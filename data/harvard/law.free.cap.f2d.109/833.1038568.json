The District Court\u2019s jurisdiction, which appellant questions, is clear, since it is a court of the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is also clear that \u201cthe remedy prescribed by the Declaratory Judgment Act may furnish a convenient and appropriate remedy for use in many cases where a controversy has arisen over the coverage of an automobile liability insurance policy.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-30\">The automobile liability policy in suit was issued to Ellen Richards. She was killed in the insured car while it was being driven, with her consent, by Catherine D. Richards. Ellen\u2019s executrix recovered a default judgment against Catherine in a negligent death action. Catherine asserted that the insurer was obligated to pay that judgment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>insurer then brought this suit against the parties to the death action, and obtained an adjudication that it is not required to pay the judgment against Catherine. The executrix appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The policy insures the \u201cnamed insured,\u201d Ellen Richards, and also any \u201cadditional insured,\u201d including persons legally driving the car (as Catherine D. Richards was) with the permission of Elien Richards, \u201cagainst loss imposed by law, resulting from accident * * * by reason of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use * * * 0f the: Motor-Vehicle * * * and arising out of * * * Bodily Injuries whether resulting fatally or otherwise * * * to any person or persons not hereinafter excepted under General Conditions \u2018Risks not Covered.\u2019 \u201d Under a heading, in capital letters, \u201cGeneral Conditions,\u201d the policy has a sub-head, in bold-face capitals, \u201cRisks Not Covered.\u201d This sub-head is followed by a paragraph which includes this language: \u201cThis policy does not cover, as respects named insured and/or any additional insured, any liability whatsoever * * * (3) For bodily injuries or death sustained by Named Insured or any other person claiming to be an Insured hereunder.\u201d Since the policy \u201cdoes not cover, as respects * * * any additional insured, any liability * * * for * * * death sustained by Named Insured,\u201d the judgment below was plainly right. It does not appear that the financial responsibility act of the District of Columbia, on which appellant bases an argument, was applicable to Ellen or Catherine D. Richards. D.C.
