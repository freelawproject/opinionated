In 1933, Paul D. Coss, hi\u00a7 father and brother, formed a partnership in Louisville, known as the C and C Ice Cream Company, which was later incorporated. They sold ice cream direct to the public in the form of \u2019\u2019double-dip\u201d ice cream cones, and opened stores at various points around Louisville for this purpose. Appellants, in an endeavor to prevent ap-pellee from usurping their already established market, opened numerous retail stores for the sale of ice cream cones, and proceeded to compete vigorously with ap-pellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-16\">Appellee alleged that appellants conspired together \u201cin restraint of commerce among the several states to create a monopoly and did attempt to monopolize the trade in ice cream among the several states of the United States in violation of Secs. 1 and 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Law and the Clayton Act.\u201d The gravamen of appellee\u2019s complaint is that appellants opened stores near appellee\u2019s places of business in Louisville; that their cones contained so much ice cream (9 to 13 ounces) for five cents that appellee could not compete; that the ice cream was sold at less than cost, and that the primary purpose of appellants was to drive appel-lee out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-17\">The sole question is whether acts of the appellants in competition with the appel-lee have such a direct relation to interstate commerce as to affect and burden it within the purview of Title 15, Sections 1 and 2, U.S.C., 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, and the decisions applicable thereto. Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. National) Labor Relations Board, 303 U.S. 453, 58 S. St. 656, 82 L.Ed. 954. If so, the ju5gment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">While the bulk of the raw ingredients used by the parties in the manufacture of ice cream cones comes from Kentucky, the gelatin, fruits, flavoring and part of the milk come from outside the state. It is not shown that appellants\u2019 acts have resulted in any reduction or monopolization of these supplies. Cf. United Leather Workers\u2019 International Union v. Herkert &amp; Meisel Trunk Co., 265 U.S. 457, 44 S.Ct. 623, 68 L.Ed. 1104, 33 A.L.R. 566. During the three years here involved (1933, 1934, and 1935) more than ninety-nine per cent, of appellants\u2019 product was sold within Kentucky, and that which was sold outside of Kentucky was distributed through independent dealers and not through retail stores operated by appellants. All of the ice cream sold in this price-war was sold within Louisville and Jefferson County, Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">The Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1-7, 15 note, derives its authority from the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the states. Blumenstock Brothers Advertising Agency v. Curtis Publishing Co., 252 U.S. 436, 40 S.Ct. 385, 64 L. Ed. 649. Assuming that transactions constituting intrastate commerce may come within the provisions of the Sherman Act (Local 167 v. United States, 291 U.S. 293, 297, 54 S.Ct. 396, 78 L.Ed. 804), it still is necessary that appellee prove that the dealings of appellants, which form the subject matter of the complaint, operate substantially and directly to restrain and burden interstate commerce. Cf. Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">We do not regard the transactions complained of as creating a direct and substantial burden on interstate commerce. The ingredients which came from without the state ceased to be a part of interstate commerce when manufactured and sold in Kentucky. The sales in appellants\u2019 retail stores were entirely of a local nature, made after all transportation, local and interstate, had ceased, and were beyond the regulatory power of Congress over interstate commerce. Foster &amp; Kleiser Co. v. Special Site Sign Co., 9 Cir., 85 F.2d 742. Competition between the parties in Louisville and Jefferson County in no way affected interstate commerce, and the record contains no proof of conspiracy to restrain such commerce. Lipson v. Socony Vacuum Corp,, 1 Cir., 87 F.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">The court erred in overruling appellants\u2019 motion for directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-12\"> Title 15, \u00a7 1, U.S.C., 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"Acr\">\u201cEvery contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.
