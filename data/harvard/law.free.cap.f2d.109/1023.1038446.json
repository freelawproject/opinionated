Wood, deceased, seeking compensation for services alleged to have been rendered by him as special referee in a bankruptcy proceeding, and it appearing that before the bankrupt estate was administered, Charles A. Wood deceased, and a second special referee was appointed to complete the administration, and it appearing that there is no clear mistake in the concurrent findings of the referee and of the District Court upon which the order is based (cf. Fruehauf Trailer Co. v. Bridge, 6 Cir., 84 Fed.2d 660, 663), and that the matter of allowance was determined by the District Court in its order of April 12, 1938, in accordance with Title 11, Section 68, U.S.C., 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 68, it is therefore ordered that the order and judgment of the District Court be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
