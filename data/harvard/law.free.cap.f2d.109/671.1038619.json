The rule is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b727-22\">\u201cRule 14. Third-Party Practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-23\">\u201c(a) When Defendant May Bring in Third Party. Before the service of his answer a defendant may move <em>ex parte </em>or, after the service of his answer, on notice to the plaintiff, for leave as a third-party plaintiff to serve a, summons and complaint upon a person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to him or to the plaintiff for all or part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against him. If the motion is granted and the summons and complaint are served, the person so served, hereinafter called the third-party defendant, shall make his defenses as provided in Rule 12 and his counterclaims and cross-claims against the plaintiff, the third-party plaintiff, or any other party as provided in Rule 13. The third-party defendant may assert any defenses which the third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The third-party defendant is bound by the adjudication of the third-party plaintiff\u2019s liability to the plaintiff, as well as of his own to the plaintiff or to the third-party plaintiff. The plaintiff may amend his pleadings to assert against the third-party defendant any claim which the plaintiff might have asserted against the third-party defendant had he been joined originally as a defendant. A third-party defendant may proceed under this rule against any person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to him or to the third-party plaintiff for all or part of the claim made in the action against the third-party defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-24\">It appears from the record that: The ap-pellee, plaintiff below, seeking damages from the appellants, alleged that she was injured through the negligent operation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>them of a \u201cGeneral Cab,\u201d in consequence of which it collided with a motor vehicle in which the appellee was riding in the District of Columbia. After the filing of the appellee\u2019s complaint, and of pleas thereto, and of an amended complaint, the appellants moved the trial court to implead as third-party defendants the owners and operators of the vehicle, alleged by the appellants to be a \u201cDiamond Cab,\u201d in which the appellee was riding at the time of the collision. The appellants submitted with their motion a proposed third-party complaint in which they charged that the injuries, if any, sustained by the appellee were caused by the negligence of the proposed third-party defendants, and in which they prayed that judgment, if any, should be entered against the latter. The appellants did not, however, assert any cause of action on their own part against the proposed third-party defendants. Notice of the motion to iniplead was given to the appellee. When this motion came on for hearing before the trial court the appellee declined to amend her complaint so as to state a cause of action on her own part against the proposed third-party defendants. Whereupon the trial judge denied the motion to implead.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal was then taken.</p>\n<p id=\"AJP\">The appellants contend that they had an absolute right to bring the proposed third-party defendants into the case. To the contrary, the appellee says that Rule 14 (a) places the impleading of third-party defendants within the sound discretion of the trial court, and that there is no showing of an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Rule 14(a) was adopted for the purpose of extending, with some modifications, into the civil procedure of the district courts of the United States the practice, in respect of impleading third parties, of the Federal admiralty courts, of certain state courts \u2014 notably those of Pennsylvania, New York and Wisconsin \u2014 and of the English courts. See Notes to the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts of the United States (Sen.Doc, No. 101, 76th Cong. 1st Sess. (1939) 233).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In admiralty, under Federal Admiralty</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Rule 56 (Rules of Practice for the Courts of the United States in Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction (1920), 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723, impleader is a matter of right \u2014 the rule says \u201cthe claimant or respondent . . . shall be entitled to bring in any other vessel or person\u201d \u2014 if the petition is presented before or at the time of answering the libel. Thereafter it is discretionary \u2014 the rule stating \u201cor at any later time during the progress of the cause that the court may allow.\u201d 1 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice under the New Federal Rules (1938) 741, 754. And see Otts v. I. M. Ludington\u2019s Sons, Inc., 1914, D.C.N.Y., 229 F. 454. In Pennsylvania, the Scire Facias Act of 1929, as amended by the Acts of 1931, 1933, and 1937 (12 Purdon\u2019s Pa. Stat.Ann. (1938) \u00a7 141), authorizes a defendant to \u201csue out, as of course, a writ of scire facias to bring upon the record\u201d an additional defendant, but gives the court power to see that \u201cthe plaintiff shall not be prejudiced or unnecessarily delayed . . . . \u201d See First National Bank of Pittsburgh v. Baird, 1930, 300 Pa. 92, 150 A. 165; 37 Dickinson Law Review 236, 237. In New York the statutory provisions in respect of impleading third-party defendants are in discretionary terms, stating that the court \u201cmay order such person to be brought in . . . .\u201d Civil Practice Act, \u00a7 193 (2) (Laws of 1923, c. 250). An earlier statute (Laws of 1922, c. 624) had used the term \u201cmust direct.\u201d The New York courts have held, under the later act, that the addition of parties is within the discretion of the court. La Lone v. Carlin, 1931, 139 Misc. 553, 247 N.Y.S. 665; Greenhouse v. Rochester Taxicab Co., 4 Dep\u2019t 1926, 218 App.Div. 224, 218 N.Y.S. 167; Hailfinger v. Meyer, 4 Dep\u2019t 1925, 215 App.Div. 35, 212 N.Y.S. 746. And see the comment of Augustus N. Hand, Circuit Judge, in Van Cott v. Marion De Vries, Inc., 2 Cir., 1930, 37 F.2d 48. In Wisconsin the third-party statute is in discretionary words, providing that \u201cthe court may . . . order.\u201d Wis.Stats. (1935) 260:19 (3). In an earlier statute the legislature had been even more explicit, saying \u201cthe court may in its discretion make such order.\u201d Wis.Stats. (1933) 260:19 (3). To the effect that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>changed phrasing continues the discretionary power see 1 Moore, <em>op. cit. supra, 778. </em>In England the pertinent provision (O. 16A, r. 1 (1) (c) (1929), Ann.Prac. (1939) 295) is that \u201cthe Court or Judge may give leave to the defendant to issue and serve a \u2018third-party notice.\u2019 \u201d This language has been held to place the impleader of third parties within the discretion of the court. Baxter v. France, 1 Q. B. 591 [1895]; Gowar v. Hales, 1 K.B. 191 [1928]; Lo-thian v. Epworth Press (Note to Gowar v. Hales (C. A. 1926) [1928] 1 K.B. 199. And see Ann.Prac. (1939) 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Against this background of statutes and decisions, the Supreme Court, in framing Rule 14(a), chose the language \u201ca defendant may move . . . <em>for leave </em>as a third-parfy plaintiff to serve a summons and complaint upon a person not a party to the action and the language <em>\u201cIf </em>the motion is granted . . . .\u201d (Italics supplied) We think there can be no doubt that it was thus intended to make the im-pleading of third parties in the Federal practice discretionary with the trial court. See 1 Moore, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>741: \u201cWhether a party to an action shall be allowed to im-plead an additional party rests in the discretion of the court. This is in accord with the English, New York and Wisconsin practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">With impleader a matter within the discretion of the trial court we could find error in the instant case only upon a theory that the overruling of the motion to implead third parties was an abuse of discretion. We find nothing in the present record indicative of an abuse \u2014 especially since neither the appellee, nor even the appellants themselves, asserted a cause of action against the proposed third-party defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\"> The declination of the appellee to amend her complaint does not affirmatively appear in the record. But the appellants\u2019 brief states that at the hearing on the motion the trial judge asked counsel for the appellee if the latter desired to amend and that the reply was in the negative. This is not denied in .the brief of tbe' appellee, and as there is in the record no amendment of the appellee\u2019s pleadings so as to state a cause of action against the proposed third-party defendants, we treat the case as if the record did show the declination to amend. \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
