Barr &amp; Creelman Mill &amp; Plumbing Supply Co., the appellant, has asked for the allowance of a claim secured by lien in the sum of $11,469.68 against Dolomite 3 Corporation for materials ordered by the parent corporation, but used in the construction of a vessel owned by the subsidiary debtor. It has filed notice under N. Y. Lien Law, Art. 4, Consol.Laws N.Y. c. 33, of a lien on the vessel in this amount and would admittedly be entitled to it except for a credit claimed by Dolomite 3\u2019s trustee and allowed below in the amount of $6,000 as funds illegally paid to the claimant before the incurring of the present indebtedness. This appeal by the claimant raises solely the question of the validity of the credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">The credit is based upon the fact that appellant received and cashed three checks, totaling $6,000, drawn by Dolomite 3 Corporation in favor of appellant as payee. These checks were given from six to ten months before the reorganization proceedings were begun, at a time when Dolomite 3 admittedly owed nothing to appellant, and were used to satisfy appellant\u2019s then existing claim against Dolomite Marine Corporation, the parent of Dolomite 3. Each check showed on its face that it was the check of Dolomite 3; the first one given (as well as another small check not in issue) bore the notation, \u201cFor Account of Dolomite Marine Corp.,\u201d and they were all signed by the \u201cAsst. Secy.\u201d of Dolomite 3, who held a like office and signed checks .on the same bank for Dolomite Marine Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">The District Court held that under the circumstances the claimant was charged with a duty of ascertaining the true situation between the corporations and must now credit the amount of these payments against the claim. We think, however, that the trustee of Dolomite 3 has failed to support his burden of proving the three checks to be illegal transfers which he as trustee could set aside under any applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">Dolomite Marine, the parent, is a shipbuilding company. It undertook the construction of vessels through separate subsidiary corporations created especially for the purpose. Dolomite 3 is one of these subsidiaries. It has identical directors and officers, and shares the offices of its parent. Its assets at all times consisted of the unfinished vessel and whatever cash and materials were on hand. Its liabilities \u2014 in addition to notes to a bank financing the construction under an agreement to which Dolomite Marine and Petroleum Heat &amp; Power Co. were also parties \u2014 included obligations to Dolomite Marine in an intercompany account for expenses incurred by Dolomite Marine on its behalf. Its paid-in capital stock is $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">Before considering the power of a trustee in reorganization to recover property illegally transferred, we should note that we are not convinced of the unlawfulness of the <em>payments. </em>Appellant had sold materials to Dolomite Marine, which Dolomite Marine used in constructing the ship owned by Dolomite 3. Appellant looked to Dolomite Marine as its debtor, but Dolomite Marine was in turn a creditor of Dolomite 3. It would have been proper for Dolomite 3 to satisfy part of its debt to Dolomite Marine by writing these checks in favor of Dolomite Marine\u2019s creditor, the appellant. The meager record does not afford means of determining whether such a novation actually occurred. Accordingly we should remand the case for a finding on this question of fact, were we not of the view that the trustee must lose in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Authority for the trustee\u2019s claim here must be found in the Bankruptcy Act. The only pertinent provision which we feel requires extended consideration is \u00a7 70, sub. e(l), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110, sub. . e(l), making \u201cnull and void as against the trustee\u201d any transfer which under a state law \u201cis fraudulent as against or voidable for any other reason by any creditor of the debtor\u201d with a provable claim. There can be no preference under \u00a7 60, sub. a, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 96, sub. a, if the trustee\u2019s claim that Dolomite 3 owed appellant nothing is accepted. Nor are the transfers shown to be fraudulent under \u00a7 67, sub. d(2), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 107, sub. d(2), because although they were made within a year of the reorganization proceedings the trustee failed to show that Dolomite 3 either (a) was rendered insolvent, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>(b) was left with unreasonably small capital, or (c) intended to incur or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay, or (d) had any actual intent to defraud. And under \u00a7 70, sub. e(l), we have to consider only a single \u201cother reason\u201d under New York law, namely, that the payments were ultra vires. For there was no fraudulent conveyance under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, in force in New York, Debtor and Creditor Law, Art. 10, \u00a7\u00a7 273-276, ConsoLLaws N.Y. c. 12, for the reasons that defeat the trustee under Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 67, sub. d(2). And \u00a7 15 of the N. Y. Stock Corporation Law, Consol.Laws N.Y. c. 59, prohibiting certain.transfers to creditors and others, was not violated, since the trustee failed to prove that the payments rendered Dolomite 3 insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The trustee\u2019s power to recapture the payments as-ultra vires cannot be derived from the power of the corporation to do so. Dolomite 3 was made to issue the checks by its sole stockholder, Dolomite Marine. The will of Dolomite Marine was the will of Dolomite 3, and both corporations must be deemed to have ratified the transaction. The trustee is therefore limited to the rights of creditors. Creditors, of course, are not prejudiced by the corporation\u2019s acts of ratification. Ward v. City Trust Co., 192 N.Y. 61, 75, 84 N. E. 585; cf. Quintal v. Kellner, 264 N.Y. 32, 36, 189 N.E. 770. But, so far as we have been able to discover, a creditor\u2019s power to upset an executed ultra vires transaction seems to be dependent in New York upon his ability to establish a right of action under the so-called \u201ctrust fund doctrine.\u201d We must, therefore, consider whether the trustee has brought his case within the uncertain limits of that much debated theory as understood and applied in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">The well-publicized criticisms of the trust fund doctrine are appreciated in New York, for the Court of Appeals has said recently in Reif v. Equitable Life Assurance Society, 268 N.Y. 269, 276, 197 N.E. 278, 280, 100 A.L.R. 55: \u201cFirst declared by Justice Story (Wood v. Dummer (1824), Fed.Cas.No.17,944, 3 Mason 308, 311), this \u2018trust fund doctrine\u2019 has been the subject of much adverse commentary and-has often been repudiated as a fiction unsound in principle and vexing in business practice. See 5 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence (4th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 2319, 2320, 2130, collating the authorities. We do not stop now to canvass the limits of such a theory. It is enough that the facts of the present case \u2014 -so we hold \u2014 do not call for application of the doctrine.\u201d But that, of course, is not completely enlightening to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">The idea, as we are repeatedly told, is that the capital stock of a corporation is a trust fund for the benefit of the corporation\u2019s creditors, not to be impaired by diversion for the direct or indirect benefit of the stockholders. Certain aspects of the rule have been codified, and a New York corporation\u2019s power to declare dividends and reduce stated capital is regulat\u25a0ed by N. Y. Stock Corporation Law, \u00a7 58. But there seems to be some part of the doctrine remaining as state common law and applicable to other asset withdrawals which impair capital. Under this law the trustee may perhaps be held to fail here, because he has shown neither insolvency of the debtor nor impairment of its capital at the time of or by the payments, or because the rule cannot be invoked against a payee of a corporate check under circumstances such as those here disclosed. As we shall point out, our decision might possibly rest on one of the first grounds; in any event we think it can rest on the last ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Generally it is stated as a part of the trust fund rule that creditors may attack only those impairments of capital which render the corporation insolvent, Hollins v. Brierfield Coal &amp; Iron Co.; 150 U.S. 371, 14 S.Ct. 127, 37 L.Ed. 1113; and there are like statements in New York, Quintal v. Adler, 146 Misc. 300, 262 N.Y.S. 126; affirmed without opinion 239 App.Div. 775, 263 N.Y.S. 943, 264 N.Y. 452, 191 N.E. 509; see Lehman, J., dissenting in Small v. Sullivan, 245 N.Y. 343, 358, 157 N.E. 261. But the contrary has been held by the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court in Cottrell v. Albany Card &amp; Paper Mfg. Co., 142 App.Div. 148, 152, 126 N.Y.S. 1070, a case where insolvency did not occur until six years after some of the transfers there ruled invalid were made. This case has been cited with approval on collateral issues by Justice Shien-tag in Quintal v. Adler, supra, 146 Misc. at page 304, 262 N.Y.S. 126, and by Judge Crane in Small v. Sullivan, supra, 245 N.Y. at page 343, 157 N.E. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">Again it is not dear how far. in New York the trustee must go in proving capital impaired. Impairment of cap\u00ed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>tal has been defined as the reduction of assets below the capital stock of the company. Small v. Sullivan, supra, 245 N.Y. at page 350, 157 N.E. 261. The assets of Dolomite 3 were upwards of $175,000; its capital stock was $1,000. If the word \u201cassets\u201d be literally interpreted, a withdrawal of $6,000 did not come even close to impairing capital. But we think it more probable that \u201cassets\u201d must be interpreted as the excess of total assets over total debts, for otherwise a prohibition of capital impairment would be meaningless. Compare In re Bay Ridge Inn, 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 85, 87. Here the corporation never showed a surplus; its assets were never more than its liabilities, plus its capital stock. On this basis a diversion of $6,000 in assets, without reducing liabilities accordingly, would constitute an impairment of capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">But the third <em>ground is </em>firmer. Though in New York unlawful payments may be recovered from directors, they apparently may not be from stockholders who receive them without notice. Quintal v. Adler, supra. Such payments may or may not be recovered from third parties, depending on circumstances. In Ward v. City Trust Co., supra, a payee of a corporate check was held responsible under the trust fund theory; in Reif v. Equitable Life Assurance Society, supra, a payee was exonerated. The present case seems clearly to fall within the rule of the Reif decision. There the president of a one-man corporation paid his life insurance premiums over a period of ten years with twenty-two checks drawn by the corporation in favor of the insurance company. The court recognized the force of the trust fund rule, which had been invoked by the trial court, but declared it inapplicable to the facts of the Reif case. The Ward decision was distinguished because of the size of the check there involved ($150,-000) as compared to the capital of the insolvent company ($250,000). The Reif checks totaled $3,854.64, against a capital of 450 shares of no par common and 275 shares of $100 preferred. In our own case the checks totaled $6,000 and the capital stock of Dolomite 3 was $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">The figures above quoted are relevant only as bearing on whether the payee should have been deemed on notice. If the recipient of the check would be apt to discover nothing disturbing upon investigation, New York will not invoke the trust fund rule against him. \u201cThe rule of responsibility of the payee of corporate paper is strict and sometimes harsh and is not to be extended. * * * We think that rule should not be stretched so as to apply it to the facts of this case upon the basis of the figurative expression that the capital, of a corporation is held in trust for its creditors.\u201d Page 277 of 268 N.Y., page 281 of 197 N.E., 100 A.L.R. 55. Here the evidence do.es not persuade us that the circumstances were such as to arouse the appellant\u2019s suspicions. Dolomite 3 and Dolomite Marine had close inter-company accounts; appellant had grounds to believe that the payments would be adjusted on the books of parent and subsidiary in some lawful manner. In the words of the Reif case, we need say no more than that the facts of the present case do not call for application of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">The parties agreed that $349.35 was deductible for materials not used for the vessel in question. The judgment is therefore reversed with directions that appellant\u2019s claim be allowed as a claim secured by a lien against the vessel in the amount of $11,120.33.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b984-8\">SWAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"azp-dedup-0\">(concurring in result).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">I agree in the result but I would place decision upon a simple ground. To justify the set-off the debtor\u2019s trustee must prove that the debtor had a cause of action against the appellant. That is to say, he must prove that $6,000 of the money of Dolomite 3 Corporation was misappropriated to pay debts of Dolomite Marine Corporation. There was no misappropriation if Dolomite 3 was indebted to Dolomite Marine and received credit on that debt for its payments to the appellant. The trustee made no proof that such was not the fact. There is much in the record to suggest that it may have been. The building of the vessel was to be financed under-the contract of December 14, 1937 by the terms of which $250,000 was to be advanced by a bank; and of this sum $30,000 was to be paid to Dolomite Marine to reimburse it for expenditures already made for \u201cshipyard and dock preparation.\u201d It is entirely possible that the $6,000 paid to the appellant by the checks of Dolomite 3 was treated by it and its parent corporation as part of this $30,000 reimbursement to which the parent was entitled by the December contract. If so, the payments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>appellant were not ultra vires and there was no misappropriation of money of Dolomite 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">The majority opinion states that the trustee failed to support his burden of proving the three checks to be illegal transactions, but expresses the view that such failure should result in remanding the case for a finding on this question of fact, except that the trustee for other reasons must lose in any event. In my opinion the trustee\u2019s failure to prove the check payments illegal necessitated a decision against him. Having tried his case and failed to put in adequate proof of his alleged cause of action, he loses. There is no more occasion for a remand for further evidence than in the ordinary case where a plaintiff fails in his proof. I would rest decision on this ground and think it unnecessary to consider the other matters discussed in the opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
