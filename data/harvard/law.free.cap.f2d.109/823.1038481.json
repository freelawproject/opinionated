Appellee opposed the application, relying on ownership of the trade-mark \u201cMelrose\u201d registered October 17, 1933, for the same goods, under the ten-year proviso of section 5 of the Act of February 20, 1905, as amended, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85. Neither party took testimony. The opposition was sustained by the Examiner of Interferences, who held that the use of the words \u201cMaryland Rose\u201d upon goods identical with those upon which \u201cMelrose\u201d is used would be reasonably likely to cause confusion as to origin. The Examiner of Interferences further held that the mark of the appellant is not entitled to registration on the ground that ,the word \u201cMaryland\u201d shown in the mark is merely a geographical term. Appellant then tendered a disclaimer of the word \u201cMaryland\u201d which disclaimer was refused entry by the Examiner of Interferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-26\">Upon appeal, the Commissioner of Patents affirmed the decision of the examiner, stating as follows: \u201c* * * If my conclusion is correct that applicant\u2019s mark is confusingly similar to opposer\u2019s mark, it obviously would remain so even though the disclaimer were entered. Should applicant finally prevail in the opposition proceeding the disclaimer may then be presented to the examiner of trade-marks for appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>action. Until then it has no bearing upon applicant\u2019s right to register its mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">From' the decision of the commissioner this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">In view of our conclusion, it is necessary-only to discuss the question as to whether or not the words \u201cMaryland Rose\u201d and \u201cMelrose\u201d used on whiskey are so similar as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The commissioner, in his decision, stated as follows: \u201c \u2018Melrose\u2019 and \u2018Maryland Rose\u2019 differ considerably in appearance; but when pronounced they sound very much alike, and may, I think, be confused by a considerable number of purchasers. As was observed by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in Englander v. Continental Distilling Co., 95 F.2d 320, 25 C.C.P.A. [Patents] 1022, this would be \u2018particularly true where the goods of the parties arc purchased by the drink rather than by the bottle,\u2019 for then the purchaser usually has no opportunity to see either mark and must depend entirely on sound. Resolving possible doubts in favor of the first comer, it is my opinion that the opposition was properly sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">We cannot agree with the reasoning of the commissioner. The mark sought to be registered consists of two -words. The mark of appellee is but one word. To the ocular sense they are not at all similar. There are four syllables in the name \u201cMaryland Rose\u201d and but two in the word \u201cMelrose.\u201d While the word \u201crose\u201d in the former is pronounced as is the last syllable in the latter, we do not believe there is a similarity of sound when the respective marks are pronounced. As to the meaning or significance, we can see no similarity at all. \u201cMelrose\u201d means sweet rose, or honey rose, and is derived directly from the Latin words <em>met </em>for honey and <em>rosa </em>for rose. See 'Funk and Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary. It is also a geographical name. \u201cMaryland Rose\u201d can convey no meaning but that of a rose of, or from, or named after the state of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">Since the marks of the parties do not look alike, sound alike, nor convey anything of identity in meaning, we cannot see how their concurrent use on whiskey would be likely to cause confusion in a statutory sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">The case of Englander, etc., v. Continental Distilling Co., 95 F.2d 320, 324, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1022, cited by the commissioner, is not applicable to the facts in the instant case. That case was a trade-mark opposition proceeding in which the appellee, owner of the registered trademark \u201cSilver Shield\u201d for use on whiskey, gin, rum, rye, brandy and cordials, opposed the application of appellant for registration of a trade-mark comprising the words \u201cSilver Bar\u201d in association with the picture of a man in medieval garb bearing a shield. The trade-mark sought to be registered was for use upon substantially the same goods. In that case we quoted from the decision of the commissioner as follows: \u201cWhile the design must, of course, be considered as a part of the composite mark, the fact remains, as pointed out by the examiner of interferences, \u2018that purchasers would recognize and call for the applicant\u2019s goods by the only spoken symbol included in the mark affixed thereto, namely, the notation \u201cSilver Bar.\u201d \u2019 As purchasers of the goods here involved-frequently order by the drink, and have no opportunity to see the labels, this becomes a matter of considerable importance in determining the probability of confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">While we approved the language used by the commissioner, that where purchasers did not have the opportunity of seeing either of the trade-marks confusion might be accentuated, we expressly stated that our decision was not based entirely on that proposition. We said: \u201cIt is true, as argued by counsel for appellant, that the word \u2018bar\u2019 in appellant\u2019s mark differs substantially from the word \u2018shield\u2019 in appel-lee\u2019s mark. However, the marks should be considered as a whole, and we are of opinion that, when so considered, the differences between the words \u2018bar\u2019 and \u2018shield\u2019 are not sufficient to warrant a holding that the marks \u2018Silver Bar\u2019 and \u2018Silver Shield\u2019 are not confusingly similar when used on alcoholic beverages, such as whiskey, gin, etc.\u201d, and held squarely that the . concurrent use of the respective marks \u201cwould be likely to cause confusion, <em>whether the goods of the parties are purchased by the drink or otherwise </em>* * *.\u201d (Italics supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-14\">Because of the radical differences in the marks of the respective parties herein set forth, in our opinion there is no likelihood of confusion in the concurrent use of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">The decision appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-16\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
