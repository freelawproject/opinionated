Defendant had judgment in the Municipal Court, and the case is here on writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The insured applied for the policy on August 11, 1933, and it was issued November 19, 1933. He died, of cancer of the stomach, on September 6, 1934. In his application he said that he had not consulted or been treated by a physician within five years. Actually he had twice consulted physicians for pain in the abdomen, which was diagnosed in each case as acute indigestion; once on December 10, 1930, and once on March 23, 1932. Dr Rolls, who treated him the second time, observed that this diagnosis does \u201cnot necessarily imply anything of a serious nature but may be purely the result of over eating.\u201d Dr. Shapiro, the insured\u2019s family physician, treated him for an occasional acute cold, the last time about September, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">There is no evidence to show, or reason to suppose, that the applicant, when he applied for insurance, had these details in mind. The fact that he overlooked them does not avoid the policy. \u201cAn applicant for insurance is not required, nor indeed-expected, to disclose the fact of consulting a physician for slight or temporary ailments such as an ordinary cold, inability to sleep, constipation, headache, or the like. * * * To void this policy on the ground of false representation,, the answer must not only have been untrue, but it must have been with reference to a material matter * * <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is nothing to show that these sporadic ailments were material. They can hardly have affected the risk or the company\u2019s willingness to contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">The application stipulated that the policy should \u201cnot take effect until issued by the Company and accepted by the applicant and the full first premium thereon is paid while the health, habits and occupation of said applicant are the same as described in this application.\u201d Dr. Shapiro gave the insurance company a death certificate which stated that the first symptoms of cancer of the stomach appeared \u201cabout August 20, 1933. Saw him on 27th and stated he vomited small amount of blood twice in week before.\u201d If this recital is correct the policy issued on November 19, 1933, is void by its own terms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The beneficiaries contend that the year \u201c1933\u201d in the death certificate is an error, and that the first symptoms of cancer actually appeared in August, 1934, nine months after the policy was issued. They undertook to prove this at the trial. After they had introduced a stipulation covering the making of the application, the issuance of the policy, the death of the insured, etc., they called Dr. Shapiro \u201cout of order,\u201d with the consent of the court and as an accommodation to the witness. They asked him when the cancer was first diagnosed, and when the insured first raised blood. Their counsel explained that \u201che intended to show the first knowledge of cancer on the part of the insured to have been just prior to his admission to the hospital, or approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>two weeks prior to death, and that the first passing of blood was approximately the same time.\u201d The company\u2019s counsel objected to these questions on the ground that \u201cthey were not pertinent to any issue then before the court,\u201d and the court sustained the objection. This, we think, was error. The company had pleaded that the insured was suffering from cancer when he applied for insurance, and that he had raised blood before the policy was issued. If, as the company argues, the court\u2019s intention was to exclude the testimony temporarily and admit it later, this should have been made clear to counsel at the time. The record does not indicate that it was made clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The insured stated in the application that he had other life insurance totaling $1,500, and that he contemplated no application to any other company. Between the date of the application and the date of the policy he obtained other insurance, to an amount not disclosed by the record, without notifying the defendant company. It contends on this appeal that his failure to report this additional insurance, avoids the present policy. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has said that \u201cchanges materially affecting the risk which come to the knowledge of the insured after the application and before delivery of the policy\u201d must be disclosed; \u201cFor, even the most unsophisticated person must know that, in answering the questionnaire and submitting it to the insurer he is furnishing the data on the basis of which the company will decide whether, by issuing a policy, it wishes to insure him. If, while the company deliberates, he discovers facts which make portions of his application no longer true, the most elementary spirit of fair dealing would seem to require him to make a full <em>disclosure.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Perhaps additional insurance may sometimes increase the \u201cmoral risk.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But an additional insurance policy, like an illness, may certainly be too small to affect the risk or the company\u2019s willingness to assume it. No company would refuse a policy for fear that a man already insured for $1,500 or $2,500 would kill himself for an additional $500 or $1,000. The non-disclosure of the other insurance in this case is no defense, at least so long as it is not shown to be of such amount as to affect the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The policy provides that \u201cIf the age of the Insured has been misstated, the amount payable hereunder shall be such as the premium would have purchased at the correct age.\u201d In the application the insured stated his age as 55, and evidence in corroboration was introduced on the trial. The company produced evidence which tended to show that he was older. This included a hospital record, made a year later, which gave his age as 64. The admission of this record is assigned as error. Hospital records of diagnosis and treatment are usually held <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to be covered by statutes which, like D.C-Code, Tit. 9, \u00a7 20, forbid physicians to disclose confidential information acquired while attending a patient in a professional capacity. But a properly authenticated record of the patient\u2019s name, address, age, etc., is admissible, provided there is no disclosure of diagnosis or treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The company contends that the cause of action of the adult beneficiary, <footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Sarah Kaplan, was barred by the three-year statute of limitations. D.C.Code, Tit. 24, \u00a7 341. She replies that her suit was timely under the six-year statute of limitations of New York, where the policy was to be paid. According to the established rule, a limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>tion on the time of suit is procedural and is governed by the law of the forum.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the present record, therefore, the interest of the adult beneficiary is barred by the District statute, and the company is liable to the minor beneficiaries only to the extent of their separate interests in the policy. Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-9\"> Wharton v. \u00c6tna Life Insurance Co., 8 Cir., 48 F.2d 37, 43, certiorari denied 284 U.S. 621, 52 S.Ct. 9, 76 L.Ed. 529; Connecticut Mutual Life Ins.
