Sutton was arrested after a police officer saw him selling drugs. A search of Sutton\u2019s residence revealed the presence of weapons and ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">Sutton was charged in a four-count superseding indictment. He pleaded guilty to Count One, being a convicted felon in possession of a Winchester 30-30 caliber rifle, a Remington .22 caliber rifle, a Sears and Roebuck model 200 shotgun, and Federal 30-30 caliber ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e). The remaining three counts were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended that Sutton be sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) of the Sentencing Guidelines, which provides a base offense level of 34 \u201cif the defendant used or possessed the firearm or ammunition in connection with a ... controlled substance offense.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) (Nov. 2001). Furthermore, the PSI recommended a criminal history category of VI, as required by \u00a7 4B 1.4(c)(2) \u201cif the defendant used or possessed the firearm or ammunition in connection with a ... controlled substance offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 431.4(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">At Sutton\u2019s sentencing hearing, Sutton asserted that none of the weapons were used in connection with the drug transaction. After hearing testimony regarding the weapons, the district court found that it was \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the 30-30, .22, and shotgun were connected to the offense. (R.4 at 41.) However, the court found that certain .357 ammunition, which was found at Sutton\u2019s residence but was not charged in the indictment, was connected to the offense. (R.4 at 41.) Sutton objected to this finding because the .357 ammunition was not charged in the indictment. (R.4 at 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">Using \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), the district court calculated a base offense level of 34 and subtracted 3 points for acceptance of responsibility. It also placed Sutton\u2019s criminal history category at VI, in accordance with \u00a7 4B 1.4(c)(2). Sutton\u2019s sentencing range was 188 to 235 months, and the court sentenced Sutton to 188 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-12\">On appeal, Sutton asserts that he should not have been sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). According to Sutton, the .357 ammunition could not be \u201cthe firearm or ammunition\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) and \u00a7 4B1.4(e)(2) because the .357 ammunition was not charged in the indictment. The Government confesses error, agreeing that, for firearms or ammunition to qualify under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) and \u00a7 4B1.4(c)(2), they must be charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-13\">The language of the Sentencing Guidelines, like the language of a statute, must be given its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>United States v. Pompey, </em>17 F.3d 351, 354 (11th Cir.1994). Section 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) imposes an offense level of 34 if the felon convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) uses or possesses \u201cthe firearm or ammunition\u201d in connection with a drug offense. USSG \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). The phrase \u201cthe firearm or ammunition\u201d echoes, but does not replicate, the phrase \u201cany firearm or ammunition\u201d that is used in the statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (2000). The difference is the use of the word \u201cthe\u201d in the Guidelines instead of the word \u201cany.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-16\">While the word \u201cany\u201d is general and nonspecific, the word \u201cthe\u201d is particular and specific. The Sentencing Guidelines themselves evince an understanding of this distinction. When any firearm or ammunition will do, the Guidelines use the nonspecific phrases \u201cany firearm or ammunition,\u201d <em>see, e.g\u201e </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), or \u201ca firearm or ammunition,\u201d <em>see, e.g., </em>\u00a7 2K1.1(c)(1), rather than the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>phrase \u201cthe firearm or ammunition.\u201d The use of \u201cthe firearm or ammunition\u201d in \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), then, indicates that this Guideline applies only to a particular firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">The applicable firearm is evident from a reading of the Guideline in the context of the criminal process. A defendant, whether by plea or trial, stands convicted of possessing a firearm. If \u201cthe\u201d firearm was used in connection with a drug offense, the defendant receives a base offense level of 34; if not, the defendant receives a base offense level of 33. When viewed in this way, the Guideline seems to use \u201cthe firearm\u201d to refer to the firearm that the defendant is convicted of possessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">Similarly, \u00a7 4B1.4(c)(2) provides a criminal history category of VI if the defendant possesses \u201cthe firearm or ammunition\u201d in connection with a drug offense. A plain reading of this Guideline indicates that it also applies only to firearms or ammunition for which the defendant is convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">In this case, Sutton was indicted, in Count One, for possessing four firearms. Sutton\u2019s possession of these firearms violated the statute, and he pleaded guilty to the violation. The district court found that none of these firearms were used in connection with a drug offense. But it nevertheless found \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) appropriate because certain .357 ammunition, for which Sutton was not indicted, was used in connection with a drug offense. This use of \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) was in error, because, as we have seen, \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) is applicable only if the firearms or ammunition <em>for which the felon was convicted </em>were used in connection with a drug offense. The .357 ammunition did not qualify under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) because Sutton was not convicted of possessing it. Since none of the firearms for which Sutton was convicted were used in connection with Sutton\u2019s drug transaction, \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) was improperly applied to Sutton. Moreover, Sutton should not have received a criminal history category of VI because the .357 ammunition does not qualify as \u201cthe firearm or ammunition\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.4(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">Because Sutton was not convicted of possessing the .357 ammunition, the district court erred by using Sutton\u2019s possession of this ammunition to sentence him under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) and \u00a7 4B1.4(c)(2). Therefore, Sutton\u2019s sentence is vacated, and this case is remanded for resentenc-ing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
