Reviewing de novo the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, and reviewing its factual findings for clear error, <em>see United States v. Snyder, </em>291 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir.2002), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-18\">Duty raises a single issue on appeal: whether the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.1. Section 4B1.1 provides that a defendant is a career offender if: (1) he was at least eighteen years old when he committed the offense underlying his conviction; (2) the offense is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. To qualify as two prior felony convictions, the prior offenses must be unrelated. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(c). Duty contends that his guilty pleas on four prior drug-related felony charges in state court should be counted as a single conviction pursuant to a Georgia statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and therefore, the district court erred in finding that he had at least two prior felony drug convictions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-19\">To begin with, the proper definition of the term \u201cconviction\u201d as used in USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 is governed by federal law, not state law. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>234 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir. 2000). Therefore, the Georgia statute referenced by Duty does not apply to the sentence imposed in this case. Moreover, Duty concedes that his state drug offenses were separated by intervening arrests, and the Sentencing Guidelines make clear that \u201c[p]rior sentences are not considered related if they were for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (ie., the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>fense).\u201d <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2. cmt. n. 3 (2001). While this court has no published decision applying this \u201cintervening arrest\u201d rule, several of our sister circuits have applied the rule to hold that prior convictions are not related where the offenses underlying those convictions are separated by arrests. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bradley, </em>218 F.3d 670, 673-74 (7th Cir. 2000); <em>United States v. Huggins, </em>191 F.3d 532, 539 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Boonphakdee, </em>40 F.3d 538, 544 (2d Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Hallman, </em>23 F.3d 821, 824-25 (3d Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>15 F.3d 526, 532-33 (6th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Gallegos-Gonzalez, </em>3 F.3d 325, 327-28 (9th Cir.1993). We agree with these decisions. Because Duty\u2019s state drug offenses were separated by intervening arrests, those offenses were not related, and the district court properly applied \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1275-16\">.
