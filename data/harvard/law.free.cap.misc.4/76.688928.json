Stoner; that it was a condition precedent of defendant\u2019s contract to insure , that the consent of the person whose life was proposed for insurance must have been personally subscribed by him on the application; and that this condition had not been complied with in the instance of plaintiff\u2019s policy. Plaintiff testified that some time after the policy was issued to her, she called at the office of the defendant company and there met its secretary, to whom she stated that she understood the policy to be of no effect, and desired the premiums paid to be returned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>her; and that the secretary replied that the policy was void, but that if the plaintiff would secure her father\u2019s consent to the policy- or a certificate from his physician respecting the state of her father\u2019s health, the company might on consideration of the matter waive its objection to the validity of the policy. Mr. Gaston, defendant\u2019s secretary and only witness on the trial, effectually corroborated plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Plaintiff was not bound to secure either the consent or the certificate required by defendant\u2019s secretary. Nor did she do so, but instead brought this action for the return of the premiums paid by her. Thus both contracting parties treated the policy as void and no longer subsisting between them, and neither could thereafter revive it without the assent of the other. Much less can defendant defeat plaintiff\u2019s action by its subsequent assumption of the validity of the policy. That being so, neither of defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s requests to charge was relevant, and the exceptions taken to such as were refused do not for that reason present error. <em>Priebe </em>v. <em>Kellogg Bridge Co., </em>77 N. Y. 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">It is well settled in principle and by authority that where there has been a total failure of consideration, or where a contract has been abandoned, or has-been rescinded, an action will lie for money had and received to recover back any money paid by either of the contracting parties to the other in furtherance of the contract. 2 Whart. Cont. \u00a7 742; <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Bearnard, </em>12 Johns. 274; <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>9 Pet. 541, 566; 9 Lawy. ed. 222, 231; <em>Lindsley </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>49 N. Y. 625 ; 3 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 889. So, also, it is settled by abundant authority and no longer open to debate that the use of the common count in <em>assumpsit </em>is a sufficient compliance with the requirement of the Code of Civil Procedure that the complaint must state the facts which constitute the cause of action. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>7 N.
