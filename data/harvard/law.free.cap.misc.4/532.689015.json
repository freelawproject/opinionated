The burden of proving performance of the condition rested upon plaintiff and, failing to sustain it by sufficient evidence, no cause of action against defendant was established. Attentive consideration of the evidence as it was finally submitted to the justice below, fails to justify the conclusion that plaintiff did sustain the burden by fair preponderance of the evidence. So, also, Patterson, a witness for plaintiff, was asked upon his direct examination to state from his examination of the meter what saving was made by the use of plaintiff\u2019s apparatus, to which he replied that it effected a saving of over thirty per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">On motion of defendant\u2019s counsel the court refused to strike the answer out, and the exception to this ruling presents error, for which the judgment must be reversed. The answer was objectionable in that it substituted the witness\u2019 conclusion for the facts upon which it was founded. Whether or not a saving of gas was effected by the use of plaintiff\u2019s apparatus, was the question at issue, and this could only be properly determined by the court. Nor could the objectionable answer have been reasonably apprehended from the question addressed to the witness. Hence the failure to object to the question did not render the answer competent. <em>Platner </em>v. <em>Platner, </em>78 N.
