It decided upon the entire proofs that the attachment should be vacated, and committed no error in reaching that conclusion. The order made by the Supreme Court January 26, 1893, appointing a temporary receiver of the defendant\u2019s property in proceedings for a voluntary dissolution of the corporation, did not disable the defendant from moving to vacate the attachment. See <em>Parry </em>v. <em>Am. Opera Co., </em>12 Civ. Proc. Rep. 194; <em>Auburn B. Co. </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>68 Hun, 401. This upon the ground that a corporation so situated is like a debtor who makes a general assignment before or after the attachment, either may make a motion to vacate because of the residuary interest in the proceeds of the attached property after the creditors are paid. <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>13 Abb. Pr. 76; <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Benham, </em>20 How. Pr. 343; 10 Abb. Pr. 390; <em>Gasherie </em>v. <em>Apple, </em>14 id. 64. It follows that the order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">GrlLDERSLEEVE, J., Concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
