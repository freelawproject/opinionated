The defendant claims to-have been evicted therefrom by the act of the plaintiff, but as there is a conflict of evidence in respect of the matters-which are claimed to constitute the eviction, we will not interfere with the judgment of the justice, unless the evidence is-of such a convincing character as to clearly indicate that there was a mistake on the part of the justice, or that he had been influenced by bias, passion, prejudice or corruption, or that he-had manifestly neglected to deliberate upon the whole testimony.

The reversal of the judgment is sought solely upon the facts, and as we cannot discover any ground for disturbing the justice\u2019s determination thereof the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">Bischoff, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
