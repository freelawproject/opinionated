Under the general assignment, the lease as well as the other property of the assignors was conveyed to him. It is true he was not bound to ratify the lease, but if he occupied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>premises lie was bound to pay rent for them even without a promise, and, therefore, the evidence objected to could not have injured the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">As a rule the assignee of a lease is not liable for the rent of the demised premises except for the time he occupies them. 2 Platt Leases, 416 ; Taylor Landl. &amp; Ten. \u00a7 444. This is as-true of an assignee under an assignment as of an assignee of a lease. <em>Litchfield </em>v. <em>White, </em>7 N. Y. 438; <em>Journeay </em>v. Brackley, 1 Hilt. 447; <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Florence Sewing Machime Co., </em>53 How. Pr. 478 ; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>16 Daly, 18. But he is liable for the time he actually occupies the premises. It is true that in such case it may be that he is not liable under the lease, but on a <em>quantum meruit. </em>It will, however, be-assumed that the rate agreed to be paid by the assignors to the landlord was a reasonable rent. There being a conflict as to-whether the appellant was in actual possession, it was a question of fact for the court below to determine, and we think from all the evidence it properly decided that question of fact in favor of the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The judgment should, therefore, be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
