The defense was substantially a general denial. The plaintiff was a salesman in the employment of John Early &amp; Co., a firm composed of John Early and Patrick Kavanagh, under a yearly \u25a0contract expiring January first of each year. On the 23d of March, 1891, Mr. Early died, leaving a will which was pro-hated, under which the defendants qualified as executors. When Mr. Early died, the plaintiff was traveling for the business and was allowed to continue on his trip for three weeks longer, and when he came back, the defendants, or one of them, said to him, \u201cYou boys can consider yourselves dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>charged.\u201d In reply to which the plaintiff said, <em>\u201c </em>I told him that I did not consider myself discharged; that I held the estate of John Early responsible for the year 1891, according to my agreement.\u201d It is claimed on behalf of the respond\u00e9nt,. Mrs. Early, that the death of John Early pnt an end to the contract between the plaintiff and the firm of Early &amp; Co., and that the new employment of the plaintiff by Mrs. Early not having been, according to the testimony adduced by the plaintiff on the trial, for a fixed period, either party was entitled at any time to terminate it, and Mrs. Early having done so in the month of June, 1891, and paid the plaintiff in full up to that time, the contract was terminated. And this contention we think is well sustained. <em>Campbell </em>v. Jimenes, 3 Misc. Rep. 516. Wood Mast. &amp; Serv. (2d ed.) \u00a7 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Where there is no provision in a copartnership for its continuance after the death of any of the partners, the copartnership is thereby dissolved. There did not seem'to have been any such provision in the copartnership under consideration, and as a matter of fact, it was dissolved and the other member of the firm went out, and the business was turned over to Mrs. Early to wind up. In Wood\u2019s Master and Servant (2d ed.), section 165, it is said: \u201c Where a servant is employed by a firm, a dissolution of the firm dissolves the contract, so that the servant is absolved therefrom, but-if the dissolution results from the act of the parties, they are liable to the servant for his loss therefrom, but if the dissolution results from the death of a m\u00e9rnber of the' firm, the dissolution resulting by operation of law, and not from the act of the parties, no action for damages will-lie\u2019. 1 * * * The test is whether the firm is dissolved.' So long as it exists the contract is in force, but when it is \"dissolved, the contract is dissolved with it, and the question as to whether damages can be recovered therefor will depend upon the question whether the dissolution resulted from the act of God, the operation of law or the act of the parties.\u201d And in this case, it is clear that it resulted from the act of God and operation of law, and consequently there can be no recovery. <em>Lacy </em>v. <em>Getmam, </em>119 N. Y. 109; <em>Griggs </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Swift, </em>82 Ga. 392. In Addison on Contracts, 653, b. p. Abb. ed. 1883, it is said: \u201cA contract of hiring and \u2022 service is dissolved by the death of the master or servant. If the con-, tract is made with a firm in partnership to serve the firm for a certain term, the contract is dissolved by the death of one of the parties.\u201d Citing <em>Farrow </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>L. R. (4 C. P.) 744; <em>Tasker </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>6 H. &amp; M. 575; 30 L. J. Ex. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">As far as yje have found, there is no case in this state in conflict with these decisions. They are founded on the principle alluded to by Judge Bisohoff in <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>16 Daly, 464, where he says: <em>\u201c </em>To render the contract operative and binding upon the parties at its inception, the obligation of the contracting parties must be mutually dependent, that is to say, the obligation of the party who is to receive the services, to pay, is conditioned upon the obligation of the party who is to render the services, to perform, and <em>vice versa.\u201d </em>If the employee dies, the employer has no remedy against his estate; his death puts an end to the contract; it is but just that the same results shall follow from the death of the employer. The principle is still more obvious in the case of a copartnership, which is dissolved by operation of law when one of the partners dies. Another reason that the authorities assign for putting an end to the contract is that the services which the plaintiff was employed to perform were skilled services, where the employee is not a mere laborer. And the plaintiff, as a salesman, was expected to perform skilled services, and in such a case the death of either party terminates the contract. <em>Spalding </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>71 N. Y. 40; <em>People </em>v. <em>Globe Ins. Co., </em>91 id. 179 ; <em>Martin, </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>1 Allen, 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We have carefully looked over the evidence in this case and do not find that there is any proof to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s contention, that the contract of employment previously existing with the firm of John Early &amp; Co. was assumed by the executrix, or that there was a new contract of hiring for the remainder of the year, the contract with the executrix, as before stated, being without any fixed time.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The judgment should, therefore, be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Bischoeb, J., concurs.</p>\n<author id=\"b138-5\">Peyob, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alo\">On the 1st of January, 1891, the firm of John Early &amp; Go. hired the plaintiff as a traveling salesman for the period of one year. On the twenty-third of March next ensuing, the copartnership was dissolved by the death of Early, and the defendant, as executrix of his will, took possession and control of the firm assets and business, but whether for the purpose of winding up or continuing the business is disputed upon the evidence, and is unimportant in the disposition of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">That a contract of service of the kind before the court, is canceled by the death of the employer, is not now an open question in this state. <em>Lacy </em>v. <em>Getman, </em>119 N. Y. 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The proposition that such a contract is terminated by the dissolution of a copartnership employer, seems not to have been adjudged in this state, and may not be affirmed on the authority of uniform decision. In this country it is supported by one express adjudication <em>(Griggs </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>82 Ga. 392 ; 14 Am. St. Rep. 176), and disputed by another <em>(Fereina </em>v. <em>Sayres, </em>5 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 210; 40 Am. Dec. 49). The text-writers appear to accept it implicitly. Wood Mast. <em>&amp; </em>Serv. \u00a7 163 ; 2 Add. Cont. (Morgan\u2019s ed.) \u00a7 901; Lawson Rights, etc., \u00a7 283. The preponderance, therefore, of authority is in favor of the proposition. How stands it on principle ?</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">If the plaintiff be regarded as an <em>agent </em>of the firm, on its dissolution the relation undoubtedly ceased, because an agent is merely the representative of his principal, and if there be no principal there can be no agent. \u201c There is a manifest absurdity in doing an act in the name of a person no longer in being.\u201d <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Vanderhorst, </em>32 N. Y. 553, 555.\" The death of a partner operates an immediate dissolution of the copartnership (Pars. Part. 397), and, therefore, the authority of a previously-appointed clerk absolutely ends. <em>MeNuaghton </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>1 Hayw. 189. The rule, of course, is inapplicable to an agency coupled with an interest, but the right of the plaintiff to a commission proportioned to sales, does not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>stitute a power coupled with an interest within the exception to the general principle. <em>Houghtaling </em>v. <em>Marvin, 7 </em>Barb. 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Supposing the plaintiff to be a servant rather than an agent, still the conclusion is inevitable that the dissolution of the partnership by death terminated his employment. The decision in <em>Lacy </em>v. Getman, 119 N. Y. 109, 115, 116, proceeded upon the ground of a personal trust and confidence between the employer and the employee and held that such trust and confidence on the part of the employee, cannot be transferred by operation of law to a substituted employer. The reason of the rule is equally prevalent between a copartnership employer and its servant. In the case at bar, for instance, the plaintiff had engaged to serve John Early and Patrick Kavanagh, not Patrick Kavanagh alone, still less Patrick Kavanagh and Mary A. Early, executrix of John Early. He might be willing to trust and obey John Early and Patrick Kavanagh, but not at all willing to trust and obey Kavanagh alone, or Kavanagh and Mary A. Early \u2014 just as the employee of a single person might be willing to engage service with him but not with his executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Employed by the partnership and not by its individual members, engaged to serve the partnership and not its individual members, plaintiff\u2019s relation to the partnership was dissolved necessarily by its dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">As well,, therefore, upon principle as authority, we conclude that the contract of the plaintiff with the firm of John Early <em>&amp; </em>Co. terminated on the dissolution of the copartnership by the death of Early.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The defendant is sued, however, as well in her personal as her representative capacity, and plaintiff\u2019s alternative claim is upon a contract with her. Conceding his employment by the defendant, it was terminable at will, because for no definite period <em>(Campbell </em>v. Jimenes, 3 Misc. Rep. 516), and he was duly discharged upon payment for his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
