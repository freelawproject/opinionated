Defendant maintained that these several items were by him applied in payment of the indebtedness, while plaintiff contended that they had reference to matters not connected with the subject-matter of the action. On defendant rested the burden of proving his defense of payment, and no evidence appears in the record bearing upon the dispute, other than the conflicting testimony of the parties, respectively. In such a case there is nothing winch we may review, as we are precluded from consideration of the weight of the evidence by the judgment of the General Term of the court below. <em>Arnstein </em>v. Haulenbeek, 16 Daly, 382; <em>Third Wat. Bank </em>v. Cornes, 1 Silvernail Ct. App. 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Defendant\u2019s exceptions concerning the memoranda from which plaintiff read while testifying, were confined to the referee\u2019s refusal to direct the production of the memoranda for inspection by defendant\u2019s counsel. The record, however, shows that the memoranda were produced and inspected by defendant\u2019s counsel after the referee\u2019s ruling was had, and that plaintiff was cross-examined respecting their contents. Under the circumstances, the error of the referee\u2019s refusal, assuming it to have been such, was harmless, and the exceptions, therefore, afford no ground for reversal. <em>City Bank of Brooklyn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>v. <em>Dearborn, </em>20 N.
