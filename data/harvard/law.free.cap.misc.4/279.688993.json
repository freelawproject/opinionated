By consent the answer was amended, setting up a further agreement relating to the same matter between the parties and defendant; and a witness testified that said agreement was made and executed on July 12, 1888, at the office of 0. Plaintiff was recalled, and testified that she was only once at G.\u2019s office \u2014 July 11, 1888\u2014and signed but one paper. The court charged the jury that if they believed that plaintiff signed the paper dated July 12, 1888, she was only entitled to a verdict for a certain amount; while, if they believed that she did not sign it, she was entitled to a verdict for the full amount claimed. No exception was taken to the charge <em>Held, </em>that a verdict for the full amount was not against the weight of evidence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-8\">Appeal from a judgment entered upon the verdict of a jury on the 24th day of January, 1893, in favor of the plaintiff, and from an order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-9\"><em>Robert </em>Greentkal, for plaintiff (respondent).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-10\"><em>E.

Such agreement, duly executed by plaintiff and defendant, was admitted in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>deuce, and marked \u201c Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1,\u201d and the interest admitted to be the sum of $154. Plaintiff rested her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel thereupon, offered in evidence \u201cthe front page of the contract had between plaintiff and defendant\u201d (being the paper produced by plaintiff, and already admitted in evidence, and marked \u201c Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 \u201d), which was also admitted in evidence, and marked \u201c Defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">By consent of plaintiff\u2019s counsel defendant\u2019s answer was amended by setting up a further agreement, made in relation to the same matter, between the same parties, which bears date July 12, 1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Defendant\u2019s counsel thereupon produced and presented to Louis Canale, a notary public, a witness on the part of the defendant, a paper, and which paper bears date on the 12th day of July, 1888, and was subsequently admitted in evidence and marked \u201c Defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 12,\u201d who testified that the paper was executed on the 12th day of July, 1888, at his office, 84 Centre street; and that he saw the parties thereto execute the same. That Salvatore Strano subscribed his name, and Diglia Tuscano (the plaintiff herein), being unable to write, made her cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Salvatore Strano, the defendant, also testified that, the plaintiff on the twelfth day of July was present at the witness Canale\u2019s office. That \u201c she (plaintiff) signed that in my presence ; she put her hand to that paper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The plaintiff, after defendant had rested his case, was called and testified: \u201c I was only once at Mr. Canale\u2019s office. One paper was signed upon that day. I was there. That is the paper which is marked \u2018 Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1,\u2019 and dated the eleventh day of July, 1888, that is my mark. Q. Did you sign that paper upon the 12th day of July ? A. I never signed it only one time; I was never in Mr. Canale\u2019s office the day after I signed the paper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">At the close of the testimony the trial justice in his charge to the jury instructed them: \u201c That the plaintiff must have a verdict at your hands for at least $220; that is, if you find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the plaintiff executed this agreement on the 12th of July, 1888, she will be entitled to $220 and no more. Before you believe that she did execute this agreement you must find so, from a preponderance of evidence on the part of the defendant ; and if there is an absence of such preponderance of evidence in the defendant\u2019s favor upon that issue, your verdict must be in favor of the plaintiff for the whole amount. I repeat, if you believe that the plaintiff signed this paper of the 12th of July, your verdict for her can only be for $220 ; while, if you believe she did not sign it, your verdict must be for her for $954.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">No exception was taken to the charge and the jury rendered their verdict for the plaintiff for $954.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The issues were thus presented to the jury upon contradictory evidence, and it was within the province of the jury to believe or disbelieve either the evidence of the plaintiff or of the defendant, or of any of the witnesses who testified therein, and to give such weight to the evidence of any of the witnesses as the jury, in their judgment, thought proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In rendering their verdict for the plaintiff they evidently-believed her and did not believe the defendant and his witness Canale, as to her executing the paper marked \u201c Defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 12.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">If the verdict rendered by the jury may reasonably be presumed to have resulted from an honest and, intelligent exercise of judgment upon their part, the court will not interfere with their conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">And in an action of this kind a verdict will not be set aside as excessive unless it manifestly appears to be the result of passion, partiality, prejudice or corruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">We find no evidence of any such herein, and the judgment and order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">Yax Wyck, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
