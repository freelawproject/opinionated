Upon this taxation the clerk allowed thirty dollars as trial fee for the inquest, and- thirty dollars as trial fee of the final trial, and from which defendant appealed to Special Term, where the clerk\u2019s taxation of the first trial fee was reversed, and it is from such reversal that this appeal is taken. This order of reversal recites that the inquest was <em>\u201c </em>duly taken \u201d and the first judgment <em>\u201c </em>duly entered,\u201d and that thereafter the defendant\u2019s default was opened and the final trial had, at which was returned for plaintiff the verdict upon which the second and final judgment was entered. There is no other or further proof in the record as regards the inquest, the first judgment, the opening of defendant\u2019s default, the final trial, or the second judgment. Upon the record on appeal the clerk\u2019s taxation of two trial fees of thirty dollars each was correct and should not have been reversed, for it has been repeatedly held that an inquest is such a trial as entitled plaintiff to a trial fee of thirty dollars. <em>Wessels </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>22 Abb.
