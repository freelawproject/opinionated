Y. St. Repr. 858 ; 34 id. 1005; 16 Daly, 496. The determination of the controversy rested in the conflicting contentions of the parties. Crediting the statements of plaintiff\u2019s assignor, the recovery should have been for fifty dollars; discrediting them, defendant was entitled to judgment. The complaint was not amended to enable the action to proceed as one to recover the reasonable value of the services, nor was any evidence whatever introduced for either party from which the justice could determine such values. The recovery, therefore, was not <em>secimdum allegata eb probata. Romeyn </em>v. <em>Sickles, </em>108 N.
