This rule, however, does not apply tua case where money is loaned to the wife.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-8\">Appeal by plaintiff from a judgment of a District Court in the city of New York, rendered in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b572-9\"><em>John, BE. </em>Tierney, for plaintiff (appellant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b572-10\"><em>Alfred B. </em>Oruikshcmk, for defendant (respondent).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b572-11\">Bischoef, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aen\">The action was brought to recover the sum of $122.78 for goods sold and money loaned by plaintiff\u2019s assignor to defendant, through the medium of his wife as his alleged agent. The amount claimed for the goods sold was twenty-three dollars and forty-one cents, and the court below rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the value of such goods, no recovery being had for the money loaned. From this judgment in her favor the plaintiff appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">The only question for our determination is, does the plaintiff\u2019s case, as made out, entitle her to a recovery against the defendant for money furnished to defendant\u2019s wife by plaintiff\u2019s assignor, a tradesman patronized by defendant ?</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">In order that recovery may be had against a husband for goods furnished to his 'wife, the plaintiff must show that the goods so furnished were suitable to the wife\u2019s position and necessary to her maintenance, and that she was not otherwise provided for. <em>Arnold </em>v. Allen, 9 Daly, 198; <em>McQuhae </em>v. <em>Rey, </em>3 Misc. Rep. 550; <em>Bloomingdale </em>v. <em>Brinkerhoff, </em>2 id. 49. With regard to the money furnished the wife in this case, this burden was in no way successfully sustained by the plaintiff upon the trial. Moreover, the rule that a husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>may be so charged, does not apply to a ease where <em>money is </em>loaned to the wife. <em>Anderson </em>v. Cullen, 8 N. Y. Supp. 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">There is no proof that the defendant knew of or assented to the loans for which recovery is sought, and, in the absence of such proof, his assumption of responsibility for such supplies as should be furnished to his wife, does not justify the interpretation that he assumed responsibility for anything other than what he might have reasonably expected that the tradesman would furnish in the ordinary course of his trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The decision of the court below was in all respects correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Giegebich, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
