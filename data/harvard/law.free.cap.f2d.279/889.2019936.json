The indictment was in three counts. Counts 1 and 2 charged violations of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705(a) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by appellant. Count 3 charged a violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705(a) by appellant and Watson.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-21\">Appellant was arraigned, pleaded not guilty, had a jury trial and was found guilty on each count of the indictment. A judgment of conviction was entered, sentencing appellant to be imprisoned 20 years on each count, the sentences to run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>concurrently. This appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Appellant\u2019s brief does not, as required by our Rule 18, 28 U.S.C.A., contain a specification of errors relied upon. It does, however, contain a statement entitled \u201cAppellant\u2019s Specification of Error.\u201d The statement reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">\u201cI. The appellant contends that the trial judge excelled in the use of sarcasm and ridicule at the trial and that he singled out the appellant\u2019s attorney<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the butt of his verbal forays, and that the judge\u2019s efforts in this direction thwarted the appellant from having and receiving a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">\u201cII. The .appellant contends that by reason of the conduct of the trial judge in interrupting the cross-examination of a very vital witness, Caffey, <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the trial judge\u2019s hostile attitude toward the defense tended to rehabilitate and point the way for the witness to escape being destroyed during the cross-examination. That the trial judge lacked impartiality during the course of the trial and influenced the jury and thereby deprived [appellant] from having a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">This, obviously, is not a specification of errors, but is merely a statement of appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">There is no merit in these contentions. The record shows that, from time to time during the trial, the judge made comments and questioned witnesses, but it does not show that he used sarcasm or ridicule, or that he made any verbal foray, or that appellant\u2019s attorney was the butt of any such foray, or that the cross-examination of Caffey was improperly interrupted, or that the judge was hostile to appellant, or that the judge lacked impartiality, or that the jury was improperly influenced, or that appellant was prevented from having a fair trial. Instead, the record shows that he had a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-22\">.
