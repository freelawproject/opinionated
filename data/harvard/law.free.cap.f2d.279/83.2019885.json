JOSEPH SMITH, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b132-20\">The National Labor Relations Board, pursuant to the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e), petitions this court for enforcement of a Board order issued against respondent union enjoining union recognition without a majority designation in an election, enjoining a union membership agreement, and enjoining coercion of employees in organization, and requiring repayment of checked-off dues, fees and assessments, and the posting of the usual notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-21\">On December 18, 1956 the Company and the Union entered into a collective bargaining agreement which recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the Union as the exclusive bargaining agency for all employees at the Company\u2019s Waterford, New York, warehouse excluding office employees, watchman, permanent salaried supervisors, bakery employees, trucking department employees, and inspectors. The agreement required that as a condition of employment all employees covered by the agreement shall within the statutory grace period become members of the Union and remain members in good standing during the term of the contract, and also contained a check-off provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">In the Fall of 1956 the Union had renewed a campaign, which it had pursued intermittently since 1954, to organize the employees at the Company\u2019s Waterford, New York, warehouse. In late November it sought recognition as the representative of these employees and threatened the Company with a strike and picketing unless the Company entered into a collective bargaining agreement with it. On December 5,1956, a meeting was held in Albany attended by various representatives of the Company and the Union, including Bernard A. Lubeck, who is in charge of labor relations for the Company, Robert L. Hood, the Company\u2019s counsel, Nicholas M. Robilotto, president of Local 294, and Harry Pozefsky the Union\u2019s counsel. The Union\u2019s representatives indicated that they had in their possession designation cards signed by a majority of the Company\u2019s employees and agreed to produce them for inspection. The meeting was thereupon adjourned to the Union\u2019s offices where the Company\u2019s representatives were shown a typewritten sheet listing the employees who had signed cards for the Union as well as the cards themselves. A total of 45 cards was produced which the Company\u2019s representatives checked against its payroll records. Four of the cards were found to have been signed by persons no longer in the Company\u2019s employ and 3 by persons who were working in classifications not included within the proposed bargaining unit. With respect to the remaining cards, the Company\u2019s representatives were uncertain as to the authenticity of the signatures on 3 and were unable to make a comparison of the signatures on 2 others because they did not have specimen signatures of these employees with them. In addition, the Company\u2019s representatives questioned the validity of 8 cards which bore dates more than 12 months old. Thus, including all doubtful cards, the Union had 38 authorizations from employees who were working in the classifications for which it was seeking recognition. At the time there were 101 employees in the proposed bargaining unit. The Company\u2019s representatives therefore informed Robilotto that the Union did not represent a majority and that the Company would negotiate with the Union when it succeeded in obtaining designations from a sufficient number of employees. The Union\u2019s representatives indicated that it would only be a matter of a few days before they would have more designation cards. No one representing the Company at this meeting made a list of the names of the employees whose designation cards had been shown to them. Negotiations went on until December 18, with threats from the Union of a strike if it was not recognized. There were two meetings of the employees with Company officers or two sessions of the same meeting on that date. In the earlier part of the morning meeting, in response to a specific query, 69 out of 75 employees then present at the meeting expressed by a show of hands opposition to having the respondent Union as their representative. Thereafter, at the close of the meeting, the president of the Company said to the 75 employees that the Union had threatened a strike if it was not recognized and that the Union had the Company \u201cover a barrel.\u201d Somebody asked the employees to show their loyalty to and confidence in the president and, at this point, all of the employees rose and applauded the president. Faced with heavy losses if struck at its busiest period, the Company capitulated and signed a union shop agreement, although on a show of hands the great majority of the employees had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>indicated that they did not wish to be represented by Local 294. The employees had given a rising vote of confidence to the Company\u2019s president. However, Local 294 had never shown the Company designation cards signed by a majority of the employees. After the execution of the contract all the employees signed checkoff cards. Union dues were checked off and paid over to the Union until about August 3, 1957. On August 9, 1957 in a representation election in a voting unit including the warehouse workers and bakery workers, the Union was rejected and Robert E. Gray elected. On September 23, 1957 Gray and the Company entered into a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The Board\u2019s finding that on December 18, 1956, the critical date, the Union did not represent a majority of the 101 employees in the contractual unit is supported by its analysis of the evidence which was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">\n<em>Number of Employees Comment</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">47 They testified before the Board and it is undisputed that they never designated respondent before the contract was signed on December 18, 1956 to represent them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">4 They testified before the Board that they never authorized the respondent before December 18, 1956 to represent them. Their authorization cards were not signed in fact until after the execution of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">(Seguin, O\u2019Leary, Brady and Bourgeois)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-12\">5 These did not testify. They signed authorization cards dated January 1957, i. e., after the contract had been signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-13\">(Timm, Williams, Lawyer, McCullen and Sweet)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-14\">3 Although they were at one time members of respondent Union or a sister-Union, they did not designate the respondent as their representative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-16\">(Ilotaling, Fluewelling and Hedden. Only Hedden testified)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-17\">5 They testified before the Board. They formerly designated respondent in 1955, but they did not wish respondent to represent them in 1956 and signed no authorization cards until after December 18, 1956.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyX\">(Coon, Jansen, Fitzgerald, B. Westcott and S. Westcott)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-20\">64</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-21\">There is substantial basis in the record for the Board\u2019s conclusions that the Union did not represent a majority of the employees in the unit at the time the contract was entered into, and that the Company did not then have a sincere, good faith belief that Union did represent a majority. The Board\u2019s conclusion that the contract was in violation of the Act is clearly correct. N.L.R.B. v. Local 55, 10 Cir., 218 F.2d 226, 232, N.L.R.B. v. Henry Heide, Inc., 2 Cir., 219 F.2d 46, 48-49. The only question that remains is whether the form of the relief granted is within the powers of the Board and appropriate to the circumstances. The Board is authorized \u201cto take such affirmative action including reinstatement of any employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>policies of this Act.\u201d We think that the \u25a0portion of the decree requiring reimbursement is unduly harsh and penal in nature, not clearly bearing on the effectuation of the policies of the Act. Although the employer has consented to the order against it, in this check-off, the employer acted under pressure and with the support, even though in the case of the majority, also under pressure, of its employees. The Union involved is an existing local, not a shop union created by the illegal action in the case, not one whose disestablishment was the primary end sought by the Board, as in Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. N. L. R. B., 319 U.S. 533, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 87 L.Ed. 1568. There was no enforcement or occasion for enforcement of the union shop provision of the contract. A substantial proportion of those who would be reimbursed were bona fide members before the illegal contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u201cThe validity of reimbursement orders necessarily depends upon the peculiar circumstances of each * * * case.\u201d N.L.R.B. v. Adhesive Products Corp., 2 Cir., 258 F.2d 403, 409. The order here so far as it requires reimbursement is punitive in application and should be modified. Morrison-Knudsen Company, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 2 Cir., 275 F.2d 914; Bldg. Material Teamsters Local 282, etc. v. N.L.R.B., 2 Cir., 275 F.2d 909; Western Union Tel. Co. v. N.L.R.B., 2 Cir., 113 F.2d 992; Corning Glass Works v. N.L.R.B., 2 Cir., 118 F.2d 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The order of the Board may be modified by deleting provisions 1(b)(1) and 11(b)(1) which are the reimbursement provisions of the order, and the corresponding paragraphs of the Notices to Employees, Appendices A and B, concerning reimbursement, and as so modified enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is decreed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\">On Petition for Rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b135-8\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b135-9\"> The Board moves for rehearing of that portion of the court\u2019s order which deleted reimbursement provisions from the Board\u2019s order. Its attack on that portion of the court\u2019s order is well taken. In each case the validity of reimbursement orders must be determined on the particular circumstances shown. N. L. R. B. v. Adhesive Products Corp., 2 Cir., 258 F.2d 403, 409. We held in the instant case that the reimbursement order was punitive in application, unduly harsh and penal in nature, since the union was not company dominated, there was no evidence of enforcement of the union shop provision of the contract, and a substantial proportion of those who would be reimbursed were bona fide members before the illegal contract. On reconsideration, we now hold that these facts are outweighed by the coercion of the majority by the illegal agreement and are not sufficient grounds to refuse enforcement of the reimbursement order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\"> It has been established that the union represented a minority of the employees. Although there was a substantial representation of the employees, nevertheless the actions of the union were not supported by the express approval of the majority of the employees at the time the contract was entered into. The employees signed the check-off authorization cards largely on the solicitation of the employer. They did so in face of a contract requiring membership in the union within thirty days and we think that sufficient coercion existed here to warrant the imposition of a reimbursement order against the union which was the ultimate beneficiary of the collections. We think that the illegal activity of the union was the substantial factor causing the previously uncommitted employees to authorize the check-off. Pressure by the minority union caused the employer to request the workers to show their loyalty to the company by consenting to the check-off. The means of coercion is somewhat different and less direct than that displayed in N. L. R. B. v. Revere Metal Art Co., 2 Cir., 280 F.2d 96. However, it is present here and is traceable to the union. Indeed, the existence of the thirty day membership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>provision in a contract with a minority union has in itself been held sufficient to justify a reimbursement order. Dixie Bedding Mfg. Co. v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 268 F.2d 901, 905. Since the reimbursement order vindicates public rights as well as private rights, Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. N. L. R. B., 1943, 319 U.S. 533, 543, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 87 L.Ed. 1568, the inclusion of this minority group should not preclude enforcement of the order. The majority was coerced by the illegal contract into paying the dues. The lack of enforcement may indicate only that the coercion was successful. Company domination of the union as in the Virginia Electric case, may be an additional factor to support a reimbursement order. It is not, however, a necessary element. Compare Lodge 1424 v. N. L. R. B., 105 U.S.App.D.C. 102, 264 F.2d 575, 582, reversed on other grounds, 362 U.S. 411, 80 S.Ct. 822, 4 L.Ed.2d 832; N. L. R. B. v. Local 404, 1 Cir., 205 F.2d 99, 104 N. L. R. B. v. Spiewak, 3 Cir., 179 F.2d 695, 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The motion for rehearing is granted. Enforcement of the Board\u2019s order in full is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
