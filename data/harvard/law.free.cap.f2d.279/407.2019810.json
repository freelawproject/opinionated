The objects stolen were seven or eight 4,000 foot lengths of nylon towing rope of unusual size, color and capacity. The three testified their theft took place at appellant\u2019s instigation. Appellant denied his part in instigating the theft, or in transporting, or in possessing, the rope. The testimony of these three youths was suspect, in that they might have testified falsely in an attempt to save themselves. In rebuttal, an apparently disinterested witness (appellant\u2019s landlord) testified that coils of this unusual rope were for one night shortly after the theft in appellant\u2019s and the witness\u2019 jointly used garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">After conviction, a motion for new trial was made and denied. This is an appeal from that denial. The sole ground of error alleged on this appeal is that the motion for new trial should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">This motion for a new trial in the court below was on the basis of newly discovered evidence. It is to the effect that one of the three co-actors who testified against appellant was the real culprit in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">The six affidavits of the nine individuals filed in support of the motion were, in general, merely cumulative of previous testimony. The affidavit of appellant\u2019s daughter and wife, for example, substantiates the testimony of appellant\u2019s landlord that the coiled rope was on appellant\u2019s premises, although both deny the rope was appellant\u2019s property. The affidavit of Oreb indicates that appellant had a sample of the rope in his possession in San Pedro and was trying to sell coils of it although he claimed the sale was to be made for another. This is cumulative to appellant\u2019s own testimony, that he tried to sell rope from an eight inch sample for one of the three youths involved to help him out.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-16\">Of even more importance, there is no showing that the purported \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d was not available to the appellant before or during his trial, or discoverable during the more than three months between appellant\u2019s arrest and his trial. His only excuse for his wife and daughter not being present at the trial was that they were \u201con vacation.\u201d Other than this, there was no showing of due diligence to explain why the evidence proffered after the trial could not have been presented at it.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-17\">Furthermore, because of their cumulative effect, or their incompetency and nonmateriality,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the value of the affidavits to appellant is extremely doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-18\">But whether good or bad affidavits, or whether weak or strong, they were passed upon by the trial judge. He has a large discretion in determining the weight to be given such alleged new evidence and in determining what diligence is necessary. We cannot interfere with that discretion unless it can be said to have been abused. We find no abuse of discretion here.

One affidavit of a constable was to the effect that he had never seen the appellant carrying bundles or spindles of rope, but he had seen children playing with \u201ctow target rope\u201d during 1957.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
