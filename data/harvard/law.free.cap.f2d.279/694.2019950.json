United States Senior Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019CONNELL, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28 U.S.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>WORLEY, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">This appeal is from the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the United States Patent Office affirming the decision of the Examiner of Trademarks refusing appellant\u2019s application for registration of \u201cBurgundy\u201d for use on a soft drink syrup, on the principal register under the provisions of Section 2(f) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Appellant originally sought registration without reference to Section 2(f). However, after repeated rejections by the -examiner on the ground that \u201cBurgundy\u201d \u25a0denotes a flavor designation and is therefore descriptive, appellant amended its application and sought registration under .'Section 2(f), and presented evidence purporting to show that the mark had become distinctive of its goods in commerce. That evidence was held by the \u25a0examiner and the board to be insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The record shows that appellant began using the word \u201cBurgundy\u201d as a trademark for processed cherries in 1937, and in 1940 obtained Registration No. 376,-.687 for that mark as applied to \u201cprocessed cherries preserved in syrup.\u201d Appellant claims to have used \u201cBurgundy\u201d as a trademark on flavoring syrup continuously since 1939, the syrup in question having been produced from \u201cBurgundy\u201d processed cherries.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">In holding that \u201cBurgundy\u201d has not 'been shown to have become distinctive \u25a0of appellant\u2019s flavoring syrup, the board relied primarily on the ground that appellant has not used the word on such goods as a trademark but only as a flavor designation. That conclusion appears to be borne out by the two specimens submitted with appellant\u2019s application. On both specimens \u201cJ. Hungerford Smith\u2019s\u201d and \u201cJ H S\u201d appear in the largest lettering. The first specimen bears in smaller letters additional words \u201cImitation Burgundy Cherry Syrup,\u201d while the second bears the words \u201cCreamPak Brand \u2018Burgundy\u2019 Cherry Flavoring Syrup\u201d with \u201cReg. U. S. Pat. Off.\u201d appearing beneath the quoted word \u201cBurgundy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Regarding the first specimen, use of the word \u201cImitation\u201d makes it clear that \u201cBurgundy\u201d is not used in a trademark sense. Obviously the intended meaning is not that the syrup is an imitation of a trademarked product, but that it imitates the Burgundy cherry flavor.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">On the second specimen, as above noted, the word \u201cBurgundy\u201d appears in quotations with the notation \u201cReg. U. S. Pat. Off.\u201d printed below. Since \u201cBurgundy\u201d has not been registered for syrup, the notation presumably refers to the registration of that word for cherries. The meaning, therefore, is that the syrup is made from appellant\u2019s \u201cBurgundy\u201d cherries. The word \u201cBurgundy\u201d therefore is not used as a trademark for the syrup but to identify a principal ingredient. Use of the words \u201cCreamPak Brand\u201d in addition to \u201cJ. Hunger-ford Smith\u2019s\u201d serves as a further indication that \u201cBurgundy\u201d is not used in the sense of a trademark for the syrup.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">We agree with the Patent Office that, so far as the record shows, appellant has not used \u201cBurgundy\u201d as a trademark for a soft drink syrup, but only as a flavor designation. It follows that registration was properly refused, and it is unnecessary to consider the further holding that \u201cBurgundy\u201d is descriptive of appellant\u2019s product and has not been shown to have acquired a secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b743-14\">RICH, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ab2\">(dissenting, with whom SMITH, Judge, joins).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-15\">While appellant\u2019s use of the word-mark \u201cBurgundy\u201d is not as unequivocal a trademark use as it could have been, nevertheless I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that appellant has not made a trademark use of it on syrup or the conclusion that it has been used only as a flavor designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-16\">The label referred to by the majority as the \u201cfirst specimen\u201d is the weaker of the two alleged trademark uses. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>arrangement of the words on the label, all in the same size of block letters, is:</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">IMITATION</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">BURGUNDY CHERRY SYRUP</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">I do not see that the word \u201cImitation\u201d makes anything clear except that the syrup contains imitation cherry flavoring rather than natural cherry juice. Many soft drink syrups are imitations, i. e. synthetic flavors, and the label simply announces that this is one of them. All it makes clear is that it isn\u2019t real cherry syrup.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The other words proclaim that this is \u201cBurgundy Cherry Syrup.\u201d The majority says this means it \u201cimitates the Burgundy cherry flavor.\u201d \u201cBurgundy\u201d is not the name of a cherry or of a flavor. It is a registered trademark owned by appellant for use on processed cherries. It is descriptive neither of them nor of cherry flavored syrup. My view as to the first specimen label is that although it does not cause \u201cBurgundy\u201d to stand out as clearly as a trademark as it might, the alleged word-mark thereon is not descriptive of the product, which is imitation cherry syrup, and hence it really is a trademark in the form in which used. If in place of \u201cBurgundy\u201d we had Sunset or North Pole or Vesuvius, I think there would be no question about it. I see no reason why \u201cBurgundy\u201d should fare worse. The idea has crept into this case that \u201cBurgundy\u201d has a descriptive significance. But so far as cherries are concerned it is a trademark and I cannot see how, when applied to syrup, it comes to \u201cdesignate\u201d a flavor.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">As to the \u201csecond specimen\u201d label, the case is clearer. \u201cBurgundy\u201d is in quotation marks and under it is the legend \u201cReg. U. S. Pat. Off.\u201d The goods designation is \u201cCherry Flavoring Syrup\u201d and \u201cBurgundy\u201d is set forth with all of the accouterments of a trademark. No member of the public could possibly avoid the thought that it was intended to be a trademark for the \u201cCherry Flavoring Syrup.\u201d The question here is one of the impression on the public. I find the majority\u2019s reasoning completely unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">The majority first points out that the registration notice, as a <em>legal </em>matter, necessarily refers to the registration for cherries. <em>But members of the public would not know that, </em>as we do. Not knowing, they would have no reason, as does the majority, for making an association with \u201cBurgundy Cherries,\u201d about which they may never have heard, and \u201cReg. U. S. Pat. Off\u201d would mean nothing more to them than the words \u201cTrade Mark\u201d which are often similarly used. The majority next points out that the label carries appellant\u2019s name, monogram, and another brand name, \u201cCream-Pak.\u201d Other trademarks on a label may or may not detract from trademark use, depending on the overall impression created by the label. I do not think they detract here. I feel that the second specimen label is a clear trademark use.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">On the issue of descriptiveness, which the majority did not reach, I am of the view that the evidence of deseriptivenessrelied on by the Patent Office has been overcome, not by proof of distinctiveness, under Section 2(f) but by a showing that, the third party uses relied on are actually infringements and that \u201cBurgundy\u201d does not describe a flavor. Section 2(f) is-not properly involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">Believing that there has been a trademark use of \u201cBurgundy\u201d on syrup, I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
