Feldman v. Board of Pharmacy of the District of Columbia, D.C.Mun.App.1960, 160 A.2d 100. The Board now petitions this court for the allowance of an appeal from the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">For the reasons stated at the end of the opinion of the Municipal Court of Appeals in the two paragraphs beginning, \u201cAppellate courts\u201d and ending with the words, \u201cthe alleged offense,\u201d we agree that the decision of the Board of Pharmacy had to be reversed and remanded. \u201cThe key consideration is to prevent the demeanor of witnesses, whenever it may be a substantial element, from getting lost from the case.\u201d 2 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise 113 (1958 ed.). The petition for the allowance of an appeal is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
