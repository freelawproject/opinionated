It is disclosed that, under advice of counsel, he entered a plea of guilty in the Recorder\u2019s Court of Detroit, Michigan, to two separate charges of murder in the second degree, the sentence imposed on each charge being life imprisonment. Had he been convicted for murder in the first degree, for the killing of his wife and step-son, or either of them, he would not have been eligible for parole from a life sentence; while, on his plea to second degree murder, he could have been paroled after ten years\u2019 service. Thus, by entering the plea which he did, he probably escaped many years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-19\">We are in accord with the well-reasoned opinion of United States District Judge FREEMAN in denying the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-20\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
