The complaint named as defendants Colt Co., Inc., the owner of the cab, Fermaglick, its driver, Ackerman and others who were alleged to dominate Colt Co., Inc. so as to make them liable for its actions, two companies alleged to have failed to maintain the cab properly, the company that manufactured the cab and the dealer that sold it. Federal jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship. Ackerman moved pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 12(b) to dismiss the complaint as to him as failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The district judge granted the motion and ordered \u201cthat in accordance with Rule 54(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, it is hereby determined that there is no just reason for delay and the entry of judgment dismissing the complaint as against the defendant, Edwin Ackerman, is accordingly directed.\u201d Plaintiff has appealed from this order and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">Amended Rule 54(b) applies by its terms only \u201cWhen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action.\u201d In Goldlawr, Inc. v. Heiman, 2 Cir., 1959, 273 F.2d 729, 731, we made it clear that the Rule \u201cdoes not allow a finding of finality * * * where a single claim against multiple parties is dismissed as against some but not all.\u201d That is precisely this case. Plaintiff asserts a single claim for the injury alleged to have been done him by the taxicab; the order sought to be appealed dismisses the claim , only as against Ackerman. Such an order is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. As said in Goldlawr, Inc. v. Heiman, supra, \u201ca 54(b) certificate is ineffective to make appealable a judgment dismissing the action against some parties but leaving it pending against others.\u201d The distinctions of Goldlawr asserted by plaintiff are unconvincing. The case is parallel to Lopinsky <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>v. Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System, Inc., 2 Cir., 1951, 194 F.2d 422, which was disapproved in Goldlawr insofar as it had sustained the application of Rule 54(b). See 6 Moore, Federal Practice, \u00b654.34[2], at 247-248 (2d ed. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
