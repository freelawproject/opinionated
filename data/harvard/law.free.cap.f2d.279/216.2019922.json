In short: we hold the case is not ripe enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">Therefore, we vacate as improvidently made the order of November 30, 1959, granting the interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">It may be noted that under Section 1292(b), which came into the Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Title (Title 28) under Public Law, 85-919, 72 Stat. 1770, what is here done may have to be done in other cases from time to time. At the threshold when an interlocutory appeal is sought, in some cases it will be impractical to review fully the district court\u2019s findings that there should be a special interlocutory appeal granted under Section 1292(b). Therefore, at the beginning doubts must be resolved in favor of permitting the appeal. But, when it eventually appears that the question presented should await further ripening, we hold our duty is equally clear to vacate the initial order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
