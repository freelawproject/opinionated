United States, 5 Cir., 232 F.2d 83, at page 88:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuP\">\u201cUnder the evidence in this case, we think that it was for the jury to say whether there was any conspiracy and if so, whether one or more than one. If more than one conspiracy was proved, of at least one of which the appellant was guilty, it is clear that there was no variance affecting his substantial rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-24\">As to Lincoln\u2019s point, we need only say that we have carefully read the testimony to which our attention has been called in the briefs, touching on Lincoln\u2019s actions. We conclude that the evidence clearly shows t-hat his relations with Parmente: and others charged in the indictment and the manner in which he knew exactly how to fit into the part he was to play in re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ceiving and paying for the final load of whiskey on terms which must have been the subject of prior agreement, spoke eloquently and convincingly of an agreement with Parmenter to be an important actor in the illegal possession and sale of the nontaxpaid whiskey. No more was needed to warrant submission of the case to the jury. Its verdict must therefore be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The remaining points urged by appellants do not constitute prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
