The Seven-Up Bottling Company of Miami, Inc. bottles and sells the drink, using an extract or syrup purchased from the defendant under a contract giving the dealer the exclusive right to sell \u201c7-Up\u201d in Miami. The local dealer supplies its own bottles, crowns, and ingredients other than the extract. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Missouri company exercises no control over the local bottler except in the sense that unless the local bottler complies with certain standards, common to Seven-Up dealers, it may lose its franchise. The Miami dealer had no power to bind the Missouri corporation. The bottling company\u2019s sales were for its benefit; the Missouri company benefited only from the sales of the extract to the dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">We have carefully considered the pleadings, the depositions, and the exhibits, especially the \u201cTerritory Agreement\u201d between the Seven-Up Company of Missouri and its Miami dealer. We agree with the district court that in the circumstances of this case service on the local dealer, the Seven-Up Bottling Company of Miami, Inc., cannot be said to be adequate service upon the Seven-Up Company of Missouri.

Drill Well Oil Company, 5 Cir., 1959, 270 F.2d 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-14\">. Section 47.171, Florida Statutes, F.S.A., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-15\">\u201cWhen any domestic or foreign corporation shall fail to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 47.34 and 47.35 relating to the designation of the place for service of process, or in the alternative, with \u00a7 47.36, relating to the designation of the office of the clerk of the circuit court as a place for service of process, then process directed to any domestic corporation failing to comply</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-23\">with said sections may be served upon any officer or agent of such domestic corporation resident in the state or transacting business for \u2018it in the state.
