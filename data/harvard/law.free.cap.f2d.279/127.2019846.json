The broad claim of error which they press on this appeal is that they were denied a fair and impartial trial. They cite, in support of this claim, the following incidents of the trial: (1) the allegedly excessive questioning of witnesses by the District Judge; (2) a discussion between the judge and counsel out of the jury\u2019s presence relating to a motion to suppress evidence; (3) the judge\u2019s tolerating the District Attorney\u2019s argument to the jury which is said to have referred indirectly to the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand; and (4) the judge\u2019s summation of the evidence in his charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-21\">We have examined the record bearing on the incidents cited and find nothing in them warranting criticism of the conduct of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-22\">The questions addressed by the judge to the witnesses were neither improper nor excessive in amount. They were well within reasonable limits, were calculated to clarify the testimony, and seem to have had that effect. Nor were the questions partial to the Government; such interventions as the judge made from time to time did not violate his role of neutrality.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-23\">The United States Attorney\u2019s argument cannot be said to have constituted a forbidden comment on the failure of the defendants to testify. He merely reviewed certain testimony and added, truthfully, that there was no evidence in contradiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Finally, we discover no ground for complaint either in the judge\u2019s remarks made out of the jury\u2019s presence, or in his charge, which was a fair and balanced review of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
