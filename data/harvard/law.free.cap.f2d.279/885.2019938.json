KIRKPATRICK<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-11\"> United States Senior Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019CONNELL, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28 U.S.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b933-17\">SMITH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">This is an appeal by the opposer-appellant, Richfield Oil Corporation, from the decision of the Assistant Commissioner of Patents, 116 U.S.P.Q. 346, affirming the decision of the Interference Examiner and dismissing the notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-19\">The applicant-appellee, Dieterich Field, Inc., seeks registration of the trademark \u201cRichfield\u201d for hosiery. The opposition was instituted by appellant, relying on various registrations covering the mark \u201cRichfield\u201d alone and in combination with other words or designs, or both, for gasoline,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for gasoline, other engine fuels and lubricants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and for storage batteries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-20\">Appellant\u2019s earlier use of the mark \u201cRichfield\u201d in the petroleum field is conceded.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-21\">Appellant took testimony which establishes that it has used the mark \u201cRich-field\u201d in connection with the sale and distribution of gasoline and other petroleum products, electric batteries and storage batteries, lubricant charts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>seed envelopes containing flower seeds, the latter distributed as premiums. The testimony also refers to appellant\u2019s manufacture and distribution of specialty products, including \u201ccycohexanes,\u201d napthenic acids, cresylic acids, paint thinners, solvents, asphalts, cleaning compositions, mineral rubbers and additives. The testimony also establishes that \u201ccycohexane\u201d is used in the manufacture of \u201cnylon 66.\u201d Appellant\u2019s testimony also establishes that appellant does not manufacture nylon, and that it does not intend to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Appellee did not take testimony and is restricted to its filing date, January 21, 1955, for use of the mark. Appellee\u2019s specimens of record show the mark \u201cRichfield\u201d applied to containers for full-fashioned hosiery.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Both parties are using the identical word mark \u201cRichfield.\u201d However, the products of the parties on which the mark is used are different. It is appellant\u2019s position that the public, upon seeing the mark \u201cRichfield\u201d on hosiery, will be confused as to the source or origin of such goods and will acquire \u201cRichfield\u201d hosiery \u201cunder the mistaken assumption that it is one of opposer\u2019s excellent products, particularly if the same happened to be on display in or distributed by a service station or similar establishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">First use as a trademark of a specific name such as \u201cRichfield\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not, by and of itself, give the first user the right to prevent subsequent fair use of the same name by others on different articles. Federal Telephone &amp; Radio Corp. v. Federal Television Corp., 2 Cir., 1950, 180 F.2d 250, 251, 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">In American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, 269 U.S. 372, 380, 46 S.Ct. 160, 162, 70 L.Ed. 317, the rule is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-8\">\u201cThe mere fact that one person has adopted and used a trade-mark on his goods does not prevent the adoption and use of the same trademark by others on articles of a different description. There is no property in a trade-mark apart from the business or trade in connection with which it is employed. United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., 248 U.S. 90, 97 [39 S.Ct. 48, 63 L.Ed. 141]; Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 413-414 [36 S.Ct. 357, 360, 60 L.Ed. 713].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">The word \u201cRichfield\u201d does not possess the inherent distinctiveness of a fabricated word mark. Appellee, therefore, has the same right as appellant had originally to appropriate this word and to use it as its trademark on different goods subject to the qualification that such use must be a fair use.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">In S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. v. Johnson et al., doing business as Johnson Products Company, 2 Cir., 1949, 175 F.2d 176, 180, the court was asked to find that the defendant had no right to use the name \u201cJohnson\u201d on a cleaning fluid. Judge Learned Hand in the opinion for the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-11\">\u201c * * We cannot conceive any justification in these circumstances for allowing it (referring to plaintiff S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc.) to reach a choking hand into a market not its own, and to deprive the defendants of an interest, natural and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>proper in its origin, and after sixteen years presumably an important element in their business. <em>If Conr gress really meant to allow every first user of a mark so to stifle all excursions into adjacent markets upon showing no more than that confusion would result, it seems to us that it would have said so more clearly. </em>* * * \u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Here, appellant has sought to establish facts which would preclude our application of the rule of the Johnson case and has endeavored to establish its use, its intended use or, at least its association, of the mark \u201cRichfield\u201d with hosiery.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Appellant\u2019s testimony establishes that from time to time it has given away various premiums to encourage customers to purchase gasolines and oils distributed through its various service stations. At some date, established only as \u201crecently,\u201d it \u201cused in an experimental way the give-away as a sales promotion item, a liquidating premium, nylon hosiery.\u201d This experimental operation was further described in the testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-7\">\u201cWell, if it were handled as a liquidating premium by the dealer, he would offer a special inducement at a price to a purchaser who would come into the station and offer the hose as an inducement to get them to come in, and if they did they would be entitled to secure, let\u2019s say, a one-dollar-and-a-half pair of hosiery for $.49 or some similar figure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Under this experimental operation, the customers received the hosiery directly, with no coupons involved. There is no evidence, exhibit or testimony that under this operation the name \u201cRichfield\u201d ever appeared as a trademark on the hosiery itself. The testimony is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-9\">\u201cThe manufacturer\u2019s name would very probably be on either the box or the hose or possibly a little sticker in the box. But the name \u2018Rich-field\u2019 would be on the package somewhere. It would be on there from the standpoint of the mailing sticker on the box wherein it would be identified as coming from \u2018Richfield, a Richfield dealer.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">If, as above stated, the only appearance of the mark \u201cRichfield\u201d on the hosiery box was limited to the mailing sticker, such use does not constitute a trademark use of the mark <em>on hosiery. </em>The Examiner of Interference, in referring to appellant\u2019s use on hosiery, correctly found \u201cthe record is silent as to whether the mark \u2018Richfield\u2019 was applied thereto * * * <em>\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">Neither do we think trademark use on hosiery is established by appellant under its contemplated plan involving the use of redeemable coupons. The testimony is clear that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-14\">\u201cBecause of the inability to give customers proper sizes we have undertaken a study of a proposal for the handling of nylon hose in a different manner, that of using a coupon and the address for the mailing of the proper size to whomever are entitled to the hosiery, based on our sales promotional plan that would be in effect at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">The testimony further establishes that appellant\u2019s plans for using the name \u201cRichfield\u201d in connection with the premium distribution of hosiery is speculative at best. It is something which may be consummated at some future, speculative date. Thus, in answer to the question, \u201cAt the moment in what stage is your prepared program?\u201d the witness answered, \u201cWell, we plan to expand this distribution, but the decision hasn\u2019t as yet been reached as to whether we will carry additional stock or handle it on a coupon basis.\u201d As against this future speculative use of the name on hosiery, appellee has its filing date, January 21, 1955, as the date of its first use of the mark \u201cRichfield\u201d on hosiery. Thus, on the record, appellee is the first user of this mark on hosiery.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>We agree with the Assistant Commissioner\u2019s summary of the testimony of the witnesses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-4\">\u201c * * * <em>If </em>opposer were to give away as premiums, or sell at reduced prices, nylon hosiery at its automotive service stations, and <em>if </em>applicant\u2019s hosiery were given away or sold by opposer or others in automotive service stations, or <em>if </em>opposer should decide at some future time to manufacture hosiery and should decide to use \u2018Richfield\u2019 as a trademark for such hosiery, then purchaser confusion would be likely. * * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">The record is silent as to any facts from which we can reasonably assume that purchasers of appellee\u2019s \u201cRichfield\" hosiery are likely to believe that it emanates from appellant or that appellant is the source of such hosiery. The normal methods of selling and distributing hosiery utilize retail outlets which a purchaser is not likely to associate with the retail service-station outlets of appellant. There is nothing of record which indicates that appellee\u2019s use of the mark \u201cRichfield\u201d is anything other than a fair use. We do not think that purchaser confusion, mistake or deceit is likely upon the facts of this case. We therefore affirm the decision of the Assistant Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-12\">. Reg.
