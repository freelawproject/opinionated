Now, however, they are unhappy with what to them in retrospect seems to have been Hobson's choice. They appeal, attacking as an abuse of judicial discretion the probationary condition forbidding gambling. In other words, they cling to probation while seeking to welch on its price.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-22\">In a colloquy with one of the defendants the district judge stated that as he viewed it, \u201cthe government does not want you to get out of the business [of gambling].\u201d Nevertheless, the defendants say, the court proceeded to put them out of business. Moreover, the argument runs, gambling as such does not violate any <em>federal </em>statute and the gambler\u2019s occupational tax statute is a measure for the collection of revenues; it is not a police measure. And it is not an instrument for moral reform.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-23\">One must say that the appellants, as gamblers apparently still anxious to pursue their chosen profession, are in a predicament. But they got in it of their own doing, elected to stay in it of their own free will, and the misgivings they now have should have occurred to them before they agreed to probation on the trial judge\u2019s terms. They complain of the court\u2019s doing exactly what they agreed that the court should do as an alternative to their going to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"AXu\">It is a reasonable alternative. A broad latitude is given to a district court in prescribing conditions of probation in order to help probationers make the necessary adjustment with society.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is nothing unusual in conditioning probation on the defendant\u2019s obeying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>law, state law and federal law. Florida statutes make it a violation for a person to have gambling paraphernalia in his possession. Professional gambling got these defendants into trouble. It seems a fair exercise of judicial discretion therefore for the district court to proscribe gambling. In Stone v. United States, 9 Cir., 1946, 153 F.2d 331, 333, dining car employees were convicted of unlawfully taking money from dining ears on trains moving in interstate commerce. The district judge placed the defendants on probation subject to the condition that they not return to employment as stewards on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce. The Circuit Court approved the order although the effect of the order was to deprive the probationers of their usual employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s special conditions of probation. On the contrary, the district court tempered justice with a large measure of mercy to defendants admittedly guilty and subject to imprisonment for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-13\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4401, 4411, 4412, 4421, 4901(a), 7203.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-14\">. In addition to imposing standing conditions of probation, the judgment imposed the following special conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-15\">\u201c3.
