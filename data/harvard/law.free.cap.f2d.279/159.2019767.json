The only specification of error relied upon reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">\u201c1. The Court erred in overruling the objection made by counsel for the Appellants and in permitting the introduction of the testimony concerning conversations between the government witness John R. Evans and alleged coconspirator Jimmy Sanders outside the presence of any of the defendants on trial, inasmuch as the government had failed to prove a prima facie case of conspiracy between Jimmy Sanders and the defendants on trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">The conspiracy was, we think, established by ample evidence. Sanders, a Negro sharecropper with Huey Cash, lived on Cash\u2019s land about 250 yards from the Cash residence. Evans was working in an undercover capacity with a Federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Agent. On March 20, 1958, Cash agreed to supply Evans as much whiskey as Evans wanted at $35.00 a case. Evans was to return the following morning. Evans testified that upon his return:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-13\">\u201cI said I went down to his house and blowed the horn and called him a time or two, and he wouldn\u2019t get up; somebody finally hollered and asked me what did I want; I told him I had come after it; he said, \u2018See Jimmy,\u2019 and I went up to the colored man\u2019s house and got it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">Evans was familiar with Cash\u2019s voice. He did not positively recognize the shouted direction to \u201cSee Jimmy\u201d as Cash\u2019s voice, but merely assumed that. Evans then went to Jimmy Sanders\u2019 house, where he paid Jimmy $35.00 per case for four cases of non-tax-paid whiskey. Five days later, after again contacting Cash, Evans made a similar purchase, the delivery being made by Jimmy Sanders from a nearby church. A few days later, on April 1, 1958, Evans introduced the federal agent Powell to Cash, pretending that Powell was a bootlegging associate. Cash agreed on another sale of whiskey and told them that Jimmy would have it the next morning and to \u201cgo to Jimmy\u2019s house,\u201d \u201cwhenever you want whiskey, see Jimmy.\u201d Evans went alone, and testified, \u201cJimmy told me when I went after the whiskey the next morning he had done sold it before Huey saw him, all they had.\u201d Jimmy Sanders then dropped out of the picture. The conspiracy was well established independently of the statements of Jimmy Sanders to which Evans testified, and Jimmy\u2019s statements to Evans were admissible. Montford v. United States, 5 Cir., 1952, 200 F.2d 759, 760. Those statements related directly to the appellant Huey Cash alone, and it is therefore not necessary to trace the evidence as to the connection of the other two appellants with the conspiracy. The sufficiency of that evidence is not questioned. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
