United States, 1895, 159 U.S. 487, 16 S.Ct. 51, 52, 40 L.Ed. 229. This Court has consistently refused to review the ruling of a district judge on a motion for continuance unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown. Bryant v. United States, 5 Cir., 1958, 252 F.2d 746; Brown v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 228 F.2d 286; Girard Trust Co. v. Amsterdam, 5 Cir., 1942, 128 F.2d 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-20\">The facts show no abuse of discretion in this case. Taylor and Tray-wick were arrested on May 7, 1959. October 17, 1959, a motion to suppress evidence was denied. The attorneys representing Taylor and Traywick since their arrest refused to represent Taylor any longer because of a disagreement over their fee. October 18, 1959, at approximately 10:00 P. M., Taylor engaged his present lawyer. Taylor and his attorney went to Macon, Georgia, on October 19, 1959, when the case was set for hearing, to ask for a continuance. The assistant United States Attorney w-as not available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>for trial, so the case was set for the following day. October 20, 1959, Taylor\u2019s motion for a continuance was denied. A renewal of the motion was also denied. The jury convicted the defendant on four counts of the five count indictment in a routine illicit whiskey case. The facts \u2022of the case were simple, no complex questions of law were involved, and the record \u25a0\u2022shows no detriment to the defendant be\u2022cause of denial of the continuance. Boyer v. United States, 5 Cir., 1937, 92 F.2d 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"> Taylor\u2019s other specifications of error deserve only brief mention. After Taylor had taken the stand, he was questioned about a prior liquor conviction. Taylor\u2019s counsel objected to the questioning, not because Taylor\u2019s character was being put in issue without his having first done so, but because Taylor\u2019s answer was not the best evidence of the prior conviction. When Taylor took the stand he voluntarily put his character in issue and, for impeachment purposes, could then be asked questions about prior convictions. Williams v. United States, 5 Cir., 1931, 46 F.2d 731; Workman v. United States, 4 Cir., 1930, 43 F.2d 44. Taylor has no standing to complain on appeal that his character was improperly put in issue. His objection did not raise the question in the trial court and he did not request instructions limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of his prior conviction to questions of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">At the trial appellant\u2019s only objection to the impropriety of the remarks of the United States Attorney was to the statement that: \u201cIt seems a reasonable inference from the evidence that Mr. Taylor had this old darky [Traywick] down there running the still and he was going in there to check it.\u201d This statement was a reasonable inference from the evidence adduced at the trial. Tray-wick admitted that he had worked at the still, he was arrested at the still site, and he admitted that he had been working for the appellant who would be there shortly to pick up liquor that morning. In view of his testimony, there is no doubt that the United States Attorney\u2019s statement was properly based on the evidence. Moreover, no motion for mistrial was made, nor was any request made for instructions from the court concerning the United States Attorney\u2019s remarks. See Benham v. United States, 5 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">We have reviewed the record. The appellant had a fair trial and the evidence supports the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-14\">.
