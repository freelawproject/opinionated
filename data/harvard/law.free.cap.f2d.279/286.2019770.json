They rely on Reg. No. 275,403, issued September 13, 1930 (renewed) of \u201cSewhandy\u201d for \u201csewing machines and sewing-machine needles\u201d and also on prior use of the same mark on a child\u2019s hand-operated sewing machine and a sewing kit or mannikin doll sewing set including a carrying case. There is no substantial dispute as to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The board, after saying that the op-posers\u2019 kits had been sold both with and without the \u201csewhandy\u201d machines, found the following additional facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">\u201c* * * \u2018Sewhandy\u2019 juvenile sewing machines have been separately marketed through opposers\u2019 retail establishments and other retail stores since 1950. Opposers commenced use of \u2018Sewhandy\u2019 on the sewing kits in 1951, and made estimated sales of close to 16,000 units thereof during the years 1951 to 1954. The sale of these goods was then discontinued and has not since been resumed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-15\">\u201cOpposers discontinued the marketing of \u2018Sewhandy\u2019 sewing machine kits over two years prior to the filing of this opposition. No explanation has been offered in that regard ; nor does the record show that opposers are now prepared, or have any intention, to resume the marketing thereof. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-16\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s \u2018Sew-Easy\u2019 kit is intended for use by children in making hand sewn doll clothes, and includes precut cloth for several different kinds of garments, needles, and thread. This product sells for something under two dollars, and has been distributed through department and toy stores and the like since September, 1956.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-17\">\u201cThe proofs establish that opposers have had continuous use of \u2018Sew-handy\u2019 on juvenile sewing machines since several years prior to applicant\u2019s first use of \u2018Sew-Easy\u2019 for the hand-sewing product for which registration is sought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-18\">The board, apparently assuming that opposers\u2019 trademark rights in \u201cSew-handy\u201d subsisted only with respect to machines and the normal aura of protection related thereto, held that the cumulative differences in the marks and the goods obviate any reasonable likelihood of confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-19\">One element in this case which the board opinion did not mention is that op-posers\u2019 child\u2019s sewing machine, as the record shows, is not sold simply as a \u201cSewhandy\u201d machine. It is sold as a <em>\u201cSinger </em>Sewhandy Model No. 20\u201d sewing machine with emphasis either on the name \u201cSinger\u201d or on that company\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>well-known trademark consisting of a large capital \u201cS\u201d with the three words \u201cSinger Sewing Machines\u201d superposed on its three horizontal portions. The sewing kits which were sold <em>with </em>sewing machines bore labels in which the prominent word was \u201cSinger\u201d in type several times larger than the legend thereunder reading \u201cSewhandy Mannikin Set.\u201d The kits sold <em>without </em>sewing machines were sold as \u201cSinger Mannikin Doll Set\u201d and the only relevance such kits have here is to show that opposers sold sewing kits under the \u201cSinger\u201d mark and also to show that inside the cover they advertised the omitted \u201cSinger Sewhandy\u201d machine. Thus opposers\u2019 record shows, in the various forms of trademark <em>usage </em>relied on, a primary emphasis on \u201cSinger\u201d or the \u201cS\u201d symbol with \u201cSewhandy\u201d in a secondary position as an identification of a particular Singer Company sewing machine, or sewing kit including that machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Appellants, perhaps justifiably, object to the board\u2019s apparent dismissal of their trademark rights in \u201cSewhandy\u201d with respect to sewing kits because of their admitted discontinuance of the sale thereof in 1954. They argue that they have not abandoned the <em>mark </em>since they continue to use it on juvenile machines and that since they sell merchandise in many phases of the sewing field, sewing kits would be a natural extension of the children\u2019s sewing machine business. They say the fact they were once in this business puts that matter beyond question and that they might want to go back into it. We think this argument is sound but we are still faced with the problem of likelihood of confusion from the concurrent use of \u201cSew-Easy\u201d and opposers\u2019 mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The board, as we have indicated, predicated its decision on a cumulation of differences in goods and differences in marks. If we eliminate consideration of differences in the goods we also eliminate most of the opposers\u2019 arguments before us and reduce the .issue to likelihood of confusion from concurrent use of the two marks. Even when we do this we find we are still in agreement with the board\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In our opinion the only similarity in the marks is in the common inclusion of the common word \u201cSew.\u201d We agree with the board that it is devoid of trademark significance. This is so because it is purely descriptive of sewing kits, materials or machines or any combination thereof, even if integrated into a unitary mark. We think this common element is of very little significance on the likelihood of confusion issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">As to the other parts of the marks, the Easy in \u201cSew-Easy\u201d and the Handy in \u201cSewhandy,\u201d we are unable in our subjective collective judgment to agree with opposers\u2019 contention that there is any such real similarity of any kind as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake among purchasers of these goods, even should they be children as opposers say may be the case. From the point of view of adults \u2014 and we think the same would apply to children \u2014 Easy and Handy do not sound alike, look alike, have the same or very similar meanings or create the same psychological impact. The facts that they both end in \u201cY\u201d and that one has four letters and the other five do not impress us. Our psychological reaction to EASY is: something simple, not difficult. Handy means to us convenient, ready-to-hand for use. These reactions correspond to the meanings ascribed by opposers but we cannot go with them the next step, that these meanings are manifestly similar, even in a broad sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">We therefore affirm the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">WORLEY, C. J., was not present at the argument and did not participate in this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-20\">. The mark <em>as used </em>on applicant\u2019s box is \u25a0without a hyphen and is part of a label appearing four times in the form \u201cSew Easy Ready-cut Doll Clothes.\u201d This discrepancy should be resolved before registration. Another legend reads \u201cEat is complete even <em>to needle </em>and thread.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
