We held, or intended to hold, that Lhe letter from the claimant\u2019s attorney was a \u201cclaim\u201d within the meaning of Section 19(c) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> although not on the form prescribed by the Department of Labor. Since a claim was filed the insurance carrier of the employer and an \u201cinterested party\u201d under Section 19(c), had the right to apply for a hearing, and upon such application being made the Deputy Commissioner was under a duty to order a hearing upon the claim in the regular course of the administration* of his offices</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>In the opinion we indicated that the Deputy Commissioner might be under a duty to conduct a hearing under Section 14(h) of the Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> upon application of an interested party and that such duty might be enforced by a mandatory injunction. A majority now concludes that any opinion with respect to this question should be reserved for a case where it is properly presented by the facts. Such question is not presented by the facts of this case and we now intend that no opinion shall be expressed as to how such question should be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">We adhere to our former holding in that, under Section 19(c), the Deputy Commissioner was under a duty to order a hearing. It follows that the decision was correct and the petition for rehearing is</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-20\">. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 919(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-19\">. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 914(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b124-6\">BROWN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"And\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">I concur in the denial of the petition for rehearing. But I respectfully dissent in the holding that the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s duty to proceed with a hearing on the Employer\u2019s application came into being because the letter from the Claimant\u2019s lawyer constituted a \u201cclaim.\u201d This difference comprehends also the reservation \u2014 for another case and another day\u2014 of the question whether the Deputy Commissioner has the duty to proceed to a hearing where no written \u201cclaim\u201d has been filed. The reservation \u2014 if not a retraction \u2014 leaves the Court free in subsequent cases to reach a decision contrary to that previously announced and which, for the reasons extensively set out in the Court\u2019s original opinion, 274 F.2d 794, I firmly feel was correct. Under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act a written claim \u2014 whether on the official form or by a letter or other writing \u2014 is of little significance. It certainly is not the source or measure of the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s duty to administer. '</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">I must therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
