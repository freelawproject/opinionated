Appellant sought judicial review of the determination by appellees of the 1959 base wheat acreage and wheat acreage allotment for his farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">The net effect of the determination complained of was to reduce appellant\u2019s wheat acreage allotment approximately 20 acres for the year 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-19\">The District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois entered judgment affirming the review committee\u2019s determination and dismissing the action. The Honorable Casper Platt, Chief Judge, prepared and filed a well-considered opinion in this case, reported as Dighton v. Coffman, D.C.E.D.Ill.1959, 178 F.Supp. 114, followed by a supplemental opinion, Dighton v. Coffman, D.C.E.D.Ill.1959, 179 F.Supp. 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-20\">Appellant contends here that the action of the review committee and the district court was erroneous under the regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture, applicable statutory provisions, and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-21\">We have carefully considered the record, briefs and oral arguments submitted on this appeal. We think the opinions of Judge Platt, cited above, adequately cover all issues before us and correctly resolve them, and such opinions are now approved and adopted as the opinion of this court in this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-22\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b545-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-14\">.
