The critical issue is whether the petitioner was disqualified because he had not been \u201cphysically present\u201d in the United States for at least half the period of five years preceding the filing of his petition. \u00a7 1427(a), Title 8 U.S.C.A. The facts which are not in dispute are as follows: Medalion, a Pole, was admitted into the United States for permanent residence on August 24, 1951. He was in business and had to be absent from this country from time to time. On December 10, 1958, he filed a petition for naturalization in the Southern District of New York, based upon a continuous residence within the United States for five years preceding the filing of his petition (\u00a7 307(a) of the Nationality Act of 1940). He had been \u201cphysically\u201d present in the United States for only about fourteen months of the five years before he filed his petition, and \u00a7 316(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, requires his presence for half of that period. Hence if the 1952 Act applied he could not be admitted. To escape this defect he rests his case upon \u00a7 405(a) of the 1952 Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 note, which declares that nothing in it \u201cshall be construed * * * to affect * * * any status, condition, right in process of acquisition * * * existing, at the time this Act shall take effect; but as to all such * * * statuses, conditions, rights, * * * the statutes * * * repealed by this Act are * * * continued in force and effect * * * \u201d He argues that this language preserved his right to be naturalized after five years residence, in accordance with the terms of the 1940 Act, regardless of the period of his physical presence in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-18\">If the petitioner had fulfilled all the conditions of naturalization imposed by the First Act, we should have no doubt that \u00a7 405(a) would have covered his situation and that his petition should be granted. There would be no difficulty in allowing him to use his \u201cstatus,\u201d \u201ccondition\u201d or \u201cright in process of acquisition\u201d under the 1952 Act. The doubt we have is whether \u00a7 405(a) did not mean to continue the existing conditions upon the \u201cstatuses\u201d etc. as these appear in the 1940 Act: that is, still to require a declaration of intention before the petition was filed. If that be not so, we must say that, although a \u201cstatus\u201d was preserved, it was not in all respects the same \u201cstatus\u201d as that required under the 1940 Act. Certainly, the petition did not literally satisfy the conditions prescribed by either Act: (1) he never filed a declaration, and (2) he had not been \u201cphysically\u201d present for half the period of five years before filing his petition. Should he be allowed a privilege broader than that accorded by either Act? To repeat, when the Second Act accepted as sufficient any \u201cstatus,\u201d \u201ccondition\u201d or \u201cright in process of acquisition,\u201d did it mean to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>change them or only to take them over as they were? Whatever be the right answer, we are satisfied that at least the appellant\u2019s solution is not valid: i. e. even if the alien need not have filed any declaration of intention and need not have been physically present for more than half of the five preceding years, any privilege that \u00a7 405(a) of the Second Act gave him expired five years after that Act went into effect. That appears to us an even more drastic amendment of the Second Act than to say that the saving clause allows the elimination of the condition precedent of a declaration of intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Nevertheless, there is a body of authority, contrary to what we must own would have been our own interpretation, that we shall follow. It begins with the opinion of the Supreme Court in the United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615, in which the alien had filed a declaration before the Second Act went into effect, but had not physically resided in the United States for half of the five years preceding the filing of his petition which was after that Act took effect. The court decided that, since he had fully performed all the conditions required by the First Act before it was repealed, \u00a7 405(a) of the Second Act gave him the privilege of filing his petition after that Act took effect. However, in his opinion Justice Clark went further, and said (348 U.S. at page 536, 75 S.Ct. at page 518), that it \u201ccould be argued in the present case that it was Menasche\u2019s residence, rather than his filing of the declaration, which gave rise to his rights under \u00a7 405(a). And this approach would have the virtue of eliminating the inequitable treatment envisaged by the Government as regards those special groups of aliens who did not have to file declarations as a prerequisite to citizenship. But while our decision could be rested on this ground, it is sufficient here merely to refer to the provisions in \u00a7 405(a), derived verbatim from \u00a7 347(a) of the 1940 Act, preserving the \u2018validity\u2019 of declarations of intention \u2018valid at the time this Act takes effect.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">It appears to us that, although this language was not necessary to the decision of the case then at bar, it would be improper for us to disregard it as dictum. It is in accord with other language of the court in the same opinion as to the purposes of the Second Act. For example, 348 U.S. on page 535, 75 S.Ct. on page 518: \u201cThe consistent broadening of the savings provision, particularly in its general terminology, indicates that this policy of preservation was intended to apply to matters both within and without the specific contemplation of Congress.\u201d Again in 348 U.S. on page 536, 75 S.Ct. on page 518: \u201cthe congressional resolution of the Bertoldi\u2014 Aberasturi conflict indicates a willingness, at least in some situations, to preserve rights in process of acquisition without requiring affirmative action on the part of the alien.\u201d This language becomes especially pertinent in the case at bar in which the alien tried to make the declaration required by the First Act but was refused leave to file it. Moreover, even though it were permissible for us not to follow the quotation from United States v. Menasche, supra, there has been such a concord of decisions that have relied upon it that we should not feel at liberty to disregard it. The Third and Ninth Circuits have treated it as imperative. Aure v. United States, 9 Cir., 225 F.2d 88; Petition of Wolff, 270 F.2d 422. Six District Judges have also so held: Petition of Kaufteil, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 152 F.Supp. 538; Petitions of F\u2014 G\u2014 and E\u2014 E\u2014 G \u2014 , D.C.S.D.N.Y., 137 F.Supp. 782; Petition of Pauschert, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 140 F.Supp. 485; Petition of Pinner, D.C.N.D.Cal., 161 F.Supp. 337; Petition of Rosenbaum, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 171 F.Supp. 141; Petition of Zahario, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 166 F.Supp. 314. It appears to us that in the face of such unanimity we should accept the language as authoritative until the Supreme Court disclaims it. Anything else would only serve to confuse the administration of the Second Act which is being applied in numberless cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
