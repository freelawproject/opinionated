HAYES, Appellant, v. Frank W. LIVERMONT, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"Aup\">No. 15385.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b866-5\">United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b866-6\">Argued March 8, 1960.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AO97\">Decided May 26, 1960.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b866-13\">Mr. Alvin Guttag, Washington, D. C., with whom Mr. Joseph H. Heard, Washington, D. C., was on the brief, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b866-15\">Mr. Leo A. Rosetta, Washington, D. C., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b866-16\">Before Edgerton, Wilbur K. Miller and Bazelon, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b866-17\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b866-18\">The District Court held that the term \u201cadverse parties residing in a plurality of districts\u201d, in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 146, which concerns review of Patent Office decisions, is \u201cnot limited to plurality of defendants but may involve one plaintiff and one defendant if each resides in a separate district.\u201d This was error. Coe v. Hobart Mfg. Co., 70 App.D.C. 2, 102 F.2d 270. Cf. Chris Laganas Shoe Co. v. Watson, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 324, 221 F.2d 881. Since appellant resides in Michigan and was not served with process in the District of Columbia, this suit against him cannot be maintained here. The order denying his motion to dismiss is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-19\">But the District Court has authority to transfer the case to a district \u201cin which it could have been brought\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a). The case is therefore remanded to enable the District Court to consider whether transfer would be in the interest of justice. As the late Judge Parker said for the Fourth Circuit, \u201ctransfer is in accord with modem standards of procedure, the purpose of which is to get away from time-consuming and justice-defeating technicalities and secure an adjudication of the rights of the parties by as direct and as expeditious a route as possible.\u201d Internatio-Rotterdam, Inc. v. Thomsen, 218 F.2d 514, 517. Amerio Contact Plate Freezers, Inc. v. Knowles, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 81, 274 F.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-20\">In respect to transfer, Judge Bazelon concurs only in the result and only because of the authority of the Amerio case.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-21\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
