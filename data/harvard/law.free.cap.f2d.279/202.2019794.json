The Supreme Court of Illinois, in affirming both the conviction and a denial of post-conviction remedies, held that the evidence justified a finding by the Illinois trial court that the confession was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The District Court dismissed the petition for writ of habeas corpus without oral hearing, after consideration, not of the entire Illinois State Court record, but only of the documents attached to the petition, including the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, People v. Jennings, 1957, 11 Ill.2d 610, 144 N.E.2d 612, and a report of amicus curiae appointed by the District Court. This Court dismissed Jennings\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The United States Supreme Court, United States ex rel. Jennings v. Ragen, Warden, 1959, 358 U.S. 276, 79 S.Ct. 321, 3 L.Ed.2d 296, granted petition for writ of certiorari and held that the District Court erred in dismissing the petition without first satisfying himself by examination of the Illinois State Court record that this was a proper case for dismissal of petition without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">On remand the District Court considered the complete records of Jennings\u2019 State Court conviction and post-conviction proceedings. The District Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">\u201cThis court is satisfied upon the full records before it that the findings of the state courts that the challenged confession was freely and voluntarily given by petitioner are correct, and that there has been no denial of federal due process of law. Accordingly, this court is of the opinion that the Rule should be discharged and the petition dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">These same records are before us and have been the subject ef care-, ful scrutiny by this Court. We are compelled to agree with the District Court. It thus appears to us that the District Court has fulfilled the requirements laid down for him by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">Due process is satisfied when the State produces evidence sufficient reasonably to convince the jury, or the trial judge sitting without a jury, that a confession is voluntary and not coerced. Stein v. New York, 1953, 346 U.S. 156, 187, 73 S.Ct. 1077, 97 L.Ed. 1522. In the Stein case, Mr. Justice Jackson, speaking for the Supreme Court, said that petitioners there had confused the more rigid rule of exclusion promulgated for federal courts with the more limited requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the Illinois Supreme Court held that where there is evidence of extortion, the prosecution, if feasible, must produce every police officer or other person connected with taking the confession, to ascertain whether it was voluntary. People v. Jennings, supra, 11 Ill.2d at page 615, 144 N.E.2d 612 and other cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">Jennings contends that the prosecution failed to call all of the police. officers whom he accused of complicity in the extortion of his confession. Our study of the whole record does not support that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">At the trial, the Illinois Court appointed, as counsel for Jennings, Mr. George N. Leighton, a particularly distinguished member of the Illinois bar and a highly competent criminal law attorney. It is significant that the following interchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-16\">\u201cThe Court: * * * I want to be certain that we have all the witnesses here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-17\">\u201cMr. McDonnell: [the prosecutor] We have all the witnesses that are pertinent or that are implicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>at all by the defendant, Talbot Jennings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">\u201cThe Court: Is there any witness, Mr. Leighton?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201cMr. Leighton: I don\u2019t know of any, your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
