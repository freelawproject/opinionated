After a hearing in consolidated revocation and nonrenewal proceedings, the Authority canceled licensee\u2019s liquor license, with a $250 bond penalty, and disapproved its renewal application. The Appellate Division unanimously modified, reducing the sanction to a 30-day suspension, with the $250 bond penalty, and annulled the determination disapproving the renewal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The issue* is whether the Authority abused its discretion by canceling and refusing to renew licensee\u2019s liquor license because of its careless failure to keep adequate business records and to maintain accurate ownership documents with the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">There should be an affirmance. Absent evidence of willful deception or corruption, or the likelihood of either, imposition of the severe sanctions of cancellation and nonrenewal for licensee\u2019s careless violations of the record-keeping and ownership certification requirements of the Alcoholic Beverage Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>trol Law was so disproportionate to the violations as to constitute an abuse of the Authority\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Licensee Shore Haven Lounge has operated under a restaurant liquor license since 1968. Investigation by the State Liquor Authority in 1972 and 1973 disclosed that licensee had failed to maintain adequate business records on the premises, in violation of subdivision 12 of section 106 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law. More important, the Authority learned that licensee\u2019s principal of record, Pasquale Morgigno, was not the sole party in interest. Instead, Morgigno\u2019s brother-in-law, Vincent Dimperio, was an undisclosed partner, to whom the day-to-day management of the business had been entrusted. Moreover, Dimperio and Morgigno\u2019s wife had become corporate officers in 1969, without the Authority\u2019s permission required by subdivision 2 of section 99-d of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law. At the hearing, Morgigno entered a plea of \"no contest\u201d to the charges and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Neither Dimperio nor Morgigno\u2019s wife had any criminal record. There was no suggestion that Morgigno had been anything other than careless in his record-keeping, his failure to disclose Dimperio\u2019s participation in the business, and his neglect to file a change of corporate officers. Morgigno testified that he thought that he had not done anything wrong because of the close family relationship among the principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The result of this case accords with the restatement of principles, including that of judicial restraint, governing administrative sanctions contained in <em>Matter of Pell v Board of Educ. </em>(34 NY2d 222, 230-235). More recently, in <em>Matter of Ahsaf v Nyquist, </em>decided simultaneously with this appeal (37 NY2d 182), the court, as it did in <em>Matter of Butterly &amp; Green v Lomenzo </em>(36 NY2d 250, 255), adheres to those principles in applying them to regulated licensees as distinguished from internal agency employees and officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Thus, the support for the Appellate Division\u2019s judgment is the undisputed absence of conscious violation of the law by, and ulterior motivation of, licensee or its principals, or even the likelihood of such ulterior motivation (see, e.g., <em>Matter of Potter v New York State Liq. Auth., </em>37 AD2d 760; compare, e.g., <em>Matter of Hacker v New York State Liq. Auth., </em>19 NY2d 177, 184; <em>Matter of R &amp; L Bar &amp; Grill v New York State Liq. Auth., </em>34 AD2d 933). At worst, there was, in this case, gross carelessness by licensee without any evidence of prejudice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the public interest, except perhaps in the abstract. With no reason to believe that the laxness by licensee will continue, the licensee should not suffer the fact or the threat of a death sentence to its enterprise (see <em>Matter of L'Intrigue v New York State Liq. Auth., </em>29 AD2d 854). Moreover, by reducing the sanction imposed to a 30-day suspension and a bond penalty of $250, the fault of the licensee was not being treated lightly by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The court does not minimize the paramount importance of requiring and enforcing strict record-keeping by licensees under the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law and preserving the accuracy and authenticity of records within the regulatory agency reflecting ownership and operation of licensees. Thus, should licensee from this point on fail to comply meticulously with the requirements of the law and regulations applicable to it, an entirely different basis would exist for the imposition of the agency\u2019s sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Under the circumstances, there is no occasion, as there may often be, to remit the matter to the agency to reconsider the sanctions imposed. Only needless delay would result, especially in the regularization of the status of the licensee and of its ownership documents filed with the agency (see <em>Matter of Ahsaf v Nyquist, </em>37 NY2d 182, <em>supra; Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., </em>34 NY2d 222, 234, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b223-7\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXH\">(dissenting). I would reverse the order of the Appellate Division and reinstate the determination of the State Liquor Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">From the evidence before this court, and considering the nature and gravity of the violations committed and conceded by petitioner\u2019s \"no contest\u201d plea, there was more than a reasonable basis for the penalty imposed herein. Pursuant to sections 118 and 119 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, the Authority instituted a proceeding to revoke petitioner\u2019s license upon the following charges:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">\"1. That the licensee has failed to keep and maintain on the licensed premises adequate and accurate books and records of the business conducted on the licensed premises as required by Section 106, subd 12 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">\"2. That the licensee violated Section 99-d, subd 2 in that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>effected a corporate change without having first duly obtained the permission of the Authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">In addition thereto, the Authority instituted a proceeding of nonrenewal of petitioner\u2019s license upon the following specifications: \"The authority is not satisfied that Pasquale Margigno, sole principal of record of [the] licensee corporation, is the sole and true party in interest in the licensed premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">At the hearing of the charges, petitioner pleaded \"no contest\u201d to all charges in the revocation proceeding and specifications in the nonrenewal proceeding. Subsequently, the Authority adopted the findings of the hearing officer in the revocation matter and determined the appropriate penalty to be cancellation of the license with a demand made against the bond in the sum of $250; and in the nonrenewal matter, determined that the proper penalty was not to renew the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The petitioner, in permitting an unauthorized person to avail himself of the license herein and concealing material facts from the Authority, was guilty of violations of the most serious nature. These violations strike at the very heart of the State\u2019s control and supervision of the trafficking of alcoholic beverages. The Legislature regarded such conduct so disruptive of the orderly regulation of the alcoholic beverage industry as to authorize the penalty of revocation. (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, \u00a7\u00a7 110, 111, 114, subds 2, 6; \u00a7 118.) In order to carry out the intent of the Legislature with respect to the use of a license, it is understandable that strict accountability of each license is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Accountability is impossible where availing is tolerated, proper records are not kept, and through deceit and deception the identity of an interested party is concealed. If unchecked, such conduct would render illusory regulation of the manufacture, sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages within the State in derogation of fundamental public policy. While revocation of the petitioner\u2019s license, a much more serious penalty, may have been warranted in the circumstances here revealed, cancellation certainly was not an abuse of discretion and should not be disturbed. <em>(Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., </em>34 NY2d 222, 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Judges Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Cooke concur with Chief Judge Breitel; Judge Jasen dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
