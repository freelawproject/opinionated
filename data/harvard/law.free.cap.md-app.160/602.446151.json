Neither incident, however, was reported by Nigha until July 2002, when she informed her mother of both.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Appellant was subsequently arrested and charged with, among other crimes, two counts of second-degree rape, two counts of attempted second-degree rape, and two counts of second-degree assault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At his trial before a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, the state presented three witnesses: Nigha, then eight years old, her mother, and a county social worker, who had interviewed Nigha shortly after this matter came to light. Both Nigha\u2019s mother and the social worker testified only as to what Nigha purportedly told them. While Nigha\u2019s testimony was largely consistent with the social worker\u2019s testimony as to the November 2001 incident, it contradicted her mother\u2019s and the social worker\u2019s testimony as to the June 2002 incident, in several important respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">No physical evidence was introduced, although Nigha received a full medical examination following her revelations, nor was any other corroborative evidence presented. The state concluded its case by, among other things, hinting that appellant was a \u201cmonster,\u201d and implying that the child of appellant\u2019s cousin might also be in danger. But no objection was made nor was any mistrial sought on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">After the jury convicted appellant of all pending charges, the circuit court sentenced him to a term of fourteen years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>imprisonment for each of the two rapes; the two sentences were to run concurrently with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Requesting that we now reverse his convictions, appellant claims that the testimony of the social worker should not have been admitted under Maryland Criminal Procedure \u00a7 11-304, that the testimony of Nigha\u2019s mother should not have been admitted under Maryland Rule 5-802.1, that Nigha\u2019s testimony standing alone was not legally sufficient to support any of appellant\u2019s convictions, and that the state\u2019s closing remarks to the jury were so inflammatory as to warrant a reversal of his convictions by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Twenty-seven-year-old Joseph Lawson was accused of raping and assaulting Nigha P., sometime between October 1, 2001 and November 30, 2001, and then in June 2002. When these two incidents occurred, Nigha was living at 1205 Kayak Avenue in Prince George\u2019s County, with her mother, Tanya Renee Thomas; her brother, Kristopher, who, at the time of trial was eleven years old; her grandparents; and appellant, who is her cousin. Although appellant moved out of that address sometime after the first assault, he continued to \u201cvisit or watch\u201d Nigha and her brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Nigha did not inform her mother of the abuse until sometime in July 2002. On July 15, 2002, Nigha\u2019s mother notified the police that appellant had sexually assaulted her daughter. Two days later, on July 17, 2003, Nigha underwent a physical examination at the Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And the day after that, on July 18, 2002, Nigha was interviewed by Jennifer Cann, a social worker employed by the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services, Child Advocacy Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">At trial, Nigha testified that, when the first incident occurred, she was sharing a bedroom with her older brother, nine-year-old Kristopher. The children slept in bunk beds: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Kristopher slept on the top bunk and Nigha on the bottom bunk. On the night of the November 2001 incident, Nigha was lying awake in her bed, watching television while her brother slept. Appellant, she testified, entered her bedroom. Exposing his \u201cprivate part\u201d to her, he asked if she knew what it was. When she said \u201cno,\u201d he got into bed with her and, while she was lying down, tried to \u201cstick his private part\u201d into hers, penetrating her \u201ca little bit.\u201d After she observed \u201cwhite stuff\u2019 come out of his private part, which she described as a \u201cbig long stick,\u201d \u201che went to the bathroom, he got a rag and he told [her] to wipe it up.\u201d After she did, he \u201ctold [her] not to tell no one.\u201d The next incident occurred, approximately eight months later, in June 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Nigha testified that, one day in June 2002, she returned home from school to find appellant alone in the house with her brother, Kristopher. After telling Nigha that he wanted to speak with her about an \u201cincident\u201d that occurred that day, appellant instructed her brother to \u201clook out for\u201d their grandmother, as he and Nigha walked into her mother\u2019s bedroom. Once inside the bedroom, appellant, according to Nigha, unsuccessfully attempted to pull down her pants and then told her that she could have some of his soft drink, if she would let him touch her with his private part. She testified that she told him to \u201cstop\u201d and then left the room. She did not, she admitted, see his private part that day. Later, at trial, she recalled talking to a social worker about the incident, but she could not remember telling the social worker that she did see his private part or that \u201che put a plastic thing on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Nigha\u2019s mother testified next. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, Nigha\u2019s mother stated that, in July 2002, Nigha told her that, when Nigha and appellant were in the living room in June, 2002, he \u201ctook his private part,\u201d which had a \u201cplastic thing\u201d on it, and \u201cput it in her private part,\u201d while the two of them were on a living room couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The third and last witness to testify was Jennifer Cann, a social worker employed by the County Department of Social Services. Her job, she testified, entailed \u201cinvestigating] alie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>gations of child sexual abuse,\u201d and \u201c[t]o come to a determination or disposition as to whether or not the abuse occurred.\u201d On July 18, 2002, she interviewed Nigha at one of the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services buildings. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, Cann testified that, after establishing a rapport with Nigha, she asked a series of non-leading questions to get \u201cinformation to come from Nigha naturally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Cann then testified as to what Nigha told her concerning the November 2001 and June 2002 incidents. A detailed account of her testimony will be given when we take up the issue of the admissibility of Nigha\u2019s statement to her later in this opinion. Suffice it to say that her testimony was consistent with Nigha\u2019s as to the November 2001 incident and was consistent with the testimony of Nigha\u2019s mother as to the June 2002 incident. The testimony of both women, however, was inconsistent with Nigha\u2019s as to what occurred in June of 2002, as Nigha testified that she did not have sexual intercourse with appellant at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The state then rested, and appellant took the stand. He denied that he ever raped Nigha or touched Nigha in an inappropriate manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">When the trial ended, the jury found appellant guilty of both incidents, the November 2001 and the June 2002 incident, convicting him of two counts of second-degree rape, two counts of attempted second-degree rape, and two counts of second-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Appellant contends that the circuit court \u201cerred when it permitted a county-employed social worker!,] who was a stranger to the complaining witness!,] and who interviewed the complaining witness during a police investigation!,] to testify under Criminal Procedure \u00a7 11-304 as to the complaining witness\u2019s description of the alleged sexual assaults.\u201d The social worker, Jennifer Cann, testified as to what Nigha told her concerning the incidents of November 2001 and June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>2002.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cann stated that Nigha told her that, one night in October or November of 2001, she was lying in bed watching television, when appellant exposed himself to her and asked her if she \u201cknew what it was,\u201d apparently referring to his penis. When Nigha said she did not know what it was, \u201cappellant started putting his private part in [her] private part.\u201d Nigha told Cann that she saw \u201cwhite stuff come out of the front of his private part[,]\u201d whereupon appellant \u201cwent in the bathroom and got a rag.\u201d After \u201cwip[ing] off the side of the bed\u201d, appellant, Nigha informed Cann, \u201cwiped her private part off\u2019 and said to her, \u201cDon\u2019t tell nobody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Cann further testified that Nigha confided to her that, one afternoon in June of 2002, she arrived home from school to find appellant and her brother in the living room eating Popeye\u2019s chicken. Appellant \u201ctold her he needed to discuss something with her in the bedroom, her mother\u2019s bedroom, and she went in there with him.\u201d When appellant \u201ctold her that he wouldn\u2019t give her any chicken unless she let him touch her,\u201d Nigha \u201csaid \u2018no\u2019 and left the room.\u201d Later, according to Cann, when both Nigha and appellant were in the living room, appellant \u201cthen told her brother to go across the street and get some chips.\u201d After he left, appellant \u201cplaced her in a chair,\u201d knelt in front of her, and \u201cput a plastic thing on his private part right before he put his private part in her private part.\u201d Cann testified that Nigha \u201cdescribed him pushing it in there, referring to his private parts, and that he ... had his private part in her private part until her brother came back to the house and knocked on the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">That testimony, appellant claims, ran afoul of Md.Code (1957, 2001 RepLVol.), \u00a7 ll-304(c) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>Recipients and offerors of statement </em>\u2014 An out of court statement may be admissible under this section only if the statement was made to and is offered by a person acting lawfully in the course of the person\u2019s profession when the statement was made who is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">(1) a physician;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">(2) a psychologist;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">(3) a nurse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">(4) a social worker; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">(5) a principal, vice principal, teacher, or school counselor at a public or private preschool, elementary school, or secondary school.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">While conceding Cann was a qualified social worker under Maryland law at the time she interviewed Nigha,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appellant contends that, at the time of that interview, Cann was not \u201cacting lawfully in the course of ... [her] profession\u201d under C.P. \u00a7 ll-304(c). Rather, appellant maintains, Cann was, at that time, acting as an \u201cagent of the state who was brought into this case for the purpose of evidence collection rather than for the purpose of treatment,\u201d and therefore, her testimony was not admissible under that statutory exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">Appellant\u2019s claim requires that we first determine whether, when Cann was interviewing Nigha, she was \u201cacting lawfully in the course of [her] profession,\u201d a locution that has not heretofore been the subject of appellate scrutiny. We begin by noting that Cann, in interviewing Nigha, was performing duties mandated by state law. Section 5, subtitle 7 of Maryland\u2019s Family Law Article, entitled \u201cChild Abuse and Neglect,\u201d requires the Department of Social Services, among others, to promptly investigate \u201ca report of suspected physical or sexual abuse.\u201d Specifically, it states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>(b) <em>Time for initiation; actions to be taken. </em>\u2014 Within 24 hours after receiving a report of suspected physical or sexual abuse[,] ... the local department [of Social Services] or the appropriate law enforcement agency shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">(1) see the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">(2) attempt to have an on-site interview with the child\u2019s care taker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">(3) decide on the safety of the child, wherever the child is, and of other children in the household; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">(4) decide on the safety of other children in the care or custody of the alleged abuser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">(c) <em>Scope. </em>\u2014 The investigation shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">(1) a determination of the nature, extent, and cause of the abuse or neglect, if any;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Md.Code (1984, 1999 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-706 of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">Consistent with that statute, Cann\u2019s duties, as a social worker at the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services, required her to \u201cinvestigate allegations of child sexual abuse\u201d and \u201ccome to a determination or disposition as to whether or not the abuse occurred.\u201d She interviewed Nigha for that purpose, explaining \u201c[t]he agency had received allegations that Nigha had been sexually abused.\u201d In short, she performed her duties, as required by Maryland law, specifically F.L. \u00a7 5-706(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">Moreover, the General Assembly enacted C.P. \u00a7 ll-304(c) permitting social workers to testify as to out of court statements made to them while they were \u201cacting lawfully in the course of [their] profession,\u201d after enacting F.L. \u00a7 5-706, imposing upon the local departments of social services the professional duty to investigate reports of sexual abuse and to interview the victims of such abuse. Presuming, as we must, that the General Assembly knew that it had defined the professional duties of departmental social workers to include interviewing the victims of sexual abuse, when it enacted legislation permitting the same social workers to testify as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>statements made to them in the course of their professional duties by victims of such abuse, <em>see Cicoria v. State, </em>332 Md. 21, 43, 629 A.2d 742 (1993), we conclude that performing such interviews falls within scope of the lawful professional actions of a departmental social worker. We therefore hold that, when Cann interviewed Nigha about being sexually abused by appellant, she was \u201cacting lawfully in the course of [her] profession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Although Cann\u2019s interview of Nigha, as appellant correctly points out, aided the state in the collection of evidence against appellant and thereafter in his prosecution, it was, to be sure, principally intended to protect Nigha from further sexual abuse.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That it may have ultimately served more than one purpose does not render it inadmissible as long as it otherwise qualifies as a hearsay exception, which it does. <em>See Webster v. State, </em>151 Md.App. 527, 827 A.2d 910 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Appellant counters, however, that Nigha\u2019s statements to Cann were untrustworthy, as she was nothing more than a stranger to Nigha at the time of the interview. \u201cOnly statements obtained by someone in a trusting relationship with the child would satisfy hearsay concerns regarding reliability and trustworthiness,\u201d he maintains. Appellant then draws the following analogy: The \u201cdistinction between familiar social workers with whom the child has a relationship and unfamiliar social workers who are employed by the state to investigate allegations of criminal activity can be analogized,\u201d he reasons, \u201cto the distinction between treating and examining physicians in the context of the hearsay exception for statements made to a treating physician.\u201d \u201cJust as an examining physician who is hired for purposes of litigation does not instill the requisite trust in a patient to ensure that the patient gives truthful information, the social worker who is a stranger, sent by the state after an allegation of sexual abuse is made, similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>does not instill the requisite trust in the child to ensure that the child gives a complete and truthful account of the alleged abuse,\u201d he concludes.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">But the prior relationship between the child victim and the social worker, though relevant, is not the only factor the court must consider in determining the admissibility of the child\u2019s statement to the social worker. Indeed, C.P. \u00a7 ll-304(e)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides that, to determine whether \u201c[a] child victim\u2019s out of court statement is admissible ... the court shall consider, but is not limited to,\u201d thirteen factors. At an <em>in camera </em>pre-trial hearing, the court did just that. When the hearing concluded, the court found: 1) that Nigha possessed detailed personal knowledge of the events; 2) that she testified \u201cvery forthrightly\u201d and did not appear to be \u201cholding anything back\u201d; 3) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>the court was certain that the statements were made; 4) that Nigha did not possess a motive to fabricate her testimony; 5) that the social worker did not impermissibly lead or coerce Nigha\u2019s testimony; 6) that Nigha described the incidents using language that is appropriate for her age; 7) that the timing of the statement did not impair its reliability; 8) that her detailed knowledge of the events enhanced her credibility; 9) that Nigha was not suffering from \u201cany major distress when making the statement\u201d; and 10) that the social worker appeared to be a credible witness and \u201ccapable historian.\u201d Given that appellant does not contest any of these findings, we hold that the circuit court did not err in admitting Cann\u2019s statements, regardless of the fact that Cann and Nigha had never met before the interview took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in permitting Nigha\u2019s mother to testify at trial as to what Nigha said to her concerning the June 2002 incident under the \u201cprompt complaint of sexually assaultive behavior\u201d hearsay exception of Rule 5-802.1(d). Appellant claims that Nigha\u2019s statements to her mother \u201cdo not qualify for admission as prompt complaints of sexually assaultive behavior, because the statements were not consistent with [Nigha\u2019s] trial testimony....\u201d And, \u201ceven if the statements did fall within the scope of the hearsay exception, they were not,\u201d appellant insists, \u201c \u2018prompt\u2019 within the contemplation of the rule[,] and therefore[,] should not have been admitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Rule 5-802.1(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">The following statements previously made by a witness who testifies at the trial or hearing and who is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement are not excluded by the hearsay rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">(d) A statement that is one of prompt complaint of sexually assaultive behavior to which the declarant was subjected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>if the statement is consistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Rule 5-802.1(d) was adopted by the Court of Appeals in 1994. Given our recent discussion of the origins of this rule and the policy underlying it in <em>Gaerian v. State, </em>159 Md.App. 527, 860 A.2d 396, 2004 WL 2403157 (2004), we need not concern ourselves with that here, except to reiterate that Rule 5-802.1(d) embodies a principle that \u201chas been the settled law of Maryland for over one hundred years that \u2018a victim\u2019s timely complaint of a sexual attack is admissible as part of the State\u2019s case-in-chief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nelson v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 402, 409, 768 A.2d 738 (2001) (quoting <em>Cole v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 279, 287, 574 A.2d 326 (1990)). \u201cIt is not merely rebuttal evidence,\u201d we have observed, \u201cbecause 1) it may be offered in the State\u2019s case-in-chief, 2) it is not hedged in by limiting instructions, and 3) its admissibility is not contingent upon the defendant\u2019s doing something first.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>83 Md.App. at 289, 574 A.2d 326. \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d we have cautioned, \u201cit is not fully autonomous substantive evidence, because it is subject to limitations such as 1) the requirement that the victim actually testify; 2) the timeliness of the complaint; and 3) the extent to which the references may be restricted to the fact that the complaint was made, the circumstances under which it was made, and the identification of the culprit, rather than recounting the substance of the complaint in full detail.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Appellant contends that, because the testimony of Nigha\u2019s mother was, in his words, \u201cwholly inconsistent\u201d with Nigha\u2019s, the circuit court erred in admitting it under Rule 5-802.1. He cites as authority for that position <em>Corbett v. State, </em>130 Md. App. 408, 746 A.2d 954 (2000). In that case, the defendant was charged with attempting to rape his girlfriend\u2019s twelve-year-old daughter. <em>Id. </em>at 411, 746 A.2d 954. When the adolescent complainant could not remember what had happened, except for some \u201cevents peripheral to the allegations against\u201d the defendant, she was permitted to read to the jury a portion of a handwritten statement she gave police shortly after the incident inculpating the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 412, 746 A.2d 954. The entire statement was later admitted into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>evidence over defense counsel\u2019s objection. <em>Id. </em>at 414-15, 746 A.2d 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Declaring the admission of that statement to be error, this Court noted that \u201cto qualify under this rule, the [out-of-court] statement must be consistent with the witness\u2019s testimony at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428, 746 A.2d 954. \u201cAlthough [the complainant\u2019s] trial testimony about some peripheral facts was consistent with her recitation of those facts in her written statement, none of those facts,\u201d we pointed out, \u201cconcerned sexually assaultive behavior on appellant\u2019s part,\u201d and therefore we concluded that \u201cRule 5-802.1 (d) was not applicable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Nigha\u2019s testimony concerning the June 2002 incident not only fell far short of making out a case of second-degree rape, but in fact exculpated appellant of that charge. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-304 of the Criminal Law Article (stating that second degree rape requires \u201cvaginal intercourse\u201d). At trial, Nigha stated that when she returned home from school appellant was there babysitting her older brother. When she and appellant went into her mother\u2019s bedroom to talk, he tried unsuccessfully to pull down her pants. She told him to stop and left the room. Nothing happened after that, she testified, and she did not see his \u201cprivate part\u201d that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">That testimony conflicted with her mother\u2019s version of what occurred on that occasion. Nigha\u2019s mother claimed that Nigha had told her that she and appellant were on the living room couch when appellant \u201ctook his private part,\u201d which had \u201ca plastic thing\u201d on it, and \u201cput it in her private part.\u201d Because the testimony of Nigha and of her mother was not only completely at odds, but differed as to whether in fact the crime of rape had ever occurred on that date, we hold that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Nigha\u2019s mother under Rule 5-802.1(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">But that error, the state contends, was harmless error. There was, the state assures us, \u201cother highly persuasive evidence\u201d of appellant\u2019s guilt. \u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d the state avows, \u201cwould ... have been the same, with or without Thomas\u2019s testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>For an error to be harmless, \u201c[u]pon an independent review of the record, we must be able to declare, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict----\u201d <em>Collins v. State, </em>373 Md. 130, 148, 816 A.2d 919 (2003). That we cannot do here.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Contrary to the state\u2019s claim, there was no \u201cother highly persuasive evidence of Lawson\u2019s guilt.\u201d No medical evidence or other corroborative evidence was presented that appellant raped Nigha in June 2002, except, that is, for the testimony of the social worker, whose sole source of information was the same as Nigha\u2019s mother: Nigha\u2019s post-incident statement which was repudiated by Nigha at trial. When the state\u2019s case relies exclusively, as it does here as to the June 2002 incident, on the credibility of a single witness, the bolstering of that witness\u2019s credibility with testimony of another witness, which should not have been admitted into evidence, cannot be harmless. <em>See McCray v. State, </em>122 Md.App. 598, 610-11, 716 A.2d 302 (1998). We shall therefore reverse all of appellant\u2019s convictions that relate to the June 2002 incident. In doing so, we.note that appellant\u2019s convictions for the earlier incident of November 2001 rested on far firmer evidentiary grounds, and therefore, we are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the admission of the testimony of Nigha\u2019s mother as to the June 2002 incident did not unfairly prejudice appellant as to the November 2001 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Appellant contends that \u201cthe statements of the alleged child victim, standing alone without any independent corroboration, were legally insufficient to convict [him] of two counts of second-degree rape and two counts of attempted second-degree rape[,]\u201d particularly when, as to one of the alleged rapes, the child denied that a rape had ever occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">The requirement of corroboration in sex crime cases does not have roots that extend much beyond the twentieth century. Conceived shortly before that century began, it attracted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>little legislative or judicial support, and then, before that century ended, almost completely disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">It was, to be sure, never a part of our common law tradition. \u201cAt common law,\u201d as Wigmore notes, \u201cthe testimony of the prosecutrix or injured person, in the trial of all offenses against the chastity of women, was alone sufficient evidence to support a conviction; neither a second witness nor corroborating circumstances were necessary.\u201d 7 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 2061 (3d ed.1940). That changed, in small measure, when, in 1886, \u201cthe New York legislature became the first to enact a corroboration requirement for the prosecution of rape, a provision purportedly designed to protect the defendant from an \u2018untruthful, dishonest, or vicious complaint.\u2019 \u201d Michelle J. Anderson, <em>The Legacy of the Prompt Com,plaint Requirement, Corroboration Requirement, a,nd Cautionary Instructions on Campus Sexual Assault, </em>84 B.U.L.Rev. 945, 956-57 (2004) (footnotes omitted). By the early 1970s, seven jurisdictions, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, New York, the Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, and Nebraska, had legislatively or judicially adopted a corroboration requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The three principal justifications for the corroboration requirement were summarized by the Supreme Court of Idaho, in the very case in which it finally discarded that requirement. According to that court, they were: \u201c(1) the ease of fabrication and the fear of frequent false charges due to the emotion connected with the act of intercourse; (2) the chance of conviction solely because of the emotional reaction of the jury to the alleged facts of the charge; and (3) the difficulty of disproving an accusation of rape.\u201d <em>Idaho v. Byers, </em>102 Idaho 159, 627 P.2d 788, 790 (1981) (citing <em>United States v. Sheppard, </em>569 F.2d 114, 116 (D.C.Cir.1977)). But \u201cthese justifications,\u201d the Idaho court noted, \u201chave come under increasingly heavy attack____\u201d <em>Byers, </em>627 P.2d at 790. Explaining the reasons for this shift in policy, the court stated: \u201cAs to the first justification, there is no evidence showing that sex crime charges are frequently falsified or that sexual victims are an inherently unreliable class whose testimony should not be believed in the absence of corroboration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, as to \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>latter two justifications,\u201d the court observed, they \u201cseem insubstantial in light of available evidence which indicates that it is more difficult to convict for rape than for other major crimes.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>People v. Rincon-Pineda, </em>14 Cal.3d 864, 123 Cal.Rptr. 119, 538 P.2d 247, 257-59 (1975); The Rape Corroboration Requirement: Repeal Not Reform, 81 Yale L.J. 1365, 1382-84 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In rejecting a requirement that it formerly embraced, the Idaho court quoted at length from an opinion of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island in <em>State v. Cabral, </em>122 R.I. 623, 410 A.2d 438, 441 (1980), in which Rhode Island\u2019s highest court explained its reasons for holding that the crime of rape should be treated no differently from any other crime, whether it involved an adult or a child. That court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">The requirement for independent corroboration in sex-offense cases has been the subject of ever increasing criticism. Contemporary empirical studies suggest that the factors employed to support the corroboration requirement do not justify the rule. There is a great reluctance to report a rape. Amir, Patterns in Forcible Rape 27-28 (1971); Note, Rape and Rape Laws: Sexism in Society and Law, 61 Cal. L.Rev. 919, 921 (1973). Juries generally tend to view rape charges with skepticism and suspicion, especially when there is a suggestion of willingness or agreement on the part of the victim, Kalven and Zeisel, The American Jury 249-254 (1966), <em>see also </em>Commonwealth v. Bailey, 370 Mass. 388, 394, 348 N.E.2d 746, 750 (1976), and convictions, in the absence of aggravating circumstances, are the exception rather than the rule. Holstrom, The Victim of Rape Institutional Reactions 238 (1973) (the study of 109 rape cases: eighteen cases were tried; four concluded with a guilty verdict, ten not guilty, one with a hung jury, and three with a guilty verdict on a lesser charge).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">The corroboration requirement poses a major hurdle to a legitimate conviction for a sex offense. Due to the nature of sex crimes, eyewitnesses are seldom available. <em>Stapleman v. State, </em>150 Neb. 460, 464, 34 N.W.2d 907, 910 (1948).... Most women, when confronted with a weapon-wielding as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>sailant, make the sensible decision not to resist physically. Thus, they lack the bruises and torn clothing that would otherwise corroborate the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><em>Cabral, </em>410 A.2d at 441 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">But of particular relevance to appellant\u2019s demand that we impose a corroboration requirement in sex crime cases involving a juvenile victim, is the observation by the Rhode Island court that \u201c[jjuvenile complainants are more likely to be attacked by someone with whom they are acquainted and, therefore, are less likely to encounter a weapon and threat of battery and are less likely to scream and resist.\u201d <em>Cabral, </em>410 A.2d at 441. We feel impelled to add that such victims are also less likely than their adult counterparts to appreciate the criminality of the sex acts, to understand the protections that society affords the victims of such crimes, and to have the opportunity to report the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Today, every jurisdiction has eliminated its general corroboration requirement for sex offense cases, and all but two have rejected a corroboration requirement in statutory rape cases. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-6-3 (2003); Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 97-3-69 (2000). Maryland is no exception to this trend. In fact, \u201c[i]t is well settled\u201d in Maryland \u201cthat the testimony of a victim of a rape, standing alone, will constitute legally sufficient evidence to support a conviction,\u201d whether the victim is an adult, <em>Estep v. State, </em>14 Md.App. 53, 286 A.2d 187 (1972), or a child. <em>Moore v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 540, 329 A.2d 48 (1974). And no argument has been advanced today that persuades us that we should depart from this long standing principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">We do note, however, that, despite the absence of a corroboration requirement in Maryland law, Nigha\u2019s testimony was, in fact, fully corroborated by the social worker\u2019s testimony as to the November 2001 incident. And Nigha\u2019s testimony, in turn, partially corroborated her social worker\u2019s testimony as to what occurred in June 2002. While a prior consistent statement of a witness, as recounted by a third party, has not been deemed corroborative evidence of the witness\u2019s trial testimony in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>situations, <em>see, e.g., Turner v. State, </em>294 Md. 640, 452 A.2d 416 (1982) (holding that a \u201cthird party relating an excited utterance made by an accomplice to the third party\u201d does not \u201cprovide[] the necessary corroboration of the accomplice\u2019s testimony[,]\u201d as required by Maryland law), it has been held to \u201cconstitute sufficient substantive evidence of corroboration\u201d in one of the two states that still statutorily require corroboration in statutory rape cases. <em>Weldon v. State, </em>270 Ga.App. 262, 606 S.E.2d 329 (2004). In so holding, the Court of Appeals of Georgia stressed, \u201cthe quantum of corroboration needed is not that which is in itself sufficient to convict the accused, but only that amount of independent evidence which tends to prove that the incident occurred as alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331. \u201cSlight circumstances,\u201d the Georgia court added, \u201cmay be sufficient corroboration....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">As for both incidents of alleged rape in the instant case, the corroborative evidence presented exceeded \u201cslight circumstances.\u201d Moreover, under Maryland law, Nigha\u2019s testimony, standing alone, as to the November 2001 incident, and the social worker\u2019s testimony, standing alone, as to the June 2002 incident, when viewed \u201cin the light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>accord State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533, 823 A.2d 664 (2003); <em>Moye v. State, </em>369 Md. 2, 12, 796 A.2d 821 (2002), provided evidence upon which a rational fact finder could have found appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of both crimes. That Nigha\u2019s testimony contradicted her mother\u2019s and the social worker\u2019s as to whether a rape occurred in June 2002 does not affect the admissibility of the social worker\u2019s testimony under C.P. \u00a7 11-304. That section does not require that the victim\u2019s out-of-court statement to a third party be consistent with the victim\u2019s in-court testimony to be admissible and, with good reason. \u201c[A] young child can be easily intimidated into not testifying about [such] offenses .... \u201d <em>State v. Benwire, </em>98 S.W.3d 618, 624 (Mo.Ct.App. 2003). For that reason and others, \u201cas a general phenomenon, child abuse victims frequently recant their initial reports of abuse.\u201d <em>Yount v. State, </em>99 Md.App. 207, 210, 636 A.2d 50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>(1994). Indeed, it has been observed that a child\u2019s out-of-court statements may \u201cbe more reliable than the child\u2019s testimony at trial, which may suffer distortion by the trauma of the courtroom setting or become contaminated by contacts and influences prior to trial.\u201d <em>Benwire, </em>98 S.W.3d at 624 (citation and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">That is why, we hold, that any conflicts between Nigha\u2019s out-of-court statements and her in-court testimony do not render her out-of-court statements inadmissible, but rather present a question of credibility to be resolved by the jury. As Judge Learned Hand observed in <em>Di Carlo v. United States, </em>6 F.2d 364, 368 (2d Cir.1925), \u201c[i]f, from all that the jury see of the witness, they conclude that what [she] says now is not the truth, but what [she] said before, they are none the less deciding from what they see and hear of that person and in court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred \u201cin permitting the State to make impermissible and inflammatory arguments to the jury\u201d during its closing and rebuttal arguments. During closing argument, the State, according to appellant, violated the \u201cprohibition of \u2018golden rule\u2019 arguments\u201d and \u201cunconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to appellant,\u201d and then, on rebuttal, the State, he claims, \u201cappealed to the jurors\u2019 prejudices and fears\u201d by characterizing him as a \u201cmonster\u201d and \u201cchild molester\u201d and impermissibly \u201csuggested that appellant would commit similar crimes on another specific victim if acquitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Although we have declared that \u201c[cjlosing argument \u2018is a robust forensic forum wherein its practitioners are afforded a wide range of expression,\u2019 \u201d <em>McCracken v. State, </em>150 Md.App. 330, 361, 820 A.2d 593 (2003) (quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 444, 455, 768 A.2d 761 (2001)), we have also cautioned that this range \u201chas bounds.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>148 Md.App. 601, 654, 814 A.2d 1 (2002). In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>words,\u201d[d]espite the wide latitude afforded attorneys in closing arguments, there are limits in place to protect a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 430, 722 A.2d 887 (1999); see <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 413-15, 326 A.2d 707 (1974). Reversal, however, is only warranted when \u201c \u2018it appears that the remarks of the prosecutor actually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 431, 722 A.2d 887 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>310 Md. 569, 580, 530 A.2d 743 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">When reviewing a closing argument on appeal, we will first determine whether counsel made an improper argument. If not, our inquiry ends. But if we find that the argument was improper, we must then determine whether the argument was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a reversal of conviction. <em>See Walker v. State, </em>121 Md.App. 364, 382, 709 A.2d 177 (1998). We now turn to the remarks at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">During closing argument, the state instructed the jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">I want you to put yourself in the shoes if you have an eight-year-old niece, seven-year-old niece, or you have an eight-year-old daughter, seven-year-old daughter, a cousin, a close family friend, and this child comes to you and says that someone that you know sexually molested them. What would go through your minds?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">It then pointed out that the defense had failed to present any evidence as to why Nigha would lie about what had happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">Well, I would urge you to think about certain things. One, motive. What is the motive here? Have you heard any motive? Did the defense give you a motive as to why Nigha would be lying?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">When the defense objected to these comments, the court overruled that objection, whereupon the state returned to requesting that the jurors place themselves in the shoes of Nigha\u2019s mother:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>I urge you, while putting yourself in the shoes of someone who has had a child come to them and tell them this, what else do you look at? Well, again, you would look at the details.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\u201c[A]n advocate may not implore jurors,\u201d appellant asserts, \u201cto consider their own interests by asking them to put themselves in the shoes of a party or a witness to the case.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Holmes v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 518, 705 A.2d 118 (1998). This is known as the \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument, and, as appellant states, such \u201carguments are impermissible because they encourage the jurors to abdicate their position of neutrality and decide cases on the basis of personal interest rather than the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In <em>Holmes, </em>the only case upon which appellant relies in advancing this argument, the state urged the jury to convict Holmes of possession with intent to distribute both heroin and cocaine, declaiming: \u201cThis is not about jail time. It\u2019s about the day of reckoning, the day of accountability, the day we say no, Mr. Holmes, no longer will we allow you to spread that poison on the streets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526-27, 705 A.2d 118. Although we reversed Holmes\u2019s convictions on other grounds, we found those statements to be improper, explaining: \u201cThe \u2018we say no\u2019 comments implore jurors to consider their own interests and therefore violate the prohibition against the \u2018golden rule\u2019 argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 705 A.2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">\u201cBy asking the jurors to put themselves in the shoes of Nigha\u2019s mother and give Nigha the same credibility that they would give their own daughter, the State,\u201d appellant asserts, \u201cimproperly appealed to the passions of the jury in order to persuade them to believe Nigha\u2019s version of events.\u201d \u201cAfter all,\u201d appellant asks rhetorically, \u201cwho wouldn\u2019t believe their own daughter?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Although a violation of the golden rule prohibition, the argument was not, standing alone, so prejudicial as to deny appellant a fair trial. It did not request, as the state\u2019s comments did in <em>Holmes, </em>that the jurors consider their own interests in reaching a verdict. Nor did it amount to more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>than a brief remark, which was abandoned almost as quickly as it was made. Moreover, the court instructed the jury, before closing argument, that it was to \u201cconsider this case fairly and impartially ... without bias or prejudice,\u201d and not to let \u201csympathy, prejudice or public opinion\u201d sway them, thereby mitigating whatever prejudice might have been engendered by this remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Appellant also claims that the state, in its closing, \u201cdiluted its own obligations and shifted the burden of proof to Appellant.\u201d The state did so, appellant maintains, \u201c[b]y arguing that the defense ha[d] a responsibility to provide the jury with a reason why Nigha would lie,\u201d which in effect \u201cimposed on Appellant a duty to present evidence in violation of Appellant\u2019s constitutional due process rights.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">It is well settled that a prosecutor may not \u201ccomment upon the defendant\u2019s failure to produce evidence to refute the State\u2019s evidence.\u201d <em>Eley v. State, </em>288 Md. 548, 555 n. 2, 419 A.2d 384 (1980); <em>Garrison v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 475, 480, 594 A.2d 1264 (1991) (citing <em>Eley, </em>288 Md. at 555 n. 2, 419 A.2d 384); <em>Woodland v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 503, 490 A.2d 286 (1985) (citing <em>Eley, </em>288 Md. at 555 n. 2, 419 A.2d 384). After urging the jury \u201cto think about certain things,\u201d especially \u201cmotive,\u201d the state asked a series of rhetorical questions, which ultimately placed the burden of explaining the complainant\u2019s motive squarely on appellant. The state asked, \u201cWhat is the motive here? Have you heard any motive? Did the defense give you a motive as to why Nigha would be lying?\u201d Although in question form, the state\u2019s comments were clearly asserting that appellant had failed to present evidence to rebut the state\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">But those remarks, even if improper, did not so prejudice appellant as to deny him a fair trial. The court\u2019s instructions to the jury, which preceded that misleading statement, corrected the state\u2019s misassignment of the burden of proof. In those pre-deliberation instructions, the court reminded the jury that \u201c[t]he State has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d the defendant\u2019s guilt; that \u201c[t]his burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>remains on the State throughout the trial\u201d; and that \u201c[t]he Defendant is not required to prove his innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Rebuttal</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Appellant complains that, on rebuttal, the state described him as a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cchild molester\u201d and suggested that he was a threat to the safety of the eleven-year-old child of his cousin. What the state actually said was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">What does a monster look like? Looks like different things to different people. What does a sexual molester look like? He looks like someone you know. He looks like your uncle, your brother, your sister, your cousin. It\u2019s possible. But there is no certain way that someone who molests children looks. But they do ingratiate themselves. They make themselves indispensable. They are friendly, always there to watch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">Not everyone is like that, but please don\u2019t misunderstand me because the important point here is that a child molester looks like anybody else. That\u2019s why they are able to do what they do, because they look like all of us, and we trust. When I said that they ingratiate themselves, they make themselves indispensable. They make themselves helpful. The defendant told you, himself, he is paying for an apartment and he is not living there. He is letting an adult female cousin, who just happens to have a little 11-year-old child, live there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-9\"> But, after these remarks were made, appellant did not object to them, ask that they be stricken, request a mistrial or demand some other form of remedial action. Generally, a timely objection must be made to preserve an-issue for appeal, otherwise it is waived. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-323(a). The only exception to that rule is when the closing argument constitutes plain error. <em>McCracken v. State, </em>150 Md.App. 330, 362, 820 A.2d 593 (2003); see also <em>Bruce v.

Plain error is invoked, however, only in instances which are \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>tional or fundamental to assure the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Stanley v.

Daughton, </em>321 Md. 206, 210-11, 582 A.2d 521 (1990) (\u201can appellate court may recognize <em>sua sponte </em>plain error, that is, error which vitally affects a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">There are three limitations \u201con the affirmative act of noticing plain error\u201d: 1) there must be error; 2) it must be plain; and 3) it must be material. <em>Morris v. State, </em>153 Md.App. 480, 507 n. 1, 837 A.2d 248 (2003) (citations omitted). Accordingly, to determine whether allowing a closing argument constitutes plain error, we must first examine whether allowing the closing argument constituted error, that is to say, that the argument was improper and that it prejudiced the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">As noted above, appellant contends that there were two instances of error in the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument. First, he claims that the \u201cdescription of him as a \u2018monster\u2019 and \u2018child molester\u2019 was wholly inappropriate and was specifically designed to inflame the jurors\u2019 prejudice against a class of hated individuals within society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In support of this argument, appellant cites cases in which the prosecutor characterized the defendant as \u201ca child molester,\u201d \u201ca pervert,\u201d and \u201canimal,\u201d but in none of these cases was the issue of whether the comment was reversible error reached. <em>See Walker, </em>121 Md.App. at 374, 709 A.2d 177 (during closing arguments, the prosecutor stated \u201cThe evidence reveals that you \u2014 that he\u2019s an animal.\u201d); <em>State v. Matthews, </em>358 N.C. 102, 591 S.E.2d 535, 542 (2004) (\u201cDuring closing argument the prosecutor characterized defendant as a \u2018monster,\u2019 \u2018demon,\u2019 \u2018devil,\u2019 \u2018a man without morals\u2019 and as having a \u2018monster mind.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Nonetheless, the instant case is distinguishable from the cases relied on by appellant. The state never directly characterized appellant as a \u201cmonster\u201d or \u201csexual molester.\u201d In each instance, it was an isolated comment with no direct reference to appellant. Indeed, viewing the state\u2019s comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>in the context of its entire argument, we do not find that the challenged comments vitally affected appellant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">\u201cEven more egregious,\u201d appellant insists, \u201cwas the prosecutor\u2019s rather explicit suggestion to the jury that appellant would sexually assault his cousin\u2019s eleven-year-old child if he was not convicted of this crime.\u201d Although no Maryland appellate court has addressed this precise issue, other state courts have.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">\u201cIt is undoubtedly improper,\u201d declared the Court of Appeals of Idaho, \u201cfor a prosecutor to raise the specter of possible future criminality of the defendant as a reason for the jury to return a guilty verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>131 Idaho 61, 951 P.2d 1288, 1297 (1998); <em>see also State v. Williams, </em>145 S.W.3d 874, 2004 WL 2289600 (Mo.Ct.App. Oct.12, 2004); <em>Williams v. State, </em>261 Ga.App. 511, 583 S.E.2d 172, 177 (2003); <em>People v. McNeal, </em>175 Ill.2d 335, 222 Ill.Dec. 307, 677 N.E.2d 841, 855 (1997) . \u201cSuch a prediction of future offenses,\u201d the Idaho court explained, \u201cis not a \u2018fact\u2019 proven by the evidence and hence not an appropriate subject for the jury\u2019s decision or counsel\u2019s argument.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>951 P.2d at 1297. We agree. The statement at issue was entirely improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Even so, \u201c[t]he fact that an error may have been <em>prejudicial </em>to the accused does not, of course, <em>ipso fa,cto </em>guarantee that it will be noticed.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>153 Md.App. at 512, 837 A.2d 248. This is because \u201c[i]f every material (prejudicial) error were <em>ipso facto </em>entitled to notice under the \u2018plain error doctrine,\u2019 the preservation requirement would be utterly meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 837 A.2d 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Indeed, courts are reluctant to find plain error in closing arguments. <em>See Clermont v. State, </em>348 Md. 419, 704 A.2d 880 (1998) ; <em>Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 602 A.2d 677 (1992); <em>Perry v. State, </em>150 Md.App. 403, 822 A.2d 434 (2002); <em>Beard v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 276, 399 A.2d 1383 (1979). This principle holds true even when the prosecutor impermissibly argues that the jury should convict a defendant in order to prevent him from committing future crime. <em>See State v. Williams, </em>145 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>S.W.3d 874 (2004); <em>State v. Dixon, </em>70 S.W.3d 540 (Mo.App.2002); <em>State v. Brown, </em>131 Idaho 61, 951 P.2d 1288 (1998). This case presents no persuasive reasons why it should be an exception to this well established rule. The remarks at issue were unquestionably improper but, in each instance, they were short, isolated, and vague comments and thus did not vitally affect appellant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">JUDGMENT AS TO SECOND COUNT OF SECOND-DEGREE RAPE AND ATTEMPTED SECOND-DEGREE RAPE REVERSED.
