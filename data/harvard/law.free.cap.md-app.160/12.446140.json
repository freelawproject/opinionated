We must determine whether, in a suit initiated by a former employee of a county board of education, the school board is an arm of the State <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for purposes of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">David Norville, appellant, was discharged by the Anne Arundel County Board of Education (the \u201cBoard\u201d) when he was 48 years old. That termination led Norville to file suit in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against the Board and Norville\u2019s supervisor, Don Cramer, appellees. In an Amended Complaint, Norville alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634 (the \u201cADEA\u201d), as well as the Fair Employment Practices Act, Md. Code (1957, 2003 Repl. Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 16(a). Norville also asserted claims for common law wrongful discharge and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In successive rulings over a period of months, the court dismissed all of Norville\u2019s claims prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">On appeal, Norville poses the following questions:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>I. Was Norville\u2019s Article 19 rights [sic] violated by the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">II. Did the Circuit Court err when it held that the Eleventh Amendment bars an ADEA suit against the Anne Arundel County Board of Education in State court, and consequently dismissed Norville\u2019s ADEA count against the Board?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">III. Did the Circuit Court err when it held that there is no private cause of action under Article 49B, \u00a7 16, and consequently dismissed Norville\u2019s 49B count against the Board?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">IV. Did the Circuit Court err when it held that Norville\u2019s common law count of Wrongful Discharge against the Board was preempted by both federal and state statutory remedy, and consequently dismissed Norville\u2019s Wrongful Discharge count against the Board?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm in part and reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Appellant began his employment with the Board as a Media Technician in August 1973, and was later promoted to the position of Media Production Specialist. He was discharged by the Board on September 30,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">On November 6, 1998, Norville, then <em>pro se, </em>filed a complaint against the Board with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \u201cEEOC\u201d). He said, in part: \u201cMy statement concerns Anne Arundel Co. Public Schools.... My immediate supervisor is Don Cramer, production and Design Super.\u201d Norville claimed that he \u201cwas discriminated against in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, because of my age, 48, with respect to discipline, and discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">In the affidavit Norville submitted with his complaint, he averred that he \u201cwas not given a satisfactory reason for the disciplinary action.\u201d Appellant added: \u201cI was informed that I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>was being discharged because of budgetary reason [sic].\u201d Norville also averred that, on or about June 24, 1998, he received \u201ca disciplinary action\u201d from Cramer, asserting that he was \u201cinsubordinate\u201d because he \u201crefused to allow\u201d his wife to operate a school vehicle to transport photographic equipment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, appellant claimed that, on September 30, 1998, he was \u201cforced to retire....\u201d Norville recalled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\">I went on vacation on June 29, 1998 for two weeks. Upon my return from vacation a letter was sent to me informing me that they had received the fy99 budget which reduced the number of positions in our department. I was informed that I had to apply for the two positions when they were posted. In my department they [sic] were other specialists: (1) Jenifer Corwin, age mid-20\u2019s, Lori Berdequez, age late 30\u2019s, and Joe Thompson, age late 30\u2019s, Steve Greg, age late 30\u2019s, and myself. 1 was not selected for the positions, but they retained their position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">On September 16, 1998, I received a letter informing me that I was not selected for the position. And I was offered a demeaning position as Teacher Assistant retaining my salary for one year or forced retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\"><em>On September 30, 1998, I was forced to retire from my position. </em>I was the only person I am aware of that was forced to retire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\"><em>I believe this happened to me because of my age, 1/.8, and my salary </em>\u2014 $53,000 yearly plus benefits. All of my coworkers are being paid at a lesser rate than I. The school system would save a lot of money in their budget.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The EEOC forwarded a copy of the complaint to the Maryland Commission on Human Relations (the \u201cMCHR\u201d or the \u201cCommission\u201d). In a letter dated December 22, 1998, the Commission notified appellant of its receipt of the EEOC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>complaint, which it considered as \u201cfiled with the [MCHR] as of the date it was filed with EEOC.\u201d Further, the Commission advised that, pursuant to a \u201cWorksharing Agreement\u201d between the EEOC and the Commission, the EEOC would investigate the matter in order \u201cto avoid duplication of effort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">After the EEOC completed its investigation, it sent a \u201cDismissal and Notice of Rights\u201d letter to Norville, dated December 21, 1998, advising that it was \u201cclosing its file\u201d because it was \u201cunable to conclude that the information obtained establishes violations of the statutes.\u201d However, the EEOC added: \u201cThis does not certify that the respondent is in compliance with the statutes. No finding is made as to any other issues that might be construed as having been raised by this charge.\u201d The EEOC also informed appellant of his \u201cright to sue\u201d under federal law, in either federal or state court, \u201cwithin 90 days\u201d of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">On March 17, 1999, appellant served notice on the Anne Arundel County Solicitor of an age discrimination claim. He did not specifically refer either to the Local Government Tort Claims Act, Maryland Code (2002 Repl. Yol.), \u00a7 5-304 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d), or the Maryland Tort Claims Act, Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12YL01 through \u00a7 12-110 of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The next day, March 18, 1999, Norville filed suit against appellees in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, which he later amended on June 2, 1999. <em>See Norville v. Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>No. MJG99764, 1999 WL 1267696. The Amended Complaint contained claims for compensatory and punitive damages based on six grounds: violation of the ADEA; violation of Art. 49B, \u00a7 16(a); unjust enrichment; quantum meruit; wrongful discharge; and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Among other things, Norville alleged that Cramer deliberately harassed him in an effort to fabricate a record of unsatisfactory performance by appellant, even though appellant\u2019s perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>anee was exemplary. He also claimed that his position was awarded to a person under the age of 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Appellees moved to dismiss the action or, alternatively, for summary judgment. On November 23, 1999, the federal court (Garbis, J.) issued a Memorandum and Order in which it dismissed the ADEA claim against Cramer, with prejudice, and dismissed the remaining claims against Cramer, without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In dismissing the ADEA claim against Cramer, the district court noted that appellant\u2019s failure to name Cramer in his EEOC complaint constituted a \u201cprocedural bar\u201d to the claim against Cramer in his individual capacity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, it agreed with Cramer that, even if he had been properly named in the EEOC complaint, the ADEA does not authorize personal liability against a supervisory employee who discharges an employee. Rather, the ADEA prohibits an <em>employer </em>from discriminating based on age. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 630(b) (defining \u201cemployer\u201d); <em>Birkbeck v. Marvel Lighting Corp., </em>30 F.3d 507 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In contrast to its ruling as to Cramer, the court stayed the claims against the Board to await the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>157 F.3d 908 (11th Cir.1998), <em>cert. granted, </em>525 U.S. 1121, 119 S.Ct. 901, 142 L.Ed.2d 901 (1999). In January 2000, the Supreme Court decided <em>Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>528 U.S. 62, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000). Thereafter, in reliance on <em>Kimel, </em>the district court dismissed the federal claims against the Board, with prejudice, by Order dated February 20, 2001. The court also dismissed the remaining State claims against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the Board, without prejudice. In doing so, the court observed: \u201cIt appears that Rule 2 \u2014 101(b) of the Maryland Rules of Procedure would be applicable! ] with regard to the state law claims over which this Court declines to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Accordingly, on March 21, 2001, appellant filed suit against appellees in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, alleging age discrimination in violation of Art. 49B, \u00a7 16(a); unjust enrichment; quantum meruit; common law wrongful discharge; and intentional infliction of emotional distress. After appellees moved to dismiss, the court held a hearing on September 24, 2001. Thereafter, on November 1, 2001, the court (Lerner, J.) entered an Order dismissing, with prejudice, the unjust enrichment and quantum meruit claims (Counts II, III). The remaining claims were also dismissed, but with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Norville then filed an Amended Complaint on November 26, 2001, consisting of eight counts (i.e., four identical claims against each defendant), for which he sought compensatory and punitive damages of $1,000,000 each and other relief. In particular, he alleged violations of the ADEA (Counts I and V); violations of Article 49B, \u00a7 16(a) (Counts II and VI); wrongful discharge (Counts III and VIII); and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Counts IV and VIII).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>On December 6, 2001, appellees moved to dismiss the \u201ccompensatory damage claims in Counts I and V and punitive damage claims in Counts I-VIII of the Amended Complaint.\u201d As to Norville\u2019s claim for damages under the ADEA, appellees asserted that \u201cthe ADEA contains no specific authorization for awarding compensatory damages for pain and suffering,\u201d and noted that \u201ccourts are unanimous in holding that damages for pain and suffering or emotional distress are not recoverable under the ADEA.\u201d Appellees also asserted that, \u201cby its terms,\u201d the ADEA \u201cdoes not expressly provide for an award of punitive damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Then, on December 13, 2001, appellees moved to dismiss Counts II and VI, as well as Counts III, IV, VII, and VIII of the Amended Complaint. They advanced numerous grounds to support their motion, including sovereign immunity, preemption by \u201cstate and federal statutory authorities,\u201d and failure to \u201cadequately plead a cause of action for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d In addition, appellees argued that Article 49B of the Maryland Code does not provide for a private right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">At the motions hearing on April 9, 2002, appellees\u2019 counsel stated: \u201c[0]ne of the reasons we are bringing this motion ... is to boil this case down to what it really is. <em>In our opinion, it is a federal ADEA </em>case.... <em>[I]t should go forunrd solely as that.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Further, appellees\u2019 attorney asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">The motion really raises six issues. And the first issue is the private right of action under Article 49[B] of the Maryland Code, which is essentially the state equivalent of Title 7 in the Age Discrimination Act. And the cases that we cited ... stand for the proposition that the only party that has standing to bring a cause of action under 49[B] is the Maryland Commission on Human Relations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">And we have cited numerous Fourth Circuit, as well as Maryland state court cases, which essentially say that the only person that could bring a cause of action would be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>state agency and that a private individual cannot bring an action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\">To some extent, this statute is cumulative and duplicative of ... the ADEA Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. <em>Clearly, we don\u2019t dispute the fact that the plaintiff can sue the [B]oard under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. </em>So 49[B] is really duplicative, and we think it should be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Appellees\u2019 counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">My position is, at least as to Article 49[B], the only person [sic] can then bring suit is the Maryland commission. What happened in this case is he filed a claim, or what is called a charge of discrimination, with the EEOC and the Maryland commission. And they treat that as the initial filing of an administrative claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">They investigate it. And either agency has the authority to bring suit themselves. The EEOC does under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. And the Maryland commission under 49[B] also has that right. In this case, they investigated the case and found no violation of the Age Discrimination Act and basically gave him what is called a right to sue notice. And that right to sue notice then allows him to go into federal court or state court under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the federal statute, to sue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">It is our position that if you read 49[B], and if you read the entire statute, the only person that can move under that particular statute is the Maryland commission. And as I have said earlier, <em>we have no argument with his right to file suit under the federal statute. And he can file suit in federal court or state court.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">But for purposes of at least the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Maryland commission is the one who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>has the jurisdiction, sole jurisdiction, to be the proper plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Ruling from the bench, the court (North, J.) dismissed both claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, because appellant did not plead \u201csevere\u201d or \u201cextreme or outrageous conduct.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order dated May 17, 2002, disposing of the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">In its Order, the court granted the motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s claim under Article 49B, \u00a7 16(a) (Counts II and VI), and his common law wrongful discharge claim (Counts III and VII). The court also dismissed the ADEA claim against Cramer (Count V).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">In its Memorandum Opinion, the court noted that appellees had not sought to dismiss the ADEA claim against the Board (Count I). As to the ADEA claim against Cramer (Count V), the court dismissed it for the same reasons previously articulated by the federal court. The circuit court said: \u201cCramer asserts that the Court should dismiss Count V, because he was not named in the administrative complaint filed with the EEOC and individual liability is not available under the ADEA. This Court agrees.\u201d The court added: \u201cEven if Cramer had been named at the EEOC level, individual liability, as opposed to employer liability, is not permitted for delegable personnel decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">With respect to the claims under Art. 49B, \u00a7 16(a) (Counts II and VI), the court concluded that the statute did not create a private right of action. Therefore, the court determined that the Commission was appellant\u2019s sole recourse to address an alleged violation of Article 49B. Concerning appellant\u2019s common law wrongful discharge claims (Counts III and VII), the court stated that \u201ca wrongful discharge claim may not lie\u201d because the \u201cstatutory remedies provided by Article 49B and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the ADEA preempt any common law wrongful discharge claim.\u201d Citing <em>Makovi v. Sherwin-Williams </em>Co., 316 Md. 603, 561 A.2d 179 (1989), and <em>Insignia Residential Corp. v. Ashton, </em>359 Md. 560, 755 A.2d 1080 (2000), the court added: \u201c[I]f the legislature has provided the vehicle by which a plaintiff may remedy a specific employment wrongdoing as an exception to the terminable at-will rule, an abusive discharge claim may not be brought.\u201d The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">Two statutes specifically address the problem of age discrimination: Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 14-18 and the ADEA. Thus, a judicially created abusive discharge claim to remedy age discrimination is neither permitted or necessary under the holding in <em>Makovi. </em>Norville has alleged only an age discrimination suit. The ADEA and Art. 49B provide his only possible remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Further, the court determined that it need not address appellees\u2019 arguments regarding sovereign immunity and qualified immunity. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s ADEA claim against the Board was then his only surviving claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">On December 24, 2002, the Board filed a \u201cPreliminary Motion,\u201d asking the circuit court to \u201crule that sovereign/governmental immunity bars Plaintiffs ADEA claim\u201d against it. The Board claimed that it is a State agency and, therefore, it enjoys constitutional immunity from suit under the ADEA, in both State and federal court, pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">According to appellant, the Board\u2019s motion represented \u201ca complete reversal\u201d of the Board\u2019s earlier \u201clegal position.\u201d Moreover, appellant argued that immunity under the Eleventh Amendment extends only to suits brought in federal court. In addition, Norville insisted that the Board is not a State agency, and thus it is not entitled to sovereign immunity or the protection of the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">At the hearing on May 1, 2003, the Board argued that \u201cit is well established,\u201d both in federal and State court, \u201cthat the local board[s] of education are state agencies for purposes of sovereign immunity.\u201d The Board added: \u201cState immunity or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>sovereign immunity applies not only to the state government, but it applies to state agencies.\u201d It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-4\">The second issue that we have addressed in our brief is the issue of can the state assert sovereign immunity in a federal ADEA claim in state court. We have cited in section two of our brief several Supreme Court cases. And I think it is fair to say that there has been a major revolution in this area of the law recently: The Kimmell [sic] case, the Seminole case, Seminole Tribe case, and particularly the Alden case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">And in 1999 the Supreme Court in Alden held that the powers delegated to Congress under Article 1 of the United States Constitution do not include the power to subject non-consenting states to private suits for damages in the state court. So what I think what the Supreme Court was saying is that, clearly, when a claimant comes in to state court to assert rights under federal law, particularly employment law, such as the Fair Labors [sic] Standard [sic] Act or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, clearly the state can impose sovereign immunity both in the federal court under Article 11, as well as traditional notions of sovereign immunity in state court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Appellant disagreed, claiming that the Board is a \u201cquasi-agency\u201d and, under Article 19 of the Maryland Constitution, appellant is entitled to seek redress of a constitutional tort. With regard to whether the Board is a local or State agency, Norville\u2019s lawyer said it did not \u201cmake[ ] a lot of difference ....\u201d; he maintained that, at the very least, the Legislature waived sovereign immunity up to $100,000. Claiming that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply in State court, appellant asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">I think that this is \u2014 this is a constitutional tort, if anything. And it does have a statutory basis. But that statutory basis says in the federal statute that that gives jurisdiction to state and federal courts to hear these types of discriminations. And the reason they got out of it in the federal court was because of the Supreme Court came through with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Kimmell [sic] decision, saying ... you can\u2019t sue state agencies in a federal court because of the Eleventh Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The court agreed with the Board. By Order of May 14, 2003, the court (Davis-Loomis, J.) granted summary judgment to the Board as to Count I, stating: \u201c[T]he Eleventh Amendment' bars suit against the [Board] on the basis of the [ADEA].... \u201d In its Memorandum Opinion of the same date, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As\">States are immune under the Eleventh Amendment from suit in federal court under the ADEA. <em>Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, </em>528 U.S. 62, 91[, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522] (2000). The county boards of education in Maryland are state entities that can assert Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit in federal court under the ADEA. <em>See Barnes v. Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>Civil No. L-99-1608[, 2000 WL 979108], 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10695, at *2 (D.Md. July 14, 2000) (stating that \u201c[i]t is well-established that Maryland county school boards are state entities for Eleventh Amendment purposes. Defendant Anne Arundel County Board of Education is thus immune from suit in federal court under the ADEA.\u201d); <em>Jones v. Frederick County Bd. of Educ., </em>689 F.Supp. 535, 538 (D.Md.1988) (stating \u25a0that \u201c[t]he Frederick County Board of Education is an agent of the State entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.\u201d). In the instant case, Plaintiff\u2019s ADEA claim was dismissed in federal court on the basis of the Board\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">Maryland law provides county boards of education with the power to sue and be sued.

Vol.). \u201c[T]he state\u2019s partial waiver of the county boards\u2019 sovereign immunity does not constitute a waiver of their constitutional immunity from suit in federal court under the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>689 F.Supp. at 538 (citing <em>Florida Dept. of Health &amp; Rehabilitative </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>Servs. v.

The Supreme Court in <em>Alden v. Maine, </em>527 U.S. 706[, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636] (1999), clearly held that \u201cthe States retain immunity from private suit in their own courts\u201d as well as in the federal courts. <em>Alden, </em>527 U.S. at 754[, 119 S.Ct. 2240]. In making his argument, Plaintiff fails to address <em>Alden </em>and instead cites to federal appeals court cases from 1986 and 1946.... It is apparent to this Court that <em>Alden </em>controls this issue. <em>The Maryland Court of Appeals has also recognized that where the State enjoys Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity from suit in federal court,, it enjoys the same immunity in state court. See Robinson v. Bunch, </em>367 Md. 432, 439[, 788 A.2d 636] (2002) (stating that \u201cit is clear that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alden v. Maine, </em>527 U.S. 706[, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636], requires that we overrule the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that the plaintiffs are entitled to maintain this action under the remedial provisions of the [Fair Labor Standards Act] invoked by the plaintiffs. The <em>Alden </em>case made it clear that the FLSA could not constitutionally authorize an action such as the one here involved.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Alden </em>made it quite clear that where a State has immunity in the federal courts from an action based on federal law, it enjoys the same immunity in the state courts. <em>Alden, </em>527 U.S. at 754[, 119 S.Ct. 2240]. Even though Maryland has partially waived the sovereign immunity of the county boards of education, it has not waived their Eleventh Amendment constitutional immunity to suit under the ADEA. Clearly, a private plaintiff cannot bring a cause of action based on the ADEA against a county board of education in a Maryland state court. (E .22-23)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">Plaintiff also argues that there is a dispute of material fact as to whether the Board is a state or a county agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>It is clear to this Court that no such dispute exits. <em>The Court of Appeals has conclusively determined that the county boards of education are state agencies. Montgomery County Educ. Assn. v. Board of Educ. of Montgomery County, </em>311 Md. 303, 317[, 534 A.2d 980] (1987); <em>McCarthy v. Board of Educ. of Anne Arundel County, </em>280 Md. 634, 650[, 374 A.2d 1135] (1977). As such, <em>the county boards of education may assert Eleventh Amendment immunity as agencies of the state.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">The Eleventh Amendment protects the States from suit unless they have explicitly waived their immunity. Maryland has clearly not waived its immunity from suits brought under the ADEA, and this immunity applies to private actions brought against its agencies in both federal and state courts. Accordingly, the Anne Arundel County Board of Education has a constitutional immunity to suits brought in state court under the ADEA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">A. <em>The Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Appellant contends that the circuit court violated his rights under Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> by erroneously ruling that he cannot sue the Board for violations of the ADEA, Art. 49B, or for the common law tort of wrongful discharge. Asserting that he has a property interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>in his job, appellant complains that he has been deprived of his day in court and has been denied \u201cany remedy.\u201d He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">Having had his EEOC complaint dismissed without any hearing or administrative ruling on the merits, having had his federal complaint dismissed without a hearing on the merits, and having had every count in his state complaint dismissed over the course of three separate motion hearings before three separate circuit court judges spread out over two years, Norville\u2019s age discrimination claim was thus fully dismissed without <em>ever receiving any hearing on the merits at any state of the litigation </em>\u2014 leaving him with no remedy, either common law or statutory, for being discriminated against on the basis of his age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Further, appellant argues that, under both federal and State law, there is a \u201cclear statutory policy against age discrimination in the workplace.\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1); Art. 49B, \u00a7 16(a)(1). He notes that Maryland also recognizes the common law tort of wrongful discharge \u201c \u2018when the motivation for discharge [contravenes some] clear mandate of public policy.\u2019 <em>Adler v. American Standard, Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 47[, 432 A.2d 464] (1981).\u201d Thus, appellant contends that the court \u201cerred when it held that Norville\u2019s common law count of Wrongful Discharge against the Board was preempted by both federal and state statutory remedy, while at the same time the Court denied any statutory remedy to Nor-ville.\u201d Indeed, Norville maintains that the circuit court\u2019s ruling \u201cflies in the face of the clear statutory policy against age discrimination contained in both State and federal law....\u201d He explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">This ruling would suggest to all county school boards throughout Maryland that they are free to discriminate against their any [sic] employee over the age of 40 on the basis of age, for the Circuit Court has held that there is no statutory or common law remedy available to State employees over the age of 40, victimized by age discrimination in the workplace. This ruling nullifies Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Appellant also contends that the circuit court erred when it ruled that the Board is a State agency for purposes of sovereign immunity, and that the Eleventh Amendment bars an ADEA claim against the Board. Insisting that the Board is a county agency, Norville argues that \u201cthe Board cannot avail itself of sovereign immunity.\u201d But, \u201c[e]ven if the Board is a state agency,\u201d Norville contends that the State has partially waived its immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In addition, Norville complains that, at the hearing in April 2002, the Board repeatedly conceded that he could bring suit under the ADEA in State court. Yet, despite those representations, in May 2003 the Board articulated what appellant characterizes as \u201ca stunning display of reversal of legal position,\u201d and \u201cdiametrically contradicted its own concession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Appellant also maintains that the court \u201cerred when it held that there is no private cause of action under Article 49B, \u00a7 16, and consequently dismissed Norville\u2019s 49B count.\u201d Further, he complains about the dismissal of his wrongful discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">In response, the Board argues that it is well settled in Maryland that county boards of education are State agencies, and thus they are protected from suit by sovereign immunity and Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence. The Board also claims that the Legislature has not waived sovereign immunity as to the ADEA claims, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">A review of Section 5-518, Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, and Section 4-105, Education Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, reveals no such specific waiver of ADEA claims. In fact, both statutes are a narrow waiver of sovereign immunity; their focus is on traditional tort claims; these statutes do not address federal statutory actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak\">Additionally, the Board maintains that appellant has no private right of action under Article 49B of the Maryland Code. It states: \u201cArticle 49B itself creates a specific procedure and remedy for the redress of any alleged wrongs. <em>Parlato v. Abbott Labs., </em>850 F.2d 203, 205 (4th Cir.1988). Article 49B empowers only MCHR to initiate litigation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Moreover, the Board claims that the statutory remedies under Article 49B and the ADEA preempt any common law claim for wrongful discharge, stating: \u201cMaryland courts do not recognize a cause of action for wrongful discharge (or abusive discharge) when a separate statutory remedy exists that provides an exception to the terminable employment at will doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The Board also argues that Norville does not have a viable Article 19 claim, because he did \u201cnot plead a cause of action under either Article 19 or 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.\u201d The Board notes: \u201cMr. Norville has cited no ADEA case authority to support an Article 19 claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We shall discuss these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">B. STATE OR MUNICIPAL AGENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Appellant\u2019s ADEA claim is based on 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623. It provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u00a7 623. Prohibition of age discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"At\">(a) Employer practices</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">It shall be unlawful for an employer\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age;</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s age; or ...</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">(f) Lawful practices; age an occupational qualification; other reasonable factors; laws of foreign workplace; seniority system; employee benefit plans; discharge or discipline for good cause</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">It shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency, or labor organization\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>(1) to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section where age is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business, or where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age, or where such practices involve an employee in a workplace in a foreign country, and compliance with such subsections would cause such employer, or a corporation controlled by such employer, to violate the laws of the country in which such workplace is located;....</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The circuit court found that the Board is a State agency. Therefore, it concluded that appellant\u2019s ADEA claim against the Board was barred by the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution and the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The Eleventh Amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In reaching its decision, the circuit court relied on <em>Kimel, supra, </em>528 U.S. 62, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522. There, the Supreme Court considered the Eleventh Amendment and sovereign immunity in regard to a private suit against a state to recover damages under the ADEA. It determined that, in enacting the ADEA, Congress \u201cdid not validly abrogate the States\u2019 sovereign immunity to suits by private individuals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 120 S.Ct. 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Appellant challenges the underlying premise of the circuit court\u2019s decision. He vigorously maintains that the Board is not an \u201carm of the state,\u201d and thus the Board is not protected from suit, either by the Eleventh Amendment or sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Arguing that county school boards are the product of the Legislature, the Board disagrees with Norville. As it recognizes, Md. Code (1978, 2004 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 8-103 of the Education Article (\u201cEd.\u201d) creates a board of education for each county, \u201cwith limited authority to control educational matters that affect the county.\u201d <em>Chesapeake Charter, Inc. v. Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>358 Md. 129, 135-36, 747 A.2d 625 (2000). Although the Board concedes that, \u201cin terms of their composition, jurisdiction, funding, and focus,\u201d the local school boards \u201chave a local flavor,\u201d it notes that the Court of Appeals has consistently regarded county school boards as State entities, rather than local agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The question of whether the Board is a State or local entity is central because, with regard to the ADEA claim, the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not apply to a county agency; it applies only to the State and its instrumentalities. \u201c[T]he powers delegated to Congress under Article I of the United States Constitution do not include the power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits for damages in state courts.\u201d <em>Alden v. Maine, </em>527 U.S. 706, 712, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999). Rather, \u201c[i]n exercising its Article I powers Congress may subject the States to private suits in their own courts only if there is \u2018compelling evidence\u2019 that the States were required to surrender this power to Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>pursuant to the constitutional design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730, 119 S.Ct. 2240 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">As we noted, the court below relied, in part, on the Eleventh Amendment. In <em>Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp., </em>513 U.S. 30, 115 S.Ct. 394, 130 L.Ed.2d 245 (1994), the Supreme Court explained that the Eleventh Amendment \u201clargely shields States from suit in federal court without their consent, leaving parties with claims against a State to present them, if the State permits, in the State\u2019s own tribunals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 115 S.Ct. 394. Similarly, the Court of Appeals recently said: \u201cIt was settled over a hundred years ago that the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution\u201d provides a state with immunity to claims arising under federal law and asserted by a citizen of that state in federal court.\u201d <em>Maryland Military Dept v. Cherry, </em>382 Md. 117, 122, 854 A.2d 1200 (2004). Thus, Congress has no authority to abrogate a state\u2019s sovereign immunity in federal or state court, although a state may consent to suit. <em>Alden, </em>527 U.S. at 748, 752, 754-55, 119 S.Ct. 2240.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u201c \u2018The [Eleventh] Amendment is rooted in a recognition that the States, although a union, maintain certain attributes of sovereignty, including sovereign immunity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hess, </em>513 U.S. at 39, 115 S.Ct. 394 (citation omitted). The Amendment was adopted for \u201ctwin reasons\u201d: 1) \u201cthe States\u2019 fears that \u2018federal courts would force them to pay their Revolutionary War debts, leading to their financial ruin,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(citation omitted), and 2) \u201cthe integrity retained by each State in our federal system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201cimpetus for the Eleventh Amendment\u201d was \u201cthe prevention of federal-court judgments that must be paid out of a State\u2019s treasury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 115 S.Ct. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u25a0 [3] Notably, constitutional sovereign immunity \u201cderives not from the Eleventh Amendment but from the structure of the original Constitution itself.\u201d <em>Alden, </em>527 U.S. at 728, 119 S.Ct. 2240; <em>see Idaho v.

The <em>Alden </em>Court acknowledged, 527 U.S. at 713, 119 S.Ct. 2240, that the Supreme Court has \u201csometimes referred to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>States\u2019 immunity from suit as \u2018Eleventh Amendment immunity,\u2019 \u201d but that phrase, while \u201cconvenient shorthand,\u201d is also something of a misnomer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is because \u201cthe sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, \u201cthe States\u2019 immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution, and which they retain today....\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the <em>Alden </em>Court said, \u201cThe Eleventh Amendment confirmed, rather than established, sovereign immunity as a constitutional principle^]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728-29. Thus, the parameters of constitutional sovereign immunity for the states and its instrumentalities are determined \u201cby fundamental postulates implicit in the constitutional design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729, 119 S.Ct. 2240. <em>See Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n v. South Carolina State Ports Auth., </em>535 U.S. 743, 753, 122 S.Ct. 1864, 152 L.Ed.2d 962 (2002) (\u201c[T]he Eleventh Amendment does not define the scope of the States\u2019 sovereign immunity; it is but one particular exemplification of that immunity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u201c[S'jovereign immunity is rooted in the common law and \u2018is firmly embedded in the law of Maryland.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stern v.

Thus, the Court of Appeals has \u201cheld, consistently, that immunity from suit is \u2018one of the highest attributes of sovereignty,\u2019 and that any waiver of that immunity must come from the Legislature.\u201d <em>Sharafeldin, </em>382 Md. at 140, 854 A.2d 1208 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">While \u201c[t]he bar of the Eleventh Amendment to suit in federal courts extends to States and state officials,\u201d it \u201cdoes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>not extend to counties and similar municipal corporations.\u201d <em>Mt.

Only the states themselves, or a state agency or instrumentality that functions as an \u201carm of the State,\u201d is entitled to invoke sovereign immunity or the immunity afforded by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Regents of the Univ. of California v.

Therefore, the state/loeal conundrum requires careful scrutiny; we must determine whether the Board is an arm or instrumentality of the State, entitled to the protections of sovereign immunity, or, instead, is to be treated as a county agency, to which sovereign immunity does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The federal cases suggest several factors that are pertinent to the analysis of whether a particular entity is regarded as an arm of the state.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Paramount among them is the so called \u201cState treasury\u201d factor, i.e., whether an adverse judgment against the entity would be paid from the State\u2019s treasury. The three \u201cadditional factors\u201d are: \u201c(1) the degree of control that the State exercises over the entity or the degree of autonomy from the State that the entity enjoys; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the scope of the entity\u2019s concerns \u2014 whether local or statewide \u2014 with which the entity is involved; and (3) the manner in which State law treats the entity.\u201d <em>Cash v. Granville County Bd. of Educ., </em>242 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The Supreme Court observed in <em>Hess, supra, </em>513 U.S. at 48, 115 S.Ct. 394, that the \u201cvulnerability of the State\u2019s purse\u201d is the \u201cmost salient factor in Eleventh Amendment determinations.\u201d It noted that, when a state is not obligated to bear and pay the judgment of a public entity, \u201cthe Eleventh Amendment\u2019s core concern is not implicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 115 S.Ct. 394. Similarly, the Fourth Circuit said in <em>Cash, </em>242 F.3d at 223: \u201cThe principal factor, upon which courts have virtually always relied, is whether a judgment against the governmental entity would have to be paid from the State\u2019s treasury.\u201d <em>See Alkire v.

The <em>Cash </em>court said that, \u201cif the State treasury will be called upon to pay a judgment against a governmental entity, then Eleventh Amendment immunity applies to that entity, and consideration of any other factor becomes unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223. Conversely, it determined that \u201ca finding that the State treasury will not be affected by a judgment against the governmental entity weighs against finding that entity immune.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224. In that circumstance, the court considers whether the three \u201csovereign dignity\u201d factors, identified above, compel a contrary conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The Fourth Circuit analyzed various statutory provisions pertinent to the matter of the autonomy of the county school boards. <em>Id. </em>at 225-26. In particular, it noted that local school boards may purchase liability insurance to satisfy judgments against them; may retain private counsel without seeking permission from the state\u2019s Attorney General; are \u201c \u2018unit[s] of local government\u2019 authorized to enter into interlocal cooperative agreements\u201d; and may declare bankruptcy under federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 225. Moreover, it pointed out that the members of school boards are locally elected, and it is the local board that enforces the statewide rules for teacher certification and curriculum. <em>Id. </em>at 225-26. Accordingly, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the county board \u201cappears much more akin to a county in North Carolina than to an arm of the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226. In its view, \u201cany judgment rendered against a local school board would not ... affront the dignity of the State.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>In contrast to <em>Cash, </em>we are mindful that, historically, the Court of Appeals has almost always regarded local school boards as agencies of the State.

In <em>Lewis v. Bd. of Educ. of Talbot County, </em>262 F.Supp.2d 608 (D.Md. 2003), for example, a former employee of the Talbot County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Board of Education brought suit against the board and its agents for breach of contract, wrongful discharge, promissory estoppel, and violations of federal and state constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 610. The defendants asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that they were protected from suit by sovereign immunity, pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 612. The federal court concluded that the Board was entitled to immunity with respect to all claims, because it is an arm of the state. <em>Id. </em>at 612-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">In its analysis, the court considered the factors discussed in <em>Cash </em>to determine whether suit against the school board \u201cessentially constitutes suit against the <em>state....\u201d Id. </em>at 613. Although the court noted that \u201cthe scope of concern\u201d of the Talbot County School Board \u201cis more local than statewide,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 613, and acknowledged that this \u201cfactor tilts slightly against a finding of sovereign immunity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 614, the court was satisfied that it was \u201coutweighed by the other factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Among other things, the court observed that \u201cMaryland law, through statute and judicial opinion, treats the county school boards as agents of the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 613:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">The Talbot County School Board is less autonomous than the board at issue in <em>Cash </em>in many respects. Among other things, the Talbot County Board\u2019s members are appointed by the Governor of Maryland, not locally elected. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Educ. \u00a7 3-108. In Maryland, the Board may buy, sell, and hold property only with the approval of the State Superintendent. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 4-115. Each new school established by the Talbot County Board becomes a \u201cpart of the State program of public education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4-109. The Board\u2019s employment and teacher certification practices are more closely regulated in Maryland than those of the boards in North Carolina. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 6-202 &amp; 4-205(e) (the state, through the State Board of Education, is the ultimate judge of the validity of dismissals for both professional and non-professional employees); Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A \u00a7 07.02.01 (state controls form of contract for certificated employees); Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A \u00a7\u00a7 12, <em>et </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>seq. </em>(state defines and enforces teacher certification requirements). While both boards exercise some budgetary discretion, the Talbot County board must submit to an annual audit conducted by the state. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Educ. \u00a7 5-113. Moreover, the State of Maryland retains the power to reconstitute and oversee the operation of schools that do not meet state standards for student performance. <em>See </em>Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A \u00a7 01.04.08. The Talbot County School Board does not operate with the same degree of autonomy as do the school boards of North Carolina.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Similarly, in <em>Biggs v. Bd. of Educ. of Cecil County, </em>229 F.Supp.2d 437 (D.Md.2002), the plaintiffs, parents of an epileptic daughter, sought monetary damages on her behalf under the Americans with Disabilities Act. <em>Id. </em>at 438-39. They argued that the Board of Education of Cecil County was not entitled to invoke the protection of the Eleventh Amendment because it is not an instrumentality of the State. <em>Id. </em>at 443. The federal court disagreed, concluding that the board is a state agency for the purpose of Eleventh Amendment analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 444. Relying, <em>inter alia, </em>on <em>Chesapeake Charter, Inc. v. Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>358 Md. 129, 747 A.2d 625 (2000), the court said: \u201cMaryland law consistently and repeatedly has treated local school boards as agencies of the state.\u201d 229 F.Supp.2d at 444 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The <em>Biggs </em>court explicitly addressed the criteria articulated by the Fourth Circuit in <em>Cash, supra, </em>242 F.3d 219, and determined that the local board met those criteria and was immune from suit. It stated, 229 F.Supp.2d at 444:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">The Court concludes that the Board is a state agency for the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment. First, the State of Maryland exercises a great degree of control over Maryland county school boards. Senior Judge Joseph H. Young of this Court noted in <em>Jones </em>[v. <em>Frederick County Bd. of Educ., </em>689 F.Supp. 535, 537-38 (1988)] that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">Maryland law creates the county boards of education and governs their composition and membership.... The county boards must obtain the state\u2019s approval regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>establishment of schools, acquisition or disposition of property, construction or renovation of buildings, and curriculum. The state appropriates substantial funds to support the county boards. In return, the county boards must acquiesce to an annual audit and submit an annual budget to the state....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><em>See also Adams v. Calvert County Pub. Schs., </em>201 F.Supp.2d 516, 521 (D.Md.2002) (recognizing that \u201c[b]oth state and federal courts in Maryland ... have \u2018consistently held that the county boards of education are agencies of the state\u2019 and that \u2018the Maryland statute clearly supports this conclusion.\u2019 \u201d) (internal citations omitted); <em>Rosenfeld v. Montgomery County Pub. Schs., </em>41 F.Supp.2d 581, 586 (D.Md.1999) (concluding, in race discrimination case against the Montgomery County Board of Education and others, that suit was barred by the Eleventh Amendment because the school board is a State entity, and finding, under Maryland law, that Ed. \u00a7 4-105(a) does not constitute a waiver for claims less than $100,000, because the State did not explicitly consent to suit); <em>Jones v. Frederick County Bd. of Educ., </em>689 F.Supp. 535, 538 (D.Md. 1988) (concluding that Frederick County Board of Education \u201cis an agent of the State of Maryland entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">County boards of education in Maryland seem to have a \u201cpeculiar hybrid nature,\u201d with attributes of both State and county government. <em>Dean v. Bd. of Educ. of Cecil County, </em>71 Md.App. 92, 98, 523 A.2d 1059, <em>cert. denied, </em>310 Md. 490, 530 A.2d 272 (1987). Here, the Board operates 108 elementary, middle, and high schools, with nearly 75,000 students. And, for fiscal year 2003, it had an operating budget of over 633 million dollars.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While we are tempted simply to parrot what the cases cited above have said as to the arm of the State status of county school boards, the importance of the issue warrants a more careful analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Tt is helpful to begin with a review of the legislative scheme governing public education in Maryland. The General Assembly has crafted a statutory scheme that confers broad authority upon the State Board of Education as well as local school boards. At the same time, it imposes limitations upon the respective powers of the local boards and the State Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">County schools systems are funded partly by the State and partly by the individual counties. <em>Hornbeck, supra, </em>295 Md. at 604, 458 A.2d 758. The jurisdiction of \u201ceach county school system\u201d is coextensive with the \u201cgeographical boundary of the county.\u201d Ed. \u00a7 3-102. Each county board is an independent \u201ccorporate body,\u201d with the right to \u201csue and be sued.\u201d Ed. \u00a7 3-104 (emphasis omitted). Moreover, the purpose of the county boards is generally local. <em>See </em>Ed. \u00a7 4-101(a) and (b) (stating that \u201c[ejducational matters that affect the counties shall be under the control of a county board of education in each county,\u201d with authority to \u201cseek in every way to promote the interests of the schools under its jurisdiction\u201d). Pursuant to Ed. \u00a7 4-108(3), county school boards \u201cdetermine, with the advice of the county superintendent, the educational policies of the county school system,\u201d subject to State law and applicable bylaws, rules, and regulations of the State Board of Education. However, county school boards must comply with State requirements regarding certification of teachers (Ed. \u00a7 6-201) and curriculum (Ed. \u00a7 4-111).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">County boards have the power to hold property, Ed. \u00a7 4-114, and to condemn property without State approval. Ed. \u00a7 4-119. In addition, a county school board may consolidate schools, Ed. \u00a7 4-120, and enter into cooperative agreements for the joint administration of programs. Ed. \u00a7 4-123.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They also enjoy considerable latitude in budgetary matters. Ed. \u00a7\u00a7 5-102, 5-103. But, the State retains supervisory control over local development of school property. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>county boards may purchase real property, build and remodel school buildings, and select land for school sites, they may only do so with the approval of the State Superintendent of Schools.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Ed. \u00a7\u00a7 2 \u2014 303(f), 4-115, 4-116.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Notably, county school boards are entrusted with considerable control over matters of personnel.

Indeed, the Board is represented here by the County Attorney\u2019s Office, not the Maryland Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Maryland has a mixed system for choosing members of its county boards of education; the boards of about half of Maryland\u2019s counties are locally elected. <em>See </em>Ed. \u00a7 3-114.

Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>358 Md. 129, 747 A.2d 625 (2000). That case suggests to us that, under very limited circumstances, a county board of education in Maryland is to be treated as a local agency rather than as an arm of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Chesapeake Charter, Inc. </em>involved \u201ca procurement dispute\u201d between three school bus contractors and the Anne Arundel County Board of Education. <em>Id. </em>at 131, 747 A.2d 625. The Court had to determine \u201cwhether the procurement of services by a county board of education is subject to [the State\u2019s] General Procurement Law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the Court answered in the negative, we do not construe the opinion as a harbinger of change in regard to state arm analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">In that case, the bus contractors protested the school board\u2019s solicitation of bids for student transportation routes. When their protest was denied, they filed an appeal with the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals (\u201cMSBCA\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 132-33, 747 A.2d 625. The purchasing officer was of the view that the county board was not subject to the State\u2019s procurement law or the jurisdiction of the MSBCA. <em>Id. </em>at 133, 747 A.2d 625. She noted that county school boards are \u201cauthorized to enter into procurement contracts, pursuant to their own procedures, subject to administrative review by the State Board of Education----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132, 747 A.2d 625. After the State Board of Education intervened as an interested party, both the Anne Arundel County Board and the State Board moved to dismiss the contractors\u2019 appeal, claiming that the MSBCA had no jurisdiction to consider the protest because the County Board was not subject to the State\u2019s procurement law. <em>Id. </em>at 133, 747 A.2d 625. The MSBCA dismissed the appeal, concluding \u201cthat, although county boards of education may be State agencies for some purposes, they are not units in the Executive Branch of the State Government for purposes of the General Procurement Law and are therefore not subject to that law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Following the circuit court\u2019s affirmance, the Court of Appeals was tasked with deciding whether the Anne Arundel County School Board was subject to the State\u2019s General Procurement Law. Relying on earlier decisions of the Court of Appeals holding that county school boards are State agencies, rather than county agencies, the contractors argued that the board was subject to State procurement law. The County School Board, joined by the State Board of Education, claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>that the County Board was <em>not </em>subject to the State\u2019s General Procurement Law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The Court noted that Maryland Code (2001 Repl.

Moreover, the MSBCA is vested with jurisdiction to hear appeals from the \u201cfinal action of a unit\u201d concerning a protest relating to a procurement contract. SFP \u00a7 15-211. While recognizing that the award of a bus transportation contract by a county school board is an \u201cexpenditure\u201d under a procurement contract, <em>id. </em>at 134, 747 A.2d 625, the Court reasoned that whether the school board is subject to the General Procurement Law and MSBCA jurisdiction \u201chinges on whether a county school board is \u2018a unit\u2019 within the meaning of that law.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The Court recognized that, \u201cin terms of their composition, jurisdiction, funding, and focus,\u201d county school boards \u201cclearly have a local flavor, [yet] the county school boards have consistently been regarded as State, rather than county, agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136, 747 A.2d 625. The Court elaborated, <em>id. </em>at 135-36, 747 A.2d 625:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">County school boards are creatures of the General Assembly. Section 3-103 of the Education Article (ED) cre- ' ates such a board for each county, with limited authority to control educational matters that affect the county. <em>See </em>ED \u00a7 4-101. In 13 counties, the members of the board are elected by the voters of the county (\u00a7 3-114); in Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>City, the members of the board, other than a student member, are appointed jointly by the Governor and the Mayor of Baltimore (\u00a7 3-108.1); in the other counties, the members are appointed by the Governor from among the residents of the county (\u00a7 3-108). The county school systems are funded in part by the State and in part by the counties. <em>Hornbeck v. Somerset Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 597, 458 A.2d 758 (1983).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Of significance here, the Court elucidated the underlying rationale delineating county boards as state agencies. Tt said, <em>id. </em>at 136-37, 747 A.2d 625:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">County school boards are considered generally to be State agencies because (1) the public school system in Maryland is a comprehensive State-wide system, created by the General Assembly in conformance with the mandate in Article VIII, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution to establish throughout the State a thorough and efficient system of free public schools, (2) the county boards were created by the General Assembly as an integral part of that State system, (3) their mission is therefore to carry out a State, not a county, function, and (4) they are subject to extensive supervision by the State Board of Education in virtually every aspect of their operations that affects educational policy or the administration of the public schools in the county.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Notably, the Court carved out a particular area in which a local board is not deemed an agency of the State. It said: \u201cAlthough legally State agencies for those reasons, they are not normally regarded, for structural or budgetary purposes, as units within the Executive Branch of the State government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 747 A.2d 625. It added: \u201cThis becomes evident when we examine the place of county school boards in the structure and governance of public education in Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 747 A.2d 625. The Court explained, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6\">In carrying out the mandate of Article VIII, \u00a7 1 [of the State Constitution], the Legislature created a deliberate and well-defined balance between State government structures and State-based but predominantly local structures. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>State government structure for primary and secondary education is the State Department of Education, created by ED \u00a7 2-101 \u201cas a principal department of the State government.\u201d The Department consists of (1) the State Board of Education, which is the head of the Department (\u00a7 2-102) and is vested with ultimate supervisory authority for determining educational policy in Maryland and administering the public school system, (2) the State Superintendent of Schools, who is a member of the Governor\u2019s Executive Council (\u00a7 2 \u2014 303(d)) and serves, in essence, as the chief executive officer of the Department, and (3) the other professional, administrative, and clerical employees employed by the Department, who are State government employees for budgetary and personnel purposes. <em>See </em>FY 2000 Maryland State Budget, Part II at 283, showing 1,344 authorized positions for the State Department of Education and an appropriation of nearly $67 million to pay those employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Further, the Court stated, <em>id. </em>at 137-38, 747 A.2d 625:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">The authority of the State Board of Education, codified in part in ED \u00a7 2-205, has been described as \u201ca visitatorial power of the most comprehensive character,\u201d one that is \u201cin its nature, summary and exclusive.\u201d <em>Wiley v. Allegany County School Comm\u2019rs, </em>51 Md. 401, 405-06 (1879); <em>Zantzinger v. Manning, </em>123 Md. 169, 178, 90 A. 839, 842 (1914); <em>Wilson v. Board of Education, </em>234 Md. 561, 565, 200 A.2d 67, 69 (1964). It includes (1) determining the primary and secondary educational policies of the State, (2) explaining the true intent and meaning, causing to be carried out, and deciding all controversies and disputes arising under the provisions of the Education Article that are within its jurisdiction/<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) adopting by-laws, having the force of law, for the administration of the public schools, (4) through the State Superintendent of Schools, exercising general control and supervision over the public schools and educational interests of the State, (5) preparing the annual State public school budget, including appropriations for State aid to the counties for current expenses, student transportation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>public school construction, and (6) specifying the information each county board is required to record and the form in which it is to be recorded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Also, the Court observed that the General Assembly has created for each county a county department of education \u201cthat, in structure, generally mirrors that of the State Department of Education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138, 747 A.2d 625. It explained, <em>id. </em>at 138-39, 747 A.2d 625:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">The county school board is the head of the county department and is responsible for administering, in the county, the supervening State policy determined by the State Board of Education, in accordance with State Board\u2019s directives.1-J <em>See </em>ED \u00a7 4-108. There is, as well, a county superintendent, who is the executive officer of the county board and, in essence, the chief executive officer of the county department. <em>Finally, there are the teachers, principals, and other professional, administrative, clerical, security, transportation, and maintenance staff hired by the county </em>school board to work in or service the schools in the county. Unlike the situation at the State level, <em>the county superintendent and the employees of the county department of education are appointed, and their salaries are set by the county school board upon recommendation of the county superintendent, \u00a7 j-i 03(a), in accordance with a personnel system established by the county board.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">As we indicated, <em>the State currently provides a,pproximately 12% of the current operating revenues of the county boards. </em>Most of those funds are appropriated by the General Assembly to the State Department of Education for pass-through to the county boards, either in conformance with the basic current expense sharing formula set forth in ED \u00a7 5-202 or pursuant to other State aid provisions in title 5 of that article r ].... <em>None of the major appropriations for operating expenses are made directly by the General Assembly to the county boards. The county boards </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>prepare and submit their annual budgets to the respective county governments which, subject to certain limitations and requirements, have ultimate approval power over them. See </em>ED \u00a7\u00a7 5-102 and 5-103; 76 Op. Atty. Gen. 181, 184 (1991). The State Department of Education, the Governor, and the General Assembly are not directly involved in the budget process for the county boards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\">What this statutory scheme reveals is that, although the county boards are generally regarded as State agencies because they are part of the State public education system, are subject to extensive supervision and control by the State Board of Education, and exercise a State function, from a budgetary and structural perspective, they are local in character. They are not divisions of or units within the State Department of Education. They are subject to the county, not the State, budget process and must justify their budget requests to the county government. <em>Most of their operational funding comes from the county, not the State, government. When these factors are taken into account, it is clear that the general characterization of county boards of education as State agencies does not require a finding that they are entities \u201cin the Executive Branch of the State government\u201d for purposes of SFP \u00a7 ll-101(x). </em>At the very least, there is an ambiguity as to whether the term \u201cunit,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 ll-101(x), applies to them. That ambiguity requires that we look further, beyond the precise language of \u00a7 ll-101(x), to determine legislative intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 139-40, 747 A.2d 625 (italics and boldface added).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">After reviewing the history of the General Procurement Law and the Education Article to glean legislative intent, the Court concluded that a county school board is not a \u201cunit\u201d under State procurement law. <em>Id. </em>at 145-46, 747 A.2d 625. It said, <em>id. </em>at 143-44, 747 A.2d 625:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">Both the history of the 1980 law and the experience under it reveal a number of things relevant to the issue before us. The Legislature was aware that procurement of supplies and services by county school boards was governed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>provisions in the Education Article and that such procurement had never been subject to control by the Board of Public Works or the Department of General Services. It was aware, by contrast, that school construction projects <em>\u2022were </em>subject to some Board of Public Works control, mostly in terms of which projects and costs the State would fund. The Legislature had before it the basic policy issue of whether to include under the new procurement law procurement by agencies that had not previously been subject to Board of Public Works and Department of General Services jurisdiction, including agencies that were considered to be State agencies but that were predominantly local in character. Some agencies, or types of procurement, it chose to include; others it chose to exclude. <em>See </em>SFP, \u00a7\u00a7 11-101(x)(2) and 11-203. In Section 24 of the 1980 enactment, the Legislature declared that all laws that were inconsistent with the new procurement law were superseded to the extent of the inconsistency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">In making these choices, the General Assembly left intact, without change, the procurement provisions in the Education Article. That alone indicates an intent to allow the county school boards to continue to operate under those provisions and not subject them to an entirely new regime of substantive and procedural requirements. Of at least equal significance is the fact that most of those provisions have since been amended, demonstrating clearly a legislative recognition that they were not superseded by the 1980 law.tJ</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">The Court added:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">In the 19 years since the General Procurement Law went into effect, no effort has been made to subject the procurement of supplies and services by county school boards to that law. To the best of our knowledge, with the limited exception noted for school construction, none of the State control agencies \u2014 neither the Board of Public Works nor the Departments of Budget and Management or General Services \u2014 have ever attempted to exercise jurisdiction over procurement contracts entered into by the county school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>boards. Throughout that period, those contracts have been regarded as local matters, subject to supervision on the State level by the State Board of Education. The State Board of Education has, indeed, entertained appeals from non-school construction procurement decisions made by the county school boards, including decisions regarding school bus contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\"><em>We find no basis, upon this analysis, to conclude that the Legislature ever intended to subject procurement by a county school board to the General Procurement Law. It is inconceivable that the General Assembly would have made such a dramatic shift in policy without some clearer indication of its intent to do </em>so.cl <em>We hold, therefore, that a county school board is not a \u201cunit\u201d within the meaning of that law, and, accordingly, that MSBCA has no jurisdiction over disputes arising from procurement decisions made by those boards.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 144-146, 747 A.2d 625 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In reaching its conclusion, the Court recognized that \u201c[t]he effects of subjecting county school board procurement to the General Procurement Law are not inconsequential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145 n. 7, 747 A.2d 625. It explained, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">Major changes in contract terms and procedure would be required; new duties would be cast upon the Board of Public Works and the Departments of General Services and Budget and Management; and new and expanded jurisdiction would be vested in MSBCA. Apart from these administrative or logistical consequences, subjection of county school board procurement to the General Procurement Law might well put the Board of Public Works, the Department of Budget and Management, and MSBCA in the middle of disputes over textbook and instructional material selection, which the Legislature could not possibly have intended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">As we read <em>Chesapeake Charter, </em>the Court left virtually intact the principle that county school boards are ordinarily agencies of the State. The Court recognized only a limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>exception with respect to budgetary matters and procurement. If <em>Chesapeake Charter </em>were meant to signal a sea change in regard to a matter of longstanding public policy, we believe the Court would have clearly made that known.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">To be sure, numerous federal courts have considered the status of local boards of education and have concluded that they are <em>not </em>arms of the state and thus are not entitled to immunity from suit under the federal Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Mt.

It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">\u00a7 17A.

In our view, the plain language of the statute indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>that the Board may not raise the defense of sovereign immunity in regard to <em>any claim, </em>of $100,000 or less.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">In <em>Alden, supra, </em>527 U.S. at 712, 119 S.Ct. 2240, the Supreme Court determined that while FLSA purports to authorize private actions against states in their own courts, \u201cpowers delegated to Congress under Article 1 of the United States Constitution do not include the power to subject non-consenting States to private suits for damages in state courts.\u201d Moreover, the <em>Alden </em>Court held that \u201cthe States retain immunity from private suit in their own courts, an immunity beyond the congressional power to abrogate by Article I legislation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754, 119 S.Ct. 2240. On the other hand, the Court recognized that \u201csovereign immunity bars suits only in the absence of consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755, 119 S.Ct. 2240.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Similarly, in <em>Kimel, supra, </em>528 U.S. 62, 120 S.Ct. 681, 145 L.Ed.2d 522, the Supreme Court made clear that a litigant cannot bring suit against a state, pursuant to the ADEA, in either federal or state court, unless the State has expressly waived its sovereign immunity with regard to the ADEA. It said: \u201cThe ADEA\u2019s purported abrogation of the States\u2019 sovereign immunity is accordingly invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 120 S.Ct. 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In <em>Robinson v. Bunch, </em>367 Md. 432, 788 A.2d 636 (2002), the Court of Appeals relied on <em>Alden </em>in deciding whether employees and a former employee of the Division of Parole and Probation (part of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services) had a viable claim against the Secretary of the Department for monetary damages based on allegations that they were not paid for overtime work, in violation, <em>inter alia, </em>of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cthe FLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 through 219. <em>Id. </em>at 434, 788 A.2d 636. The Secretary moved to dismiss the suit, claiming that, based on sovereign immunity, the federal causes of action were barred, and \u201cthat Congress had no authority to abrogate that immunity by authorizing suits of this nature against a state official in state courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436-37, 788 A.2d 636. The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss. This Court reversed, holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that the FLSA preempted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Maryland statutory administrative and judicial remedy provided in Md. Code (1993, 1997 Repl. VoL), \u00a7 12-402 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (\u201cSPP\u201d). <em>See Bunch v. Robinson, </em>122 Md.App. 437, 461-62, 712 A.2d 585 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari </em>to determine whether Congress had the power to abrogate a state\u2019s sovereign immunity with regard to suits under FLSA filed in state court. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>367 Md. at 438, 788 A.2d 636 (citing to <em>Robinson v. Bunch, </em>351 Md. 285, 718 A.2d 234 (1998)). However, the Court stayed the appeal pending the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Alden, supra, </em>527 U.S. 706, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636. After the Supreme Court decided <em>Alden, </em>the Secretary moved to reverse this Court\u2019s decision. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>367 Md. at 438, 788 A.2d 636. Instead, the Court amended its <em>certiorari </em>order. It said, <em>id. </em>at 434, 788 A.2d 636:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">[T]he dispositive issues are whether Maryland law provides a remedy or remedies for adjudication of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and, if so, whether the present action was an authorized remedy. We shall hold that Maryland law does provide a statutory administrative and judicial review remedy for adjudication of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and that the remedy is exclusive. We shall further hold that, because the present lawsuit is not encompassed by the exclusive statutory administrative and judicial review remedy, the Circuit Court correctly dismissed the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">According to the Court, \u201c[t]he <em>Alden </em>case made it clear that the FLSA could not constitutionally authorize an action such as the one here involved. At the same time, however, the Supreme Court made it clear in <em>Alden </em>that <em>state law </em>could authorize such actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439, 788 A.2d 636 (internal citation omitted). The Court assumed that the overtime provisions of FLSA were applicable to the employees, and proceeded to consider whether any State law gave them a remedy for the alleged violations of FLSA and State law. <em>Id. </em>at 442-43, 788 A.2d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>The Court examined SPP \u00a7 8-302, which provides that State employees are eligible for overtime compensation provided in that subtitle or, to the extent applicable, as required by the FLSA. The Court also considered Subtitle 14 of SPP, which waives the State\u2019s sovereign immunity for claims filed pursuant to SPP \u00a7 8-302. <em>Id. </em>at 442-43, 788 A.2d 636. The Court of Appeals held, however, that the State did not waive sovereign immunity with respect to direct judicial actions against the State under the FSLA. <em>Id. </em>at 446, 788 A.2d 636. Rather, the employees had to pursue their claims through administrative grievance procedures, which constituted their exclusive remedy. The Court explained, <em>id. </em>at 439, 788 A.2d 636:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\">[l]t is clear that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alden v. Maine, supra, 527 </em>U.S. 706, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636, requires that we overrule the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that the plaintiffs are entitled to maintain this action under remedial provisions of the FLSA invoked by the plaintiffs. The <em>Alden </em>case made it clear that the FLSA could not constitutionally authorize an action such as the one here involved. At the same time, however, the Supreme Court made it clear in <em>Alden, 527 </em>U.S. at 755, 119 S.Ct. at 2267, 144 L.Ed.2d at 678-79, that <em>state law </em>could authorize such actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">The Court said, <em>id. </em>at 443, 788 A.2d 636:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">The above-reviewed statutory provisions make it clear that covered state employees are entitled to overtime compensation in accordance with applicable state law or the FLSA, whichever is greater, that there is a duty on the part of the State or the appropriate officials to make such payments or provide for them through the budget process, and that sovereign immunity is not a defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The Court observed that, \u201cif the General Assembly had not enacted a specific statutory remedy, state employees would certainly have a common law remedy in Maryland courts to enforce their rights to mandated overtime compensation under state or federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 788 A.2d 636. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u201c \u2018Article 19 [of the Maryland Declaration of Rights] insures that rights belonging to Marylanders are \u201cnot illegally or arbitrarily denied by the government.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Nevertheless, the Court recognized that the Legislature \u201cestablished a statutory administrative and judicial review remedy for state employees who claim that they have not been compensated in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, 788 A.2d 636. In the Court\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he language of [S.P.P.] \u00a7 12-103 evidences the General Assembly\u2019s intent that the administrative and judicial review grievance procedure constitutes the exclusive remedy for claims such as those made by the plaintiffs-respondents in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, 788 A.2d 636. Therefore, it concluded that \u201cthe Legislature intended to preclude direct judicial actions such'as the present one.\u201d <em>Id. See also Md. Military Dep\u2019t., </em>382 Md. at 128-29, 854 A.2d 1200; <em>Utilities v. WSSC, </em>362 Md. 37, 45, 763 A.2d 129 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">To be sure, \u201c[t]he doctrine of sovereign immunity ... precludes such a damages action [for wrongful discharge] against the \u2018State of Maryland\u2019 absent legislation consenting to suit.\u201d <em>Ritchie v. Donnelly, </em>324 Md. 344, 369, 597 A.2d 432 (1991). Moreover, \u201c \u2018[a] waiver of sovereign immunity is to be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lizzi v. WMATA, </em>156 Md.App. 1, 9, 845 A.2d 60 (2003) (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t. of the Army v.

To do so, we rely on well settled principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">.  The interpretation of a statute is a judicial function. <em>Muhl v. Magan, </em>313 Md. 462, 481-82, 545 A.2d 1321 (1988).

Moreover, we may not \u201cmodify an unambiguous statute by adding or removing words to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature chose to use, nor \u2018engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Facon v.

To effectuate the legislative intent, we may also consider \u201c \u2018the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chesapeake Charter, Inc., supra, </em>358 Md. at 135, 747 A.2d 625 (citation omitted).

RTKL Assocs., </em>380 Md. 670, 678, 846 A.2d 433 (2004). For example, we may look to legislative history, the statutory purpose, and the \u201crelative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 846 A.2d 433; <em>see Sharafeldin, supra, </em>382 Md. at 138, 854 A.2d 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">With this understanding of the principles of statutory construction, we turn to consider the parties\u2019 contentions. Under the settled approach to statutory interpretation, the words \u201cany claim\u201d cannot reasonably be read to exclude certain categories of claims. The plain and unambiguous meaning of the statutory text is that the Board cannot assert sovereign immunity as a defense to \u201cany\u201d claim under $100,000, including those based on age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">In this case, the circuit court found that Maryland has \u201cpartially waived the sovereign immunity of the county boards of education.\u201d Yet, it also concluded that it did not waive \u201cconstitutional immunity to suit under the ADEA.\u201d Accordingly, the court held that \u201ca private plaintiff cannot bring a cause of action based on the ADEA against a County board of education in a Maryland state court.\u201d In adopting this view, we believe that the trial court erred. We agree with Norville that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of C.J. \u00a7 5-518 conflicts with the plain meaning of the statute.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, we shall remand appellants\u2019 ADEA claim for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">D. <em>Article 49B</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Next, we must determine whether appellant has a private right of action under the Fair Employment Practices Act, codified in Article 49B of the Maryland Code. The Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>prohibits termination of employment for discriminatory reasons. Section 14 of the Act articulates the State\u2019s policy as to discrimination. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\">\u00a7 14. Declaration of policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">It is hereby declared to be the policy of the State of Maryland, in the exercise of its police power for the protection of the public safety, public health and general welfare, for the maintenance of business and good government and for the promotion of the State\u2019s trade, commerce and manufacturers to assure all persons equal opportunity in receiving employment and in all labor management-union relations regardless of race, color, religion, ancestry or national origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, or disability unrelated in nature and extent so as to reasonably preclude the performance of the employment, and to that end to prohibit discrimination in employment by any person, group, labor organization, organization or any employer or his agents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Article 49B includes a specific procedure and remedy for the redress of any alleged wrongs. <em>See Parlato v. Abbott Labs., </em>850 F.2d 203, 205 (4th Cir.1988). The statute authorizes the MCHR to initiate litigation. Specifically, sections 11 and 12 of Article 49B describe the procedure and relief available to a litigant under Article 49B. Section 12 states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">\u00a7 12. Enforcement of Commission\u2019s orders; complaint maliciously made; right to bring civil action not denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">(a) If any respondent refuses to comply with an order of the Commission made within the scope of any of these subtitles, <em>the Commission may, represented by its general counsel, institute litigation in the appropriate equity court of the county or in Baltimore City where the alleged discrimination took place to enforce compliance with any of the provisions of this article.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">The court, in hearing said case, shall be governed by the judicial review standards as set forth in the Administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Procedure Act, Title 10, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Section 16 of the Act makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate based on age and other criteria. It states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u00a7 16. Unlawful employment practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">(a) <em>Failure to hire or discharge; reduced status. </em>\u2014 It <em>shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer: </em>(1) To fail or refuse to hire or <em>to discharge any individual, </em>or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to the individual\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <em>because of such individual\u2019s </em>race, color, religion, sex, <em>age, </em>national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, genetic information, or disability unrelated in nature and extent so as to reasonably preclude the performance of the employment, or because of the individual\u2019s refusal to submit to a genetic test or make available the results of a genetic test;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">In Article 49B, \u00a7 16 the Legislature authorizes the MCHR to provide an avenue of relief to aggrieved persons. As the Court of Appeals said in <em>Makovi v. Sherwin-Williams Co., </em>316 Md. 603, 607-08, 561 A.2d 179 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">Like its federal counterpart, the original version of the Maryland statute declared discriminatory employment practices to be unlawful. <em>See </em>Art. 49B, \u00a7 16. It provided for limited enforcement through an administrative agency, now the Human Relations Commission (HRC) (then entitled \u201cInterracial Commission\u201d). In 1965 enforcement of Art. 49B did not include any monetary relief. <em>See Gutwein v. Easton Publishing Co., </em>272 Md. 563, 325 A.2d 740 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 991, 95 S.Ct. 1427, 43 L.Ed.2d 673 (1975). Power to award back pay of up to two years in connection with an order of reinstatement or hiring was conferred on the HRC by Ch. 937 of the Acts of 1977. <em>See </em>Art. 49B, \u00a7 11(e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>We are satisfied, however, that Article 49B does not provide a private right of action under the circumstances attendant here. <em>See Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v.

Williams, </em>381 Md. 378, 403-04 n. 22, 849 A.2d 504 (2004), the Court recognized that the \u201cviability\u201d of a private cause of action for discrimination \u201cmay find some support by analogy in <em>Molesworth v. Brandon, </em>341 Md. 621, 637, 672 A.2d 608, 616 (1996).\u201d In <em>Molesworth, </em>a female veterinarian brought a common law wrongful discharge claim based on an allegation of sex discrimination. <em>Molesworth, </em>341 Md. at 626, 672 A.2d 608. She could not proceed under the Act, however, because her employer had fewer than fifteen employees, and the statute expressly excludes from coverage any employer who has less than fifteen employees. <em>Id. </em>at 628, 672 A.2d 608. Nevertheless, the Court recognized that \u201cArt. 49B, \u00a7 14 provides a clear statement of public policy sufficient to support a common law cause of action for wrongful discharge against an employer exempted by Art. 49B, \u00a7 15(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637, 672 A.2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Here, the Board, as the employer, has more than fifteen employees. Therefore, the rationale of <em>Molesworth, </em>permitting a private common law cause of action for wrongful discharge, does not apply. <em>See Makovi, supra, </em>316 Md. at 608, 561 A.2d 179; <em>Jordan v.

Mascari II, Inc., </em>374 Md. 402, 426-27, 823 A.2d 590 (2003), elucidates the point. There, the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>When there is no remedy provided by a statute ... the absence of the remedy may justify vindication for violation of the public policy through a [common law] wrongful discharge action. In <em>Molesworth v. Brandon, </em>341 Md. 621, 628, 672 A.2d 608, 612 (1996), we considered the provisions of the Maryland Fair Employment Practices Act (\u201cFEPA\u201d) and held that Md. Code (1957, 1986 Repl. Vol), Art. 49B, \u00a7 14 provided a sufficiently clear statement of public policy with respect to <em>all </em>employers who discriminate based on sex, despite explicit limitations on the scope of coverage of the statute. That employers of less than fifteen employees were exempted specifically from the administrative adjudicatory <em>process </em>outlined in FEPA for allegations of misconduct did not mean that such employers were exempted from the <em>policies </em>established by the Act for purposes of the wrongful discharge tort. <em>Id. </em>We therefore held that Art. 49B, \u00a7 14 provided a clear statement of public policy sufficient to support a common law cause of action for wrongful discharge against an employer otherwise excluded from the reach of FEPA\u2019s administrative process. 341 Md. at 637, 672 A.2d at 616.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Accordingly, to assert a claim under Art. 49B, appellant had to proceed by way of the MCHR. Appellant exhausted his administrative remedies with the EEOC/MCHR and filed his complaint in the federal district court, pursuant to EEOC\u2019s advisement in its \u201cright to sue\u201d letter. However, appellant has no private right of action under Article 49B. Therefore, the court did not err in dismissing that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">E. WRONGFUL DISCHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"ABi\">Appellant contends: \u201cAt the very least, if Norville\u2019s injury cannot be vindicated by the ADEA remedies because of sovereign immunity, or by the 49B remedies because there is no private cause of action, Norville should be allowed to proceed with a common law wrongful discharge remedy. Otherwise, his Article 19 guarantee to a remedy would be nullified.\u201d In response, the Board maintains that appellant\u2019s claim for wrongful discharge was properly dismissed because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>availability of both federal and State statutory remedies, which preempt any common law claims of wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">In Maryland, with few exceptions, at-will employment has been held to be terminable by either party at any time for any reason whatsoever. <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 35, 432 A.2d 464 (1981) (citing <em>St. Comm\u2019n on Human Rel. v. Amecom Div., </em>278 Md. 120, 360 A.2d 1 (1976), <em>Vincent v. Palmer, </em>179 Md. 365, 19 A.2d 183 (1941), and <em>Washington, Baltimore &amp; Annapolis R.R. Co. v. Moss, </em>127 Md. 12, 96 A. 273 (1915)). Although the common law at-will rule has not been abrogated, statutory exceptions have been \u201cengrafted\u201d that limit the previously unfettered discretion to discharge at-will employees. <em>Adler, </em>291 Md. at 35, 432 A.2d 464; Gil A. Abramson &amp; Stephen M. Silvestri, <em>Recognition of a Cause of Action for Abusive Discharge in Maryland, </em>10 U. Balt. L. Rev. 257, 259-62 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In <em>Adler, supra, </em>291 Md. 31, 432 A.2d 464, the Court of Appeals recognized the common law tort of wrongful discharge, constituting in this State the first judicially created exception to the at-will doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 47, 432 A.2d 464. The Court reviewed the evolving case law from other jurisdictions, noting that the overwhelming majority that adopted the cause of action defined it as a tort in which the employee may recover damages arising from the employee\u2019s discharge under circumstances violating a clear mandate of public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 35-41, 432 A.2d 464. The \u201cpublic policy\u201d could derive from statute, judicial decision, administrative regulation, or from any other appropriate source. <em>Id. </em>at 45, 432 A.2d 464. In deciding whether a policy will support a cause of action, however, the touchstone must be clarity. <em>Id. </em>at 42-43, 432 A.2d 464. The Court determined that the public policy in question was not sufficiently clear to support the particular claim at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 43-47, 432 A.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In the wake of <em>Adler, </em>the focus of many wrongful discharge cases has been the clarity of the public policy at issue. For example, in <em>Kern v. S. Balt. Gen. Hosp., </em>66 Md.App. 441, 504 A.2d 1154 (1986), an employee discharged for absenteeism due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>to a work-related injury alleged that the statutory policy underlying the Workman\u2019s Compensation Act applied to her discharge. This Court reviewed the statutory policy, which expressly precludes discharge \u201csolely\u201d because the employee has filed a claim under the Workman\u2019s Compensation Act. <em>Id. </em>at 446-47, 504 A.2d 1154 (citing Art. 101, \u00a7 39A (1985)). From the language of the statute, we concluded that the policy did not contain a sufficiently clear mandate regarding discharges that were not \u201csolely\u201d due to a filed claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">In this case, the circuit court found <em>Makovi, supra, </em>316 Md. at 603, 561 A.2d 179, instructive in its analysis of appellant\u2019s wrongful discharge claim. In that case, the plaintiff filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging sex discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 605, 561 A.2d 179. But, the EEOC did not find reasonable cause for the claim and notified the complainant of her right to file suit under Title VII. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the complainant chose to file a wrongful discharge claim in circuit court against her employer, a corporation not statutorily exempt, claiming sex discrimination based on her discharge from employment during pregnancy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The Court of Appeals limited the availability of the common law wrongful discharge action. It held that a claim of common law wrongful discharge, by its nature as a purely supplemental remedy, was not available to the plaintiff, because the Act set forth its own remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 609, 561 A.2d 179. Essentially, the Court concluded that, as the tort is supplementary and not complementary, it is only available where it provides relief that does not overlap an already extant remedy; only where a clear- mandate of public policy would otherwise be left unvindicated is the common law tort available. <em>Id. </em>at 611-12, 561 A.2d 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Observing that Art. 49B authorized individuals to file complaints with the Maryland Commission on Human Relations (the \u201cHRC\u201d), and empowered the HRC to investigate and remedy acts of employment discrimination, the Court declined to extend the common law tort of wrongful discharge to discriminatory employment practices covered by the enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ment mechanisms in the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 621-26, 561 A.2d 179. <em>See generally </em>Comment, <em>Torts </em>\u2014 Wrongful <em>Discharge </em>\u2014 Maryland <em>Limits The Scope Of The Wrongful Discharge Tori Where Statutory Civil Remedies Are Available, </em>20 U. Balt.' L. Rev. 290 (1990). The Court said, <em>id. </em>at 626, 561 A.2d 179:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">In cases of discharge motivated by employment discrimination prohibited by Title VII and Art. 49B the statutes create both the right, by way of an exception to the terminable at-will doctrine, and remedies for enforcing that exception. Thus, the generally accepted reason for recognizing the tort, that of vindicating an otherwise civilly unremedied public policy violation, does not apply. Further, allowing full tort damages to be claimed in the name of vindicating the statutory public policy goals upsets the balance between right and remedy struck by the Legislature in establishing the very policy relied upon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Here, the Board is within the purview of the Act. And, appellant was provided with an administrative remedy by way of Article 49B. Because appellant had a statutory remedy available to him, he cannot pursue a common law wrongful discharge claim. <em>Compare Molesworth, supra, </em>341 Md. at 637, 672 A.2d 608 (recognizing common law claim for wrongful discharge based on sex discrimination because, due to size of employer, Art. 49B did not apply). Accordingly, we shall affirm the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s common law wrongful discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS; COSTS TO BE PAID 50% BY APPELLANT, 50% BY THE ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-12\">.
