A hearing was held on that same date and on November 3, 2003, the Department filed its first amended child in need of assistance (CINA) petition. On November 14, 2003, the maternal grandparents filed a motion to intervene, which was subsequently granted by the court on December 10, 2003. On December 9, 2003, the Department filed its second amended CINA petition and four hearings ensued on January 28, 29, and 30, as well as on February 2, 2004. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Savage, J.) found both children CINA.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Shirah A. was subsequently born on April 14, 2004 to appellant mother and was immediately placed in the care of the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services (Department) by Child Protective Services. The Department filed a child in need of assistance (CINA) petition on April 15, 2004. A hearing was conducted on May 13, 2004 and the circuit court (Boynton, J.) found Shirah a CINA. We have consolidated appellant\u2019s two timely appeals where she presents one question for our review, which we rephrase as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">1. Did the circuit court err in adjudicating Nathaniel, Madeline, and Shirah CINA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">We answer in the negative. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">FACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Officer Darley of the Montgomery County Police Department\u2019s Family Crimes Division testified that on the night of October 18, 2003, after he was informed of a report of a child abuse incident, he proceeded to the Shady Grove Hospital. He subsequently interviewed appellant and she explained that on October 17, 2003, her son, Nathaniel, had been \u201cacting up\u201d and decided to go to bed in the clothes he wore that day. During the night, she changed his soiled pants; Nathaniel refused to use the toilet and was generally uncooperative. When she grabbed and pulled his left arm by the wrist, he began to cry. Appellant consequently applied Bengay to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>child\u2019s arm, gave him Children\u2019s Tylenol, and sent him to bed. Appellant told Officer Darley that Nathaniel complained of arm pain the following day and she decided to take him to Night Time Pediatrics, which referred her to Shady Grove Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">After admitting to Officer Darley that she had initially told the doctors that Nathaniel had been hurt at the playground, she admitted that she had caused the injury. Officer Darley explained that appellant told him when she pulled on Nathaniel\u2019s arm and fractured it, it was out of frustration and anger due to a difficult day. Appellant apologized for her actions and explained that she had lost her temper.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Jennifer Knotts, of the Department, testified that she interviewed appellant at the hospital. Appellant stated to Knotts that Nathaniel was being difficult and she pulled on him to stop him from moving so she could change his pants. She also explained to Knotts that her son had acid reflux problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Dr. Julian Orenstein, the treating physician at the hospital, stated that Nathaniel told him that appellant \u201cgrabbed his arm, twisted, then crack.\u201d Dr. Orenstein revealed that the x-ray of Nathaniel\u2019s arm showed a transverse fracture of the humorous bone, and this type of injury could only result from a \u201chigh degree of force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Department caseworker Sandra Lopez testified that appellant had described Nathaniel\u2019s acid reflux issues, as well as prior medical problems to her. She explained that the father\u2019s whereabouts were unclear and at best, his contact with the children was \u201con-and-off.\u201d Lopez asserted that appellant was exceptionally concerned with the health of Nathaniel and relayed to her that he had a history of vomiting, stomach problems, and was lactose intolerant. Lopez testified that Nathaniel appeared to be a \u201chealthy\u201d child and appellant acted overly concerned with his medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Dr. Muriel Wolfe of the Children\u2019s Hospital testified that she examined Nathaniel and Madeline on March 13, 2003; appellant complained that he had been vomiting. Dr. Wolfe described Nathaniel\u2019s numerous doctor visits and noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>appellant continually insisted on further referrals. Dr. Wolfe concluded that Nathaniel had no serious condition and saw him for a follow-up visit one month later. At some point in 2003, Dr. Wolfe stated that appellant urged her to declare that Nathaniel\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d qualified her for \u201cSSI\u201d benefits, but she declined to accept the doctor\u2019s advice. Dr. Wolfe concluded that Nathaniel was in general good health, although an endoscopy revealed a slight irritation of the esophagus. She also expressed her concern that she felt appellant exaggerated Nathaniel\u2019s condition and was exceptionally worried about Nathaniel\u2019s health. Appellant complained to Dr. Wolfe that Madeline had crooked legs and, although Dr. Wolfe doubted this assertion, she referred Madeline to an orthopedist due to appellant\u2019s insistence.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Esther Herman, a therapist in Rockville, Maryland, testified that she met appellant and her children in August 2003 when Madeline was referred to her for speech therapy. Appellant also brought Nathaniel in the hopes of having Herman assist in rectifying his health and behavioral issues. Herman noted that Nathaniel had been in treatment for his behavioral problems since October 2003 and she believed appellant was consumed with his purported health problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Pediatrician Dr. Allison Jackson testified that she reviewed Nathaniel\u2019s and Madeline\u2019s medical file and stated that Nathaniel had been subjected to numerous medical visits, diagnoses, and various treatments for his health issues. She testified about his prior behavioral and health problems and asserted that the symptoms of which appellant complained concerning Nathaniel did not match the ultimate diagnoses. Dr. Jackson concluded that Nathaniel\u2019s medical treatment was \u201cexcessive,\u201d and consequently, \u201cabusive.\u201d Although she noted that appellant did not invent symptoms for Nathaniel, Dr. Jackson stated that Nathaniel was \u201cat risk\u201d because of the fractured arm incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Psychiatrist Dr. Joanne Brant testified that Nathaniel had thirty-seven doctor visits in twenty-seven months and they generally related to Nathaniel\u2019s feeding problems, vomiting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>sensory food aversion, dependency on a bottle and milk, and inability to calm himself. Dr. Brant concluded that appellant was likely an overanxious parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Both maternal grandparents testified that Nathaniel and Madeline were currently living in their homes and were of general good health and doing well. The circuit court engaged in an in-depth review of the CINA petition line by line and declared which facts were sustained, using the preponderance of the evidence standard, and, based on the testimony, which facts it did not believe had been established. She found that appellant fractured Nathaniel\u2019s arm when she pulled on it out of frustration and anger and his numerous doctor visits and treatments disclosed no serious medical conditions. The hearing judge explicitly credited the statements that the injury was non-accidental. She also credited the testimony of Officer Darley and Knotts that appellant stated her anger and frustration led to the incident. The circuit court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIl\">There were and are significant issues that this mother faces in her own life that have had huge influences on her children ... What I can find by a preponderance of the evidence is that Nathaniel was in fact abused and injured by virtue of the arm fracture. I also find by a preponderance of the evidence that he was subjected to unnecessary and excessive medical interventions, which amount legally to abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">But the picture of the mother that was so vivid in my mind or is so vivid in my mind, call it what you will, it\u2019s someone that is I guess obsessed in a way, and I don\u2019t mean that in a clinical way, with health concerns. And the health concerns of the children. In a way that is detrimental to them. And that\u2019s the key.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">Of course, we want parents to be worried about their children\u2019s health. But when it comes to visits in the numbers of 40s, 44 visits. And after all of that, what you come out with is mild esophagitis and treat with Prevacid. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>mean I shutter to think what this child was subjected to over and over and over again. Sort of seeking another opinion, wanting something to be wrong. And endoscopy, which is a very invasive procedure. The trips to an allergist , which for a very young child to have blood drawn and have skin pricks, to what end, to what end?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">He goes to their great grandparents and the grandparents and by their testimony he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s fine. And Dr. Jackson\u2019s testimony in a nut shell, how did he get fine so fast? ... I mean is that coincidental? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">[TJhis is Dr. Wolfs words, \u201cshe wanted to make sure there were problems with these children.\u201d [WJe\u2019re talking about two very young children here. And I will grant you that Nathaniel has been dragged through a whole lot more than Madeline has. But there is enough of a pattern here that when you, look at all of Nathaniel\u2019s visits and then when you look at Madeline\u2019s at a mere two years that it gives rise in the Court\u2019s mind and by a preponderance of the evidence a finding that she is at significant risk for having this repeated for her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">I have read <em>Andrew A. </em>It does come out of this county. I\u2019ve read <em>William B., </em>and also <em>Dunstin [Dustin] T. </em>touches on this as well. And one does not have to wait until each child in succession to see what happens ... [s]o one must look at the history to Nathaniel in assessing the risk to Madeline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">In assessing that risk, the Court looks at the age of the children, the history of what actually has happened to Nathaniel, looks at the mother\u2019s own expert\u2019s report, which states that she has major depression and that she\u2019s not being currently medicated for that depression. And also noted a personality disorder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">The incident with the fracture is clearly I find beyond a reasonable doubt if anybody wants me to, which I don\u2019t need to. That was abuse ... [b]ut when the mother grabbed this child in the way that she did because of anger, because of frustration, take anger out of it if you want, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>because of frustration, because things have been going so badly for him, for her, and between them, she injured him grievously. A transverse fracture of the humorous, as Dr. Orenstein said, that was caused by a great deal of force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">[Ij\u2019ve heard so little about the father. I\u2019ve heard so little that I can credit that 1 have no idea who he is, where he is, what his intentions are, what his thoughts are, what his ability to help is, what his financial situation is ... So in terms of each of the parents I make a finding of the father ... He has neglected [the children] by his absence if I credit that. He\u2019s neglected them by not attending their needs and if you will protecting them from [appellant\u2019s] excessive medical intervention pattern ... He is unwilling and unable from the evidence that I have to give them proper care and attention. He may be able but I have no evidence that he is or that he has been able ... I have nothing dispositive about the father from which I can conclude that he is anything other than neglectful, unwilling, and unable to care for his children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">In terms of the mother, I find that she has abused ... Nathaniel directly and physically in the broken arm injury. Her pattern of seeking medical intervention amounts to abuse, as defined in our CINA statutes, as well for Madeline. I don\u2019t have any evidence of physical, direct physical, abuse, but I find, based on the history here, and the patterns that appear in this evidence, that she, too, is at significant risk of this pattern of excessive medical intervention ... [and appellant\u2019s] untreated psychiatric conditions as set forth by her own experts force me to conclude that she, too, is unable ... at this juncture, to give proper care and attention to her children and their needs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">I have already given my opinion as to the credibility of Detective Darley and social worker Jennifer Knotts, as to the incident with the broken arm, as it was corroborated by the mother, and the child\u2019s own words at the hospital ... [d]r. Orenstein\u2019s physical findings corroborate and confirm that explanation of what happened on that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Whatever is motivating her, whatever malady, if there is one, that has caused her to behave as she has in the last 4.5 years with Nathaniel and Madeline, is sufficient, in my mind, call it what you will, it is sufficiently serious to cause a significant risk or harm to the children. I so find.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In Shirah\u2019s case, the circuit court based its CINA finding on its analysis of the record introduced by the State, from Nathaniel\u2019s and Madeline\u2019s hearings held on January 28, 29, and 30 2004, as well as February 2, 2004, the State\u2019s Petition, and oral argument. Wfiien appellant\u2019s children were found to be CINA, she was pregnant with Shirah. As noted, <em>supra, </em>when Shirah was born, she was subsequently placed in the care of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">At the May 13, 2004 hearing, the Department elected to proceed in summary fashion, and, over appellant\u2019s objection, the circuit court took judicial notice of the prior case regarding appellant\u2019s other children. The circuit court concluded, based on its reading of Maryland Rule 8-421 and 8-425, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMVv\">So it seems to me that, since an injunction has not been placed upon the order of the findings of this court, that they\u2019re still valid. And because prior court orders are valid considerations for judicial notice, I think at this time that the prior order of the court would be a proper item for me to take a judicial notice, of which to take judicial notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">So because there\u2019s, it seems to me there\u2019s been no motion to stay or there\u2019s been no injunction issued at this time, that the order still is valid and that I can take judicial notice of it. It seems that taking judicial notice is an alternative method to calling witnesses from an evidentiary point of view and so I think at this point, given the fact that it\u2019s still a valid order, that would be a proper, that would be one means by which the Department could establish those facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">The Court: Well, let me ask you this, in the last hearing, Shirah was not a party, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: She was not born.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The Court: She was not born. So obviously the [appellant\u2019s] treatment of Shirah was not an issue so no evidence was presented at that time. So my understanding is, the Department wants to present fact findings regarding [appellant\u2019s] treatment of the other children to establish a pattern and therefore risk to the newly born child. Although I think that I can consider that, that certainly wouldn\u2019t preclude you from having [appellant] testify about her treatment of the newborn baby for me to consider on the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: But in this case, if they [prior witnesses from other case] were to come forward today, like Dr. Jackson, let\u2019s say\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">The Court: Right. Yes, so you can call those witnesses and ask the same questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: Right, but it\u2019s their case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">The Court: No, I understand. So if what they present to me falls short of their proof, it falls short of the proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">The Court: I mean, I\u2019m not pre-judging what the proof standard is or whether it\u2019s going to meet it or not. They have to decide what they want to offer and if it doesn\u2019t meet it, it doesn\u2019t meet it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-11\">[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-12\">The Court: If it does, it does. But that doesn\u2019t preclude anyone in this room from calling any witness they want to call to ask any questions they want to ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-13\">[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">The State subsequently offered the transcript of the prior hearing and petition as its evidence and announced its intention to call witnesses for the dispositional phase of the hearing. The circuit court then asked appellant\u2019s counsel if he planned to call any witnesses, and he responded that he did not. The hearing judge stated that \u201cI guess what I need to do then is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>read the transcript and then hear argument about whether what\u2019s presented in this transcript meets the burden of proof for finding CINA with regard to Shirah.\u201d The hearing commenced one hour later and appellant argued a motion to dismiss. The circuit court first reviewed the CINA petition and found that physical abuse had occurred and that, since the incident, appellant\u2019s angry and frustrated demeanor has not changed and appellant has not sought treatment or counseling. The prior record also indicated that appellant excessively brought Nathaniel to the doctor, which the court found \u201cabnormal\u201d and \u201cexcessive.\u201d He noted that appellant\u2019s abnormal condition had not been addressed and that both of these conditions were the basis in the prior case in finding that Madeline was at risk and should be declared a CINA. The circuit court therefore concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">... because the anger and frustration is what led to the manifestation of the physical abuse, the snapping and the breaking of the arm, and because the psychiatric or psychological or personality disorder is what led to this behavior of excessive medical attention, those conditions still exist as far as I can tell. There\u2019s been no evidence produced to the contrary. And in the prior case, because those conditions existed, it created a substantial risk to Madeline because of her youthful age. She was only two years old. She was unable to verbalize and she was unable to really protect herself. And I think that risk is beyond the ordinary risk because of the conditions that exists in this particular mom, as opposed to moms that don\u2019t have these conditions. And they\u2019re untreated conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">With regard to this girl, Shirah, she is even younger. She\u2019s only I guess a month old tomorrow. And she is less verbal and less capable of taking care of herself. And so I think as long as the conditions still exist that led to the breaking of the arm and led to the excessive medical treatment, that there is a substantial risk that that same manifestation could occur to this child. It would be due to the fact that she\u2019s younger and more vulnerable and less verbal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>So with regard to the mom, because I find that her condition, that conditions still exist that cause her to commit to physical abuse and also to subject Nathaniel to excessive medical condition, I find that she\u2019s unable and unwilling to provide for the need of this child. And as a result of that, this child is subjected to, her safety and welfare is at risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">So for those reasons, I\u2019ll find that, even though there\u2019s been nothing, no direct harm done to Shirah, no direct action taken against her at this time, I believe that the prior pattern which was caused by the existence of conditions that have not yet been treated or changed, creates a substantial risk of harm to the child. And so I\u2019ll make the finding at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AIp\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Appellant contends the circuit court erred in finding her three children CI\u00d1A. We disagree. It is axiomatic that parents have the fundamental constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment to raise their children as they choose, without excessive interference from the State. We explained those rights in <em>Wolinski v. Bmwneller, </em>115 Md.App. 285, 693 A.2d 30 (1997), which was favorably quoted by the Court of Appeals in <em>In Re Yve S\u201e </em>373 Md. 551, 566-67, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003). We stated in <em>Wolinski:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">Beginning with <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390[, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042] (1923) and <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510[, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070] (1925), the Supreme Court, in a variety of contexts, has recognized that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage, family life, and the upbringing of children is a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See M.L.B. v. S.L.J., </em>519 U.S. 102[, 117 S.Ct. 555, 136 L.Ed.2d 473] (1996)(termination of parental rights).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Within the narrower context of the parent-child relationship, the Supreme Court has deemed the right to rear a child \u201cessential,\u201d <em>id., </em>and encompassed within a parent\u2019s \u201cbasic civil rights.\u201d <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. 535[, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655] (1942). Maryland has consistently echoed the Supreme Court, declaring a parent\u2019s liberty interest in raising a child a fundamental one that cannot be taken away unless clearly justified. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 112[, 642 A.2d 201] (1994); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. CAA 92-10852 &amp; CAA 92-10853, </em>103 Md.App. 1, 12[, 651 A.2d 891] (1994)(\u201cThis right is in the nature of a liberty interest that has long been recognized and protected under the state and federal constitutions.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">* * <em>X</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">The Supreme Court has emphasized, however, that \u201crights of parenthood are [not] beyond limitation,\u201d <em>Prince[ v. Com. of Mass.], </em>321 U.S. [158] at 166[, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944) ], and that the \u201cstate has a wide range of power for limiting parental freedom and authority in things affecting a child\u2019s welfare ... <em>Id. </em>at 167[, 64 S.Ct. 438]. Thus, a parent\u2019s right to direct his or her child\u2019s upbringing is not absolute. Rather, Due Process analysis requires the delicate balancing of all of the competing interests involved in the litigation. <em>See, e.g., City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, </em>462 U.S. 416, 427[, 103 S.Ct. 2481, 76 L.Ed.2d 687] (1983)(balancing individual\u2019s rights against the State\u2019s interest in regulating abortion); <em>[Wisconsin v. ]Yoder, </em>406 U.S. [205] at 221[, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) ] (balancing individual religious freedom and parental autonomy against the State\u2019s interest in preparing citizens to be self-reliant participants in society). In the context of most family law disputes over children, the State\u2019s interest is to protect the child\u2019s best interests as <em>parens patriae </em>\u2014 a derivation of the State\u2019s interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry. <em>See, e.g., Santosky[ v.

(C.J.), \u00a7 3 \u2014 801(f) defines a child in need of assistance as \u201ca child who requires court intervention because:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">(1) The child has been abused, has been neglected, has a developmental disability, or has a mental disorder; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">(2) The child\u2019s parents, guardian, or custodian are unable or unwilling to give proper care and attention to the child and the child\u2019s needs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">An allegation that the children are CINA must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. C.J. \u00a7 3 \u2014 817(c). The circuit court\u2019s CINA adjudication will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 8 \u2014 131(c); <em>In re: Michael G., </em>107 Md.App. 257, 264, 667 A.2d 956 (1995). In the case, <em>sub judice, </em>there was sufficient evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s decision that Nathaniel and Madeline were CINA and, therefore, the court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">The circuit court found that appellant fractured Nathaniel\u2019s arm out of frustration and anger and exposed him to excessive medical treatment. The hearing judge concluded that, taking into account those issues and appellant\u2019s untreated anger, frustration, and depression problems, Nathaniel was a CINA. She noted that appellant had sought no help nor shown any change in her conditions. We believe the fractured arm, coupled with the excessive medical treatment, as well as appellant\u2019s current anger, frustration, and depression prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>lems, are sufficient evidence to declare that Nathaniel was a CINA.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Although the hearing judge found appellant had not physically abused Madeline, or subjected her to the excessive medical treatment to which Nathaniel was exposed, based on her reading of <em>In re: Andrew A., </em>149 Md.App. 412, 419, 815 A.2d 931 (2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>374 Md. 583, 824 A.2d 59 (2003), <em>In re: William B., </em>73 Md.App. 68, 72-73, 533 A.2d 16 (1987), and <em>In re: Dustin T., </em>93 Md.App. 726, 736, 614 A.2d 999 (1992), she concluded that Madeline was a CINA. Based on the prior conduct of appellant, we must determine whether Madeline is at a \u201csubstantial risk of harm,\u201d which would require that she be deemed a CINA. <em>In re: Andrew A., </em>149 Md.App. at 419, 815 A.2d 931; <em>In re: William B., </em>73 Md.App. at 72-73, 533 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The issue presented is whether appellant\u2019s \u201cability to care for the needs of one child is probative of [her] ability to care for other children in the family.\u201d <em>William B., </em>73 Md.App. at 77, 533 A.2d 16. We recently opined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZC\">[a] \u2018substantial risk of harm\u2019 constitutes \u2018neglect.\u2019 Thus, if there are two children involved in a parent\u2019s act or omission, but only one child is harmed, there nevertheless may be neglect of the second child if, depending on the facts, the act or omission created a substantial risk of harm to the second child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-7\"><em>Andrew A., </em>149 Md.App. at 418, 815 A.2d 931. We have held that \u201c[t]he judge need not wait until the child suffers some injury before determining that he is neglected. This would be contrary to the purpose of the CINA statute. The purpose of the act is to protect children \u2014 not to wait for their injury.\u201d <em>In re: William B., </em>73 Md.App. at 77-78, 533 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The circuit court\u2019s determination that Madeline was at a substantial risk of being subjected to the same conditions to which Nathaniel was exposed was not clearly erroneous. Appellant fractured Nathaniel\u2019s arm out of frustration and anger, subjected the child to forty-four unnecessary doctor visits, has a depression problem, and has sought no help nor shown any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>change in her conditions that would lead us to believe that Madeline would not be subject to the same harm to which Nathaniel was exposed. Appellant\u2019s inability to appropriately care for Nathaniel is predictive of her ability to care for Madeline. We need not wait until Madeline is actually harmed; rather, based on the conduct of appellant towards Nathaniel, we may find her to be at risk and, therefore, a CINA. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. T00032005, </em>141 Md.App. 570, 606, 786 A.2d 64 (2001); <em>Dustin T., </em>93 Md.App. at 731, 614 A.2d 999; <em>William, B., </em>73 Md.App. at 77, 533 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The circuit court concluded that the father was either unable or unwilling to care for the children due to his absence and lack of involvement in the children\u2019s lives. Our review of the record does not indicate that the circuit court was clearly erroneous in its findings and ultimate conclusions regarding the ability of either parent to care for Nathaniel and Madeline.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Appellant further contends on appeal that Shirah\u2019s hearing was inappropriately \u201cconducted in summary fashion and without any formal presentation of proof ... the burden of proof was improperly shifted to [appellant] ... [and] the evidence does not support a CINA finding.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Before deciding if Shirah was in fact correctly adjudicated a CINA, we must first address appellant\u2019s assertion that the circuit court\u2019s \u201csummary fashion\u201d of the hearing was inappropriate. Appellant correctly noted that the Department bore the burden to show Shirah was a CINA and that \u201cthe allegations in a Petition ... shall be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule ll-114(e)(3). The State moved into evidence the transcript of the prior proceedings that detailed the CINA determination as to Nathaniel and Madeline and the Petition to declare Shirah a CINA; the trial judge took judicial notice of the record from the prior hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The hearing judge extended an opportunity to appellant, to present witnesses, including the same witnesses, if she de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>sired. The State was permitted to \u201cdecide what they want to offer and if it doesn\u2019t meet [the standard of proof], it doesn\u2019t meet [the standard of proof].\u201d The circuit court explained to appellant, several times, her right to call witnesses and present her defense to the State\u2019s evidence. The hearing judge specifically stated to appellant that \u201cyou can call those witnesses and ask the same questions\u201d and \u201cthat doesn\u2019t preclude anyone in this room from calling any witness they want to call to ask any questions they want to ask.\u201d Counsel argued a motion to dismiss, however, appellant chose not to call any witnesses or dispute the contents of the transcript and Petition with other evidence until the adjudication had ended and the court found Shirah to be a CINA. Appellant offered witnesses after that ruling in the disposition phase of the hearing. Proceeding in this \u2018summary fashion\u2019 did not cause the burden to be shifted to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Taking judicial notice of the prior hearings by the hearing judge was not inappropriate. The mother was a party to the prior hearings; she had the opportunity to defend herself through cross-examination; she was represented by counsel at those hearings; the facts relied upon were identical to the facts in the prior litigation; neither party demonstrated that circumstances had changed for the better since the prior hearings; the prior transcripts pertained to judicial findings deciding the allegations by the same circuit court; the transcripts were identified, moved into evidence, and made a part of the record; and the circuit court independently analyzed the evidence before it and made its own conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Illustra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>tive of the precepts expounded in footnote one is <em>In the</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>Interest of D.T., </em>667 N.W.2d 694, 697-99 (S.D.2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">Upon the State\u2019s motion, the trial court took judicial notice of the fact that both Mother and Father had their rights to other children terminated for abuse and neglect ... In its conclusions of law the [trial] court stated, \u201cbased on the prior abuse and neglect cases and the pattern of abuse and neglect demonstrated by both parents in those cases, D.T., Jr., is an abused and neglected child.\u201d ... It is undisputed that the child was adjudicated abused and neglected based on the history of abuse and neglect demonstrated by parents toward their other children ... Father asserts that the legislature did not intend to allow courts to take judicial notice of prior terminations during the adjudicatory phase of the proceedings ... There is nothing in the statute that indicates that it was intended to limit the trial court\u2019s discretion in determining whether and when to take judicial notice of prior terminations ... Father\u2019s assertion that case law does not permit the trial court to take judicial notice of prior terminations at the adjudicatory phase is equally unavailing. It is well settled that trial courts are permitted to take judicial notice of prior abuse and neglect adjudications ... This Court has upheld findings of abuse and neglect predicated upon evidence indicating potential harm to the child ... Finally, if the Court were to accept Father\u2019s argument that judicial notice of prior terminations may only be taken during the dispositional phase, the best interest of the children involved would not be served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The hearing judge concluded, based on the transcript and Petition concerning the prior conditions, the only evidence before him, arguments by counsel, and the fact that the prior conditions have not since been remedied, Shirah was a CINA. Having elected to proceed as she did, appellant now wishes to challenge the manner in which the circuit court conducted the hearing. Her claim may have had merit had not the circuit court afforded her the option of presenting her witnesses and a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">A summary proceeding in which the State merely submits a prior record and parental rights are thereby abrogated with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>out giving the parties the opportunity to present additional evidence would not comport with the precepts iterated in <em>Wolinski, supra. </em>Here, the circuit court provided appellant and the State with an opportunity to present new evidence at each hearing. Bearing in mind that the circumstances of the parties can improve over time, a parent should not automatically lose his or her parental rights in a perfunctory proceeding. Where use of a prior record is contemplated, the parties should be permitted to present evidence demonstrating that circumstances have improved, as the hearing judge did in this case. The opportunity to present evidence of changed circumstances must be afforded to a parent although appellant did not avail herself of that opportunity in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">With that said, the merits of Shirah\u2019s case do not focus on whether there was actual harm to her, but rather, like Madeline\u2019s situation, based on the prior conduct of appellant, whether her newborn child is at a \u201csubstantial risk of harm,\u201d which would mandate that the child be removed from the parent. <em>Andrew A., </em>149 Md.App. at 419, 815 A.2d 931; <em>William B., </em>73 Md.App. at 72-73, 533 A.2d 16. We must determine whether appellant\u2019s \u201cability to care for the needs of one child is probative of [her] ability to care for other children in the family.\u201d <em>William B., </em>73 Md.App. at 77, 533 A.2d 16. The child may be considered \u201cneglected\u201d before actual harm occurs, as long as there is \u201cfear of harm\u201d in the future based on \u201chard evidence\u201d and not merely a \u201cgut reaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 533 A.2d 16 (quoting <em>In re Jertrude ()., </em>56 Md.App. 83, 100, 466 A.2d 885 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">There was legally sufficient evidence to support the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion. Our review of the record does not indicate that the circuit court was clearly erroneous in its fact-finding. Md. Rule 8-131(c). We, therefore, affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-5\">.
