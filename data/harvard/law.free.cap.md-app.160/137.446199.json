Pleasanton, Kinsey\u2019s surviving spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Appellant presents four questions, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">I. Did the court below err as a matter of law when 15 months after the Petitions for Attorneys Fees and P[ersonal] Representative] Commissions had been approved as well as the Account, without Petition of any interested person, modified the Order pertaining to P.R. commissions and changed the amount approved from $15,787.75 to $5,787.75?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">II. Was it an abuse of discretion by the court below when it failed to impute monies to the surviving spouse for attorney[\u2019]s fees and court costs incurred by the Estate because of his failure to comply with the settlement agreement previously approved by the court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">III. Was it an abuse of discretion by the court below when it failed to approve attorney[\u2019]s fees and court costs necessitated by failure of the surviving spouse and/or his agent to remove tenants from Estate property and to pay over to the Estate monies due the Estate[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">IV. Did the court below err as a matter of law when it failed to approve a proposed division of cash proceeds for the two rental units as agreed to by the parties in a settlement agreement previously approved by the court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">Elsie Kinsey died testate on May 1, 2000. Kinsey executed her \u201cLast Will &amp; Testament\u201d on July 8, 1991, years before her marriage to Roger E. Pleasanton on June 26, 1997.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>to Kinsey\u2019s Will, her nephew, the appellant, was appointed as the Personal Representative of Kinsey\u2019s Estate. On June 16, 2000, Pleasanton, as surviving spouse, filed with the Orphans\u2019 Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County an \u201cElection to Take Statutory Share of Estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In October 2000, Mr. Pleasanton brought suit in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County against the Estate and Peterson, individually and as personal representative, challenging the value of the probate estate. He focused on various Certificates of Deposit, totaling approximately $253,000, which the decedent had established -with certain relatives well before her marriage to Pleasanton. Nevertheless, Pleasanton contended that the certificates were part of Kinsey\u2019s Estate. Following a trial in May 2001, the circuit court granted the defense\u2019s motion for judgment, embodied in a judgment of August 7, 2001. Thereafter, Pleasanton appealed to this Court. We affirmed on the merits, but remanded to the circuit court for the entry of a declaratory judgment. <em>Pleasanton v. Peterson, </em>No. 920, September Term, 2002, 145 Md.App. 723 (filed August 7, 2002) (unreported).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">On March 30, 2001, Peterson filed a first administration account, in which he reported assets for the Estate of $407,952.51. Kinsey\u2019s Estate included, <em>inter alia, </em>real and leasehold properties, including properties located at 212, 216 and 244 Merganser Drive in Chestertown.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">On June 29, 2001, appellant conveyed the properties at 212 and 244 Merganser Drive to Pleasanton as the surviving spouse. At that time, Pleasanton also held title to the property at 216 Merganser Drive. By Order entered November 6, 2001, however, the Orphans\u2019 Court directed Pleasanton \u201cto deed the three (3) real properties back to the estate for distribution or sale of said properties, unless the legatees and the surviving spouse agree that the spouse may retain the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>parcel that he was willing to accept as a partial distribution-in-kind of his elective share.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">In the interim, on August 10, 2001, appellant, through counsel, filed a \u201cPetition for Allowance of Attorney Fees,\u201d in which he requested an award to Davis of attorney\u2019s fees of $22,599. Both Peterson and Davis signed the Petition. The Petition identified the following services rendered by Ms. Davis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">a. Identifying creditors of the Estate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">b. Preparation of Petition for Probate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">c.

Preparation of Inventory;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">f. Preparation of Information Report and Amended Information Report;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">g. Defending the Personal Representative in litigation wherein he was sued by the surviving spouse over non-probate assets, representing the Personal Representative in matters before the Orphans\u2019 Court pertaining to the carrying out of the provisions of the decedent\u2019s will and representing the Personal Representative in recovering assets belonging to the Estate....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">h.

The list reflected 167.4 hours of work, at an hourly rate of $135, for a total of $22,599.

In his petition, appellant detailed seventeen services he rendered between June 19, 2000, and June 26, 2001, for which he claimed to have expended 63.5 hours in time.

Attending Hearing on replevin action</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">On the same date, August 10, 2001, Ms. Davis filed a \u201cNotice of Filing,\u201d in which she notified all interested persons that: 1) a petition for attorney\u2019s fees had been filed; and 2) the interested persons had a statutory right to object to the request within twenty days of receipt of the notice. According to the certificate of service, Ms. Davis sent copies of the petition to appellant; Daniel Peterson; and Samuel Heck and Frederick Franke, attorneys for the surviving spouse. Subsequently, on August 27, 2001, the surviving spouse, through his counsel, filed an \u201cAnswer to Petition for Allowance of Attorney\u2019s Fees,\u201d in which he objected to the proposed award of counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In addition, Ms. Davis filed another \u201cNotice of Filing,\u201d in which she informed all interested parties of appellant\u2019s petition for commissions and the statutory right to except within twenty days. The notice was sent to the same individuals to whom the prior notice was mailed. Then, on August 27, 2001, Pleasanton, through counsel, filed an \u201cAnswer to Petition for Allowance of Personal Representative\u2019s Commission,\u201d in which he excepted to the request for commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Appellant filed his \u201cAmended First Administration Account\u201d on September 12, 2001, in which he reported total Estate assets of $408,551.51, an increase of $599 over the assets reported in the first administration account. On September 18, 2001, the Orphans\u2019 Court approved the amended account, \u201csubject to exceptions being filed within twenty (20) days\u201d of the date of the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Thereafter, on October 25, 2001, Peterson, through counsel, filed a \u201cSupplemental Petition for Allowance of Attorney Fees,\u201d in which he requested an additional $2,376 in legal fees for Ms. Davis, for a total fee award of $24,975. Both Peterson and Davis signed the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">The request for an increase in fees was based on additional services rendered by Ms. Davis to prepare the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>administration account. In the supplemental petition, appellant provided an itemized list of the additional services rendered by Ms. Davis from August 3, 2001, through October 18, 2001. It showed 17.6 hours of services, at a rate of $135 per hour, for a total of $2,376.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On October 25, 2001, Ms. Davis sent a \u201cNotice of Filing\u201d to the interested parties, advising that appellant filed a supplemental petition for attorney\u2019s fees and they had a statutory right to file exceptions within twenty days. Copies of the supplemental petition and the notice were sent to appellant; Daniel Peterson; Pleasanton; and to Heck and Franke as attorneys for Pleasanton. Thereafter, on November 14, 2001, counsel for Pleasanton filed \u201cExceptions to Supplemental Petition for Allowance of Attorney[\u2019]s Fees,\u201d objecting to the proposed award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Also on October 25, 2001, Peterson filed a \u201cFurther Revised First Administration Account,\u201d in which he reported Estate assets of $410,179.09, and noted that appellant\u2019s requests for attorneys\u2019 fees and Personal Representative commissions were \u201cpending.\u201d Thereafter, on November 14, 2001, Pleasanton filed exceptions. In an Order of February 19, 2002, the court approved the \u201cFirst and Final Administration Account,\u201d subject \u201cto future directives of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">On February 19, 2002, counsel for both Peterson and Pleasanton filed a \u201cJoint Request for Approval of Settlement\u201d with the Orphans\u2019 Court (hereinafter, the \u201cJoint Settlement Request\u201d), in which they sought court approval of a settlement agreement reached on December 27, 2001, relating to division of the Estate. The Joint Settlement Request outlined the specific terms of the proposed settlement agreement. By its terms, Pleasanton was to receive the deed to the property at 216 Merganser Drive and one-half of the net proceeds of the sale of the properties located at 212 and 244 Merganser Drive. The surviving spouse also agreed to withdraw his objections to the first administration account and the awards of attorney\u2019s fees and personal representative commissions. The settlement agreement provided, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>(1) In settlement of [the surviving spouse\u2019s] elective share in the Maryland estate as presently constituted (The estate excludes the Virginia property, on which there is a separate agreement, and the joint accounts on which there is no agreement) [the surviving spouse] would receive, in full satisfaction of his claim the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">(a) The home and lot at 216 Merganser Drive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">(b) Sixty Thousand ($60,000.00) in cash;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">(c) One-half the net proceeds of 244 Merganser Drive (net proceeds being defined as gross proceeds, less real estate commission and sellers [sic] share of transfer taxes, if any);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">(d) Stock equivalent to Fifty Thousand ($50,000.00) Dollars on the date of transfer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">(e) One half the net proceeds of 212 Merganser Drive less whatever the amount necessary to ensure that the estate receives an amount equivalent to one-half <em>Qk) </em>the net proceeds of a sale at the appraised value ($45,000.00). Here the net proceeds will be defined as gross sales price $45,000.00 less real estate commission and sellers share of recordation and transfer taxes, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">(2) In addition, our agreement includes the following]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">(a) Real estate shall be listed with Wyble Enterprises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">(b) Sales (other than a sale through the realtor) shall be approved by both parties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">(c) If the agreement is acceptable to both parties, [the surviving spouse] will dismiss his objections to the account, the attorneys fees and his circuit court appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-13\">(d) If the agreement is ratified by the clients, the stock and cash would be paid within 15 days of Orphans\u2019 Court approval, or as quickly thereafter as Legg Mason can complete the transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">(e) Written evidence of the agreement will be recorded with the Register of Wills, so that the Orphans\u2019 Court can approve the transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>3. That in exchange for payment of his elective share, [the surviving spouse] agrees to withdraw his objections to the First Administration Account of William C.

That the parties hereto, by the respective counsel, have confirmed their understanding of and desire to proceed to the settlement and it is in the best interest of the parties hereto to complete the s\u00e9ttlement as quickly as possible....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">By Order entered February 19, 2002, the Orphans\u2019 Court approved the settlement agreement. The Order also reflected the surviving spouse\u2019s withdrawal of his objections to the first administration account, including a withdrawal of objections to appellant\u2019s requests for attorneys\u2019 fees and personal representative commissions. The Order stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">The aforegoing Joint Request for Approval of Settlement having been read and considered, it is hereby</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">ORDERED, this <em>19th </em>day of <em>February, </em>2002, that the settlement as ratified by the parties to Estate No. 7613 in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County, Maryland, be and is hereby approved, and it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">FURTHER ORDERED, that the objections to the First and Final Administration Account are hereby withdrawn and the same approved pursuant to future directives of this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">Pleasanton filed a \u201cReceipt and Release of Personal Representative\u201d on March 26, 2002, releasing Peterson \u201cfrom any and all claims and demands ... in connection with the estate[.]\u201d In addition, Pleasanton released appellant \u201cfrom rendering any additional accounting for the funds heretofore received by him as Personal Representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>That same date, March 26, 2002, the court entered an Order awarding Ms. Davis $24,975 in attorney\u2019s fees and authorizing payment of $15,787.83 in commissions to appellant, as Personal Representative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court\u2019s Order, to which no exceptions were lodged, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">Upon the foregoing Petition and verification, it is this <em>26th </em>day of <em>March, </em>2002, by the Orphans\u2019 Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County, Maryland,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">ORDERED that William C.

On December 30, 2002, appellant filed with the Orphans\u2019 Court a \u201cPetition for Authority to Sell,\u201d seeking the court\u2019s approval of a sale to appellant of the rental properties at 212 and 244 Merganser Drive at the appraised value (less ten percent diminution) of $40,500 each. In his petition, appellant noted that, by having the properties sold directly to himself, he could accrue more money for the Estate and be able to \u201cfinalize the Estate sooner rather than later.\u201d Specifically, appellant stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">12. If your Petitioner was able to sell the properties at the appraised value, less a 10% diminution in value because of the damage done to them by tenants, less a 6% realtor\u2019s commission, the maximum realized would be $38,070.00. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>And there would be additional real estate taxes, and fire insurance premiums paid and maintenance that would have to be done until such time as the properties sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">13.

On May 15, 2003, appellant .filed a \u201cPetition for Allowance of Additional Attorney Fees and Court Costs,\u201d seeking additional attorney\u2019s fees of $4,269.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">On May 15, 2003, Ms. Davis also filed a \u201cNotice of Filing,\u201d advising the interested persons that appellant had filed a petition for additional attorney\u2019s fees and they had the right to file exceptions within twenty days. Copies were sent to appellant; Daniel Peterson; and Pleasanton. No exceptions were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Peterson sought to impute monies to the surviving spouse for his part in continuing litigation with the Estate. In his first \u201cPetition to Impute Monies to Surviving Spouse,\u201d filed on January 8, 2003, appellant sought to have the rental income improperly received by the surviving spouse deducted from the monies otherwise owed to the surviving spouse pursuant to the settlement agreement. Appellant averred, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">1. That the Court Order the Personal Representative to attribute or credit to the surviving spouse Roger E.

Pleasanton the sum of $5,340.49 ... for determining the amount of monies otherwise due the surviving spouse upon the sale of 212 Merganser Drive and 244 Merganser Drive, Chestertown, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">By \u201cOrder of Court\u201d entered February 4, 2003, the court granted appellant\u2019s petition and \u201cORDERED, that William C. Peterson, Personal Representative, shall impute ... the sum of $5,340.00 ... for determining the amount of monies otherwise due the surviving spouse upon the sale of 212 Merganser Drive and 244 Merganser Drive.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In a second \u201cPetition to Impute Monies to Surviving Spouse,\u201d filed April 25, 2003, appellant recounted the litigation relating to the Estate, which appellant alleged was \u201ccause[d] by the destructive behavior of the Surviving Spouse, Roger E. Pleasanton.\u201d Specifically, appellant contended that Pleasanton\u2019s actions contributed to litigation in Delaware to collect monies owed to the Estate by Frank Reed and to evict the holdover tenants residing on the properties at 212 and 244 Merganser Drive. Appellant sought an order imputing an additional $4,269.75 to the surviving spouse, representing the cost of the additional litigation. Appellant explained, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>2. The first case involved a debt owed to the Estate by Frank R. Reed in the amount of $5,000.00. After he acknowledged the validity of the debt to the Estate it was necessary to file suit against him to obtain a Judgment to collect the money. Suit was filed against him in the District Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County, Maryland and after service and the entry of a Default Judgment against him in the amount of $5,000.00, Mr. Reed through counsel, Samuel L. Heck (who was also the attorney for the surviving spouse, Roger E. Pleasanton) on the thirtieth day following entry of the Default Judgment filed a Motion To Strike alleging the Defendant, Frank R. Reed was not susceptible to suit in Maryland. The Judge granted the Motion finding that having a car registered in Maryland is not sufficient contact with the State to have jurisdiction over an individual. Thereafter, the Personal Representative obtained counsel in Delaware to sue Mr. Reed, service was obtained and on the date set for the hearing the Personal Representative and Elise Davis, the attorney for the estate, appeared for the Estate, because Frank Reed had filed an answer saying that he was a resident of Maryland and could not be sued in Delaware. On the day of trial Frank Reed did not appear but sent his son instead to argue that his father lived in Maryland notwithstanding that he was served in Delaware. The Delaware Court rejected Frank Reed\u2019s assertions and entered judgment against him for the amount of $5,000.00 plus costs of $30.00, and shortly thereafter the said Frank Reed paid the Estate the $5,030.00....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">3. The second litigation case necessitated by the conduct of the Surviving Spouse Roger E. Pleasanton was necessitated by his failure to comply with requests of the Personal Representative and return personal property belonging to the decedent. When the property was not returned a replevin action was filed in the District Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County against the Surviving Spouse however he objected to jurisdiction because he was a resident of Delaware and notwithstanding the fact that he had instituted two legal cases in Maryland. The District Court ruled in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the Surviving Spouse\u2019s favor and dismissed the replevin action. The Personal Representative then retained counsel in Wilmington, Delaware.... By the time the Surviving Spouse turned over the personalty, $970.00 in attorney\u2019s fees had been expended for the Wilmington attorney.... 4. The third and fourth litigation matters came about because the Surviving Spouse and/or his attorney-in-fact Dudley McClain told three tenants at 212 and 244 Merganser Drive that notwithstanding the fact that those properties had been conveyed back to the Estate those tenants did not have to follow the direction of the Personal Representative including paying rent to him. The Personal Representative gave [the tenants] notice to quit the premises they occupied and when they failed to do so, the Personal Representative had to file landlord/tenant actions in the District Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County, [t]he Court ordered the tenants to leave, they did and then the Personal Representative had to file civil complaints for the back rent owed by the tenants. The tenant Manley defended against her action, the case was tried and the court entered a judgement [sic] against her in the amount of $200.00 plus costs. The claim was for six-hundred dollars but Manley produced a receipt for the May rent signed by the surviving Spouse after the property was deeded back to the Estate. Following the Judgment Manley paid the $200.00 plus costs back to the Estate. Suit was filed again against the [tenants] Hohreins and after much investigation by the Personal Representative as to their whereabouts, they were served and Judgment was entered against them in the amount of $1,125.00 plus court costs....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">On May 15 2003, appellant filed yet another \u201cPetition to Impute Monies to Surviving Spouse,\u201d in which, on behalf of the Estate, he sought to recover $1,110.98, representing the cost for personal property allegedly removed from the rental properties by the surviving spouse. In the petition, appellant claimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">1. At the time the premises located at 244 Merganser Drive and 212 Merganser Drive, Chestertown were con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>veyed by the Personal Representative to Roger E. Pleasanton on or about June 29, 2001, they each had operating dryers in good working order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">2. When the said 244 Merganser Drive and 212 Merganser Drive were conveyed by Roger E. Pleasanton back to the Estate and the Personal Representative was able to gain control[ ] of the premises on or about August 31, 2002, neither of the premises had a dryer and 212 Merganser Drive had the same refrigerator as on June 29, 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">3. During the course of a hearing on October 25, 2002, Dudley McClain, attorney-in-fact for Roger E. Pleasanton, testified and submitted two bills for dryers that he allegedly purchased for 212 and 244 Merganser drive because what was there was not operable and a new refrigerator for 212 Merganser Drive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">4. The bills for replacement dryers and refrigerator ... submitted to this Court totaled $1,110.98.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">5. During the course of the hearing on January 21, 2003, Kim Manley, the tenant at 244 Merganser Drive for the entire period that the property was owned by the said Roger E. Pleasanton[, testified] that the premises did not have a dryer and that she did not remove a dryer from the premises which she vacated on or about August 31, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">6. When the Personal Representative purchased replacement dryers for said premises at 212 and 244 Merganser Drive, they cost a total of $300.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">By \u201cOrder of Court\u201d entered May 27, 2003, the Orphans\u2019 Court denied appellant\u2019s second and third petitions to impute monies to the surviving spouse. By a separate \u201cOrder of Court\u201d entered that same day, the court denied the petition for additional attorneys\u2019 fees. Moreover, on May 27, 2003, after completing an audit of the various papers filed on behalf of the Estate, and while awaiting closure of the Estate, the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>issued a Show Cause Order to appellant and Ms. Davis \u201cto show cause why the personal representative fees paid ... should not be reduced as originally fixed\u201d by the court on March 26, 2002. The court noted \u201cthat all of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>papers filed were filed by the Attorney for the estate and not by the personal representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">A show cause hearing was held on June 10, 2003, at which appellant and Ms. Davis appeared. It does not appear that anyone else attended. At the outset of the hearing, the court noted its concern with the duplication of services in regard to attorneys\u2019 fees and the Personal Representative\u2019s commissions. The court stated: \u201cThe question is now arisen and the arguments that we\u2019re having here today is there were duplications of services by [counsel] and by Mr. Peterson which we had documented and that\u2019s what we want an explanation [for] today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Ms. Davis explained that she and appellant worked together on the same tasks, assisting each other. Ms. Davis also contended that the court lacked the authority, <em>sua aponte, </em>to review its prior order, issued on March 26, 2002, awarding $24,975 in counsel fees and $15,787.83 in commissions to the Personal Representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The following colloquy is pertinent with respect to the court\u2019s concern about duplicate services:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">[MS. DAVIS]: ... The hours I cannot begin to document that we spent in each and every way on this case, frequently having to do it together, me as the attorney, him providing his input as to knowledge of Elsie Virginia Kinsey. The notice was given of those petitions. They were given many times, and there came a point that the surviving spouse, Roger Pleasanton, and his attorneys withdrew their objections and this Court approved both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: Yes. And upon, and upon review, an audit of that we saw that it was a duplication and as you recall, there was only two judges, and that was a previous Court, not this Court. The previous Court approved that when Ms. Clevenger was the Chief Judge. We have a policy now. We will audit each and every account that we sign off on, and where we see inconsistencies with the statute, we will issue a show cause for the people to come in and further explain. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Now, you said <em>we </em>several times in your presentation here, you did this and he did that or we worked together, which is fine. Now I could go down every one of these things and point out probably fifteen or twenty things that \u201cwe\u201d, you and Mr. Peterson allegedly have done together. I have problems with that, big problems. Unless one person does it, Mr. Peterson hired you to do this, why would you need Mr. Peterson to share responsibility and you get your fee and he gets his fee....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">[MS. DAVIS]: Well,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: And I\u2019ll go through each one in a moment, but if you wish, I could start with the preparation of the petition for the probate which was done by you, yet Mr. Peterson said that he did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">[MS. DAVIS]: He had to provide information with regard to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: Well, that\u2019s part of your job to question him to do that. If he does it, he gets paid. If you do it, you get paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">[MS. DAVIS]: Judge, first of all, I would submit that the order of last spring is a final order. I don\u2019t think this Court has the authority to go back and undo what an earlier Court did. But, in a case of the documentation that was filed in, I think it was August and October of 2001, the work involved both normal administerial activities as well as the litigation that was prompted by the surviving spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">(Italics in original; boldface added).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">With regard to travel to Kinsey\u2019s Virginia property, for which both Ms. Davis and appellant sought compensation, the following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: <em>Well, I wish the facts and petitions substantiate[d] what you\u2019re saying, but I see a lot of duplications of </em>preparation of the petition, arranging for the bond, which you say you did, arranging for appraisals which you say you did, and he says he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-12\">[MS. DAVIS]: Yes, we both did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: Yeah, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\">[MS. DAVIS]: I arranged for the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: You arranged for the petition, for the appraisal to go to Chincoteaque, Virginia to have this appraiser down there appraise a lot with a trailer on it valued at $25,000 at Appomattox County, Virginia. Who arranged for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">[MS. DAVIS]: We went down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: I understand it takes two hours to go from Chestertown [i.e., where appellant resides] to Easton [i.e., the location of Davis\u2019s office] to meet up with you to drive to Accomac, Virginia and look at this piece of property. I question the wisdom and the value of that expense against the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">[MS. DAVIS]: Okay. Let me give you an example of some of what happened down there. Mr. Peterson had keys that belonged to Mrs. Kinsey. He knew about where the property was and it\u2019s not a situation where there was a house number out on the street. Once we got to the place and tried the keys, none of them worked. Mr. Peterson, over the years, had done checks for an individual who cut the grass for Mrs. Kinsey at the Chincoteague property so, we got a phone book and went and found him. The individual knew him by name and didn\u2019t have a clue as to who I was and because he knew who he was, he was able to make arrangements for the individual to go over there and get the existing lock off and get a new lock in, giving him the key. I couldn\u2019t have done that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: Well, I\u2019m not expecting you to do it.... I question why you even had to go down there. You\u2019re the attorney. He was the Personal Representative. It was part of his duties to do that. You charged the estate eight hours and it was over $1,000, almost $1,200 to go down there for that ride down there and I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>justifiable claim as an expense for you to bill the estate that fee for your trip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">[MS. DAVIS]: Well,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: You certainly didn\u2019t fix the lock. You certainly could have gone by the report that was made by this [appraiser] who gave a detailed appraisal. We\u2019re only talking about a $25,000 piece of property with a dilapidated trailer on it, and over $1,500 to go down and look at it and change the lock. That\u2019s not fair and reasonable to the estate or the legatees, who again I say, Mr. Peterson is a legatee....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: You\u2019re telling me that it was necessary for you and Mr. Peterson to go to Accomac, Virginia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">[MS. DAVIS]: Yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: Well, I disagree with you. [MS. DAVIS]: Well you know, one of the things we had to do down there was one, find an appraiser, and two find an attorney in order to take care of the, the estate proceedings that would be necessary in the Commonwealth of Virginia. We were over the state line so I had no ability to act. [CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: I know you were not at an ability to act but, for both of you to make that trip and charge it to the estate, this Court finds that that\u2019s excessive and not fair and reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">The court also questioned appellant\u2019s presence at various depositions conducted by Ms. Davis, as well as at other court proceedings. The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: ... I\u2019m sure Mr. Peterson did a lot of the work in his lay work for you, but to sit in depositions where he would have nothing to do but just sit there and go for two hours and other court proceedings, and just sit there as a witness or even as an interested party is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>not considered work done for the estate. That\u2019s for his own edification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1S\">[MS. DAVIS]: No it\u2019s not, Your Honor. Let me give you an example.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: Please do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">[MS. DAVIS]: I never, prior to Mrs. Kinsey\u2019s death, had any dealings with Mrs. Kinsey, with Mr. Pleasanton [i.e., the surviving spouse], and while I knew who Dudley McClain (phonetic) was, my knowledge of him did not marry him up as being a family of Mrs. Kinsey, in fact, he was her nephew. There were many things said over a period of time while Mrs. Kinsey was alive. There were also certain things said by Roger Pleasanton to Mr. Peterson both before and after her death. Now, when I take somebody\u2019s deposition, my client\u2019s sitting there, okay? We get a lot of \u201csitting there\u201d in this case. We noted exactly one deposition, and that was Mr. Pleasanton. All the other depositions were brought about by Mr. Pleasanton\u2019s attorney. They filed an incredible amount of discovery requests, so Mr. Peterson had the job of pulling the stuff together and then I had the obligation under the Rules to organize the information as it is specified under the Rules, and then prepare the written response that is required when one is responding to interrogatories or to a request for production for documents. Personal [Representative\u2019s commissions are determined by the size of the estate. There has been growth in the estate by virtue of dividends received in the last three years, and we\u2019re not going back for any more. The only time that I have charged for this last year, have been the litigation matters involving Mr. Pleasanton, Mr. Reed and the tenants. All of these other petitions I consider to be a part of what needs to be done for the estate, so I don\u2019t know how either one of us could be more reasonable in what we have done. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that if we brought in any attorney who does estate litigation who would say that it\u2019s, I think it\u2019s $15,000 and $24,000, so let\u2019s say $40,000 for what we have been through, is anything but reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Furthermore, the court inquired about the cost effectiveness of expending counsel fees of over $4200 to recover an outstanding debt of $5000 in connection with the rental properties. The following exchange is illuminating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: May I question the cost effectiveness of that action to recover $5,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">[MS. DAVIS]: I don\u2019t think, <em>in fact I\u2019m sure, that the money spent to recover the $5,000 with both sets of attorneys\u2019 fees came in under $1,000; 20 percent attorneys\u2019 [sic] fees.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">[CHIEF JUDGE DIPIETRO]: The only thing I have to go by is your petition where you said you were imputed $5,000. [MS. DAVIS]: That was total.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">JUDGE DIPIETRO: Yeah, $5,000 recovered and $4,200 plus you said the two other actions on there which I didn\u2019t think was cost effective but nonetheless, you said you\u2019ve done that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">The court was of the view that it retained the authority to review previously approved commissions, so long as the estate remained open, i.e., so long as the court had not approved the final accounting for the estate. The judge commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-12\"><em>Mr. Peterson, you hired your attorney to do this, you can\u2019t charge the estate for doing what she is doing for you. </em>This man prepared a detailed appraisal for you. I don\u2019t know why you had to spend ten hours going down there and Ms. Davis had to spend eight hours, costing the estate between your fee and her fee almost $1,500. Eight hours going down, you, ten hours, we have some legatees which you are a legatee in this estate. We have to protect the legatees in this estate, and duplication, I\u2019m not, I wasn\u2019t on the Court at the time, but I would not sign such an order. And as far as <em>Hunter v. Harlan </em>or <em>Harlan v. Hunter, [170 Md. 513, 185 A. 327 (1936) ] it gives this Court the authority to review any previously paid commissions to a PR as long </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>as the estate is still open. This estate is still open. It is not closed and it [ie., the Orphans\u2019 Court] still has jurisdiction over previously paid counsel fees. </em>So, if you want to read that case, that would help you out to understand why we are here today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">(Italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">On June 10, 2003, the same date as the show cause hearing, appellant filed a \u201cMotion to Reconsider\u201d the court\u2019s orders of May 27, 2003, denying his request for additional attorney\u2019s fees, as well as his petitions to impute monies to the surviving spouse. Following the show cause hearing and the court\u2019s review of appellant\u2019s motions to reconsider, and by orders of June 19, 2003, the court authorized payment of additional attorney\u2019s fees of $1423.25, but reduced appellant\u2019s commissions from $15,787.85 to $5787.85.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In its Order granting additional attorney\u2019s fees, the court determined that the fees represented \u201ca one-third attorney compensation for litigation necessitated by the Estate for the collection of a debt due from Frank Reed in the amount of $5,000.00, to remove tenants from 212 and 244 Merganser Drive, for collecting monies due for rent from those individuals and to recover personal property from the surviving spouse.\u201d In reducing appellant\u2019s commissions, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACS\">... The Court feels that [the reduction] is fair and reasonable in light of the size of this estate and the amount of the work performed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">There were numerous duplications of services alleged in both Petitions for Attorney Fees and Personal Representative Commissions. Therefore, this Court feels it fair and reasonable to compensate William C. Peterson for information supplied to the attorney who properly filed all Petitions and Orders for the estate, for which she has been compensated for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">On July 18, 2003, appellant filed two motions for reconsideration of the court\u2019s Order of June 19, 2003. In one motion, addressing attorney\u2019s fees, appellant reiterated that the additional litigation was caused by the actions of the surviving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>spouse. He contended: \u201cIt is an abuse of discretion and an illegal act for the Court to arbitrarily establish a one-third fee for work that was caused by the surviving spouse.\u201d In the other motion, concerning commissions for the Personal Representative, appellant contended: \u201c[N]o interested party ... filed an application with the Court to change the amount of the Personal Representative\u2019s Commissions,\u201d initially approved by the court in March 2002. According to appellant, the court lacked the authority to unilaterally revise the award of commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Addressing in his motion the court\u2019s reliance on <em>Harlan, supra, </em>170 Md. 513, 185 A. 327, and <em>Riddleberger v. Goeller, </em>263 Md. 44, 282 A.2d 101 (1971), appellant argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS9\">The Court in determining it had the authority to unapprove something that had been approved some fifteen months earlier with the consent of all interested parties, cited the cases of <em>Harlan v. Hunter, 170 Md. 513[, 185 A. 327] </em>and <em>Riddleberger v. Goeller, 263 Md. 44[, 282 A.2d 101]. </em>Said cases are inapposite to the facts in this Estate and said cases do not grant an Orphans court the authority to change accounts approved by it some fifteen months earlier. In the <em>Harlan </em>case an executor filed a propsed account which was objected to by an interested party and because of the facts the interested party brought to the attention of the Orphans[\u2019] Court, it refused to pass the account, <em>Harlan, </em>supra @ 512[ at 515, 185 A. 327. The court in <em>Harlan </em>stated that \u201cwith reference to commissions, the Orphans Court has jurisdiction to allow commissions ... within the limits prescribed by the various sections of the Code [ ... ] and <em>\u201cto review its action on application within a reasonable time[.]\u201d </em>In this case, there was no application by an interested party to review, a 15 month hiatus is certainly not \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d and the account had already been passed by the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">In <em>Riddleberger v. Goeller, </em>263 Md. 44[, 282 A.2d 101], a proposed account was filed claiming attorneys fees, Personal Representative commissions, and brokers [sic] commissions. Interested persons filed exceptions as to all three. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Orphans!\u2019] Court rejected the requested brokers commissions but approved the Personal Representative Commissions and attorneys [sic] fees and some of the interested persons filed an appeal. The Court of Appeals affirmed the award of Personal Representative Commissions but reduced the amount of attorneys [sic] fees. In this case, the Personal Representative commissions and attorneys [sic] fees were approved by the Interested Persons and then by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Then, on July 25, 2003, appellant filed a second administration and partial distribution account. Pursuant to the prior settlement agreement between the Estate and the surviving spouse, appellant included an accounting of the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the rental properties at 212 and 244 Merganser Drive.

It said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The Orphans\u2019 Court has the power to reduce commissions originally fixed. <em>Harlin [sic] v.

It is not fair or reasonable for the Personal Representative and the Attorney of the estate to both be paid for claiming to have done the same filings and work and to petition the court to get paid twice. See E &amp; T \u00a7\u00a7 7-601 and 7-602 and annotations thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">By another \u201cOrder of Court,\u201d entered on August 19, 2003, the court withheld approval of the second account. In that Order, the court also affirmed its Order of June 19, 2003, in which it reduced appellant\u2019s commissions. It ruled, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">[T]hat the said account shall not be approved until such time as the accounting is revised to reflect the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">1.

The Personal Representative\u2019s Commissions are reduced pursuant to this Court\u2019s Orders of June 19, 2003 and August 19,2003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Thereafter, on September 15, 2003, appellant noted his appeal to this Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Appellant launches a multilateral attack upon the proceedings below. We shall discuss each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">A. Personal Representative\u2019s Commissions</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Appellant contends that the Orphans\u2019 Court lacks the \u201cauthority to change accounts approved fifteen months earlier by a different Orphans^] Court.\u201d He asserts: \u201cIn this case, there was no application by an interested party to review, a 15 month hiatus is certainly not \u2018within a reasonable time[,]\u2019 and the account had already been passed by the Court.\u201d (Citation omitted). Moreover, pointing to the Order of March 26, 2002, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>which was never challenged, appellant argues: \u201cIn this case, the Personal Representative commissions and attorney[\u2019]s fees were approved by the Interested Persons and then by the Court and then became final,\u201d pursuant to Maryland Code (2001 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 7-502 of the Estates and Trust Article (\u201cE.T.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">According to Peterson, the court\u2019s reduction of the commissions was \u201cnot done pursuant to an express grant of power given to [the Orphans\u2019 Court] by law.\u201d He cites <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>265 Md. 327, 331, 289 A.2d 318 (1972), for the following proposition: \u201c \u2018[N]othing is more certain than the proposition that an appeal will not lie from a court\u2019s refusal to reopen a previous decision which has become final[. T]o hold otherwise would [lead] to interminable litigation[.]\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Appellee disagrees. According to appellee, \u201cThe Orphans\u2019 court properly reduced the amount of the personal representative\u2019s commissions previously authorized because the personal representative and the attorney for the estate sought fees and commissions for the same filings and work.\u201d Moreover, the Orphans\u2019 Court contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">The determination of the amount of commissions due executors an administrator [sic] is entirely within the discretion of the Orphans\u2019 Court, <em>Newton v. Johnson, </em>173 Md. 166[, 195 A. 312] (1937), and the Orphans\u2019 Court has statutory authority to allow such commissions within the limits prescribed by law, among which includes the power to review and reduce the commissions originally fixed prior to an account being made final. <em>Harlan v. Hunter, </em>170 Md. 513, 518[, 185 A. 327] (1936).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">Further, appellee asserts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">[A]t the time the Orphans\u2019 Court issued its Order on June 19, 2003, the Kinsey Estate was still open, the commissions applied for had not been earned, and the Orphans\u2019 Court had the jurisdiction and authority to determine the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>commission to be paid as it was entirely within its discretion to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The question we are called upon to decide is whether the Orphans\u2019 Court may, <em>sua sponte, </em>review and then reduce its previous award of commissions while an estate is still open. We are satisfied that it may. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The authority of the Orphans\u2019 Court to award commissions to a personal representative is derived from statute. E.T. \u00a7 7-502, entitled \u201cProposed payment to personal representative or attorney,\u201d is relevant. It states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">(a) <em>Notice. </em>\u2014 The personal representative shall give written notice to ... all interested persons of a claim, petition, or other request which could result, directly or indirectly, in the payment of a debt, commission, fee, or other compensation to or for the benefit of the personal representative or the attorney for the estate. The notice shall state the amount requested, and set forth in reasonable detail the basis for the request. It shall also state that a request for hearing may be made within 20 days after the notice is sent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">(b) <em>Finality of order. </em>\u2014 Unless there was fraud, material mistake, or substantial irregularity in the proceeding or a request for a hearing is filed within 20 days of the sending of the notice, any action taken by the court on the petition is final and binding on all persons to whom the notice was given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">(Boldface added).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">E.T. \u00a7 7-601, entitled \u201cCompensation of personal representative and special administrator,\u201d is also relevant. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\">\u00a7 7-601. Compensation of personal representative and special administrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-11\">(a) <em>Right to compensation. </em>\u2014 A personal representative or special administrator is entitled to reasonable compensation for services....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-12\">(b) <em>Computation of compensation. </em>\u2014 Unless the will provides a larger measure of compensation, upon petition filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>in reasonable detail by the personal representative or special administrator <em>the court may allow the commissions it considers appropriate. </em>The commissions may not exceed those computed in accordance with the table in this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">(c) <em>Appeal. </em>\u2014 Within 30 days a personal representative, special administrator, or unsuccessful exceptant may appeal the allowance to the circuit court, which shall determine the adequacy of the commissions and increase, but not in excess of the above schedule, or decrease them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The Court of Appeals has long recognized that \u201cmatter[s] of accounting by executors and administrators and of the allowance of their commissions\u201d are within the province of the Orphans\u2019 Court. <em>Harlan v. Hunter, supra, </em>170 Md. at 517, 185 A. 327. The Court explained in <em>In re Estate of Watts, </em>108 Md. 696, 71 A. 316 (1908):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">In fixing the commissions of an executor the Orphans\u2019 Court properly looks to the nature and extent of the of the executor\u2019s labor with the aim of course, of allowing such commissions as will be fair compensation for his services rendered in the administration of the estate; and within the limits prescribed by [the predecessor statute to E.T. \u00a7 7-601], <em>the amount to be allowed is at the discretion of the court. </em>Where a lower tribunal is charged with the performance of duties, in the discharge of which it is clothed with discretion, in the absence of clear and satisfactory proof of its refusal, or of such arbitrary conduct as amounts to a refusal, to exercise that discretion, its action, within the limits of the discretion vested in it, cannot be controlled or reviewed on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 699-700, 71 A. 316 (Emphasis added). <em>See Riddleberger, </em>263 Md. at 51-52, 282 A.2d 101 (holding that where the commissions approved are within the limitations imposed by law, they will not be disturbed on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>In addition, the Orphans\u2019 Court has the authority to review a prior grant of personal representative commissions based on the request of an interested person that is made \u201cwithin a reasonable time, and to reduce the commissions originally fixed.... \u201d <em>Harlan, </em>170 Md. at 518, 185 A. 327. The <em>Harlan </em>Court reasoned that the commissions \u201care not regarded as earned until the administration account is passed by the court[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>But here, there was no request by an interested party, and the revision arguably was not made within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><em>Newton v. Johnson, </em>173 Md. 166, 195 A. 312 (1937), provides guidance. There, the Orphans\u2019 Court passed an order fixing the commissions of an administrator. Two years and eight months later, while the estate remained open, the court rescinded its prior order and revised its award of commissions. From the decision, various interested parties appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 195 A. 312. The <em>Newton </em>Court affirmed the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s revised order granting commissions, stating: \u201c[T]he right to change or modify an original order fixing the rate [of commissions] rests in the court, until such time as the administration account is passed[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 195 A. 312. <em>See also </em>10 Maryland Law Encyclopedia, <em>Executors &amp; Administrators </em>\u00a7 182, at 504 (1999) (\u201cM.L.E.\u201d) (\u201cThe commissions allowed to a personal representative, although fixed prior to such time, are not regarded as earned by him or her until the administration account is passed by the court\u201d); 10 M.L.E. <em>Executors &amp; Administrators </em>\u00a7 183, at 505. (\u201cAn original order fixing the rate of commissions may be modified by the Orphans\u2019 Court until the administration account is passed\u201d); 10 M.L.E. <em>Executors &amp; Administrators </em>\u00a7 187, at 509 (\u201c[T]he maximum and minimum rates of commission fixed by statute apply where the administration is full and complete; there is no minimum allowance fixed by law for a partial administration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Even after final ratification, there are circumstances that permit revisions of fee awards. In <em>Malkus v. Richardson, </em>124 Md. 224, 92 A. 474 (1914), the Court of Appeals recognized the \u201cample authority\u201d of the Orphans\u2019 Court, in limited circumstances, \u201cto correct errors in the accounts of executors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>administrators <em>after </em>final ratification, and to abrogate and modify their own orders, when necessary to promote the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 92 A. 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We glean from the authorities cited above that the Orphans\u2019 Court is vested with discretion in matters of fees and commissions while an estate is open. Here, it is uncontested that, when the Orphans\u2019 Court issued its Order of May 27, 2003, reducing the award of commissions to appellant, the final administration account had not yet been ratified; the Kinsey Estate remained open.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Moreover, appellant has not directed us to any authority limiting the prerogative of the Orphans\u2019 Court, in the exercise of its discretion, to revisit the matter of the award of commissions to a personal representative prior to closure of an estate. Nor are we aware of any authority restricting the right of the Orphans\u2019 Court to revise, <em>sua sponte, </em>its previous Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">We find it helpful to analogize to the power of a trial court to revisit earlier rulings during the pendency of a case. It is well settled that, while a case remains open, \u201c \u2018a judge presiding at a trial ... is free at any time during the trial to reconsider any prior ruling in the case, <em>whether made by him or by another judge.\u2019 \u201d Driver v. Parke-Davis &amp; Co., </em>29 Md.App. 354, 362, 348 A.2d 38 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>277 Md. 736 (1976) (quoting <em>Layman v. State, </em>14 Md.App. 215, 230, 286 A.2d 559, <em>cert. denied, </em>265 Md. 740 (1972)) (emphasis added); <em>see also Baltimore Police Dep\u2019t v. Cherkes, </em>140 Md.App. 282, 300, 780 A.2d 410 (2001) (\u201c \u2018As a general principle, one judge of a trial court ruling on a matter is not bound by a prior ruling in the same case by another judge of the same court[.]\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Placido v. Citizens Bank and Trust Co. of Md., </em>38 Md.App. 33, 45, 379 A.2d 773 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">We are satisfied that, under the circumstances attendant here, it was within the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s discretion to revisit and modify its prior award of commissions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>B. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Appellant contests the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s denial of the request for an additional $4,269.79 in attorney\u2019s fees; after reviewing appellant\u2019s request, the court awarded only $1,423.25 in additional attorney\u2019s fees. Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">There was no request for hearing filed by any interested parties with respect to the petition for additional attorneys!\u201d] fees and court costs, as those fees and costs are allowed by statute, and the Orphansf] Court is not authorized to impose contingent fee awards, it was an abuse of discretion by the Orphans!\u201d] Court to allow a sum less than the claimed attorneys!\u201d] fees and costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Appellee counters: \u201cUnder [E.T.] \u00a7 7-602, determination of a reasonable compensation for services of an attorney rests with the exercise of sound judgment and discretion of the court, employing the statutory standards and basing its determination upon the evidence offered.\u201d Relying on <em>Wolfe v. Turner, </em>267 Md. 646, 299 A.2d 106 (1973), appellee notes the relationship between the court\u2019s award of Personal Representative commissions and attorneys\u2019 fees, asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">[T]he commissions allowed to the personal representative and fees to the attorney may be awarded where the court\u2019s review of the petition for commissions and attorney fees does not exceed what the court determines to be the fair and reasonable total charge for the overall cost of administering the particular estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Further, appellee contends that the court considered appropriate factors in awarding only $1423.25 in additional attorneys\u2019 fees. Appellee asserts: \u201c[T]he Orphans\u2019 Court properly awarded an attorneys\u2019 fee and Court costs of $1,423.25 in light of the fact that the litigation[,] while necessary to recover a debt due, was not cost effective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Preliminarily, we note that the parties have not addressed whether appellant is actually aggrieved by the issue of the award of attorney\u2019s fees to Ms. Davis. Put another way, the parties have not discussed whether appellant has standing to challenge the denial of the attorney\u2019s fee petition. Nevertheless, we raise this matter <em>nostra sponte. See Kilsheimer v. Dewberry &amp; Davis, </em>106 Md.App. 600, 603 n. 2, 665 A.2d 723 (1995) (\u201cStanding ... is an issue that we sometimes will address <em>nostra sponte \u201d), cert. denied, </em>341 Md. 406, 671 A.2d 20 (1996); <em>Commission on Human Relations v. Anne Arundel County, </em>106 Md.App. 221, 236, 664 A.2d 400 (1995) (\u201c[W]e consider the issue of standing as falling within the category of cases, in addition to jurisdiction, that an appellate court may address although it was not raised by a party.\u201d); <em>see also County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Offen, </em>334 Md. 499, 509, 639 A.2d 1070 (1994); <em>Cf. Lewis v. Lewis, </em>290 Md. 175, 179, 428 A.2d 454 (1981) (\u201c[PJarties may not by consent confer jurisdiction upon this Court or the Court of Special Appeals\u201d); <em>Burns v. Scottish Development Co. Inc., </em>141 Md. App. 679, 688, 787 A.2d 786 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u25a0 In <em>Frater v. Paris, </em>156 Md.App. 716, 848 A.2d 673 (2004), this Court dismissed the personal representatives\u2019 appeal taken from an order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, sitting as the Orphans\u2019 Court. In this Court\u2019s view, the personal representatives were not aggrieved by the court\u2019s order, and thus lacked standing to complain on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 723, 848 A.2d 673. The appellants were the personal representatives of a multi-million dollar estate; one of the appellants was also a legatee, but appeared below and in this Court only in his capacity as a personal representative. <em>Id. </em>at 717, 723 n. 4, 848 A.2d 673. The wife elected to take her statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>share rather than a bequest under the will, <em>id. </em>at 718, 848 A.2d 673, and the circuit court directed the appellants to amend their Revised Sixth and Final Administration Account to reflect a payment to the widow of one-half of the net value of the estate as of the time of distribution, rather than of the value as of the time of the decedent\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 717-18, 848 A.2d 673. It was that ruling that the personal representatives sought to challenge on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Looking to <em>Webster v. Larmore, </em>270 Md. 351, 354, 311 A.2d 405 (1973), the <em>Frater </em>Court reiterated that, where the Orphans\u2019 Court has passed an order regarding distribution of an estate, \u201c \u2018a personal representative is bound to make a distribution in accordance with that court\u2019s order, since the personal representative is fully protected by it[.]\u2019 \u201d 156 Md.App. at 720-21, 848 A.2d 673. We further noted that none of the legatees claimed that his or her interest in the estate would be reduced due to the court\u2019s distribution order. <em>Id. </em>at 723, 848 A.2d 673. Writing for this Court, Judge Rodowsky said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">Here, there is no appeal by any of the legatees whose participation in the distribution of income earned during administration would be reduced in a Final Account, revised to comply with the order of the court below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [T]he personal representatives have no standing to appeal the order of the court below.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 723, 848 A.2d 673 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\"><em>Grabill v. Plummer, </em>95 Md. 56, 51 A. 823 (1902), on which <em>Frater </em>relied, is also relevant. In <em>Grabill, id. </em>at 59-60, 51 A. 823, the administratrix petitioned an orphans\u2019 court to grant attorneys\u2019 fees, representing the cost of her successful defense of a caveat in the deceased\u2019s will. The court granted the request in full, but ordered the deduction of the fees from the share belonging to the beneficiaries taking under the will, and not from appellee, the deceased\u2019s widower, who elected to take his statutory share. <em>Id. </em>at 60, 51 A. 823. The administratrix appealed, but the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal \u201cbecause the appellant, as administratrix ..., ha[d] no interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>in the subject matter of the appeal, and [could not] be aggrieved by the passage of the order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 51 A. 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Significantly, when questioned by this Court at oral argument, Ms. Davis did not articulate any basis to support appellant\u2019s standing to challenge the court\u2019s ruling as to attorneys\u2019 fees. Moreover, as in <em>Frater, </em>appellant appeared below and in this Court only in his capacity as Personal Representative. <em>See Buchwald v. Buchwald, </em>175 Md. 103, 114, 199 A. 795 (1938) (Executor appealed in both his personal and representative capacities from an orphans\u2019 court\u2019s order rendering void various provisions in will; Court dismissed executor\u2019s appeal in his representative capacity for lack of aggrievement). Moreover, it appears that Davis was hired by Peterson to render services on behalf of the Estate, not on behalf of Peterson personally. There is no indication in the record that appellant will be held personally liable to Davis for whatever amount of attorney\u2019s fees were not awarded by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Accordingly, on this record, we fail to discern how appellant is aggrieved by the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded to Ms. Davis. \u201c \u2018It does not appear from the record that the [personal representative] has in any capacity such an interest in the subject-matter as entitles him to appeal[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Frater, </em>156 Md.App. at 722-23, 848 A.2d 673 (citation omitted). Therefore, pursuant to <em>Frater </em>and <em>Grabill, </em>we are satisfied that appellant lacks standing to appeal from the court\u2019s disposition of the Petition for an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Even if appellant has standing, the claim lacks merit. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The authority of the Orphans\u2019 Court to award attorney\u2019s fees to counsel for an estate is derived from statute and is governed by E.T. \u00a7 7-602.

Moreover, the award \u201cwill not be disturbed in the absence of proof of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Recently, in <em>Beyer v. Morgan State Univ., </em>369 Md. 335, 353, 800 A.2d 707 (2002), the Court of Appeals said: \u201cThe decision to allow attorney\u2019s fees is dependent upon the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to approve all, some, or none of the requested fees.\u201d <em>See Wright v. Nuttle, </em>267 Md. 698, 700-01, 298 A.2d 389 (1973) (\u201c[T]he allowance of a fee to counsel ... is clearly within the discretion of the orphans\u2019 court, and in the absence of an abuse of this discretion, will not be disturbed\u201d); <em>National Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. Foster, </em>83 Md.App. 484, 496, 575 A.2d 776 (1990) (\u201c[T]he allowance of counsel fees by an orphans\u2019 court requires the exercise of discretion and \u2018will not be disturbed in the absence of proof of abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The Court of Appeals has also outlined the \u201cprincipal elements\u201d to be considered by the Orphans\u2019 Court in determining the reasonableness of an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Wolfe, </em>267 Md. at 653, 299 A.2d 106. They include \u201cthe amount [of the requested fee] involved, the character and extent of the services, the time employed, the importance of the question, the benefit to the estate and the customary charges made for similar services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>has noted that, pursuant to E.T. \u00a7 7-602, the Orphans\u2019 Court, \u201cincident to the approval of counsel fees, shall take into account both counsel fees and commissions allowed or to be allowed the personal representative in determining what is a fair and reasonable charge for the settlement of an estate, to the end that aggregate compensation shall not exceed this amount.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>267 Md. at 701, 298 A.2d 389; <em>see Wolfe, </em>267 Md. at 653, 299 A.2d 106 (\u201c[I]n setting a counsel fee, the commissions allowed personal representatives should be taken into account, so that overall charges for administration shall be neither unfair nor unreasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Based on the foregoing, we perceive neither error nor abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s award of $1,423.25 in additional attorney\u2019s fees. It is clear that the court considered the cost effectiveness of the additional litigation. It is also obvious that the court abided by the directive of E.T. \u00a7 7-602 by taking into account the duplication of services rendered by the Personal Representative and the Estate\u2019s legal counsel. Furthermore, although the court noted that the award of $1,423.25 represented \u201ca one-third attorney compensation,\u201d necessitated by the additional litigation, there is no evidence that the court was awarding a \u201ccontingent fee,\u201d as contended by appellant. Additionally, at the show cause hearing on June 10, 2003, Ms. Davis stated: \u201c[I]n fact I\u2019m sure[ ] that the money spent to recover the $5,000 with both sets of attorneys\u2019 fees came in under $1,000; 20 percent attorney\u2019s [sic] fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">C. Division of Cash Proceeds From Sale of Rental Properties</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Appellant contends that the court violated the settlement agreement previously approved in February 2002, when it failed to approve the proposed distribution of proceeds reflected in the Second Administration and Partial Distribution Account. As previously outlined, the settlement agreement between the Estate and the surviving spouse provided that, <em>inter alia, </em>the surviving spouse was to receive one-half of the net proceeds of the sale of the rental property at 244 Merganser Drive, with net proceeds being defined as \u201cgross proceeds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>less real estate commission </em>and sellers [sic] share of transfer taxes, <em>if any.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Additionally, the settlement agreement provided for the surviving spouse of one-half of the net proceeds of the sale of the rental property at 212 Merganser Drive, \u201cless whatever the amount necessary to ensure that the estate receives an amount equivalent to one-half of the net proceeds of a sale at the appraised value ($45,000.00).\u201d In the case of the property at 212 Merganser Drive, net proceeds were defined by the agreement as \u201cgross proceeds, <em>less real estate commission </em>and sellers [sic] share of transfer taxes, <em>if any.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Appellant seems to contend that the court violated the settlement provisions regarding distribution of proceeds of the sale of the rental properties, because it refused to approve the distribution contained within the second administration account, which included a deduction for a six percent real estate commission. Appellee counters that the court was entitled to withhold approval of the distribution because appellant failed to provide evidence that the Estate actually employed a real estate broker in the sale of the rental properties, notwithstanding that the accounting indicated that a 6% real estate commission had been paid. According to appellee: \u201cThe Orphans\u2019 Court had the authority to deny the accounting for the reasons stated and did not take any action contrary to the settlement agreement[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In our view, our previous analysis as to standing applies, as well, to appellant\u2019s contentions regarding the court\u2019s failure to approve the proposed distribution of cash proceeds from the sale of the rental properties. As we noted in <em>Frater, supra, </em>156 Md.App. 716, 848 A.2d 673, when an Orphans\u2019 Court has passed an order regarding distribution of an estate, \u201c \u2018a personal representative is bound to make a distribution in accordance with that court\u2019s order, since the personal representative is fully protected by it[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 720-21, 848 A.2d 673 (citing <em>Webster v. Larmore, supra, </em>270 Md. at 354, 311 A.2d 405). As with his attorneys\u2019 fees claim, appellant appeared below and in this Court only in his repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>sentative capacity; he does not personally contest the court\u2019s failure to approve the proposed distribution. Therefore, appellant lacks standing to appeal on this ground. <em>See Frater, </em>156 Md.App. at 723, 848 A.2d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Even if appellant has standing, however, his contentions lack merit. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">As previously noted, nothing is more peculiarly within the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court than its authority to pass on accountings by personal administrators of estates. <em>Harlan, supra, </em>170 Md. at 517, 185 A. 327. Accordingly, we will not overturn a decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court relating to an administration account unless we are satisfied that the court erred or abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">E.T. \u00a7 2-102, entitled \u201cJurisdiction of court,\u201d is pertinent. It states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">\u00a7 2-102. Jurisdiction of court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">(a) <em>Powers. </em>\u2014 The court may conduct judicial probate, direct the conduct of a personal representative, and pass orders which may be required in the course of the administration of an estate of a decedent. It may summon witnesses. The court may not, under pretext of incidental power or constructive authority, exercise any jurisdiction not expressly conferred....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">E.T. \u00a7 2-102 has been interpreted to grant the Orphans\u2019 Court the authority to direct the conduct and accounting of estates. <em>See Goldsborough v. DeWitt, </em>169 Md. 463, 473-74, 182 A. 324 (1936); <em>Parker v. Leighton, </em>131 Md. 407, 102 A. 552 (1917). Here, appellant argues that the court withheld approval of the second administration account, in contravention of the settlement agreement previously approved by the court in February 2002. But, the court only refused to approve the account because of appellant\u2019s inclusion of a six percent charge for what the court regarded as a phantom real estate commission; appellant offered no evidence that he employed a broker in the sale of the properties and actually incurred the broker\u2019s fees. Indeed, in its Order of August 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>2003, withholding approval of tho second account, the court stated, as to both properties: \u201cThe 6% commission ... shall not be allowed. The 6% real estate commission was not actually paid to a real estate broker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Interestingly, appellant does not argue to this Court that the services of a broker were, in fact, employed. Nor does he direct us to any evidence indicating that the Orphans Court erroneously determined that the commissions were not paid to a real estate broker. Accordingly, it was appellant who was arguably in contravention of the settlement agreement between the Estate and surviving spouse, which provided for a deduction of real estate commissions <em>\u201cif any.\u201d </em>Consequently, we are satisfied that the court did not err or abuse its discretion in withholding approval of the second administration account pending appellant\u2019s revision thereof, removing any deduction for real estate commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">D. Imputation of Monies</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Appellant also presents a question regarding the court\u2019s failure to impute monies to the surviving spouse. However, in his brief, appellant fails to include an argument in support of this issue, in violation of Md. Rule 8-504(a)(5) (\u201cA brief shall ... include the following: (5) Argument in support of the party\u2019s position.\u201d) Accordingly, we decline to address the issue. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-504(c) (\u201cFor noncompliance with this Rule, the appellate court may dismiss the appeal or make any other appropriate order with respect to the case[.]\u201d); <em>see also Beck v. Mangels, </em>100 Md.App. 144, 149, 640 A.2d 236 (1994) (\u201c \u2018[W]here a party initially raised an issue but then failed to provide supporting argument, this Court has declined to consider the merits of the question so presented but not argued\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>337 Md. 580, 655 A.2d 370 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
