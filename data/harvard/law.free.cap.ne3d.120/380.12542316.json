Dianna Eichenlaub, plaintiff below and appellee herein, and Randy R. Eichenlaub, defendant below and appellant herein. Appellant raises the following assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"THE LOWER COURT IN ITS JUDGMENT ENTRY FINAL DECREE ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT CONSIDERED THE PARTIES' FIRST MARRIAGE IN ITS ANALYSIS OF R.C. 3105.18(C)(1)(e).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"THE LOWER COURT IN ITS JUDGMENT ENTRY FINAL DECREE ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY AWARDING PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE SPOUSAL SUPPORT FOR AN INDEFINITE TERM.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The parties initially married in October 1990, and remained married until November 1998 when they dissolved their marriage. Following the dissolution, appellant and appellee continued to live together, until appellee left the home and stayed with a friend for a short period of time. During this time, appellee became pregnant. Shortly thereafter, appellee and appellant rekindled their relationship and remarried in October 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} During the parties' marriage, appellee gave birth to the child conceived during the parties' period of separation. Also, two other children were born as issue of the marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In 2015, the parties' relationship deteriorated and they sought a divorce. On September 8, 2017, the trial court held a final divorce hearing. Appellee testified that she and appellant first married in October 1990, and remained married for eight years. Appellee stated that after the parties dissolved their marriage, appellant \"lived with [her] continuously.\" She further explained, however, that at some point, she asked appellant to leave the home. He would not do so, however. Appellee related that she decided to stay with a friend, and that the parties reunited a short time later.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellee stated that for the past three years, she has worked as a full-time kindergarten aide and earns approximately $21,000 annually. Before that, she had no other meaningful employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant testified that appellee did not work outside the home during the marriage, but instead stayed home to care for the children. Appellant stated that appellee started working within the past few years as a school aide. Appellant claimed that appellee \"has the education to do more if she chooses to.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On December 4, 2017, the trial court granted the parties a divorce, divided the parties' property, and designated appellee the children's residential parent. The court also awarded appellee spousal support in the amount of $800 per month for an indefinite time period. Additionally, the court retained jurisdiction to modify the spousal support order. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant's two assignments of error challenge the propriety of the trial court's spousal support award. For ease of discussion, we consider them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred and abused its discretion by considering the parties' first marriage when determining to award appellee spousal support. Appellant claims that nothing in the spousal support statute allows a trial court to consider a prior marriage, or a period of unmarried cohabitation, when it evaluates the propriety of a spousal support award. Appellant further maintains that once the trial court defined the term of the parties' marriage as October 27, 2001 through September 8, 2017, it could consider only that period of time when awarding spousal support. Appellant additionally asserts that when the parties dissolved their first marriage, the parties agreed to waive spousal support. Appellant thus contends that the trial court could not consider the duration of their first marriage when determining the propriety of a spousal support award following the termination of their second marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding appellee spousal support for an indefinite term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Trial courts generally have broad discretion and \"wide latitude\" when evaluating the appropriateness, reasonableness, and amount of a spousal support award.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kunkle v.

The court found that the period of separation between the parties' first and second marriages was \"brief\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that appellant nearly continuously provided the primary means of support for appellee \"for close to 22 years.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Furthermore, appellant bases his argument that the trial court must use the same dates to define the duration of the parties' marriage for both spousal support and property division purposes. The property division statute, R.C. 3105.171, directs a trial court to equitably divide the parties' marital property. One factor a court must consider when dividing the parties' marital property is the duration of the marriage. R.C. 3105.171(F)(1).

Furthermore, appellant did not argue during the trial court proceedings that the parties' alleged prior agreement that neither party would receive spousal support when they dissolved their first marriage means that the court could not consider the term of the parties' first marriage when evaluating the appropriateness and reasonableness of spousal support.

Appellant contends that their marriage was not of a long duration, but rather, lasted only sixteen years. He further argues that neither party is of advanced age, and that even though appellee was a homemaker for part of the marriage, she resumed full-time work in 2015. Appellant further alleges that appellee has the resources, ability, and potential to be self-supporting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 31} We do not agree with appellant that the trial court's decision to award appellee indefinite spousal support is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. First, the trial court could have rationally concluded that appellee lacks the resources, ability, and potential to be self-supporting. The evidence illustrates that, although appellee recently started working as a kindergarten aide, the position does not hold much opportunity for a significant increase in salary. As it stands, appellee earns approximately $21,000 annually. Additionally, appellee continues to be the primary caregiver for the parties' three minor children. Consequently, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that appellee does not have the resources, ability, or potential to be self-supporting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Second, the trial court could have logically determined that appellee \"was a homemaker-spouse with little opportunity to develop meaningful employment outside the home.\"\n   <em>\n    Kunkle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1424178\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/51/64/#p67\">\n    51 Ohio St.3d at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=554%20N.E.2d%2083\">\n    554 N.E.2d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence shows that appellee primarily cared for the children during the course of the parties' second marriage and that she did not have gainful employment outside of the home during the sixteen-year marriage. The existence of this one factor alone illustrates that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding appellee indefinite child support.\n   <em>\n    Mahoney\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Leopold\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Furthermore, we observe that the trial court retained jurisdiction to modify the spousal support award.
