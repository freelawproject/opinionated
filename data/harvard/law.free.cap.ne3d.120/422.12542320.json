Appellees are MC Mineral Company, L.L.C.; Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., CHK Utica, L.L.C.; Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C.; Chesapeake Energy Marketing, L.L.C.; Total E &amp; P USA, Inc.; Total Gas &amp; Power\n   North America, Inc.; P. Nathan Bowles, Jr., Trustee; Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas;, Haymaker Properties, LP; and Carizzo (Utica), L.L.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Jay and Mary Heller (hereinafter \"Hellers\") owned 160.25 acres of real estate in Guernsey County. On July 30, 1966, they entered into an option agreement to sell the property to Island Creek Coal Company, reserving the oil and gas rights. The option provided it would expire on September 5, 1966. On or about September 13, 1966, the Hellers executed a warranty deed to Island Creek Coal, with no reference to the reservation of oil and gas rights contracted for in the option agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Subsequently, the Hellers leased the oil and gas three times, and conveyed their oil and gas interest in the property via quit claim deed to Appellant on July 15, 1994. On June 11, 2015, Appellant brought the instant action against Appellees, all of whom except Carizzo claim either interest in the subject property or working interest in an oil and gas lease from MC Mineral. Appellee Carizzo owns no interest in the property, but operated wells in a portion of the property. The action sought to quiet title in the oil and gas rights by reforming the 1966 deed between the Hellers and Island Creek Coal Company, in order to reflect the Hellers' reservation of oil and gas rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The case proceeded to bench trial. The court found a mutual mistake of fact in the 1966 deed regarding the reservation of the oil and gas rights. However, the court found Appellant's action barred by the statute of limitations, holding as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   10. Ohio Revised Code Section 2305.22 provides, \" Sections 2305.03 to 2305.21, 1302.98, and 1304.35 of the Revised Code, respecting lapse of time as a bar to suit, do not apply in the case of an action by a vendee of real property, in possession thereof, to obtain a conveyance of the real property.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   11. Therefore, the ten (10) year statute of limitations on equitable cause [sic] of action described in R.C. 2305.14 does not apply to \"an action by a vendee of real property, in possession thereof, to obtain a conveyance of the real property.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   12. Both Ms. Bond and Thomas Zechman testified that the Lodge received the 1994 Quit Claim Deed as a gift. The Lodge did not provide any compensation or payment in exchange for the deed from the Hellers. The oil and gas rights were not purchased by the Lodge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   13. The Court holds that the Lodge is not a vendee of real property for purpose of R.C. 2305.22 because it did not purchase any interest in the Property. \"A vendee is defined as a\n   <em>\n    purchaser\n   </em>\n   of real property.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

There was no testimony supporting the Lodge's position that the exception set forth in R.C. 2305.22 applies to it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   15. As noted above, Mr. Zechman testified that the Lodge had not paid anything for the oil and gas rights and a \"vendee\" has been defined as a purchaser of real property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   16. The Lodge has not asserted a claim for conveyance of the Property. See\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Cloud\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-5390\">\n    2016-Ohio-5390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76 N.E.2d [N.E.3d] 297, \u00b6 7 (7th Dist.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (\"The Millers filed suit for declaratory judgment, quiet title, injunction,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and sale of real estate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Emphasis added\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   17. The Lodge is not seeking to reform the 1994 Quit Claim Deed it received from the Hellers. Instead, it is seeking to reform the 1966 Warranty Deed to which it was not the vendor or a vendee - the Lodge was not a party to the 1966 Warranty Deed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   18. This Court must determine the ownership interests of the parties of the subject minerals pursuant to R.C. 5303.01. The Court concludes as a matter of law that the Plaintiff's claims are time barred by the Ohio Revised Code Section 2305.22.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Judgment Entry, December 29, 2017, Conclusions of Law \u00b6\u00b6 10-18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 5} It is from the December 29, 2017 judgment Appellant prosecutes its appeal, assigning as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT APPELLANT FREEPORT LODGE # 415 FREE &amp; ACCEPTED MASONS OF OHIO (THE \"LODGE\") IS NOT A VENDEE AS DESCRIBED IN R.C. 2305.22 THUS THE DEED REFORMATION IS BARRED BY THE TEN-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN R.C. 2305.14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellees MC Mineral Company, L.L.C.; Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., CHK Utica, L.L.C.; Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C.; Chesapeake Energy Marketing, L.L.C.; Total E &amp; P USA, Inc.; Total Gas &amp; Power North America, Inc.; P.

Appellant argues the court erred in finding it was not a \"vendee\" pursuant to R.C. 2305.22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 8} R.C. 2305.14 sets forth a ten-year statute of limitations applicable to the instant action. However, R.C. 2305.22 provides an exception:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Sections 2305.03 to 2305.21, 1302.98, and 1304.35 of the Revised Code, respecting lapse of time as a bar to suit, do not apply in the case of an action by a vendee of real property, in possession thereof, to obtain a conveyance of the real property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant argues a \"vendee\" is defined as a purchaser of real property, and as a purchaser of real property from the Hellers under the 1994 deed, Appellant is therefore a vendee, excepted from operation of the ten-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant cites\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Cloud,\n   </em>\n   7th Dist. Columbiana,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-5390\">\n    2016-Ohio-5390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20N.E.3d%20297\">\n    76 N.E.3d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in support of its claim it is a vendee. In\n   <em>\n    Miller,\n   </em>\n   the court stated, \"A vendee is defined as a purchaser of real property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67. However, in that case the Millers were the vendee of the deed which they sought to reform. In the instant case, as found by the trial court, Appellant does not seek to reform the 1994 deed by which the Hellers conveyed the oil and gas rights to it, but rather seeks to reform the 1966 deed to which it was not a party. The purpose of R.C. 2305.22 was explained in\n   <em>\n    Sams v. Nolan,\n   </em>\n   4th Dist. Ross No. 1326,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1987%20WL%2013947\">\n    1987 WL 13947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   This exception, allowing a vendee in possession of real property to have that property legally conveyed to him, permits remedial, ministerial corrections in defective deeds to be made at any time. Reformation actions excepted from the statute of limitations by R.C. 2305.22 are those which merely protect a possessor's right to his interest in land conveyed by a defective deed or contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant is not claiming the deed which conveyed its interest from the Hellers is defective, but rather is claiming the deed between the Hellers and Island Creek in 1966 was defective. Assuming arguendo Appellant could claim operation of R.C. 2305.22 as a successor in interest to the Hellers, the Hellers were not the vendees of the 1966 deed. The Hellers were the vendors, and as such to the extent Appellant stands in the shoes of the Hellers as to the 1966 deed, they do so as the vendor, and not as the vendee. We agree with the trial court Appellant is not a vendee with respect to the instant action for deed reformation of the 1966 deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Further, R.C. 2305.22 sets forth three requirements for the exception to the statute of limitations to apply: the party is a vendee of real property, the party is in possession of the property, and the action is one to obtain a conveyance of the real property. The trial court also found Appellant had not asserted a claim to obtain a conveyance of the real property. Appellant does not challenge this finding on appeal. By virtue of the two-issue rule, a decision which is supported by one or more alternate grounds properly submitted is invulnerable to attack on one issue only.\n   <em>\n    Suermondt v. Lowe\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.
