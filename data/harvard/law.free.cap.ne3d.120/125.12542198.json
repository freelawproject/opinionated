(\"Montrose\") appeals from judgment entries of the Summit County Common Pleas Court granting summary judgment in favor of Bruce Averback and awarding him damages and attorney's fees. This Court affirms in part and reverses in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b62} In March 2013, Montrose purchased a new 2013 Ford F-150 Roush Raptor pickup truck from another dealership in Maryland. Upon receipt, Montrose inspected the truck and discovered that the long block engine was defective and needed replaced. Ford supplied Montrose with a new long block engine under warranty, and Montrose replaced the defective long block engine for a total cost of $ 5,800.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b63} In April 2013, Mr. Averback contacted Montrose looking to purchase a Roush truck. Montrose informed Mr. Averback that it had a Roush truck available, and Mr. Averback purchased the truck. The purchase price of the truck was $ 73,901.65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b64} Six months later, the truck began overheating. Mr. Averback took the truck\n   to Montrose where the malfunctioning temperature gauge was replaced under warranty. There was no evidence that this repair was related to the earlier engine repair. While the temperature gauge was being replaced, Mr. Averback traded in the truck at a different Ford dealership for $ 50,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b65} Mr. Averback subsequently obtained all of the service reports from Montrose and discovered that the truck's engine had been replaced under warranty. This fact was not disclosed to him when he purchased the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b66} On December 5, 2013, Mr. Averback filed a complaint against Montrose alleging various claims for violations of Ohio's Consumer Sales Practices Act (\"CSPA\"), in addition to claims for fraud, breach of contract, and breach of express warranty. On January 6, 2014, Montrose served an offer to cure upon Mr. Averback's counsel, which was rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b67} After completing discovery, Mr. Averback filed a motion for partial summary judgment against Montrose as to the issue of liability on the ten CSPA claims. The trial court denied summary judgment as to nine of the CSPA claims and granted Mr. Averback summary judgment on one of the CSPA claims. The trial court found Montrose liable for violating Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-16(B)(14) by not disclosing to Mr. Averback, prior to his purchase of the truck, that the factory-installed engine was defective and had been replaced under warranty. Mr. Averback filed an amended complaint, omitting all of his claims except for the CSPA claim based upon Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-16(B)(14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b68} All that remained for disposition was the issue of damages, which the parties agreed to try to the bench. The magistrate held a damages hearing and found that Mr. Averback was entitled to $ 2,659.46 in actual damages, trebled to $ 7,978.38; $ 500.00 in noneconomic damages; and attorney's fees. Montrose filed objections to the magistrate's decision, which were overruled. Following an attorney's fees hearing, the magistrate awarded Mr. Averback $ 23,845.00 in attorney's fees and $ 2,035.54 for filing fees and costs. The court adopted the magistrate's decision and entered judgment in favor of Mr. Averback.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b69} Montrose appeals, raising three assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT INCORRECTLY GRANTED [MR.] AVERBACK'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b610} In its first assignment of error, Montrose contends that the trial court erred as a matter of law by incorrectly interpreting Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-16(B)(14). According to Montrose, this provision only required it to disclose \"existing defects.\" This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b611} This Court reviews an award of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

They agree that the factory-installed engine in the truck that Mr. Averback bought from Montrose had been defective and was replaced with a new engine prior to Mr. Averback's purchase of the truck. They further agree that the retail repair cost of the replacement exceeded 6 percent of the manufacturer's suggested retail price for the truck. Finally, they agree that Montrose did not disclose to Mr. Averback that the defective engine had been replaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b613} They disagree, however, over whether those undisputed facts entitled Mr. Averback to judgment as a matter of law. Mr. Averback argues that Montrose was legally obligated to disclose the defect pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-16(B)(14). Montrose argues that it was not legally obligated by the regulation to disclose the defect after it had corrected it. Resolution of the issue turns upon the interpretation of Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-16(B)(14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b614} Briefly, by way of background, R.C. 1345.02(B) contains a non-exclusive list of acts and practices that the General Assembly has prohibited as unfair or deceptive. The General Assembly also authorized the Attorney General to adopt rules that define \"with reasonable specificity\" what is an unfair and deceptive act or practice. R.C. 1345.05(B)(2). Pursuant to that authority, the Attorney General has adopted Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-16(B)(14), which states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   It shall be a deceptive and unfair act or practice for a dealer * * *, in connection with the advertisement or sale of a motor vehicle, to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (14) Fail to disclose prior to the dealer's obtaining signature by the consumer on any document for the purchase of the vehicle,\n   <em>\n    any defect and/or the extent of any previous damage to such vehicle, retail repair cost of which exceeds or exceeded six per cent of the manufacturer's suggested retail price,\n   </em>\n   excluding damage to glass, tires and bumpers where replaced by identical manufacturer's original equipment. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b615} The trial court found that Mr. Averback was entitled to summary judgment because Montrose violated this administrative rule. In particular, the court found that Montrose failed to disclose that the truck had a defect when the retail repair cost for the defect had exceeded 6 percent of the manufacturer's suggested retail price for the truck. Montrose argues that the portion of the rule referencing retail repair costs in excess of 6 percent of the manufacturer's suggested retail price for the vehicle applies only to damage and not to defects. Montrose further argues that the rule requires disclosure of an existing defect, but not a previously repaired defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b616} Administrative rules are subject to the ordinary rules of statutory construction.\n   <em>\n    Ohio Edison Co. v.

Had the Attorney General meant to address only defects existing at the time of the sale, he could have expressed that\n   intention with the words \"any existing defect.\" To adopt Montrose's argument that the regulation applies only to \"existing defects\" would effectively insert a word not used into Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-16(B)(14). Indeed, the fact that the Attorney General chose to insert the word \"previous\" before damage demonstrates that his intention was to narrow the expanse of the word \"any\" modifying \"damage\" to \"any previous damage.\" He did not similarly restrict the use of the word \"any\" modifying \"defect.\" Rather, the rule simply states \"any defect\" meaning \"all\" or \"every\" defect must be disclosed regardless of whether the defect was a \"previous\" defect or an \"existing\" defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b626} Finally, Montrose argues that the phrase \"excluding damage to glass, tires and bumpers where replaced by identical manufacturer's original equipment\" supports its interpretation of the administrative rule. Montrose argues that the rule includes this exclusion for damage to glass, tires, and bumpers, but \"doesn't include an exclusion from disclosure for cured defective glass, tires, and bumpers because they are not required to be disclosed in the first instance, regardless of how much it cost to cure them.\" This argument is circular at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b627} In making this last argument, Montrose presupposes that it was not required to disclose a repaired defect, which is the very conclusion that it wishes this Court to draw. Not only is this argument circular, it is inconsistent with the balance of the regulation. Construing the regulation as a whole, aside from the 6 percent threshold, there are no exemptions from the duty to disclose \"any defect.\" There are, however, certain exemptions from the duty to disclose \"damage.\" The duty to disclose damage is limited to \"any previous damage\" and is nonexistent altogether when the damage was to \"glass, tires, and bumpers\" that were subsequently \"replaced by identical manufacturer's original equipment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b628} Upon review, this Court concludes the trial court correctly interpreted Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-16(B)(14) as applying to all defects, whether previous or existing, where the retail repair cost was in excess of the 6 percent threshold.

Accordingly, rescission of the purchase of the truck from Montrose was not an available remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Borror v. MarineMax of Ohio, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.

This fact is further supported by the prayer for relief in Mr. Averback's third amended complaint wherein he requested actual and treble damages, and not rescission of the transaction. Because rescission was not an available remedy to Mr. Averback under the CSPA, neither were reliance damages. Despite there being evidence that his out-of-pocket expenses for his down payment and negative equity arose from the CSPA violation, Mr. Averback did not rescind the transaction and was precluded from seeking his reliance damages.

Mr. Averback moved for summary judgment on the issue of liability only as to various CSPA claims and requested a jury trial on the issue of damages. Because Mr. Averback limited his summary judgment motion to the issue of liability, the trial court properly limited its summary judgment decision to the issue of liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lehmier v.

Therefore, while the trial court referenced facts regarding Montrose's policy to not disclose defect repairs to consumers in its summary judgment decision, it did not make a finding regarding such conduct being intentional or malicious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lehmier\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Accordingly, no such finding existed prior to the damages hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b656} Further, Mr. Averback's reliance in his appellate brief on the trial court's decision overruling Montrose's objections to the magistrate's decision as being evidence of intentional conduct is misplaced. That decision was rendered after the damages hearing. Accordingly, that decision was not evidence Mr. Averback could have relied upon at the damages hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b657} The parties stipulated that \"the only issue that remain[ed] to be tried * * * [was] the amount of damages, if any, to which [Mr. Averback was] entitled on his claim that [Montrose] violated O.A.C. \u00a7 109:4-3-16(B)(14) by failing to tell him that the engine had been replaced in the vehicle he was purchasing before he bought it\" and \"that single issue w[ould] be tried to the [c]ourt.\" To \"try\" means \"[t]o examine judicially; to examine and resolve (a dispute) by means of a trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1555 (8th Ed. 2004).

Under certain circumstances, Civ.R. 32(A) permits a party to submit a deposition transcript at a hearing or trial as evidence. Mr. Averback, however, did not admit any deposition testimony at the damages hearing, and thus was precluded from relying upon the earlier deposition testimony as evidence of Montrose's intentional or malicious conduct. Similarly, Mr. Averback did not attempt to admit the Montrose employee's affidavit as evidence of intentional conduct at the damages hearing, nor would he have been permitted to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Core v.

To demonstrate a knowing violation of the CSPA to support an award of attorney's fees, the consumer \"need not prove\n   that the [supplier] knew that conduct violated the law but only that the [supplier] knew the underlying facts of the conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Charvat\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b667} Montrose specifically argues that there was no evidence at the damages hearing as to \"how the engine in the [truck] had come to be replaced\" to support a finding that Montrose knowingly committed a CSPA violation. Mr. Averback does not dispute the lack of evidence at the damages hearing on this point. Instead, Mr. Averback again argues that there was evidence submitted to the trial court via the summary judgment briefs establishing that Montrose had a policy of not disclosing repaired defects and that Montrose repaired the defect prior to the sale of the truck. Mr. Averback asserts it would be a waste of judicial resources to require him to prove facts at the damages hearing that the trial court previously found. In awarding attorney's fees, the trial court based its determination that Montrose acted knowingly upon the following: 1) the affidavit of Montrose's general manager which was attached to Montrose's brief in opposition to summary judgment, and 2) the trial court's prior summary judgment ruling wherein it found that \"[Montrose] acknowledged it replaced the engine prior to selling it to [Mr. Averback.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b668} The law and analysis addressed in assignment of error number two regarding evidence of intentional or malicious conduct for noneconomic damages and the use of summary judgment evidence and the trial court's summary judgment ruling apply equally to this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b669} While the trial court's summary judgment decision listed facts regarding Montrose's policy to not disclose defect repairs and that the engine had been replaced, the trial court's summary judgment decision was limited to a liability determination that Montrose violated the CSPA and made no explicit finding that the CSPA violation was committed knowingly. Nor was there an implicit finding that the CSPA violation was committed knowingly, as the trial court did not award attorney's fees in the summary judgment decision. As previously noted, such a finding, explicit or implicit, would have been an improper damages decision because Mr. Averback did not seek summary judgment on damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lehmier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018-Ohio-3351\">\n    2018-Ohio-3351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 46. Because the summary judgment decision did not contain a finding that Montrose knowingly committed the CSPA violation, it could not be relied upon as evidence of this necessary damages element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b670} Nor could the summary judgment depositions and affidavits be relied upon because they were not admitted into evidence at the damages hearing. The parties stipulated that the sole purpose of the hearing was to determine Mr. Averback's damages, if any. Because Mr. Averback was seeking attorney's fees, he was required to present, albeit a second time,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   testimony or exhibits at the damages hearing establishing the necessary element that Montrose knowingly committed the CSPA violation. Mr. Averback, however, presented no such evidence at the damages hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b671} Upon review of the testimony and the exhibits admitted during the damages hearing in the light most favorable to Mr. Averback, this Court concludes that a reasonable trier of fact could not find in favor of Mr. Averback as to attorney's fees. Mr. Averback failed to present sufficient evidence\n   that Montrose knowingly committed a CSPA violation to support an award of attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b672} Additionally, Montrose argues that in the event the first assignment of error concerning the liability determination is reversed that the attorney's fees award must also be reversed as a matter of law. In light of this Court's affirmance of the first assignment of error as to the issue of liability, this argument is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b673} Lastly, Montrose argues in the alternative that pursuant to R.C. 1345.092 the attorney's fees award should be modified to limit Mr. Averback's award of attorney's fees to those which he incurred prior to January 6, 2014. Based on this Court's resolution of the sufficiency argument relative to the attorney's fees, we decline to address Montrose's alternative argument regarding the attorney's fees award as it has been rendered moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b674} Montrose's third assignment of error is sustained as to the attorney's fees award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Filing Fees and Costs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b675} Montrose's third assignment of error also challenges the award of filing fees and costs on the basis that the court costs should be reduced to include only those that were incurred prior to January 6, 2014. Montrose relies upon R.C. 1345.092(G)(1)-(3), which states that when an offer to cure is rejected and the award of actual economic damages is less than that offered by the supplier, the consumer is precluded from recovering treble damages, as well as court costs and attorney's fees incurred after the consumer receives the offer to cure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b676} Montrose offered Mr. Averback $ 1,800.00 in its offer to cure, which Mr. Averback rejected. The trial court originally awarded Mr. Averback economic damages in excess of Montrose's offer to cure and thus did not apply R.C. 1345.092 in its analysis of the court costs. In light of the resolution of assignment of error number two and our remand instructions to the trial court to award Mr. Averback $ 200.00 statutory damages, Mr. Averback's economic damages will be less than the amount presented in Montrose's offer to cure, thereby subjecting his award of court costs to the provisions of R.C. 1345.092(G)(2). Pursuant to this statute, Mr. Averback is not entitled to recover any court costs he incurred after the date his attorney received the cure offer from Montrose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 1345.092(G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b677} Montrose's third assignment of error is sustained as to the filing fees and costs award. This matter is remanded to the trial court to calculate the court costs to be awarded to Mr. Averback pursuant to R.C. 1345.092(G)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b678} Montrose's first assignment of error is overruled.
