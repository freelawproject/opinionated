Perry appeals his conviction and sentencing entry filed on December 23, 2016 in Columbiana County Common Pleas Court. Appellant presents speedy trial, ineffective assistance of counsel, merger, and consecutive sentencing arguments. Appellant's speedy trial, ineffective assistance of counsel, and merger arguments are without merit. However, the trial court failed to properly incorporate the consecutive sentence findings\n   pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C) within its sentencing entry. Appellant's convictions and sentence are affirmed, but the matter is remanded to the trial court for a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   entry to correct Appellant's consecutive sentence within the sentencing entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant, a known drug dealer, had been living with his girlfriend in her apartment. At some point, they ended their relationship but Appellant refused to move out until three weeks later, as he had already paid his part of the month's rent. In the meantime, his ex-girlfriend entered into a relationship with the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The incident at issue occurred one week after Appellant moved out of the apartment. The ex-girlfriend had returned home from work and was leaving to buy cigarettes when she saw Appellant in the apartment complex parking lot. She advised Appellant that she would speak to him when she returned but that he was not permitted to enter her apartment while she was gone. She took a taxi to the local Circle K and then returned. She entered her apartment to find Appellant inside and talking to the victim. The ex-girlfriend's eighteen-year-old son was asleep on a chair and the victim's five-year-old daughter was asleep on the couch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant, his ex-girlfriend, and the victim spoke cordially for about two hours. Appellant began to plead with his ex-girlfriend to leave the victim and resume her relationship with Appellant. At 4:00 a.m., Appellant was asked to leave. Appellant stood up and walked to the door but before exiting, he turned to his ex-girlfriend and asked her if she really wanted to stay with the victim. When she said yes, Appellant exited the apartment but then fired at least two shots inside, striking the victim in the forearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The ex-girlfriend called 911 and the police began searching for Appellant. The police initially could not locate Appellant, in part because he had not given his ex-girlfriend his real last name. However, officers eventually tracked Appellant down through use of his street name, \"Boog-E.\" Appellant was arrested and jailed on August 8, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant was indicted on one count of felonious assault, a felony of the second degree in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A), one count of improperly discharging a firearm into a habitation, a felony of the second degree in violation of R.C. 2923.161(A)(1), and one count of carrying a concealed weapon, a felony of the fourth degree in violation of R.C. 2923.12(A)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On December 15, 2016, Appellant was convicted by a jury on all three counts. On December 23, 2016, the trial court sentenced Appellant to seven years of incarceration on the felonious assault conviction, two years on the improper discharge conviction, and one year for carrying a concealed weapon. The court ordered the sentences to run consecutively, for an aggregate total of ten years of incarceration. We granted Appellant's motion for leave to file a delayed appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   APPELLANT'S RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL, AS GUARANTEED BY R.C. 2945.71 AND THE SIXTH AMENDMENT OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION AND ART. I, SEC. 10 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION WAS VIOLATED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant explains that, ordinarily, a defendant must be brought to trial within 270 days of his arrest. However, when the \"triple count provision\" applies, each day a defendant serves in jail counts as three days. In this case, Appellant argues\n   that the triple count provision applies and the state was required to bring him to trial within 90 days of his arrest. Appellant concedes that he filed numerous motions and had three different attorneys appointed to his case which tolled the speedy trial time. However, he argues that even after deducting the tolled events, he was not brought to trial until 293 days after his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In response, the state argues that, at worst, Appellant was brought to trial within 76 days of his arrest after deducting tolled time. The state urges that Appellant's own actions caused all but one of the continuances. As the state urges that the speedy trial clock does not resume following a continuance until the rescheduled trial occurs, it argues that all of the time between October 5, 2015 and December 13, 2016 was tolled. Thus, the state asserts that Appellant was actually brought to trial within 58 days once the tolled time is deducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Ohio recognizes both a constitutional and a statutory right to a speedy trial.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defen[s]e.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In addition to the Sixth Amendment, Ohio provides a statutory speedy trial right. R.C. 2945.73(B) provides: \"Upon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\" \"A person against whom a charge of felony is pending: * * * (2) Shall be brought to trial within two hundred seventy days after the person's arrest.\" R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). \"For purposes of computing time * * * each day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charge shall be counted as three days.\" R.C. 2945.71(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Review of a trial court's decision regarding a motion to dismiss based on a violation of the speedy trial provisions involves a mixed question of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Pursuant to R.C. 2945.72(H), the time in which a defendant must be brought to trial may be extended for the period of any reasonable continuance requested by the state or imposed\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   by the trial court. The continuance must be reasonable in both purpose and length.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell, supra,\n   </em>\n   citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Clow\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist. No. 01-CA-70,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%20924461\">\n    2002 WL 924461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (March 25, 2002), citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Regardless, the trial court's October 26, 2015 judgment entry states that the continuance was granted to allow an additional week for the state to receive reports from BCI. As such, the continuance and the length of time were reasonable. Regardless, the speedy trial time remained tolled because Appellant filed additional discovery requests. The speedy trial time remained tolled at 58 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The trial court scheduled a status conference for November 2, 2015. At the conference hearing, the trial court scheduled trial for December 8, 2015. Although Appellant argues on appeal that the trial court did not explain how it selected the trial date, it is apparent from the transcripts that the trial court worked with defense counsel's schedule in conjunction with the court's docket. For instance, at the hearing, defense counsel stated that he would be out of town for almost two weeks and had multiple trials scheduled after his return. The judge then stated that the first week of December was unavailable due to the court's docket. Thus, the judge arrived at the December 8, 2015 trial date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20} On November 24, 2015, the trial court ruled on Appellant's motion\n   for discovery, and the speedy trial clock resumed. At this point, Appellant's trial clock was still at 58 days. On December 7, 2015, the eve of trial, defense counsel filed a motion seeking discharge based on an alleged speedy trial violation, a motion in limine, and a motion for a change of venue. Accordingly, the trial court converted the December 8, 2015 trial date to a status conference for purposes of addressing the motions, and continued Appellant's trial. (12/4/15 J.E.) Motions in limine filed by a defendant automatically toll the running of speedy trial time.\n   <em>\n    State v.

On January 4, 2016, the trial court denied the speedy trial motion, permitted defense counsel to withdraw, and appointed new counsel. The appointment of new counsel due to a conflict with a defendant is a reasonable basis to continue a trial.\n   <em>\n    State v. Christian,\n   </em>\n   7th Dist.

On March 9, 2016, Appellant filed a motion for discharge on speedy trial grounds. On March 14, 2016, Appellant's March 9, 2016 motion for discharge and December 7, 2015 motion in limine were withdrawn by defense counsel. On April 25, 2016, Appellant filed a new motion for discharge and a new motion in limine. The trial court denied these on June 10, 2016. On July 5, 2016, Appellant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to dismiss. The trial court denied his motion on July 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The parties disagree as to the events that occurred between February 2, 2016 and June 10, 2016. They agree that the speedy trial time tolled on January 4, 2016 when new counsel was appointed. However, Appellant argues that the clock should have resumed running on February 2, 2016 when the status conference was held and new counsel attended. The state argues that the speedy trial time was tolled until May 3, 2016, which was the trial date set as a result of the January 4, 2016 continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 24} While this matter was pending, we released\n   <em>\n    State v.

At oral argument, Appellant conceded that\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   resolves this issue in favor of the state. In\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   , we addressed whether a delay in resetting a trial date after a continuance is granted tolls speedy trial time until the rescheduled trial date or whether time is tolled for a period of thirty days. Similar to the instant case, in\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   the trial court granted defendant's motion for a continuance and scheduled a pretrial conference but did not immediately set a new trial date. We held that the eight-month span between the trial court's decision to grant a continuance and the rescheduled trial date was properly tolled because the continuance was reasonable and the parties agreed on the new trial date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Here, the parties agree that the speedy trial time tolled on January 4, 2016 when the trial court permitted defense counsel to withdraw. In accordance with\n   <em>\n    Sims,\n   </em>\n   the clock remained tolled until May 3, 2016 (the next scheduled trial date), because the continuance was reasonable\n   and the record clearly demonstrates that Appellant's counsel, the prosecutor, and the trial court judge agreed at a status conference that May 3, 2016 was acceptable as a new trial date. (See 8/4/17 Transcript of Proceedings, p. 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The next issue is also resolved by\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   . Appellant contends that when the trial court denied his April 25, 2016 motions for discovery and in limine the speedy trial clock resumed running. Appellant argues these motions were denied on May 17, 2016. However, this record reflects that on April 25, 2016, the trial court continued the trial to allow the parties to brief the motions filed by Appellant and that these were denied June 10, 2016. On June 6, the court held a hearing and stated for the record: \"I believe we have agreed on some dates for future proceedings.\" (8/4/17 Transcript of Proceedings, p. 37.) At that time, Appellant's counsel and the state agreed that September 13, 2016 was an acceptable trial date. After the hearing, Appellant had filed his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to dismiss, on July 5, 2016. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   , the speedy trial time remained tolled until the new trial date, September 13, 2016, due to the reasonable continuance granted because of Appellant's April 25 and July 5, 2016 motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The final issue raised by Appellant is also resolved by\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   . On September 12, 2016, the eve of trial, Appellant's counsel again filed various motions, including one seeking to withdraw as counsel. The trial court held a status conference and the state expressed its concern that Appellant had requested new counsel on the brink of trial several times during the proceedings and had filed several motions to dismiss due to alleged speedy trial violations. The court acknowledged that there were legitimate concerns regarding Appellant's gamesmanship, but continued the trial because it was apparent Appellant's newly appointed counsel could not adequately prepare for trial in one day. On September 16, 2016, the trial court held a hearing and set a new trial date of December 13, 2016. The record demonstrates that Appellant's newest counsel could not appear for trial in September or October and the trial court had limited availability in November. It is clear from this record that counsel and the trial court worked together to obtain the earliest, satisfactory trial date. Thus, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   , the speedy trial time remained tolled until the trial date of December 13, 2016. Trial did commence on December 13, 2016. On this date, only 71 days of speedy trial time had accumulated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 28} As Appellant was tried within 90 days after his arrest when legitimate tolling events are considered, his first assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   APPELLANT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION OF COUNSEL AS GUARANTEED BY THE SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATE [SIC] CONSTITUTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Appellant makes three ineffective assistance of counsel arguments. First, he contends that he received ineffective assistance when his counsel failed to call the victim as a witness despite the fact that the victim provided a notarized letter stating that Appellant was not the shooter. Second, Appellant argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object when several witnesses testified that he was a drug dealer. Third, Appellant argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Det. Talbert's reference to a prior arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 30}\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In response, the state argues that defense counsel's failure to call the victim as an admittedly reluctant witness was trial strategy. The state explains that the victim's original statements to police clearly identified Appellant as the shooter. Even if the victim provided trial testimony favorable to Appellant, defense counsel would have been forced to address the inconsistency between such testimony and the unequivocal statements made by the victim immediately after the shooting. The state also argues that the defense had ample time to discuss potential testimony with the victim and there is nothing to suggest that counsel did not do so. As to the references to Appellant's status as drug dealer, the state argues that the limited references were relevant to the police officer's efforts in locating Appellant. Regardless, the state contends that Appellant has not demonstrated prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 31} To successfully assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellant must not only demonstrate that counsel's performance was deficient, he must also show resulting prejudice.\n   <em>\n    State v.

(7/5/16 Motion to Dismiss.) However, the victim stated in the letter that he would not testify and did not want to be involved with the case. The letter stated \"[t]his is my last time saying it I'm done with this case, So don't come or ask me to get on know stand about it [sic].\" (7/5/16 Motion to Dismiss.)

The ex-girlfriend also testified that Appellant was the shooter.

We can discern that the trial\n   court correctly imposed consecutive sentences at the sentencing hearing.

This omission reflects a clerical mistake that can be corrected by a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   entry.

However, while the trial court made appropriate consecutive sentencing findings at the sentencing hearing, the court failed to properly incorporate R.C. 2929.14(C) findings within its sentencing entry. Accordingly, Appellant's convictions are affirmed. Appellant's sentence is affirmed in part and remanded in part to obtain a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   entry correctly incorporating Appellant's consecutive sentence into the entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Robb, P.J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Donofrio, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
