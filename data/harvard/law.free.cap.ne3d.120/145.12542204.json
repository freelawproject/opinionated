This Court reverses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In December 2016, Clark was charged in a 30-count indictment with multiple counts of rape and gross sexual imposition involving a minor. The indictment included a sexually violent predator specification. The matter proceeded to a change of plea hearing, at which Clark was represented by counsel. Clark pleaded guilty to 3 counts of rape and 10 counts of gross sexual imposition. The remaining 2 counts of rape, 15 counts of gross sexual imposition, and the sexually violent predator specification were dismissed. A presentence investigation report was ordered, which is not a part of this Court's record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Following Clark's plea, his counsel filed a motion to withdraw. The trial court granted the motion at a hearing and appointed Clark new counsel. Thereafter, Clark, despite being represented by counsel, began to file several pro se motions, including one seeking to withdraw his plea and one seeking to represent himself. At a hearing, the trial court told Clark that he could not be both represented by counsel and represent himself. The trial court asked Clark to clarify what he wanted to do. Clark indicated that he did not want his attorney to represent him. The trial court then told Clark that it would make a determination between then and the time of the next hearing as to whether Clark could represent himself and noted that the trial court would have \"go through a pretty\n   long discussion\" with Clark about it before the trial court could allow it. In the interim, the trial court appointed the attorney who had been representing Clark as his standby counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At the beginning of the next hearing, the trial court noted that it had had a conversation with Clark about his right to counsel and Clark decided to proceed pro se. Clark confirmed that that was his decision. A hearing was then held on Clark's motion to withdraw his plea and briefs were also filed on this matter. Ultimately, the trial court denied Clark's motion to withdraw his plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Prior to sentencing, Clark filed a motion for the appointment of counsel, which the trial court granted. The trial court sentenced Clark to a term of 25 years to life in prison on each count of rape and 36 months in prison on each count of gross sexual imposition; the terms were ordered to run concurrently to each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Clark has appealed, raising four assignments of error for our review, which will be addressed out of sequence to facilitate our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE RECORD IS DEVOID OF A VOLUNTARY, KNOWING, AND INTELLIGENT WAIVER OF RIGHT TO COUNSEL BY APPELLANT AND IT WAS NOT DONE IN WRITING AND HIS CONVICTIONS MUST THEREFORE BE VACATED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Clark argues in his second assignment of error that the trial court failed to obtain a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of counsel from Clark. In so doing, Clark points out that the record contains no written waiver as required by Crim.R. 44(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant both the right to counsel and the right to elect self-representation instead.\" (Internal quotations and citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

This does not require the trial court to \"undertake pseudo-legal representation of a defendant * * * [as] a broader discussion of defenses and mitigating circumstances as applicable to the pending charges is sufficient.\" (Internal quotations and citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Yeager\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The facts of this case are somewhat unique. Clark was initially represented by counsel and pleaded guilty while represented. At the plea, the charges against Clark were read and the possible penalties were outlined.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the trial court asked a little about Clark's background but did not discuss his criminal history, if any. At the time of sentencing, Clark was also represented by counsel. However, as noted above, following the plea, Clark's original attorney was allowed to withdraw and a second attorney was appointed. Nonetheless, Clark began filing several motions pro se, including one to withdraw his plea and another seeking to represent himself. At a subsequent hearing, the trial court had a discussion with Clark about his wishes. The trial court thought Clark had not had an opportunity to speak with his new attorney but Clark clarified that he had. The trial court then stated, \"Having discussed this matter with your attorney, and having him explain to you about the serious nature of these matters, how it's very, very difficult for a layperson to represent [him]self on these matters, you've decided you want to proceed on your own. Is that correct?\" Clark responded affirmatively. The trial court then scheduled a hearing on Clark's motion to withdraw and informed Clark's second attorney that he was appointing him\n   as standby counsel. The trial court addressed Clark and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I'm going to make a determination between now and then, after we have a discussion on this matter, whether or not it is proper for you to represent yourself, if it is right in these circumstances that I've got to grant you your right to do so. I'm leaning toward it. It seems to be something that you pretty clearly want to do, but I have to go through a pretty long discussion with you about that, and I want to make sure you understand all of those things before you decide that \"Yes, I want to do that.\" And if you do, then I'm going to appoint [your second attorney] to sit in the back of the courtroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   And if we even stop the proceedings at any time, if you want to consult with an attorney, I'm going to give you that opportunity so you can. It's not a problem.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Immediately prior to the hearing on Clark's motion to withdraw his plea, the trial court stated that it had \"had a conversation\" with Clark \"concerning his right to counsel\" and Clark \"has determined to proceed without counsel.\" However, that \"conversation\" was not on the record. Clark verified that he wanted to proceed without counsel. While during the hearing on the motion to withdraw his plea, the trial court occasionally corrected Clark and noted that that was why he should have an attorney, no further discussions about Clark's right to counsel or the dangers of proceeding pro se were had. Further, no written waiver of Clark's right to counsel appears in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The State asserts that Clark's pro se motion to represent himself, filed while he was represented, and prior to any hearing on the matter, constitutes a written waiver. However, because it \"was filed before any of the discussions concerning the self-representation issue * * * this pro se motion clearly cannot amount to a waiver of [Clark's] right to counsel[.]\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1503069\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/103/385/\">\n    103 Ohio St.3d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-5471\">\n    2004-Ohio-5471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=816%20N.E.2d%20227\">\n    816 N.E.2d 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Moreover, while the record contains ample evidence that Clark did want to represent himself, and there was evidence that, at least at the time of the plea, the charges and penalties were discussed, we cannot say that the trial court sufficiently discussed the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation with Clark on the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-1121\">\n    2012-Ohio-1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 15. And while Clark had already pleaded guilty, he was seeking to represent himself at a hearing on a motion to withdraw his plea. That hearing involved calling witnesses and presenting evidence. Additionally, if Clark were to succeed on his motion to withdraw, he would then be faced with representing himself at trial as well. Given the foregoing, we conclude that the record fails to demonstrate that Clark's waiver of counsel was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. Further, in light of the fact that the trial court did not substantially comply with Crim.R. 44(A), the absence of a written waiver cannot constitute harmless error.\n   <em>\n    State v.
