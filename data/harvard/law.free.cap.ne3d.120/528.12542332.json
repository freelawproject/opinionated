Jones, Jr., appeals the trial court's decision denying his motion to suppress and his subsequent conviction for failure to inform, in violation of R.C. 2923.12(B)(1). For the reasons that follow, we vacate his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In March 2017, Jones was charged with failure to inform, using a weapon while intoxicated, and obstructing official business. The charges stemmed from an encounter with police in the early morning hours of March 18, 2017 outside the Hilton hotel in downtown Cleveland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Jones filed a motion to suppress contending that his arrest was unlawful. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion. Subsequently, Jones entered into a plea agreement with the city whereby he agreed to forfeit the firearm involved and plead no contest to the offense of failure to comply in exchange for the other offenses being nolled. The trial court sentenced Jones to 180 days in jail, with credit for three days\n   served, and the remaining 177 days suspended. Additionally, he was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and court costs with $600 of the fine suspended. Finally, Jones was ordered to serve one year of active probation that included a gun safety class and a substance abuse assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Jones now appeals, raising three assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Under R.C. 2937.07, when a court finds a defendant guilty after that defendant has entered a no contest plea, the record must provide an \"explanation of circumstances\" or factual basis that includes a statement of the facts supporting all of the essential elements of the offense.\n   <em>\n    Broadview Hts. v.

The city concedes that neither the prosecutor nor the court entered an explicit factual basis. However, the city maintains that this defect is not fatal because (1) the factual basis can be given at any time, including a previously-held suppression hearing or during sentencing; and (2) the court noted the police report number on the court's journal entry finding Jones guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The city acknowledges this court's precedent in\n   <em>\n    Middleburg Hts. v.
