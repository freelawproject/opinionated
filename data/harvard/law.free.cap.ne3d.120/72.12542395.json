Smith, filed suit against defendant-appellee, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (\"Nationwide\"), in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, alleging claims arising from the parties' unsuccessful efforts to position Smith as a Nationwide insurance agent. Nationwide filed a motion\n   to stay the proceedings based on an arbitration clause in an agreement between the parties. Smith appeals from the trial court's decision granting the motion to stay. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On October 6, 2016, Smith filed a complaint in the trial court alleging the following facts. In December 2011, representatives from Nationwide recruited Smith to join its Agency Capital Builder (\"ACB\") program, in which he was to receive the training and guidance necessary to one day open his own insurance agency. Nationwide's representatives told Smith that agents who completed the ACB program earned an annual salary of approximately $400,000, with established books of business valued at around $5 million. Relying on these representations, Smith resigned from his employment and signed the ACB agreement. He did not receive a copy of the agreement from Nationwide until three months after signing it. (Oct. 6, 2016 Compl. at \u00b6 1, 5-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The ACB agreement stated that it terminated 26 months after being signed. However, a participant who met certain sales and premium quotas before its termination would be eligible to participate in a \"Successor Program\" and receive a $25,000 bonus to use towards opening an agency. (Compl. at \u00b6 17.) The agreement also stated that Smith would receive marketing and sales training during the first three months of the program. Smith alleged that he did not receive any such training. (Compl. at \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Smith alleged that Nationwide took a number of actions that interfered with his ability to succeed in the program. According to Smith, Nationwide \"failed and refused to provide [him] with any training or guidance;\" forced him to \"stop selling insurance\" and instead work on a business plan for his agency; and fired his sales manager, forcing him to work without one for over four months before assigning him to a new one with \"no experience managing\" agents. (Compl. at \u00b6 20, 23 &amp; 26.) Smith blamed Nationwide's actions for his inability to finish the ACB program within the time period required to qualify for a bonus. (Compl. at \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Smith also alleged that after promising to do so, Nationwide refused to sell him an \"established\" book of business, and instead pushed him to buy two \"small, distressed\" books of business that had been serviced by unsuccessful members of the ACB program. (Compl. at \u00b6 28.) According to Smith, Nationwide vastly overinflated the value of those books and, in reliance on those representations, he took out a loan to purchase them. Smith also asserted that \"established books of business\" were actually available, but that \"Nationwide refused to offer\" them to him because they were comprised of Caucasian policyholders and he was an African-American. (Compl. at \u00b6 29.) Instead, Nationwide steered him to \"focus\" on minority communities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On April 2, 2014, Nationwide sent Smith an agreement to memorialize his status as an insurance agent and the servicing of the books of business he purchased. The agreement was captioned \"Advantage Program Independent Contractor/Exclusive Agent Master Agreement\" (hereinafter \"Advantage Agreement\"). (Compl. at \u00b6 34.) Smith alleges that he was told to electronically sign the Advantage Agreement the day it was sent, and that he was unable to print or download a copy of it because those features were \"disabled.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Smith asked Nationwide for a copy \"to discuss with an attorney prior to signing it,\" but the request\n   was denied. (Compl. at \u00b6 36.) Instead, Smith was told that if \"he did not sign it, he would not own his business\" and would be \"terminated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Fearing that he would lose the business he had grown during the ACB program, Smith signed the Advantage Agreement. He did not receive a copy of the 77-page agreement until \"several months later,\" and alleged that he did not even know if the agreement that Nationwide eventually provided was the same document he signed. (Compl. at \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Advantage Agreement contained performance goals based on a book of business with a value of approximately $725,000. It also required Smith to obtain his Series 6 and Series 63 licenses within six months, although Smith alleged that he was not informed of this requirement before leaving his pre-Nationwide employment. The Advantage Agreement characterized Smith as an independent contractor, but Nationwide controlled all aspects of his agency's business. According to Smith, Nationwide did not provide him with a full list of the policyholders in the books of business that he had purchased until over three months after signing the Advantage Agreement. During this time, he learned that over a quarter of the policies had been canceled or were being serviced by other agents. In addition, Smith failed to obtain the licensure required by the Advantage Agreement because he was working 60-70 hours per week to meet the agreement's performance goals. Smith alleged that Nationwide discriminated against him based on his race by providing similarly-situated Caucasian agents with books valued at $3 million or more, training, and guidance, and did not require them to obtain Series 6 or Series 63 licensure. (Compl. at \u00b6 40-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Smith alleges that on February 27, 2015, Nationwide terminated his \"employment\" and rescinded his books of business without compensating him for it. Smith filed suit against Nationwide on October 6, 2016. (Compl. at \u00b6 54.) Based on the foregoing allegations, his complaint stated claims against Nationwide for fraudulent inducement, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, and race discrimination. (Compl. at \u00b6 55-114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Citing the Advantage Agreement's arbitration clause, Nationwide filed a motion in the trial court on November 11, 2016 to dismiss, or, in the alternative, stay the proceedings pending arbitration under R.C. 2711.02. Smith opposed the motion, arguing that it was procedurally and substantively unconscionable, procured by fraud, and that Nationwide had breached the Advantage Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court sustained Nationwide's motion and stayed Smith's lawsuit pending arbitration, citing the stay issued in another case between Nationwide and a former agent based on an \"identical\" arbitration clause. (Jan. 6, 2017 Entry.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Smith appealed and asserts the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I. The trial court erred in staying this matter pending arbitration because the arbitration clause is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   II. The trial court erred in staying this matter pending arbitration because the arbitration clause was procured by fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   III.

FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Smith's first assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred when it granted Nationwide's motion for a stay because the arbitration clause in the Advantage Agreement is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable. Smith points to language in the agreement that gives Nationwide the right to change or alter the rules of arbitration at any time and the \"loser pays\" provision to demonstrate both procedural and substantive unconscionability. He also argues that the arbitration clause is procedurally unconscionable because there was no meeting of the minds when he signed the agreement, based on his assertion that the essential terms pertaining to the cost of arbitration were unknown to him and that he \"did not know what arbitration was\" at the time. (Appellant's Brief at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In response, Nationwide argues that neither the provisions that Smith points to nor any undisclosed costs of arbitration demonstrate procedural unconscionability. Nationwide also points to a login record that contradicts Smith's assertions regarding the limited timeframe allowed to view the agreement and describes him as a \"sophisticated business owner\" who was not in an inferior bargaining position. (Appellee's Brief at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Under R.C. 2711.02(B), a court must stay any proceedings in which an \"issue involved in the action is referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration\" upon application by one of the parties. Courts recognize that \"[a] presumption favoring arbitration arises when the claim in dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Aetna Fin.

For these reasons, Smith's assertion that this term was unknown to him is insufficient to demonstrate that he and Nationwide failed to reach a meeting of the minds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Smith also points to the \"difference in bargaining power\" between himself and Nationwide, which he characterizes as \"quite stark.\" (Appellant's Brief at 22.) Smith claims that he had only two options when presented with the Advantage Agreement: sign it or \"be terminated and forfeit the book of business\" he had built.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505413\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/79/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also claims that he \"did not know what arbitration was at the time he signed the Advantage Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505413\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/79/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Undoubtedly, some difference in bargaining power between Smith and Nationwide exists. However, Smith does not argue that the Advantage Agreement is a contract of adhesion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor is it a consumer contract, which \"necessarily engenders more reservations than an arbitration clause in a different setting, such as in a collective bargaining agreement, a commercial contract between two businesses, or a brokerage agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   at 472,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=700%20N.E.2d%20859\">\n    700 N.E.2d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Advantage Agreement is more akin to a commercial contract, as its purpose is to create an insurance agency business for the independent contractor. (Oct. 6, 2016 Compl., Ex. 2 at 1.) Furthermore, Smith had previously contracted with Nationwide when he entered into the ACB program. He worked with Nationwide for over two years before it presented him with the offer to enter the Advantage Program and become an independent agent. Given this familiarity with Nationwide and Smith's \"business acumen and experience\" in dealing with the company, we cannot conclude that the difference in bargaining power between the parties was great enough to support a finding of procedural unconscionability.\n   <em>\n    Tami Shearer, DVM\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In his final argument addressing procedural unconscionability, Smith asserts that Nationwide presented him with the 70-page Advantage Agreement on April 2, 2014 and told him he had to sign it the same day. (Appellant's Brief at 23.) In response, Nationwide cites to an exhibit it presented in the trial court of a time-stamped log showing that Smith was sent an invitation to view the documents on March 28, 2014, but did not view them until April 2, 2014. On that day, he viewed them in the late morning, then again nine hours later before signing them. (Appellee's Brief at 26-28.) In reply, Smith asserts that his \"recollection is different\" than the log and points to his inability to print the documents out. (Reply Brief at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Regardless of whether Smith was able to physically print out the documents, he had five days to review the contents of the Advantage Agreement, as well as all of the arbitration rules and procedures. \"A party entering a contract has a responsibility to learn the terms of\n   the contract prior to agreeing to its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Brewer v. Dowell &amp; Jones, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

While these circumstances were perhaps not ideal, they do not amount to a level of procedural unconscionability that would justify not enforcing the arbitration clause that Smith had the opportunity to read and understand before signing it. Accordingly, we reject the argument that the circumstances of the formation of the arbitration clause in the Advantage Agreement were procedurally unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Because Smith cannot demonstrate that the arbitration clause was procedurally unconscionable, we need not address the issue of substantive unconscionability, as he must show both to demonstrate the overall unconscionability of the clause.\n   <em>\n    Taylor Bldg. Corp.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. \"The failure to demonstrate either type of unconscionability alleviates the need to address the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Tami Shearer, DVM\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor Bldg. Corp.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52 (stating that \"[t]he conclusion that the arbitration clause here is not procedurally unconscionable defeats the [plaintiffs'] contention that the arbitration clause is unenforceable due to unconscionability\"). Because the arbitration clause in the Advantage Agreement was not unconscionable, the trial court did not err by granting Nationwide's request for a stay pending arbitration. Accordingly, the first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In his second assignment of error, Smith argues that the trial court erred by granting the stay pending arbitration because the Advantage Agreement was procured by fraud. Because a court must determine that a contract is valid and enforceable before sending it to arbitration, Smith argues that the trial court erred by not analyzing his allegations of fraud.

He alleges that the Advantage Agreement as a whole \"was procured by fraud.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 56.) In count one, where Smith details his fraud claim, he alleges that Nationwide made multiple false representations to induce him to join the ACB program and the Advantage Program and to sign the agreements, including misrepresenting the value of the book of business he was required to buy, his responsibilities under the Advantage Agreement, and his potential income from participating in the program. (Compl. at \u00b6 59-68.) However, the fraud allegations do not even mention the arbitration agreement. Under\n   <em>\n    ABM Farms, Inc.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Battle\n   </em>\n   , these allegations do not defeat the validity\n   of the arbitration provision in the Advantage Agreement.

Third Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In Smith's third assignment of error, he argues that the trial court should not have granted a stay pending arbitration because Nationwide's breach of the Advantage Agreement rendered it unenforceable.

(Compl. at \u00b6 28-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Neither\n   <em>\n    Waste Mgt.\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Midwest Payment Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   addressed a dispute over the arbitrability of a contract or the enforcement of an arbitration provision. Both cases concerned contract disputes resolved by trial courts on summary judgment. No party sought or resisted arbitration in either case.\n   <em>\n    Waste Mgt.\n   </em>\n   at 1088-89 (sustaining in part and overruling in part a motion for partial summary judgment, ruling that the defendant materially breached its obligation to indemnify the plaintiff for any liability arising from sale of a landfill);\n   <em>\n    Midwest Payment Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (ruling that the defendant repudiated a contract between a bank it had acquired and the plaintiff by transferring data processing services to another vendor). Neither case supports Smith's argument, which assumes that a trial court must make a factual finding concerning a party's allegation of breach before issuing a stay for the arbitration of their dispute. Simply put, litigating the issue of breach to determine an agreement's arbitrability would defeat the purpose of arbitration, which is \"to avoid needless and expensive litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Springfield v.

(Oct. 6, 2016 Compl., Ex. 2 at \u00b6 35.) Smith is free to argue in arbitration that a proposition of contract law set forth in\n   <em>\n    Waste Mgt.\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Midwest Payment Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   controls, and he may urge the arbitrator to apply the principle to the parties' dispute. However, the trial court did not err by declining to do so. Accordingly, the third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Based on our de novo review of the arbitration clause in the parties' agreement, we conclude that it was not unconscionable. Furthermore, Smith's claims of fraud and material breach of the agreement do not defeat Nationwide's right to have the arbitration clause enforced. For these reasons, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it granted Nationwide's motion to stay pending arbitration and refer Smith's claims to arbitration. Accordingly, Smith's three assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   KLATT and DORRIAN, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Smith's reply brief asserts that the Advantage Agreement has a \"one-sided, adhesive nature,\" and suggests for the first time that it is one of adhesion.
