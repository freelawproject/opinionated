He challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the issuance of the protective order, and he also asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting certain hearsay evidence during the hearing. Finding the evidence sufficient and that any error in the admission of evidence was harmless, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   [2] B.C. and M.R. began dating and started cohabiting in 2004. In 2011, a court granted B.C. de facto custody of her two-year-old granddaughter, L.M. B.C., L.M., and M.R. lived together as a family for several years. Although L.M. was not related to M.R., she still referred to him as \"grandpa.\" Tr. Vol. 2 at 16. B.C. and M.R. started experiencing relationship troubles, and sometime in 2017, B.C. moved out of the home, taking L.M. with her. The parties reconciled briefly in early 2018, and B.C. and L.M. moved back in with M.R. However, in May 2018, B.C. decided the relationship was over. She subsequently removed all her belongings from the home, and she and L.M. moved out. B.C. wished to have no more contact with M.R. and asked him to \"leave [her] alone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. B.C. got married to another man in July 2018. This resulted in a lot of \"animosity\" between the former couple.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [3] Thereafter, M.R. attended several of L.M.'s softball games despite B.C.'s requests that he not do so. M.R. often spoke to or made inappropriate comments to B.C., her husband, and L.M. This made B.C. upset. One time M.R. was driving by in his truck after the game, and B.C. heard him say something directed to nine-year-old L.M. about B.C. sleeping with multiple men.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. On another occasion, M.R. waited in his truck for B.C. to leave the ballpark, and then he followed her car through town. On yet another occasion he approached B.C. and L.M. in the concession line. B.C. asked to be left alone, but M.R. followed them as they walked. B.C. felt unsafe, so she asked a male friend, who also happens to be a police officer, to escort her and L.M. to their car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. M.R. still followed and then stood behind B.C.'s car until the officer had to ask him to step out of the way so B.C. could leave. This caused a \"very uncomfortable situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [4] During this same period of time, M.R. mailed letters to B.C.'s home and place of employment, and he also called B.C. at work on one or two occasions to express his anger about the fact that she\n   left him and married another man. M.R. called B.C.'s friends and several members of her family to talk about B.C., and he additionally called Child Protective Services on B.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [5] On June 14, 2018, B.C. filed a petition for a protective order against M.R. alleging that M.R. had committed stalking. Following a hearing held on August 10, 2018, the trial court entered its order granting B.C.'s request for a protective order. Specifically, the order provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. [M.R] is hereby enjoined from threatening to commit or committing acts of domestic or family violence, stalking, or sex offenses against [B.C.] and the following designated family or household members, if any;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. [M.R.] is prohibited from harassing, annoying, telephoning, contacting, or directly or indirectly communicating with [B.C.], except: [M.R.] is allowed to visit child, [L.M.], at the ballpark. [M.R.] is allowed to visit the same church, The Church of the Nazarene, but will have no communication with [B.C.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appealed Order at 2. This appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion and Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [6] We begin by noting that B.C. has not filed an appellee's brief.

The trial court heard the testimony and observed witness demeanor; M.R.'s arguments on appeal are merely requests for us to reweigh the evidence and reassess witness credibility, and we cannot. We agree with the trial court that, although M.R.'s behavior was not overly \"egregious,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42, B.C. presented sufficient evidence of stalking to support the issuance of a protective order.

In issuing the protective order, the trial court focused on M.R.'s harassment of B.C., and how that caused her to feel intimidated and threatened. The trial court made it abundantly clear that the order is intended to protect B.C., and not L.M., from M.R. Indeed, although the order prohibits M.R. from contacting or communicating with B.C., the language of the order permits M.R. some contact with L.M. Accordingly, we are confident that B.C.'s testimony regarding L.M.'s statements did not impact the trial court's decision to issue the protective order in this case, and therefore, any erroneous admission of evidence did not affect M.R.'s substantial rights. The trial court's protective order is affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    [15] Affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Vaidik, C.J., concurs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Mathias, J., concurs in result with opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Mathias, Judge, concurring in result.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    [16] I concur with the result in this case but write separately to comment on the admissibility of hearsay in civil protection order proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    [17] First, I observe that due to serious and immediate concerns for his or her safety, a petitioner may request an\n    <em>\n     ex parte\n    </em>\n    order of protection.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-26-5-9\">\n     Ind.

For these reasons, we may reasonably assume that in\n    <em>\n     ex parte\n    </em>\n    proceedings courts frequently rely on hearsay to determine whether an\n    <em>\n     ex parte\n    </em>\n    protective order should be issued.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    [18] In addition, petitions for civil orders of protection may be heard in any court of record, including small claims courts.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-26-5-4\">\n     Ind.

However, a party who files his or her petition in superior or circuit court must proceed under a different and more complex evidentiary standard.
