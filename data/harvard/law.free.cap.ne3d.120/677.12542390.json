Evans, appeals from a judgment of a single justice of this court denying her petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. We affirm.\n  <footnotemark>\n   2\n  </footnotemark>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-13\">\n  The respondent, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), purchased Evans's home at a foreclosure sale in March 2015 and then commenced a summary process eviction action against Evans in October 2015. The summary process trial was continued several times, at least in part because of discovery disputes between the parties, but was eventually scheduled to commence on June 8, 2016. On that day, Evans filed a motion for a continuance and for a reasonable accommodation on the basis of a disability.\n  <footnotemark>\n   3\n  </footnotemark>\n  Before the judge ruled on these motions, Evans left the court house. The judge denied the motions, and because Evans was not present for trial, a default judgment for possession entered against her. Evans's motion to vacate the judgment was denied, and she subsequently filed a notice of appeal. Over the next several months, Evans filed numerous motions to stay execution of the judgment, in both the Housing Court and the Appeals Court, to allow her time to pursue her appeal. She successfully secured a stay, but was ordered to make monthly use and occupancy payments while the appeal was pending. After Evans failed to make use and occupancy payments for several months, Freddie Mac levied on its execution for possession of the property on May 4, 2017. On that same day, Evans filed, and the single justice denied, a G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition as well as another motion to stay.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-14\">\n  In her appeal to this court, Evans argues, among other things, that the Housing Court judge erred in denying her request for a reasonable accommodation; erred in violating a Federal Bankruptcy Court automatic stay order; and, more generally, violated her right to due process. She asks the court for various forms of relief, including reversing the Housing Court's \"erroneous rulings\" and vacating the Housing Court's void judgments. The petitioner has not, however, met her burden \"to demonstrate the absence or inadequacy of other remedies,\" as she must for the purposes of G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.\n  <em>\n   Russell\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   Nichols\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080043\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/1015/#p1016\">\n   434 Mass. 1015\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 1016,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=750%20N.E.2d%201008\">\n   750 N.E.2d 1008\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (2001). In fact, she has not even addressed the issue. As we further explain today in the\n  <em>\n   Adjartey\n  </em>\n  case, we recognize the challenges that self-represented litigants may face in summary process actions, but this does negate the statutory requirement. Relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is \"properly denied\n  where there are adequate and effective routes other than [G. L.] c. 211, \u00a7 3, by which the petitioning party may seek relief.\"\n  <em>\n   Greco\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   Plymouth Sav. Bank\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1028037\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/423/1019/#p1019\">\n   423 Mass. 1019\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 1019,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=672%20N.E.2d%20535\">\n   672 N.E.2d 535\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (1996). This applies to self-represented litigants as well as those who are represented by counsel. See\n  <em>\n   International Fid. Ins. Co\n  </em>\n  . v.\n  <em>\n   Wilson\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"908732\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/387/841/#p847\">\n   387 Mass. 841\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 847,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20N.E.2d%201308\">\n   443 N.E.2d 1308\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (1983) (unrepresented litigants are bound by same rules of procedural and substantive law as represented litigants).\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-15\">\n  For example, Evans could have sought review of the denial of her motion to vacate void judgments, which she filed pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (4),\n  <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20828\">\n   365 Mass. 828\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (1974), in a direct appeal. See\n  <em>\n   Brown\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   Federal Nat'l Mtge. Ass'n\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540900\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/116/30/#p1037\">\n   481 Mass. 1036\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 1037,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540900\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/116/30/#p1037\">\n   116 N.E.3d 30\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (2019) (denial of motion to vacate void judgment can be addressed in direct appeal). This is equally true of the denial of any recusal request. See\n  <em>\n   Hilton\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   Central Div. of the Hous. Court Dep't\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12542389\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/120/674/\">\n   481 Mass. 1047\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12542389\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/120/674/\">\n   120 N.E.3d 674\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201549063\">\n   2019 WL 1549063\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (2019). Similarly, if Evans believed she was prejudiced by a judge's erroneous denial of her requests for reasonable accommodations, she could have raised that claim in a direct appeal.\n  <footnotemark>\n   4\n  </footnotemark>\n  To the extent that Evans argues that the Housing Court denied her request for assembly of the record, thus preventing her from pursuing her appeal, her argument on this point is not well developed. And while the Housing Court docket does indicate that a motion to assemble the record was denied, the basis for the denial is not clear; in any event, the denial of such a motion is also subject to appellate review in the form of a direct appeal.
