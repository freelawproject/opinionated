On July 20, 2015, appellee was operating his 1995 Mercedes Benz 600 Series on the Ohio Turnpike. At approximately 11:00 a.m., appellee's car caught on fire while it was on the turnpike. The fire department arrived shortly afterwards and contained the fire. While the car was on fire, it emitted discharges which damaged the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant had the damage to the road repaired. The total amount of the repair was $14,882.76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On January 9, 2017, appellant filed this action against appellee seeking the costs of the repairs to the road. Appellant raised two claims: one for negligence and one for negligence per se. Appellant's negligence claim asserted that appellee had a duty to maintain his car, appellee breached that duty when he did not properly maintain his car and the car caught on fire, and the fire proximately caused damage to the road. Appellant's negligence per se claim asserted that appellee's operation of his car was a violation of R.C. 4513.02 and that the said violation proximately caused damage to the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment. Appellee's motion made three arguments. First, appellee argued that he owed no duty to appellant because the injury to the road by way of appellee's car catching on fire was unforeseeable. Second, appellee argued that his car was state certified for safe operation approximately three months prior to the car fire. Third, appellee argued that R.C. 4513.02 is\n   a general duty statute and is inapplicable to negligence per se claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant filed a response to appellee's motion for summary judgment. Appellant argued that appellee was the sole owner and operator of the car. As the sole owner and operator, appellant argued that appellee had a common law duty to properly maintain his car which was breached when it was not properly maintained and caught fire. Appellant argued that appellee had a statutory duty pursuant to R.C. 4513.02 and Ohio Admin.Code 5537-5-01(C) to not operate an unsafe vehicle on public roads. Appellant additionally argued that under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, an inference of appellee's negligence should be permitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. It noted that appellant's responses to summary judgment contained only one exhibit, an affidavit. This affidavit only addressed a discovery dispute. Based on a review of the pleadings and filings relating to summary judgment, the trial court granted appellee's motion. Appellant timely filed this appeal on September 12, 2017. It raises three assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant's first assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT'S ORDER GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT LEAVES ALMOST NOTHING TO REVIEW FROM ITS TEXT AND TURNS THIS COURT INTO A TRIAL COURT ON REVIEW.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant argues that it is unclear whether the trial court thoroughly examined all of the materials before making its ruling on summary judgment and argues that the trial court's failure to explain its reasoning on why it granted summary judgment effectively turns this Court into another trial court to conduct said review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant cites this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Scassa v.

In this case, the trial court's judgment entry indicates that it reviewed the summary judgment filings. Because a trial court is not required to explain its reasoning regarding a summary judgment ruling and because the trial court reviewed all of the summary judgment filings, there is no error by the trial court in not explaining its reasoning for granting summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Accordingly, appellant's first assignment of error lacks merit and is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} For ease of discussion, we will address appellant's second and third assignments of error together. Both assignments\n   of error assert summary judgment was improper and both are governed by the same standard of review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} An appellate court reviews a trial court's summary judgment decision de novo, applying the same standard used by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Ohio Govt.

His affidavit states that a few months prior to his car catching on fire, he took his car in for its annual inspection. (Vlasach Aff. \u00b6 8). His vehicle passed inspection subject to purchasing new tires which he immediately did. (Vlasach Aff. \u00b6 9-10). Between the inspection and the fire, appellee operated his car only once or twice.
