Green (Green), motion for judgment on the pleadings, concluding that Green was entitled to a cash payout of her paid-time-off (PTO) as a form or earned wages under Indiana's Wage Payment Statute at the time of her resignation as a probation officer from the Hendricks County Courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [2] We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [3] The County presents us with two issues on appeal, which we restate as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) Whether the County may decline to pay cash for unused PTO pursuant to Indiana's Wage Payment Statute and in accordance with the County's employee manual; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) Whether the Wage Payment Statute waives sovereign immunity even though the Statute is silent as to whether it applies to government entities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [4] Green worked as a probation officer for the Hendricks County Courts from October 1993 until her voluntary resignation on September 29, 2017. At the time of her resignation, Green had accrued 331 hours of unused PTO. Instead of taking the time off, she sought to recover the accumulated hours as a cash payment pursuant to the provisions of the employee manual for the Hendricks County Probation Department, which stated that \"[r]egardless of notice given, upon resignation, the Department shall pay for personal time which has accrued not exceeding 420 hours.\" (Appellant's App. Vol. II, p. 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [5] The County maintains that its own employee manual which sets the policies applicable to all County employees is applicable to probation officers. Pursuant to the County's manual, employees are not granted a cash payout for PTO when they resign. Instead, \"[a]ccrued PTO will only be paid out upon retirement or disability retirement to eligible employees.\" (Appellant's App. Vol. II, p. 87). This policy was sent to all County employees and it is undisputed that Green received a copy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [6] On or about October 6, 2017, the Hendricks County Courts sought an appropriation from the County to pay Green's accrued and unused PTO. The County Council rejected the request, voting 7-0 to deny because \"if this payout was awarded, contrary to [the County] Policy Manual, there would be a good argument for other employees to receive the same standing.\" (Appellant's App. Vol. II, p. 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [7] On November 21, 2017, Green filed a Complaint against the County and the Hendricks County Courts, seeking a cash payment of her accumulated PTO pursuant to the Indiana Wage Payment Statute. The County answered the Complaint and moved for summary judgment on February 22, 2018. Green opposed the motion for summary judgment and, on March 9, 2018, moved for judgment on the pleadings, claiming a right to her PTO payment as a matter of law. On June 11, 2018, the trial court denied the County's motion for summary judgment. On September 28, 2018, following a hearing, the trial court entered an Order concluding that Green is \"adjudged to be employed by the Hendricks County Courts and entitled to compensation in the principal amount of $11,075.26.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Appellant's App. Vol. II, p. 11). The trial court reached this conclusion holding that \"The Hendricks County Courts, and not [the County] (fiscal body), sets the salary and controls the terms, condition, and privileges of Probation Officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2011-13-1-1\">\n    Ind.

The judiciary is an independent branch of the government and is constitutionally obligated to keep the courts open for the administration of justice. Ind. Const. art. 1 \u00a7 12. The power of the judiciary is, therefore of necessity, coequal to its duties.\n   <em>\n    Knox Co. Council v. State ex. rel.

Because courts are constitutionally obligated to be open and because the operation of a probation office is a court-related function, the courts have the corresponding constitutional power to pay probation officers at a level sufficient to attract and maintain qualified personnel.\n   <em>\n    Noble Co.

I.C. \u00a7 11-13-1-8(b)(2). Using a\n   central judicial entity with special expertise to establish minimum salary levels for probation officers, rather than having separate determinations in each county, is more efficient and insures fairness and some degree of uniformity in the setting of salaries by trial courts statewide.\n   <em>\n    Matter of Madison Co.

The salary schedule must comply with the minimum compensation requirements for probation officers adopted by the judicial conference of Indiana under I.C. \u00a7 11-13-1-8.\" I.C. \u00a7 36-2-16.5-3. As such, the county, city, or town fiscal body shall fix the salary of a probation officer based on the salary schedule adopted under this chapter. I.C. \u00a7 36-2-16.5-4. \"Unless otherwise specified in the salary schedule, a probation officer is entitled to the same benefits, holidays, and hours as other county, city, or town employees.\" I.C. \u00a7 36-2-16.5-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [14] Focusing on I.C. \u00a7 36-2-16.5-5's promulgation that \"a probation officer is entitled to the same benefits\" as other county employees, the County contends that the trial court's Order to require the County to make a cash payment of Green's PTO violates the County's policy for its employees, as the County's own employee manual unequivocally prohibits the use of County funds to pay unused PTO when-as in the case before us-an employee resigns. On the other hand, Green characterizes the PTO as a deferred compensation which, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 36-2-16.5-5, is not regulated by the County's employee manual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [15] \"Deferred payment of compensation that accrued during an employee's tenure is a wage.\"\n   <em>\n    Swift v.

App. 1983) (internal quotations omitted), which involved a dispute about vacation time, we concluded, as an issue of first impression, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [v]acation pay is in the nature of deferred compensation in lieu of wages earned each week the employee works, and is payable at some later time. An agreement to give vacation pay to employees made before they perform their service, and based upon the length of service and time worked is not a gratuity but rather is in the form of compensation services. And when the services are rendered, the right to receive the promised compensation is vested, as much as the right to receive wages or other forms of compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCausland v. Walter USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7212401\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/918/420/#p427\">\n    918 N.E.2d 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 427 (Ind. Ct. App. 2009) (\"compensated vacation pay is considered a wage and is subject to the provisions of the Wage Payment Statute.\") As such, employment compensation and wages are contingent on working, whereas an employment benefit is independent and exclusive\n   of an employee's actual work schedule. Accordingly, as Green's PTO is a deferred compensation which must be considered as part of her wages, her PTO is not subject to the confines of I.C. \u00a7 36-2-16.5-5, which by its own explicit terms does not include deferred compensation or wages, and therefore the PTO cannot be regulated by the County's employee manual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [16] In an effort to bring PTO within the list of benefits regulated by I.C. \u00a7 36-2-16.5-5, the County points to the General Assembly's mandate that probation officers must receive at least the minimum salary set by a schedule promulgated by the Judicial Center of Indiana.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 36-2-16.5-3 ; 11-13-1-8. This minimum salary, as determined by the Judicial Center of Indiana, is \"the gross salary paid to a probation officer and does not include the employer's contributions to PERF/retirement program, disability, medical or other insurance programs, or deferred compensation.\" (Appellant's App. Vol. II, p. 113). The Judicial Center of Indiana categorizes gross salary and deferred compensation as two separate items; at the same time, the definition also distinguishes deferred compensation from an employer's contributions to the employee's benefits of PERF/retirement program, disability, and medical or other insurance programs. Therefore, it is clear that even the Judicial Center of Indiana does not view deferred compensation as an equivalent to employee's benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [17] Moreover, the County's own employee manual belies the fact that probation officers must be treated similar to other County employees. Page (i) of the County's handbook states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   while these personnel policies apply to most County employees, they do not apply to all employees. Elected Officials, unless otherwise provided by law, are generally exempt from these policies. Likewise, employees of Hendricks County courts should confirm with their respective court whether they are covered by these policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Appellant's App. Vol. II, p. 45). The Hendricks County Courts' request, seeking an appropriation from the County to pay Green's accrued and unused PTO, clearly signaled that the courts considered the County's PTO policy inapplicable to probation officers, as they are employees of the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [18] As established court employees, probation officers' salaries are fixed by the courts through the Judicial Conference of Indiana and are paid out of the county or city treasury. Because judicial precedents categorize deferred compensation as wages or salary, the determination as to whether deferred compensation can be cashed out falls statutorily within the ambit of the judiciary, as I.C. \u00a7 36-2-16.5-5 expressly mandates only benefits to be within the province of the executive branch,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the County. Therefore, we affirm the trial court's Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Sovereign Immunity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [19] Even though we find that Green has a viable claim and is entitled to\n   a cash payment for PTO, the County now contends that its sovereign immunity under the Wage Payment Statute nevertheless bars Green's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [20] A statutory claim against the government exists only when a statute \"clearly evinces\" the General Assembly's intention to waive sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    Esserman v.

The failure of the Legislature to change the Statute to exclude governmental employers in light of these decisions supports our supreme court's extended interpretation of the Statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of Infant Child Baxter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9081568\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/799/1057/#p1062\">\n    799 N.E.2d 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1062 (Ind. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [22] The Wage Payment Statute clearly envisages employees, public or private, as the persons included in the Statute and there is no reason to believe it was the intent of the Legislature to exclude the County from liability under the Statute. County employees rely on their wages to the same extent as employees in the private sector, and nothing in the Wage Payment Statute supports excluding them\n   from its protection. Accordingly, as it is undeniable that the County is a body politic, it is subject to the Wage Payment Statute and cannot claim sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [23] Based on the foregoing, we hold that, as court employees, probation officers are entitled to a cash payout of unused PTO in accordance with the Court's employee manual and the County is not entitled to sovereign immunity under the Wage Payment Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [24] Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [25] Kirsch, J. and Robb, J. concur\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Appellant-Defendant, Hendricks County Courts, filed a notice of non-involvement with this court as it does not have an interest in this appeal. We accepted the notice on January 31, 2018. However, facts with respect to Hendricks County Courts will be included in so far as they are relevant to this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    We acknowledge that the Probation Officers Professional Association of Indiana, Inc. filed an\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    Brief with this court in support of Green.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The County also maintains that the trial court's Order acts as a mandate of funds without applying the mandate protection of Indiana Trial Rule 60.5. The County is correct that, if the trial court had ordered Green to be paid and the County had refused to pay her, the Trial Rule 60.5 mandate procedure could be employed to order that the funds be paid to Green. However, this is not yet the dispute before us. Rather, here the parties' argument revolves around the applicability of the County's employee manual in light of I.C. \u00a7 36-2-16.5-5, and thus the trial court's Order is more akin to a declaratory judgment. Moreover, a mandate ordering a county to release funds must be initiated by a court as there is no private cause of action to compel a mandate of funds.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    T.R. 60.5;\n    <em>\n     Knoebel v.
