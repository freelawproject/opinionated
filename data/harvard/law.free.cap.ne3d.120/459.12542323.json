We affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On February 22, 2017, appellant filed an amended\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   complaint against appellee\n   and her daughter, Angie Seymour (\"Seymour\"), alleging common-law negligence and negligence per se. According to the complaint, on or about July 19, 2015, a dog owned, kept, or harbored by the defendants on a residential premises located in Franklin County, Ohio attacked and bit appellant. The amended complaint alleged that appellant suffered injuries to his left eye, nose, and cheek as a direct and proximate result of the defendants' failure to confine and/or restrain the dog and/or failure to control the dog and that the injuries resulted in damages. Furthermore, the amended complaint alleged that the defendants knew or reasonably should have known the dog was vicious, and keeping a vicious dog would cause an unsafe environment creating a potential risk to area residents. As a result, the amended complaint alleged that the defendants were negligent and/or violated R.C. 955.22 and 955.28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment on May 9, 2017 supported by the affidavit and deposition of appellee and the depositions of appellant's mother, S.F., and Seymour. According to S.F.'s deposition, appellant was playing cops and robbers in the grassy area beside the fence separating appellant's yard from Seymour's yard, where the dog was located. Appellant stopped to look at the dog and put his hand on the fence. At that point, the dog \"ran, climbed up and over [the fence] and got him.\" (S.F. Dep. at 40.) In her motion, appellee argued that appellant's claims must be dismissed because appellee is not the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog that bit appellant. Appellee provided that all the evidence in the case showed Seymour was the owner and keeper of the dog. Moreover, appellee argued that she was not the \"harborer\" of the dog because the evidence demonstrated that appellee had neither possession nor control of the premises where the dog lived. (Mot. For Summ. Jgmt. at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Specifically, appellee contended that undisputed evidence shows that appellee rents the property to Seymour and acts as landlord. It is undisputed that appellee purchased the property without contribution from Seymour, that both appellee and Seymour are on the deed to the property, and Seymour pays appellee $675 per month to live on the property. Appellee testified that the money is rent and is \"kind of going toward the purchase of the property\" and averred that Seymour leased the premises from a company run by appellee and her husband \"for the purpose of renting out rental properties.\" (Appellee Dep. at 22; Appellee Aff. at 2.) Seymour testified that her plan to get a loan and pay off her mother fell through, and she continued to pay a monthly amount of $675 to her mother to live at the property. Furthermore, appellee averred that she did not maintain control over the premises and that the property was a single-family residence with no common areas. Appellee testified that she normally calls to see if somebody is home before she goes to the property and will knock on the door and wait for an answer prior to entering the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Regarding the common-law negligence claims, in her motion appellee further argued that the evidence showed appellee had no reason to know of any alleged vicious propensity of the dog prior to the incident. Appellee testified in her deposition that she was unaware if the dog ever attacked or bit another animal or person and averred that she was not aware of any incidents involving the dog causing injury to any person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to appellee's motion for summary judgment on May 30, 2017. Within it, appellant first argued that the evidence showed appellee was the sole owner, rather\n   than the co-owner of the home. Appellant maintained that appellee retained possession and control of the property as sole-owner because she never transferred any of her interest to her daughter through a written contract, in violation of the statute of frauds. To appellant, appellee's statement that the property was Seymour's \"is belied by the fact that * * * Seymour pays [appellee] $675 a month to live there.\" (Appellant's Resp. at 13.) Appellant then argued that appellee exercised control over the property. As evidence of control, appellant cited the mother-daughter relationship between appellee and Seymour, appellee essentially purchasing the house for Seymour and allowing Seymour to live there indefinitely, appellee working on house projects (such as painting, putting carpet down, installing a toilet, and fixing up the kitchen), appellee living one-half mile from the property, and appellee having an open invitation to visit and unrestricted access to the unlocked home. Furthermore, according to appellant, appellee testified that she would have told Seymour to get rid of her dogs if she thought they were biting or attacking people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant also argued that a question of fact remains as to whether appellee knew the dog was vicious so as to impose liability. Appellant contended that it \"defies credulity\" appellee would not know about prior incidents involving the dog, including Seymour receiving a citation for the dog not being registered because the dog was running loose, the dog killing kittens that Seymour's daughter had put in a bag on a table in the home, and the dog attacking another dog and appellee allegedly taking the dog away in her car before animal control arrived. (Appellant's Resp. at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellee filed a reply on June 2, 2017, whereby she argued that appellant misstated the law on statute of frauds, as landlord-tenant law supersedes the statute of frauds in regard to whether a lease may be written. As such, appellee argued that Seymour's oral lease with appellee is valid under Ohio law, and, therefore, it is presumed by law that Seymour had possession and control over the premises. According to appellee, appellant has done nothing to rebut this presumption. Appellee has never resided in the property and would not enter the property without calling and knocking on the door first. Regardless of any alleged awareness of the vicious nature of the dog, which appellee did not concede, no genuine issues of material fact remain, and appellee is entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to whether appellee was a \"harborer,\" which is the threshold issue for both statutory and common-law negligence liability. (Appellee's Reply at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On June 29, 2017, the trial court filed a decision and entry granting appellee's motion for summary judgment. The trial court discussed that under both common law and strict liability for dog bites, it must first be shown that the defendant is the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog before liability can be imposed. The trial court concluded that based on the undisputed evidence, appellee did not have the requisite possession and control of the property and therefore was not a harborer of the dog-the only issue in dispute. The trial court found the lack of a written lease and the personal relationship as mother and daughter did not defeat summary judgment in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On August 17, 2017, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellant against Seymour based on both strict statutory liability and common-law negligence. A magistrate awarded appellant damages against Seymour in the amount of $130,199.20. After overruling Seymour's objections, the trial court\n   adopted the magistrate's decision indicating that the decision was a final and appealable order, and there is no just cause for delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant filed a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Appellant recognizes, after\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   , this court, in\n   <em>\n    Coontz\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18, identified\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   as an outlier to established law in Ohio and the precedent of this court but contends the point we made in\n   <em>\n    Coontz\n   </em>\n   is irrelevant to the present case as Seymour did not have exclusive possession of the property here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Appellee counters that appellant never raised the \"co-owner\" issue to the trial court and thus waived it for appellate review. Regardless, appellee contends that co-ownership in and of itself does not impose liability where the co-owner is out of possession and control of the premises where the dog bite occurs. Appellee maintains that she was not in possession of the property, leased the property to Seymour, and did not have control over the property.

There was no written lease, and the daughter paid them monthly rent equal to the mortgage in addition to paying property taxes, insurance, and utilities. The daughter was responsible for yard work and maintaining the property. The parents never resided in the residence but did have keys to it. However, the parents\n   would never let themselves into the home without letting the daughter know in advance. The\n   <em>\n    Kovacks\n   </em>\n   court found \"no authority for the proposition that such act by a landlord as using a key to let themselves into a property with the knowledge of the tenant constitutes 'control' for purposes of liability in tort.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. Rather, by leasing the residence to the daughter, they had relinquished the right to admit people and exclude them from the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540509\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/114/783/\">\n    2018-Ohio-2503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540509\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/114/783/\">\n    114 N.E.3d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a recently decided decision involving statutory and common-law dog-bite claims against a dog owner and her grandmother, the Ninth District Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's granting of summary judgment in favor of the grandmother. In that case, a dog owned by \"Territa\" broke free of its chain and attacked a child playing next door. The home where the dog lived was owned by Terrell's grandmother \"Yvonne\" who had not lived there recently. Yvonne did not have a written lease with Territa but permitted her to live in the house. Territa rarely paid rent and did pay for utilities, while Yvonne paid for homeowners insurance. Yvonne initially paid someone to perform maintenance on the property but, at some point, Territa took over those responsibilities. The Ninth District noted undisputed evidence that Yvonne did not live at the house herself but permitted Territa to live there based on \"[s]ome type of oral agreement or arrangement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. The court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   and found that the plaintiff presented no evidence to overcome the presumption that Territa possessed and controlled the entire property and presented no evidence to show that Yvonne possessed or controlled any common areas where the dog was chained and where the attack occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In this case, we will initially address whether appellant waived certain arguments by failing to present them to the trial court in the first instance.

As a result, appellant argued that Seymour's payments to appellee conferred no control of the property to Seymour absent a written agreement. On appeal to this court, appellant has apparently abandoned his argument regarding the statute of frauds and instead attempts to raise, for the first time, issues surrounding co-owners related to co-tenancy and possession. Because appellant failed to raise this argument before the trial court, we decline to consider it for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Tucker.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Moreover, after independent review, we find summary judgment appropriate in favor of appellee. This case is more like\n   <em>\n    Kovacks\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540509\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/114/783/\">\n    2018-Ohio-2503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540509\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/114/783/\">\n    114 N.E.3d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , than\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   . Appellee pointed to Civ.R. 56 evidence that appellee did not live in the property and that appellee and Seymour were essentially in a landlord-tenant type relationship. Like in\n   <em>\n    Kovacks\n   </em>\n   , Seymour paid an amount each month to appellee to reside in the single-family residence at issue with the goal of buying it outright at some point in the future. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540509\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/114/783/\">\n    2018-Ohio-2503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540509\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/114/783/\">\n    114 N.E.3d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , some type of oral agreement or arrangement existed in which Seymour would live on the property and pay appellee $675 per month. Appellee also pointed to evidence that the property at issue had no common area and that appellee did not enter the property without calling or knocking first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Nothing offered in appellant's memorandum in opposition to summary judgment rebuts the contention that appellee was not in possession of the property or, even absent a landlord-tenant relationship, that appellant otherwise controlled the property for purposes of tort liability. Although appellant contends appellee testified that she would tell Seymour she needed to find another home for the dog if the dog was vicious, our review of the deposition testimony shows that appellee referred to not tolerating a dangerous dog on another specific property. In reference to the property where Seymour lived and the dog bite occurred, appellee testified \"[a]s far as I'm concerned, it's her property. I don't control what animals she has. That's her choice because that's her house, even though she's making payments to me.\" (Appellee Dep. at 21.) Furthermore, we do not find appellee's one-half mile proximity to the property, the ability to visit the home, or assisting with house projects and maintenance evidences possession or control of the property to avoid summary judgment in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Furthermore, this court previously identified\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , which found an issue of material fact remained as to whether a father/landlord harbored his son's/tenant's dog, as an outlier to established precedent in Ohio.\n   <em>\n    Coontz\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Regardless,\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   concerned a situation where the father's/landlord's property sat continuous to the property leased by the son/tenant, and the son worked on the father's business on the leased premises. The father in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   acknowledged that he had the authority to make his son remove the dog from the property. We find no reason to follow\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   considering the factual distinctions between it and the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 32} On independent review, no genuine issue of material facts exists. Construing the evidence most strongly in favor of appellant, we find reasonable minds could not conclude that appellee was in possession or control of the premises where the dog lived and, therefore, could not conclude that appellee was a \"harborer\" of the dog that bit appellant.\n   <em>\n    Coontz\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. As a result of this finding, appellant's issue regarding appellee's alleged awareness of the dog's viciousness is moot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 25. Therefore, considering all the above, summary judgment in favor of appellee is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Accordingly, we overrule appellant's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Having overruled appellant's sole assignment of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   KLATT, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   HORTON, J., dissents.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Appellant's original complaint named appellee's husband, John Griffith, as a defendant along with Seymour. Following John Griffith's deposition, appellant filed the amended complaint to substitute appellee in place of John Griffith.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-52\">\n   HORTON, J., dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 35} I respectfully dissent with the majority on the myriad issues of fact surrounding the question of whether defendant-appellee, Susan Griffith, is a \"harborer\" of the dog who possessed both possession and control of the property. The mother-daughter relationship, the lack of a written lease agreement, the question as to whether the $675 quasi-monthly payments daughter made to mother constitute evidence of co-ownership versus \"rent\" payments, the mother's knowledge of the viciousness of the dogs, the unfettered access mother had to the property and her improvements made, and the actual level of control and possession mother had over the property, among other things, present genuine issue of fact for a jury to decide. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
