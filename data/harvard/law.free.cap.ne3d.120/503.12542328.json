GALLAGHER, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Richard Amey appeals his conviction for voluntary manslaughter, which included a three-year firearm specification. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Before the shooting that formed the basis of the conviction, Amey was attacked by the victim, La'Dale Davis. The fight began when Amey accompanied Janice Gresham, Davis's former girlfriend, through her apartment complex. Davis believed that Amey was in a romantic relationship with Gresham. Davis tackled and began repeatedly punching Amey. With some difficulty, security broke up the one-sided fight. Amey and Gresham separately left the scene, but it is undisputed that Amey's injuries were not severe enough to warrant any medical intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Sometime later that same evening, Amey again met up with Gresham. Amey, however, had taken the opportunity to arm himself with an illegally possessed and carried firearm. Amey claimed he intended to escort Gersham to her apartment to get some personal belongings so she could stay at a hotel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In the second altercation, Davis assaulted Gersham outside of her apartment as she attempted to descend the steps to leave. It is undisputed that Amey did not attempt to intervene in the second attack on Gersham, who managed to get inside the apartment and shut the door. Immediately after the door was closed, Gersham heard two shots being fired. Amey told police officers that in the fleeting moment between Gersham's successful escape and the shots being fired, Davis was downstairs blocking Amey's exit and was coming up toward Amey when the shooting started. Gersham testified, however, that Amey was downstairs and Davis was the one upstairs, giving Amey a path to retreat from Davis once Gersham was in the safety of her apartment. The coroner\n   corroborated Gersham's account with the angle of the bullet trajectory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} When Gersham exited the apartment two or three minutes later, she observed Davis lying at the bottom of the stairs. Amey had fled the scene and discarded the firearm in the sewer. Amey told police officers that during the second fight, Davis said he would kill Amey. There is no evidence establishing whether that statement, if true, was hyperbole or a prediction, but it is undisputed that Davis was unarmed and that Amey's injuries from either altercation were not severe enough to warrant any medical attention. Police officers documented bite marks Amey claims to have been caused by Davis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Amey was charged with murder, felony murder, felonious assault, voluntary manslaughter, and having a weapon while under disability, along with associated firearm specifications. After a bench trial, Amey was acquitted of all but the voluntary manslaughter, the attached three-year firearm specification, and two counts of having a weapon while under disability, for which the sentences were imposed to be concurrently served with the voluntary manslaughter sentence. The trial court sentenced Amey to an aggregate prison term of ten years - seven years on the underlying felony and three years on the gun specification to be served consecutive to the underlying sentence as statutorily required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In this appeal, Amey challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and, in the alternative, claims his conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence. As part of the sufficiency analysis, Amey also claims that the trial court's acquittal of the felonious assault and felony murder counts is inconsistent with the finding of guilt on the voluntary manslaughter count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} A claim of insufficient evidence raises the question whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the verdict as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This complicates the analysis. According to the First District, in such a situation, the trier of fact must consider whether the defendant satisfied his burden to produce the evidence demonstrating the existence of the mitigating circumstances within the voluntary-manslaughter statute.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, if the trier of fact determines that the defendant is guilty of voluntary manslaughter, it must enter a verdict of not guilty on any murder charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Amey failed to present evidence in support of the mitigating circumstances under the voluntary manslaughter statute. Instead, Amey pinned his acquittal on self-defense. In this regard, the trial court's verdict of guilt on the voluntary manslaughter charge benefitted Amey; it lessened the severity of the crimes of which he was found guilty without burdening Amey with having to demonstrate the existence of the mitigating factors.\n   <em>\n    Rhodes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1714591\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/63/613/#p617\">\n    63 Ohio St.3d at 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20N.E.2d%20261\">\n    590 N.E.2d 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Amey's failure to produce evidence in support of the inferior offense cannot then be used as a sword to undue his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Further, with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence, Amey claims to have acted in self-defense. He therefore concedes that he knowingly killed Davis; it is Amey's belief that killing Davis was legally justified. Thus, there is sufficient evidence supporting the elements of the voluntary manslaughter charge for which the state bore the burden at trial.\n   <em>\n    State v. Chandler\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

In entering the verdicts, the court concluded that there was no testimony demonstrating that Amey's acts, in obtaining the weapon as part of the intent to cause physical harm to the victim, were committed knowingly for the purpose of the felonious assault, but that there was evidence demonstrating that Amey knowingly caused the death of the victim. Although the trial court spoke in terms of \"knowingly,\" it was essentially combining the premeditation component of the aggravated murder charge with the felony murder charge - a defendant does not need to knowingly obtain the weapon used to commit felonious assault. In discussing its finding that Amey did not act knowingly for the purposes of the felonious assault, the predicate offense underlying the felony murder charge, the trial court was determining whether Amey knowingly obtained the firearm to murder the victim. Nevertheless, even if the statements created ambiguity, the trial court removed all doubt by expressly concluding that Amey knowingly shot the victim for the purposes of the voluntary manslaughter conviction, a fact of consequence also demonstrated through Amey's claim of self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Notwithstanding, as the Ohio Supreme Court has continually maintained, \"a verdict that convicts a defendant of one crime and acquits him of another, when the first crime requires proof of the second, may not be disturbed merely because the two findings are irreconcilable.

Davis's own sister testified that Davis was talking crazy and that she felt compelled to leave her grandmother's home to search for him. Shatwoyne Range, Gresham's neighbor and Davis's friend, testified that she could not calm Davis down after the initial fight and that his anger elevated while speaking with Gresham on the phone. Gresham testified that when she returned home, Davis was waiting for her at her apartment. Gresham went on to state that she and Davis argued and that her mother barricaded the door to keep Davis from entering. Once her mother allowed Gresham and Davis to enter, Davis began arguing with the mother. All the while Amey remained outside of the apartment calm, telling Gresham to give Davis his things. When Davis and Gresham exited the apartment, Davis punched Gresham in the side of the head, causing her to fall on the stairs. Amey did not get involved. Gresham ran back in to her apartment, screaming, leaving Amey and Davis outside. Gresham testified that shortly thereafter, she heard two gunshots. Gresham and her mother exited the apartment and saw Davis lying on the ground, and Amey was gone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In order to find Amey guilty of voluntary murder, the trial court must\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   be able to reasonably find that Davis had seriously provoked Amey and that the serious provocation was reasonably sufficient to have incited him to use deadly force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1133160\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/97/1/\">\n    97 Ohio St.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002-Ohio-5304\">\n    2002-Ohio-5304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=776%20N.E.2d%2026\">\n    776 N.E.2d 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 75.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 35} My analysis reveals that the trial court expressed that Amey was not at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray by stating, \"the actions of La'Dale Davis that evening, starting with the confrontation that led to the earlier fight, but more importantly, the renewed and unexpected confrontation in the hallway and Davis's aggressive behavior towards both the defendant and Janice Gresham\" is what caused the situation. (Tr. 412.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Second, the trial court believed that Amey had a bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm, and that his only means of escape from such danger was the use of such force. The trial court stated that Amey's actions were \"as a direct result of sudden passion brought on by serious provocation by the victim that was reasonably sufficient to cause him to shoot.\" (Tr. 412.) Given the fact that Davis brutally beat Amey just hours before; it took two officers to get Davis off of Amey; and that the use of pepper spray on Davis did not deter Davis from beating Amey, I find that these facts support self-defense and not sudden passion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Finally, the police officer who interviewed Amey testified that Amey stated that Davis came after him and grabbed him. As they struggled, Amey felt as if the only way to get away from Davis was to shoot him. Given the nature of the brutal beating earlier, it is reasonable to believe that Amey would feel as if his life were in jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Accordingly, I would find that the trial court's rejection of the defense's claim of self-defense was error when the evidence supported such a claim. While Amey did not testify at his trial, that does not bar him from asserting a self-defense claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Cuyahoga No. 83075,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-3961\">\n    2004-Ohio-3961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201688548\">\n    2004 WL 1688548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14. I would find that the evidence supports Amey's claim of self-defense, and that trial court indirectly acknowledged his claim where the record clearly shows that Amey did not instigate any confrontation with Davis. Amey did not return to the apartment complex in search of Davis. The majority focuses on the fact that Amey had a weapon on his person when he returned. However, the record supports the fact that Davis was volatile, violent, and attacked both Amey and Gresham. It further supports the fact that Amey did not threaten Davis and remained calm while Davis engaged in verbal and physical confrontations with Gresham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 40} I reject the state's argument that Amey was provoked by sudden passion or sudden fit of rage. I find that, although there is sufficient evidence to convict Amey of voluntary manslaughter, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed under manifest weight.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
