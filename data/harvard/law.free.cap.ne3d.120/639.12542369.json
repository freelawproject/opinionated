At the change-of-plea hearing, while Hooker denied having to push the already-open door to gain entry to the residence in question, he did admit that he had squeezed through the opening. The trial court accepted Hooker's guilty plea. In 2017, Hooker filed an amended petition for post-conviction relief (\"PCR\") in which he claimed that the trial court erred in accepting his guilty plea because he had denied his guilt at the hearing. The post-conviction court concluded that Hooked had not simultaneously maintained his innocence when he pled guilty to Class C felony burglary and denied his PCR petition. Hooker contends that the post-conviction court's conclusion is clearly erroneous. Because we disagree, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   [2] On October 1, 2001, the State charged Hooker with Class B felony burglary and Class D felony theft. Hooker and the State reached a plea agreement pursuant to which Hooker would plead guilty to Class C felony burglary in exchange for dismissal of the theft charge. At the time, Indiana Code section 35-43-2-1 provided that \"[a] person who breaks and enters the building or structure of another person, with intent to commit a felony in it, commits burglary, a Class C felony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [3] A change-of-plea hearing was held on November 2, 2001. Then-Judge\n   <em>\n    pro tempore\n   </em>\n   Kelli Fink asked Hooker, \"[D]id you break and enter a building that was owned by [Z.M.]?\", to which Hooker replied, \"[y]es.\" Prior App. p. 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Judge Fink asked Hooker again whether he had broken into the building, Hooker's counsel interjected that Hooker \"would not say he broke into the building\" but that counsel's \"understanding of the law is that you do not have to break into the building [and] if he was in a building with the intention to commit a felony, that is sufficient.\" Prior App. p. 13. The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   [The State]: He may have used some force to gain entry which might have been as simple as pushing a door open which was closed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The appellate record includes a scanned appendix from a previous appeal, which contains the transcripts from the change-of-plea and sentencing hearings.

The State read the factual basis into the record, followed by more discussion between Hooker and Judge Fink:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    [The State]: Your Honor, if this were to proceed at trial the State would call the owner of the residence, or the renter of the residence who had a contractual interest in it, a woman by the name of [Z.M.] and she'd testify that she was moving out, had left some items in the house behind and the State believes that she would testify that the door was closed when she left the residence at the last time she was there. The State would also call a witness by the name of David Mills who lived across the street from the burglarized residence and he would testify that at approximately 11:00 when he went to bed he didn't notice anything unusual about the residence, but at 1:00 to 1:30 in the morning he heard some dogs barking and his own dogs were indicating something was unusual going on. He looked out and saw that the house at 1607 Evans, the door was open and that there was a red car parked in the alley way there that had not been there earlier at 11:00 when he went to bed. He also saw a set of hands that were reaching out through the opened rear door stacking items on the back porch and he contacted the police. When the police arrived, Officers Hoehn and several other officers with the Evansville Police Department arrived, looked around the residence, didn't have any luck or get any response and the officer finally entered through the back of the house and called out and the defendant finally did come out from inside the residence, and that's where he was located when officers arrived. The State heard and the Court heard the statements by the defendant earlier, and through the case law I believe the Court can establish a factual basis through the statements having been given by the defendant. He indicated that he did have to squeeze in to get into the residence. [....] He did place himself in a position to commit a felony inside. He did commit the entering element. He did ... he was found inside. He did indicate earlier that he was inside the residence and he did in fact commit a felony by committing theft. Several items that were originally inside the house including a circular saw, some stereo equipment and an area rug were found inside the defendant's vehicle which was parked in the alleyway outside the house to show the element of theft.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    [....]\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    [Judge Fink]: The agreement [is] that you plead guilty to Burglary as a Class C felony, which means you did break and enter the building and [...] structure on October 8th, 2001 [...] with the intent to commit a felony therein, to-wit Theft, contrary to Indiana law.

Judge Fink advised Hooker of his rights and set the matter for a sentencing hearing on December 5, 2001.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    [5] At the December 5 hearing, then-Magistrate David Kiely engaged in the following exchange:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    [Hooker]: Okay, now starting out, as far as this incident is concerned, initially, I want you to know that initially I didn't go there to rob these people or steal anything from them, I went there because me and [the person to whom I am engaged], we were looking for a house for us and the kids and I didn't break in either as far as kick any doors in or anything of that nature, and we're talking about a house that was for rent, it was advertised in the paper, I have the article here if you would like to see it, I have the article for the day before of which we got it out of the paper, okay, that's how I found out about the house.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    [Magistrate Kiely]: You opened the door?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    [Hooker]: No, it was open.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    [Magistrate Kiely]: Now, [...] you were in front of Judge [Fink\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    ] and [s]he found a factual basis or you admitted to him that you committed this crime?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    [Hooker]: I'm saying I did it, but what I'm saying is ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    [Magistrate Kiely]: Well, you didn't tell [her] that the door was open and you walked in?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    [Hooker's counsel]:You know, we had a mess on this thing when we did the factual basis[.]\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    [....]\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    [Magistrate Kiely]: I'm going to let [the other judge] do this.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n    [Hooker's counsel]: That's what I thought.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    [Magistrate Kiely]: Because [s]he found the factual basis, I don't believe you committed burglary unless you opened that door someway [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] or pushed it open, so I'm going to let [the other judge] handle that.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Prior App. pp. 35-37.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    [6] At the continued sentencing hearing later that month, there was no further inquiry concerning the factual basis or the plea of guilty. Judge Carl Heldt noted that he had reviewed the presentence investigation report and was \"accept[ing] the parties' plea agreement, accept[ing] the Defendant's plea of guilty, and enter[ing] a judgment of conviction under Count I, to Burglary, as a Class C felony.\" Prior App. p. 42. Judge Heldt sentenced Hooker to four years of incarceration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    [7] On May 9, 2003, Hooker filed a\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    PCR petition, a petition he withdrew later that year. On December 18, 2008, Hooker filed another\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    PCR petition. On October 21, 2013, Hooker moved to withdraw his plea, which motion the trial court denied later that month.

The State answered, denying the allegations and asserting that the amended PCR petition was barred by waiver, prior adjudication, laches, res judicata, collateral estoppel, and law of the case. On August 29, 2018, the post-conviction court, in an order prepared by now-Magistrate Fink and approved by now-Judge Kiely, denied Hooker's PCR petition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Discussion and Decision\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    [9] In post-conviction matters, \"[t]he petitioner has the burden of establishing his grounds for relief by a preponderance of the evidence.\" Ind.

Two of these defenses-res judicata and waiver-relate to an appeal Hooker pursued following the denial of his Verified Motion to Vacate the Judgment and Withdraw the Plea. Hooker filed that\n     <em>\n      pro se\n     </em>\n     motion during the pendency of the instant proceedings. Therein, Hooker presented a different issue-whether he was entitled to a particular advisement-and so the doctrine of res judicata does not bar the instant claim, which is that the plea itself was unreliable.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Ind.

Further, Indiana Code Section 35-35-1-4(c) provides that \"[a] motion to vacate judgment and withdraw the plea ... shall be treated by the court as a petition for postconviction relief under the Indiana Rules of Procedure for Postconviction Remedies.\" Thus, the post-conviction court was obligated to treat Hooker's motion as a successive petition for post-conviction relief-and, under the Indiana post-conviction rules, a petitioner must take certain steps to pursue a successive petition.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Ind. P-C.R. 1(12). Hooker had not taken those steps. Therefore, I cannot say there was any preclusive adjudication-or, with respect to the defense of waiver, that Hooker waived the instant claim by failing to present the claim in an improper successive petition.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      generally\n     </em>\n     P-C.R. 1(8) (\"All grounds for relief available to a petitioner under this rule must be raised in his original petition.\"). As to laches, the post-conviction court found that \"most of the delays in this case were the result of a change in counsel, the time needed for [Hooker's] attorneys to conduct a proper investigation and preparation, along with the Court's failure to identify that the December 5, 2001 hearing was missing from the chronological case summary.\" Appellant's App. Vol. IV at 53.
