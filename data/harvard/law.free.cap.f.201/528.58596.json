When the floor A has to rest upon piers, it is made with the downward extension <em>B, </em>which extends to the windows <em>0, </em>of which it forms the head, and rests upon piers <em>D, </em>which it caps, as at <em>B'. </em>Between the piers it can be reduced to any required thickness, as at B\", Fig. 2. This extension is reinforced with the tension bar <em>B, </em>which by preference extends the length of the building. To the floor A, by preference after it has hardened and the piers (? have been built, is also added the upper extension B, placed between the piers (?. This extension is made of one integral piece with the floor by means of the coil joint <em>H </em>or other suitable union, and it extends upward to the window <em>K, </em>of which it is the sill. It is by preference rabbeted into the piers. The advantages of this floor are: First, it thoroughly binds the building together, extending as it does entirely across the walls and piers; second, it affords an architectural feature at a trivial cost; third, by the downward extension a deep beam is formed for supporting the floor load, while it also fulfills all the functions of a window head and curtain wall; fourth, by the upward extension the depth of the beam is further increased and extended from <em>V </em>to <em>T, </em>Fig. 2, and thus its tensional and compressive stresses are greatly lessened.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\">\u201cBy the term \u2018belt course\u2019 I include any other distinctive feature into which the exterior thickness of the floor could be molded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-8\">The claims in controversy are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-9\">\u201c5.

Defendant contends that the patent does not involve patentable subject-matter and that it is invalid for lack of invention and because of anticipation. These questions need not be here discussed. Had the suit been brought on claim 2, which is broadly for \u201ca reinforced concrete floor extending to the exterior face of a building and capping the piers thereof, substantially as described,\u201d it would be necessary to pass upon-them, because defendant\u2019s reinforced concrete floor does extend to the exterior face of the building and does cap the piers thereof. Unless the words \u201csubstantially as described\u201d operate to narrow this claim, it would be clearly infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Complainant, however, has not sued upon this claim, but rests its case upon other claims, into each of which there enter one or more elements, other than the floor extending over the piers. Thus a \u2018\u2018belt course,\u201d formed by the floor at the exterior face of the building, is an element of claims 5, 6, 8, and 10. A \u201cdownward extension,\u201d substantially as described, is an element of claims 5, 9, and 10. An \u201cupward extension,\u201d substantially as described, is an element of claims <em>7, </em>8, 9, and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The weight of the testimony indicates that the \u201cbelt course\u201d is an architectural feature into which the extended floor is molded. The illustrations of defendant\u2019s structure, whether in process of construction or completed, do not present any such architectural feature to the untrained eye. The relative appearance of the columns and the floor edge is the same as in the structure of the prior art, known as the mill-of Mr. Charles Six, illustrated on page 20 of the exhibit book. Of this latter structure the complainant\u2019s witness Prevot, himself an architect, says that the drawing \u201cdoes not show exterior belt courses at the level of each floor, but only lintels between piers; the piers arising continuously anduinbroken,.and therefore does not show a belt course,\u201d and,: further, \u201cthe belt course of the patent being something that extends continuously around the building and is not merely between the piers.\u201d' So far as this element of a \u201cbelt course\u201d is concerned, we are satisfied, although there is more conflict in the testimony, that defendant\u2019s structure should be classified with the prior art, as represented by the Six' Mill, which has no belt course, and does not infringe any claim which is qualified by having the belt course efiumerated as one of its elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The \u201cdownward extension\u201d is for the purpose indicated! in the patent : \u201cA deep beam is formed for supporting the floor load,\u201d as well as fulfilling the functions of window head and curtain wall. If it were only to fulfill these last-named functions, it might be quite shallow in, cases where the windows were made so high as to come close to the floor above them; but to contribute substantially to the support of the floor load it must be the deep beam which the patent -describes. The patentee evidently contemplated its having a depth greater than ordli-. nary; the strength of a be:. :i is proportioned to its depth. He shows a deep beam formed by his integral downward extension, he calls for a deep beam, he says one of its functions is to support the floor load, he says that when there is a similar integral upward extension between piers \u201cthe depth of the beam, is further increased \u2014 and thus its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>tensiona\u00ed and compressive strains are greatly lessened.\u201d In the opinion of a majority of the court, the defendant has not any such deep beam. It has only the usual shallow beam between piers, which was to be found in the art'before the Ransome patent, which contributes [to sustain the floor load merely to the extent that such beams have theretofore contributed, and not to the greater extent which the patentee seems to accomplish by the use of a beam with a distinctively deep web.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\">As to the \u201cupward extension\u201d it seems to a majority of the court essential to the patentee\u2019s structure that such extension should be integral with the floor, united with it, not by a mere joint which may be wind and water tight, but so rigidly that each part, floor and extension, will reinforce the other in resisting strains and stresses. The testimony is conflicting, but does not satisfy' the majority that the mere superposition of a concrete block or wall on a floor of concrete, already set and hardened, without the aid of some equivalent to the coil joint of the patent, to bind the upper extension to the floor as rigidly'as the lower one is bound, will effect the close union, the \u201cintegral structure,\u201d which the patent calls for. Defendant\u2019s structure shows merely the \u201cpart of the wall between piers\u201d of the earlier art, not the integral upward extension of claims 7, 8, 9, and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">In the opinion of the majority the decree should be reversed, with costs of this appeal, and the cause remanded, with instructions to dismiss the bill. ' \u2022.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b549-5\">COXE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AH_\">(dissenting). I anr unable to agree with the majority of the court in reversing the decree as to all of the claims in issue. As I understand the invention, it consists in constructing a concrete building so that the vertical piers and the horizontal floors are practically molded together to form a strong, compact and homogeneous whole. The uprights and the floors are so firmly united that each supports the other, thus adding strength and durability to the building. The spaces between the piers above and below the floors are filled by upward and downward extensions which give additional strength and symmetry to the building. This construction produced a decided improvement in concrete buildings far beyond the capacity of the. skilled mechanic. The defendant\u2019s best reference is the Bon March\u00e9 stable exhibit, but the most favorable view that can be taken of that structure is that it leaves the question of anticipation in doubt and! is therefore insufficient to defeat the patent. The patent, marking as it does, a distinct forward movement in the art, is entitled to a liberal construction and a fair range of equivalents. I agree with the majority in thinking that the claims which have the \u201cbelt course\u201d as an element are not infringed. The belt course is an ornamental cornice or band extending beyond the face of the building and the photographs of the defendant\u2019s structure do not show a horizontal course extending around the building as shown in Figure 3. Claims 7 and 9 do not, however,'have the belt course as an element. They are as follows: .\u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201c7. A reinforced concrete floor extending to the exterior face of a building with an upward window sill extension, substantially as described.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u201c9. A reinforced concrete floor extending to the face of a building with downward and upward extensions, substantially as described.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The elements of claim 7 are:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">First, a reinforced concrete floor extending to the exterior face of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Second, an upward window sill extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Claim nine has the foregoing elements with a downward extension added.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">That these claims are infringed I have no doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">An examination of the photographs of the defendant\u2019s structure clearly shows an upward extension which brings it within claim seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">They also show the downward extension or a clear equivalent therefor. The photographs together with the testimony as to the manner in which these extensions are constructed and the function performed by them make it clear to my mind that the decree, so far at least as these claims are concerned, should! be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
