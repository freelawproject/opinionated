Some two or three ' years after plaintiff\u2019s first offer, defendant purchased the land at about the same price. There was evidence tending to support plaintiff\u2019s claim that the sale was the result of a renewfil of the original negotiations. <em>Held </em>that, if such fact were found, plaintiff was not debarred from recovering his commission because such negotiations were not continuous, nor by the fact that in the meantime the owner had given options on a part of the tract to others from which no sale resulted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aje\">[Ed.

C. A. 379. Upon the second trial, the cause was submitted to the jury, which gave to plaintiff a verdict for his claimed 5 per cent, commission upon the purchase price of the entire 60,000 acres .purchased by the Cleveland-Cliffs Company. This company, the defendant below, complains of the trial and judgment upon four chief grounds: (1) That the undisputed evidence showed the final purchase to have been disconnected from plaintiff\u2019s initial service, and hence a verdict for defendant should have been instructed; (2) that recovery was permitted upon a theory different from that pleaded by plaintiff and followed earlier in the case; (3) that Redfern, defendant\u2019s agent, clearly had no authority to bind defendant by the contract upon which plaintiff relies, or that, at least, the question of authority was for the jury, and that it was error to charge that the authority did exist; and (4) that the verdict was erroneously permitted to include subject-matter not covered by the contract in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">1. Plaintiff\u2019s services, claimed to pertain to this transaction, were rendered in October and November, 1900. The sale, on which he claims commission, was not agreed upon until April, 1903. It was plaintiff\u2019s theory that the negotiations initiated by him resulted in the purchase; .it was defendant\u2019s theory that such negotiations were terminated by the owner\u2019s letter of May 20, 1901, quoted in the previous opinion, and that the dealings which did result in the sale cannot be carried further back than October, 1902, when one of defendant\u2019s agents (not connected with Redfern or his department) suggested to Mr. Mather, defendant\u2019s president, that it should purchase this tract \u2014or perhaps July, 1902, when Gen. Alger, president of the Manistique Company, the owner, spoke to Mr. Mather on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> We approve the general theory adopted by the court below on this subject and assumed in our former opinion, viz., that plaintiff cannot recover unless his services bore a causal relation to the sale. True, the promise said to have been made by defendant\u2019s agent was, in effect, \u201cif we buy this land which you now bring to our attention, we will pay you 5 per c\u00e9nt. commission,\u201d and it is true that this promise was without express limitation of time, and can be read to refer to a purchase at any time in the future, no matter how far away. This is not its reasonable construction. Such language could not' be intended, by either party, to contemplate a sale which could not be traced as flowing from the offer then made; and it is not reasonable to infer any understanding by either party that if the offer then made was absolutely and finally rejected, and that if then, a year or more later, the matter was again taken up from a new instigation and under different market conditions, plaintiff should nevertheless have his commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In the former opinion, and apparently on the trial now under review, the necessary connection, between plaintiff\u2019s offer in 1900 and the later negotiations, was found in Gen. Alger\u2019s letter of December 23, 1902. The testimony on the second trial clearly shows that the \u201cpurchase of our 30,000 acres\u201d which Mr. Millen \u201cbrings for consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>eration\u201d had reference to a proposed sale to some one else; but the same letter continues (not quoted before):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">\u201cThe application, however, does not cover the railroad. Do you wish to further consider the purchase of the land and the road?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">It thus clearly goes back to some previous negotiations; but'in view of the present record, showing not only that the \u201cpurchase brought\u201d by Mr. Millen was a proposition from others, but showing that Gen. Alger and Mr. Mather had been corresponding in October and November regarding the purchase of the land and the railroad, we cannot find, in this letter of itself or in the correspondence, any reaching back beyond the conversation between them in July, 1902, which conversation is, in this correspondence, expressly said to be its basis.</p>\n<p id=\"AGM\">It does not follow that there is no connection between plaintiff\u2019s offer and the ultimate sale, just because this letter does not of itself furnish the necessary link. It is plaintiff\u2019s theory that he first, in October and November, brought this tract to defendant\u2019s attention as being suitable for purchase by it; that it then negotiated with the owner until May, 1901, when the owner withdrew the tract from'sale, but with notice to defendant that the withdrawal was only temporary and the offer would be renewed; that defendant was so interested that, in preparation for the expected renewal, it made, during the summer of 1901, an extended examination of the lands (probably at large expense and covering long time); that, as the result of this examination, it determined, or became inclined, to buy the lands when the right time should come; that the delay was merely to allow the owner to get more anxious to sell, and each waited for the other; that Gen. Alger\u2019s conversation in July, 1902, was what defendant was waiting for, and was, in fact, though not in form, a renewal of the suspended deal; and that Mr. Mather\u2019s letter of October, 1902, formally opening the final negotiations, was not merely the result of Gen. Alger\u2019s suggestion, but was a step in the development of defendant\u2019s plan of purchase formed because of the examination which followed from plaintiff\u2019s offer. This theory would entitle plaintiff to recover under such a contract as he claims, if he could convince the jury that it was the true theory rightfully to be inferred from all the facts; and a verdict accordingly would not have been without support. <em>It </em>follows that it was not error to deny defendant\u2019s motion for an instructed verdict. However, this theory, the only one justifying a recovery, was not sharply brought to the court\u2019s attention by plaintiff\u2019s requests nor by the court distinctly put before the jury, and we find no exceptions presenting the matter in this light. Whether, under these circumstances, we ought to reverse on this account alone, we need not consider, as there is, elsewhere, sufficiently formal cause for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">It will be noted that if the examination of the lands which, on this record, tends to make out the essential continuity, did in fact result, as defendant seems to claim, wholly from another source, operating like an intervening cause in the law of negligence, then this examination cannot serve as the necessary tie.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is next urged that intervening transactions, not appearing in the former record, prevent any recovery. These consist of options for the purchase of these lands or material portions of them, given by the owner in 1901 and 1902, with plaintiff\u2019s consent, to other parties; and it is said that, because these are inconsistent with defendant\u2019s continuing right to purchase under plaintiff\u2019s offer, they amount to a termination of his contract with defendant. We do not so regard the transactions, even if the owner was contingently bound to convey thereunder to others than defendant. Whatever rights plaintiff has {here are not based upon the earning of a commission by assisting in negotiations under a fixed and continuing offer until it was finally accepted; they are based upon the theory that he is entitled to an agreed compensation for bringing the, parties together so that they might do their own negotiating. This compensation was contingent upon the happening of a sale as the result of such negotiations; but it cannot be fatal that the owner was at the same time carrying on negotiations for sales to others. It is not material to plaintiff\u2019s case that defendant\u2019s opportunity of purchase should have been maintained unimpaired, so long as it was only suspended and not in fact destroyed. These matters bear on the question of fact whether the sale. finally closed between the parties was the consummation of the bargaining begun through plaintiff, or whether that matter was considered abandoned and closed; but they do not, as matter of law, prevent his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Nor can we imperatively apply the rule of reasonable time and say that more than a reasonable time elapsed. This subject-matter ordinarily bears on the connection between offer and sale, and serves to raise a presumption that the two were connected or were separate; but here there is no room for its application, Plaintiff must show a direct connection along the line we have indicated, or else must fail. A mere nearness in time woffld not alone prevail against otherwise undisputed evidence showing another origin for the sale; nor is there remoteness of time which of itself would defeat the claim. The issue is sharp and clear. Either the sale had its beginning in July, .1902, and plaintiff had nothing to do with it, or else it followed from plaintiff\u2019s offer without any fatal interruption, and in the manner above indicated, and the conversation of July, 1902, had nothing to do with it, except to make an excuse for taking up again the deal temporarily laid aside. One or the other of these things is true. In either case, the question of reasonable time cuts no figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Coming to the next matter urged, we cannot find any insuperable obstacle to recovery in the fact that the descriptions of the hardwood lands and the purchase price, as finally fixed, were different from those specified by plaintiff\u2019s offer. The hardwood lands specified and those purchased indicate a general identity of tract, and the modification of terms was not beyond the variations which the contract might contemplate.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">2. Defendant complains that plaintiff declared, and until the last trial prosecuted his action, upon the theory of a broker\u2019s commission for negotiating and consummating a sale; that confessedly He never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>did anything after the first offer, had no connection with all the later negotiations, and, indeed, was out of the country much of the time; but that he recovered for the value of his plat and descriptions and information furnished at the beginning. We do not find any serious inconsistency in plaintiff\u2019s claims and positions. The differences come rather from artificial \u2022 classifications sought to be imposed by defendant. It is not important whether plaintiff be called a broker, but there is no reason why those who are in the market to buy land may not say to one who comes as a broker claiming to have a good tract of land for sale that, if the broker will disclose what this tract is and put them in communication with the owners and let them deal directly together, he shall, if the land finally is bought, receive a commission. Such a contract, closed by furnishing the information, is a valid contract, by whatever name it may be called. The point is covered by the opinion on the former review.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> 3. Upon the subject of Redfern\u2019s authority: The majority of this court is convinced that upon the testimony shown by the present record \u2014 that is, upon plaintiff\u2019s version of the facts \u2014 defendant was not at liberty to deny Redfern\u2019s authority to make the alleged agreement, and that the court below was right in disposing of the question arising on such version,'as one of law. We base our conviction on the fact that, in answer to plaintiff\u2019s letter, Mr. Mather referred him to Redfern, \u201cwho will take the matter up with you, if it seems worth while.\u201d This necessarily meant, if it seemed to Redfern worth while, and, in determining as to whether it was worth while, Redfern must pass upon the conditions which plaintiff imposed as precedent to \u201ctaking it up\u201d at all, so long as such \u201cconditions\u201d were, as here, of a character not so uncommon in similar negotiations as to be clearly beyond the fair and natural expectation of the letter writer. Plaintiff\u2019s claim is that, considering together his letter to Redfern and his alleged conversation with Redfern, he substantially made the commission agreement a condition of disclosing his information. The acceptance or rejection of this condition was, as is said in the former opinion, \u201ca necessary thing at the opening of negotiations.\u201d It was the duty of defendant\u2019s agent to communicate to defendant the condition which had accompanied the offer; and defendant cannot be heard to say either that the condition was not communicated, or that it is not bound by the agent\u2019s acceptance under such circumstances. Of course, it was for the jury to say whether such circumstances existed; that is, whether, in fact, plaintiff imposed this condition upon his disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> 4. The tract actually purchased included about 60,000 acres, of which about half was covered with hardwood timber and about half was cut-over lands. The hardwood lands were figured at $5 per acre, and the cut-over lands at 50 cents per acre. The tract mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s first letter and in some other correspondence is 30,000 acres of hardwood. When plaintiff went to see Redfern, in November, 1900, he took with him a plat purporting to show the lands he had for sale. He says he talked with Redfern about a tract of 60,000 acres, and he gave Redfern this plat which showed about 60,000 acres, but the 60,000-acre purchase, as concluded, covered only about 30,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>acres of land shown by the plat; in other words, the plat indicated,' as part of the tract offered by Gamble, 30,000 acres which defendant did not buy, and defendant bought 30,000 acres which were not on the plat. The probable explanation of this seems to be, although we only infer this somewhat vaguely from the record, that the plat given by the owner to plaintiff and by him furnished to Redfern covered the 30,000 acres of hardwood belonging to the Manistique Company, and 30,000 acres of cut-over lands belonging to some one else, and that, when the negotiations took definite shape, the Manistique Company put in its own cut-over lands along with its own hardwood lands. Upon this trial, plaintiff was allowed to prove that the plat which he gave to Redfern had been given to him by the owner through a blunder, and was allowed to put in evidence a corrected plat showing the same lands which defendant did afterwards buy, though this corrected plat had never come to defendant\u2019s notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">There is no warrant for extending plaintiff\u2019s claim over lands not marked on the plat which he delivered to Redfern. No matter if plaintiff did say to Redfern that he was offering all the lands the Manistique Company had in those counties, in the same conversation he proffered the plat as a specific description of the lands about which he was talking, and it is clear that, if a contract had been then and there closed with no further details, defendant would not have been\u2019 entitled to demand 30,000 acres not shown on the plat. If plaintiff\u2019s general theory of fact is correct, then defendant, when about closing the purchase, was bound to remember that upon the lands covered by this bargain with plaintiff it must also pay him his commission. In such case, defendant\u2019s officers would have been amply justified, even if they had before them plaintiff\u2019s present version of everything which had occurred, in supposing that their bargain referred only to those lands which had been specified on the plat which was the definite materialization of the more general talk.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">For the errors in the subject-matter, last mentioned, the judgment must be reversed, with\u2019 costs, and a new trial ordered. We cannot be sure that the present record indicates with certainty the amount of excess thus erroneously embodied in the verdict so as to fix an amount to be remitted by which plaintiff could cure this error; but, if this amount could be ascertained, we would not be inclined to exercise our discretion in so avoiding another trial in a case where, as here, we think the trial which has been had was based upon a misconception of the main issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
