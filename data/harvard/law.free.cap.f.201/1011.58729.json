The tax is under section 38 of the act of August 5, 1909 (36 Stat. pt. 1, p. 112). Complainant claims that it does not fall within the. act, and that, if it does, it comes within the exception therein. The act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-6\">\u201cThat every corporation, joint-stock company or association, organized for profit and having a capital stock represented by shares * * * shall be subject to pay annually a special tax: * * * Provided, however, that nothing in this section contained shall apply * * * to domestic building and loan associations, organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of the members, * * * no part of -the net income of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">The cause is before the court upon defendant\u2019s demurrer to the complaint, which alleges that complainant is a Washington corporation, organized under the laws of that state relating to the incorporation of building and loan associations. The Washington statutes provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-9\">\u201cWhenever any number of persons not less than ten desire to be incorporated as a building and loan association, for the purpose of accumulating the savings and funds of its members and lending its shareholders or others the funds so accumulated, they shall make and execute a written declaration to that effect in the form now provided by statute for the execution of deeds of real estate, to entitle the same to record. * * * Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and upon filing an affidavit of proof of such publication in the office of the Secretary of State, the persons executing such declaration, their associates and successors, shall become a corporate body.\u201d Section 7128, Pierce\u2019s Code; section 3C01, 2 I-tem. &amp; Bal. Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-11\">\u201cThe name \u2018building and loan association,\u2019 as used in this act, shall include all corporations, societies, organizations or associations doing a saving and loan or investment business on the building society plan, whether neutral [mutual] or otherwise, and whether issuing certificates of stock which mature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>at a time fixed in advance or not\u201d Section 7149, Pierce\u2019s Code; section 3622, 2 Rem. &amp; Bal. Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-4\">\u201cAny shareholder whose stock has not been declared forfeited in such association, and whose share or shares are not pledged upon a loan, may withdraw such share or shares from the association at any time after one year, by giving at least sixty days\u2019 notice in writing to the secretary of his intention to do so. * * * \u201d Section 7154, Pieree\u2019s Code; section 3627, 2' Rem. &amp; Bal. Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-5\">\u201cAll corporations organized in this state and doing business in this or any other state as building and loan associations, shall comply with and be subject to all the provisions of this act within sixty days after its passage. * * * \u201d Section 7160, Pierce\u2019s Code; section 3633, 2 Rem. &amp; Bal.

The directors pass upon all loans, fix the rate of interest, and direct its investments.

S. (Thomson, Federal Statutes Annotated, volume 3, page 600). \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">Complainant sues as a corporation. It is admitted that it is a cor-r poration organized for profit under a law, but complainant contends that it has not a capital stock represented by shares. The \u201cbuilding and loan association\u201d statutes cover, not only \u201cmutual\u201d companies, but those doing business planned on other lines. They also insure .the shareholder, whose stock has not been forfeited and whose shares are not pledged, the right of withdrawal, and all of the provisions of the act are made applicable to those corporations organized and doing business in the state as building and loan associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">The articles provide that the issued capital stock of the company shall be $4,000,000, divided into 40,000 shares of the par value of $100 each, that no member shall hold more than 100 shares of the stock, and that the shareholders shall vote for the corporate directors by the share. There are other provisions in the articles and by-laws concerning the shares of stock in this corporation, but the complainant contends that mere words should be disregarded and the character of the association examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">In an ordinary corporation, the capital stock is fixed and the share holder has a right to a voice in its management, a share in its profits, and to receive an aliquot part of the proceeds of its capital on the winding up of a corporation. It is contended that these are essentials which show that the shares issued by the- complainant differ from corporate shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">If this corporation were, at any particular time, dissolved, the as+ sets of the corporation would, unquestionably, be distributed pro rata among the then shareholders. Therefore, as to its present members; it is a corporation having capital stock represented by shares, although; by the maturing of the stock and the retirement of shareholders, its shareholding membership is constantly changing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">. A building and loan association differs in some respects from the or* dinary corporation; but the federal statute itself shows, by the exception therein contained, that Congress intended to exempt what would otherwise have been included, but for the express exception. The exemption is not of all building and loan associations, nor those tested by the ordinary characteristics of corporation shares of stock, above pointed out, but the exemption is of\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-9\">\u201cdomestic building and loan associations \u00bb * * organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of the members, no part of tbe net income of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">._ A shareholder in the complainant corporation does not acquire- with his shares.a, fixed aliquot .part in the property of the corporation, but only such part of its authorized stock. With an increase in its m\u00e9mbership, the fraction representing his interest in the whole has becopae smaller; but the total capital correspondingly is increased, so that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>actual value should not diminish, but it is not a fixed share of the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">The tax is not upon corporations \u201cdivided\u201d into shares, but \u201crepresented\u201d by shares. The former would imply more fixity than the latter. No matter how the stock issued in this corporation expands or contracts, it continues to be \u201crepresented\u201d by shares until the last share is retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">Only one kind of stock is provided for in the by-laws, designated as \u201cinvestors\u2019 guaranteed dividend stock,\u201d and bearing interest at the rate of 7 per cent, for the average time the payments have been upon deposit. It has been argued that this guaranty feature does not destroy the mutuality of the shareholders in all of the profits; that, if all of the stockholders were to exercise the privilege of withdrawing at the same time, the guaranty would be of no value. In practice, such a thing would not likely occur. Those whose stock has matured, and who exercised the privilege, secure 7 per cent., under the guaranty, together with other profits that may have accrued to the credit of said shares. If the association had made less than 7 per cent, profit annually, when' a sufficient number of its shareholders had exercised the privilege afforded by the guaranty, the remainder would be stripped of their profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">There is a further provision in the by-laws (page 13 of the bill of complaint), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-7\">\u201cNot more than one-half of the money received in stock payments shall be used to pay withdrawing members, and such payments shall be made in the order in which certificates have been presented for cancellation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">Clearly the effect of this provision is to make two classes of stock. Assuming that a uniform profit of 7 per cent, is made upon investments and loans, then, under the guaranty above, the first half of the subscribing shareholders would have the absolute right of withdrawal; but the rest, the later subscribers, would be forced to remain in the company, which would make their stock \u201ccommon stock.\u201d If the profits were less than 7 per cent., they would not receive as much as the early subscribers exercising the privilege of withdrawal, and if the profits were more than 7 per cent, their profits would be greater. In any event, the \u201cmutuality\u201d in the profits of the association is clearly destroyed by this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">In view of the provisions for the loaning of the funds of the corporation to nonmembers, for issuing preferred or guaranteed interest-paying stock, and that allowing the directors, upon finding that the income of the association cannot be loaned profitably, to \u201ccancel any outstanding certificates of general stock not borrowed upon,\u201d paying the holder the book value of the stock so canceled, thereby being authorized to retire any and all stock in their discretion, it is clear that the complainant cannot be said to be\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-10\">\u201corganized * * * exclusively for tbe mutual benefit of the members, no part of the net income of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholders or individuals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALj\">Demurrer sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
