The bill was dismissed for want of equity jurisdiction, and complainant appeals. It is a suit brought December 12, 1910, on two patents, one having '56 days to run, and the other several years. Defendant ivas charged with infringing the claims of patent No. 514,097, expiring February 6, 1911, and the single claim of patent No. 703,313, expiring June 24, 1919. Service of subpoena was made December 13, 1910, appearance of defendant filed before the expiration of the earlier patent, and answer filed February 6, 1911, being the last day of the patent term. The answer denies novelty and usefulness of the alleged inventions, alleges anticipation, prior knowledge, and use, and denies, infringement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-9\">It is stated in the bill that the improvements claimed in the two patents are capable of being conjointly used, and have been so used by complainant in the making, use, and sale of machines covered by the first patent. A prior adjudication of the federal Circuit Court for the Northern District of Ohio sustaining the second patent is also averred. Temporary and permanent injunctions and an acounting and damages are prayed. The case was put at issue February 16, 1911, and on August 4, 1911, an ex parte order was made, on' motion of complainant, extending the time to take testimony 90 days. Defendant filed a motion August 9, 1911, to set aside this order, but on August ,8th complainant served a notice that it would examine witnesses on August 11th. It was' stipulated that the time for hearing the motion to set aside the extension order should be postponed to September 11, 1911. The motion was heard on affidavits, showing that the delay in taking testimony was due to the pendency of the suit in Ohio referred to in the bill, in which suit the bill of complaint had been dismissed by the circuit court, but was decided in favor of complainant by the.Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit July 12, 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-10\">The motion to set aside the order of extension was heard September 20, 1911, when the court Vacated such order, and made a final decree dismissing the case for want of jurisdiction.

'It was supposed because a court of equity will not usually grant a preliminary injunction in the case of a patent about to expire the jurisdiction in equity was thereby affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">It is the common practice to dismiss bills brought upon patents about to expire, when it clearly appears that no right to a preliminary injunction existed at the time the bill was filed Many of the cases are cited in the briefs, the leading one being Clark v. Wooster, 119 U. S. 322, 7 Sup. Ct. 217, 30 L. Ed. 392. Equity jurisdiction in patent cases depends on the right to an injunction at the time, suit is commenced. If it appears, therefore, that no facts then existed supporting the right to an injunction, and that the patent sued on will expire before any final decree can be made, the remedy at law is entirely adequate, and the equity suit, since it can avail nothing, must be dismissed because there is no equity jurisdiction. If, however, facts existed when suit was commenced which might, in any view, sustain an injunction, the question is not then one of jurisdiction, but one of discretion in the exercise of jurisdiction. This distinction is explained in Babcock v. Farwell, 245 Ill. 14, 33, 91 N. E. 683, 137 Am. St. Rep. 284, 19 Ann. Cas. 74, and was applied to a case quite different from this by .this court, in Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Newman, 187 Fed. 573, 109 C. C. A. 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The view taken by the trial court was that, no right to a temporary injunction \u2022 under the 'first patent-appearing;-the case upon both patents should be dismissed because of the allegation of conjoint infringement under a claim which might sustain an injunction and others which could not. Even in this view, the question presented was not one of equity power, but merely a suggestion whether the bill should not be amended so as to claim an injunction under- the second patent alone. Defendant (under the allegations of the bill), by making and sale of a machine, was talcing property rights- secured to complainant by two patents, which were conjointly, used by complainant. Clearly it is not an abandonment of thq right to an injunction for com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>plainant to allege that the improvements described in both patents are conjointly used. This allegation was made to justify joinder of the two patents in one suit, and should not be deemed to destroy the most important remedy given by the patent law, the writ of injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The decree is reversed, with direction to proceed in any manner not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">- Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
