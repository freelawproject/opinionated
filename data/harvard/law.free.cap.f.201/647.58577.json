The case in which the judgment was rendered arose as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">June 6, 1911, Fermor J. Spencer, as trustee in bankruptcy of the above-named bankrupt, filed with the referee in bankruptcy a petition asking that a certain deed of trust executed by said bankrupt corporation February 20, 1906, whereby said bankrupt corporation conveyed all of its real estate to the Empire Trust Company of New York City to secure an issue of $1,000,000 of the preferred' stock of said bankrupt corporation with certain guaranteed dividends, be declared null and void. At the same time the Corporation Trust Company of New Jersey,- which, as trustee, was the grantee in a certain other deed of trust executed by said bankrupt corporation to secure certain bonds, filed a similar petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Thereupon, the referee caused a hearing, to be had, after due notice to all persons interested, and at said hearing William K. Smith, George M. Griswold, Wells Campbell, Fred B. Farnsworth, Robert E. Men-rose, and Frank Armstrong, being beneficiaries and holders of the preferred stock mentioned in the above deed of trust to the Empire Trust Company, appeared by counsel in opposition to the prayer of the petition. On said hearing, the following facts appeared:</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The Fifty Gold Mines Corporation was incorporated under the laws of Colorado November 9, 1905. Its articles of incorporation provided for seven directors, and that the capital stock should be $3,000,000, to be divided into 300,000 shares of $10 each; 100,000 shares being preferred stock and 200,000 shares being common stock. The board of directors held its first meeting on January 3, 1906, at which meeting each of the directors subscribed and paid for one share of the common stock of the corporation. At this time, O. B. Thompsor. was the owner of property afterwards conveyed to the corporation which was worth, according to Thompson\u2019s undisputed testimony, $3,000,-000. January 3, 1906, he made a proposition to the corporation which was submitted to the stockholders at a meeting held that day. The proposition was in writing, and by it Thompson offered to convey all this property to the corporation upon the issuance and delivery to himself or order of the entire amount of unsubscribed capital stock of the corporation. This included all the stock of the corporation, both preferred and common, excepting the seven shares issued to the directors. The offer also provided that the corporation should execute a first-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>mortgage lien upon the property to he conveyed to it to secure the preferred stock, the language upon this point being that the mortgage' should provide therein that it was executed for the sole and exclusive, purpose of guaranteeing to the holders of the preferred stock of said corporation that all and each of the provisions contained therein should be fully and promptly complied with. The offer further contained an agreement upon the part of Thompson that he would place the preferred stock in the hands of a trustee under an agreement that out. of the proceeds of the sale thereof a certain percentage should be paid over to the treasurer of the corporation. This proposition was duly accepted at stockholders\u2019 and directors\u2019 meetings. \"At a directors\u2019\u2019 meeting held on the same day a resolution was passed instructing the officers of the corporation to issue and file with the Secretary of State a certificate that the capital stock of the corporation had been fully paid. This certificate was executed January 3, 1906, and was filed about .the same time. Under and by virtue of the agreement so made and accepted, Thompson conveyed the property now held by the trustee in bankruptcy to the corporation, arid received from it the deed of trust above mentioned and a certificate for the shares of the preferred stock referred to therein. Thompson placed this preferred stock in the hands of certain agents in New York City for sale. Sixty-five thousand dollars worth of said stock was sold to various parties, and the proceeds thereof were distributed as follows: One-fourth to the agents making the sales for commissions; one-half to <em>Thompson; </em>and one-fourth to the corporation. Afterwards, in consideration of the increase of the capital stock to $10,000,000, Thompson surrendered to the corporation all of the unsold preferred stock so issued to him. Up to the time of the bankruptcy proceedings, the 'corporation had taken up and canceled of the $65,000 of preferred stock sold as aforesaid, all but between $31,000 and $32,000. Dividends thereon to the extent of $8,000 or $9,000 were unpaid at the time of the hearing before the <em>referee, but the </em>corporation made no profits out of which these dividends could be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">The certificate of preferred stock issued to Thompson was in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">\u201cThis is to certify that O. B. Thompson is the owner of one hundred thousand (100,000) shares of the preferred capital stock of the Fifty Gold Mines Corporation, fully paid and nonassessable and transferable only by entry on the books of the corporation, upon surrender of this certificate properly indorsed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">\u201cThe preferred <em>stock </em>is entitled to cumulative dividends of ten (10) per cent, per annum, payable quarterly, commencing April 1st, 1906, from the net profits of the corporation before any dividends are paid on the common stock and the common stock is entitled to all dividends in excess of said ten (10) per cent. In the event of the dissolution of the corporation, or a distribution of its assets, the preferred stock outstanding at that time shall first be paid at eleven ($11.00) dollars per share, plus all accumulated unpaid dividends, and the remainder of the corporate assets shall be divided ratably among the holders of the common stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\u201cThe owner of unredeemed preferred stock, may at his option exchange the same at any time for common stock of the corporation, share for share.

A failure of said corporation for a period of ninety days \u2022to pay any quarterly dividend hereon, after the same becomes due and payable, shall render the corporation in default as to such payment, and thereby entitle the owner of this certificate to a foreclosure of the mortgage securing the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-4\">\u201cAs a guarantee that the Fifty Gold Mines Corporation will promptly pay all dividends upon its preferred stock and redeem the same in strict accordance with the provisions of this certificate, said corporation has made, executed and delivered to the Empire Trust Company of New York City, N.

(10%) per annum thereon, payable quarterly, commencing 4pril 1st, A.

The beneficiaries under the trust deed hereinbefore mentioned caused the ruling of the referee to be certified to the United States District Court, and thereafter on May 2, 1911, the findings and order of the referee were overruled, and the referee was directed-to allow the claims of the holders of the preferred certificates as preferred claims against the bankrupt estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The certificate of preferred stock evidenced a contract between the stockholders of the corporation. Stockholders may make such contracts between themselves as are not contrary to law or against public policy. The contract which the stockholders intended to make in issuing the stock in question must be determined from the language of the stock itself, taken in connection, with the articles of incorporation. As the corporation made no profits, the present holders of the preferred stock have no claim for dividends. The only claim they have arises from that provision of the certificate of stock which provides that, in the-event of a distribution of the assets of the corporation, the preferred stock outstanding at that time shall first be paid at $11 per share, and the remainder of the corporate assets shall be divided ratably among the holders of the common stock. The question now presented is: Are the present holders of outstanding preferred stock creditors of the \u25a0 corporation, or are they simply preferred stockholders? If they are creditors, they have-a secured claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>against the bankrupt estate. If they are preferred stockholders, then the above provision is valid as against the holders of common stock, for the preference in the distribution of assets was a matter concerning which the stockholders could lawfully agree as between themselves. If, however, the provision giving a preference in the distribution of assets to the preferred stockholders is sought to be upheld as against creditors of the corporation, it must fail as being against public policy and therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The assets of a corporation represented by its capital stock are a trust fund for the payment of its debts, and the law will not permit stockholders to agree among themselves that this trust fund shall be appropriated by them or some of them as against the claims of creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> We are therefore of the opinion that the present holders of the preferred stock of the corporation are not creditors thereof, but stockholders; that the provision contained in the certificate of preferred stock, giving a preference of eleven dollars per share to the holders thereof, refers only to the distribution of assets as between stockholders, and has no reference to the distribution of assets for the payment of the debts of the corporation; that, if by any interpretation it could be construed as referring to the distribution of assets to pay debts, then it is void as being against public policy. These views are sustained by an examination of the certificate of stock and the decisions of the courts. What parties to a contract may call it, of course, is not binding upon the courts if it is clearly something else. Still, in arriving at the intention of the parties,'we may look to the language which they used in reducing their contract to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In the articles of incorporation, in the stock itself, and in the mortgage, the stock in controversy is called \u201cpreferred stock.\u201d There is no evidence that any party concerned in the issuance of the stock thought that it was anything else. There is no provision in the certificate of preferred stock which, if properly construed, is not appropriate to such a certificate. After issuing the preferred stock, the corporation owed Thompson nothing for the property conveyed by him to it. He transferred his property to the corporation in payment for its stock, and the corporation issued the certificate of preferred stock in payment for the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> If thereafter the corporation made profits, the holder of any preferred stock would receive dividends; and, if at any time the corporation was dissolved and its assets were distributed, the preferred stock would be preferred as against the common stock. The performance of this agreement could be and was secured by mortgage. This view renders the transaction reasonable and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Generally speaking, at the present time, although formerly there was some doubt and discussion, the law is clearly .settled that a preferred stockholder is not a corporate creditor. Cook\u2019s Corporations (6th Ed.) \u00a7 271; 2 Clark and Marshall on Private Corporations, pp. 1313-1317; Grover v. Cavanagh, 40 Ind. App. 340, 82 N. E. 105. In Hamlin et al. v. Toledo, St. L. &amp; K. C. R. Co., 78 Fed. 664, 24 C. C. A. 271, 36 L. R. A. 826, Circuit Judge (now Justice) Lurton, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>holding certain preferred stockholders not to be creditors, used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">\u201cOne cannot well be a creditor as respects creditors proper and a stockholder by virtue of a certificate evidencing Ms contribution to the capital of the corporation. Stock is capital, and a stock certificate but evidences that the holder has ventured his means as a part of the capital. It is a fixed characteristic of capital stock that no part of it can be withdrawn for the purpose of reimbursing the principal of the capital stock until the debts of the corporation are paid. These principles are elementary. Warren v. King, 108 U. S. 389, 2 Sup. Ct. 789 [27 L. Ed. 769]; Cook, Stock, Stockh. &amp; Corp. Law (3d Ed.) \u00a7 271. The chance of gain throws on the stockholder, as respects creditors, the entire risk of the loss of his contribution to capital. \u2018He cannot be both a creditor and debtor by virtue of his ownership of stock.\u2019 Warren v. King, supra. If the purpose in providing for these peculiar shares was to arrange matters, so that, under any circumstances, a part of the principal of the stock might be withdrawn before the full discharge of all corporate debts, the device would be contrary to the nature of capital stock, opposed to public policy, and void as to creditors affected thereby. Cook, Stock, Stockh, &amp; Corp. Law (2d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 270, 271; Chaffee v. Railroad Co., 55 Vt. 110; McCutcheon v. Capsule Co., 19 C. C. A. 108-115, 71 Fed. 787 [31 L. R. A. 415]; Morrow v. Steel Co., 87 Tenn. 262, 10 S. W. 495 [3 L. R. A. 37, 10 Am. St. Rep. 658]. If that was the purpose of tMs arrangement, most doubtful language was employed. ..There is a sense in which every shareholder is a creditor of the corporation to the extent of his contribution to the capital stock. In that sense every corporation includes its capital stock among its liabilities. But that creditor relation is one which exists only between the corporation and its shareholders. It is a liability which is postponed to every other liability, and no part of the capital stock can be lawfully returned to the stockholders until all debts are paid or provided for. The violation of this well-understood principle is a breach of trust, and a creditor affected thereby may pursue the stockholders, and recover as for an unlawful diversion of assets.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Preferred stock of a railroad company is not an indebtedness which can be considered in determining whether its obligations are such as to prevent its operating a passenger train separately from its freight trains. People ex rel. W. S. Cantrell et al. v. St. Louis, A. &amp; T. H. R. Co., 176 Ill. 512, 52 N. E. 292, 35 L. R. A. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The following cases support the general proposition that holders of preferred stock are not corporate creditors: Mercantile Trust Co. v. Bal. &amp; O. R. Co. et al. (C.

A. 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The case of Miller, Executor, v. Ratterman, Treasurer, 47 Ohio St. 141, 24 N. E. 496, is very instructive on the point under consideration. In deciding that the holders of certain preferred stock secured by mortgage were not creditors, the court used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">\u201cThe relation of a holder of preferred stock is, in some of its aspects, similar to that of a creditor, but he is not a creditor save as to dividends after the same are declared. Nor does he sustain a dual relation to the corporation. He is either a stockholder or a creditor. He cannot, by virtue of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>certificate, be both. If the former, he takes a risk in the concerns of the company, not only as to dividends and a proportion of assets on the dissolution of the company, but as to the statutory liability for debts in case the corporation becomes insolvent. 'If the latter, he takes no interest, in the company\u2019s affairs, is not concerned in its property, or profits as such, but his whole right is to receive agreed compensation for the use of the money he furnishes, and the return of the principal when due. Whether he is one or the other depends upon a proper construction of the contract he holds with the company. It is said that \u2018a mortgage creditor, although denominated a preferred stockholder, is a mortgage creditor nevertheless; and interest is not changed to dividend by calling it a dividend.\u2019 \u2018The question is not, what did the parties call it, but what do the facts and circumstances require the court to call it.\u2019 The aptness of this language arises in a case where it has been determined that such holder is a creditor. It may not furnish material aid in ascertaining the fact whether he is such or not. However, what the parties in the given case have called the subject of the contract .is of no little significance in determining their purpose, and, when that purpose is ascertained, it is of much importance in giving construction to the contract. The object of all rules of construction is to arrive at the meaning of the parties. What was the object to be accomplished? What did the parties intend, and are the means taken in harmony with that intent, and with the law applicable to the subject? These are questions addressed to the court in this case, and when answered the case is decided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">\u201cAs supporting the claim that it was not stock that was issued but certificates of indebtedness, special attention is called in argument to those portions of the certificates which provide that holders shall not vote upon them at any meeting of the holders of the capital stock of the company; that the rights of the holders to the dividends are guaranteed, and are to be secured by mortgage on. the property, rights, and income; that no further or other mortgage shall thereafter be made to the prejudice of the holders of the preferred stock; that the dividends are guaranteed by the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton Company, which company had executed a mortgage to Stanley Matthews, trustee, to secure the payment of dividends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">\u201cAs to some of these provisions, it may be conceded that they are consistent with the idea that a debt was being created, but does it follow that they are inconsistent with the opposite view? While each part of the contract should be considered by itself, yet the several parts should be construed together, and the intent gathered from a consideration of the whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In Ellsworth v. Lyons, 181 Fed. 58, 104 C. C. A. 4, in deciding that certain holders of preferred stock were stockholders and not creditors, Knappen, Circuit Judge, used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">\u201cThe law is well settled that a corporation may lawfully give security to one class of stockholders over another class. Warren v. King, 108 U. S. 889 [2 Sup. Ct. 789, 27 L. Ed. 709]; Hamlin v. Toledo, St. L. &amp; K. C. R. Co. (6th Circuit) 78 Fed. 664, 670, 24 C. C. A. 271, 36 L. R. A. 826; Continental Trust Co. v. Toledo, St. L. &amp; K. C. R. Co. (C. C., N. D. Ohio), 86 Fed. 929, 949; Toledo,St. L. &amp; K. C. R. Co. v. Continental Trust Co. (6th Circuit) 95 Fed. 497, 531, 36 C. C. A. 155. It is equally well settled that a contract between a corporation and a stockholder by which the latter is to receive the par value or any part of his stock before all corporate debts are paid is contrary to public policy, and void. Warren v. King, 108 U. S. 389, 396, 2 Sup. Ct. 789, 27 L. Ed. 769; Hamlin v. Toledo, St. L. &amp; K. C. R. Co. (6th Circuit) 78 Fed. 664, 670-672, 24 C. C. A. 271, 36 L. R. A. 826; Guaranty Trust Co. v. Galveston City R. R. Co. (5th Circuit) 107 Fed. 311, 46 C. C. A. 305; American Steel &amp; Wire Co. v. Eddy, 130 Mich. 266, 269, 89 N. W. 952; s. c., 138 Mich. 403, 407-410, 101 N. W. 578; Clark v. E. C. Clark Machine Co., 151 Mich. 416, 424, 115 N. W. 416; Cook on Stock and Stockholders (3d Ed.) \u00a7 271.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">The following cases are cited as being opposed to the views expressed in this opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Heller v. Bank, 89 Md. 602, 43 Atl. 800, 45 L. R. A. 438, 73 Am., St. Rep. 212. This case when properly understood supports our views. It was there in substance decided that, as between creditors and ordinary preferred stockholders, the latter, as owners of the property of an insolvent corporation, are, upon a distribution of its assets, entitled to nothing until its creditors are first fully paid; but, if the statute under which what is called preferred stock is issued by a corporation provides that such preferred stock shall constitute a lien on the company\u2019s property and be entitled to priority of payment over general creditors, then such stock is not preferred stock in the ordinary sense, although so called in the statute, and although it possesses many of the incidents of ordinary preferred stock. The statute which authorized the issuance of the preferred stock in the case cited provided that \u201csaid preferred stock shall be and constitute a lien on the franchises and property of such corporation, and shall have priority over any subsequently created mortgage or other incumbrance.\u201d The court simply held that the holders of the preferred stock were entitled to the lien and priority expressly given to it by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Mulford v. Exploration Co., 45 Colo. 81, 100 Pac. 596. This case has no bearing upon the case at bar. The plaintiff in that case purchased treasury stock of the Exploration Company with the right to return the stock and have the consideration which he gave therefor returned to him within six months. It was held that such a sale of stock was not in violation of the Colorado statute prohibiting corporations from using any of their funds for the purchase of stock in their own company or corporation, except such as might be forfeited for the nonpayment of assessments thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Savannah Real Estate, Loan &amp; Building Co. v. Silverberg, 108 Ga. 281, 33 S. E. 908. This case comes nearest to being opposed to our views, but it involved stock in a building and loan association, and was governed largely by the statute authorizing the issuance of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Cook v. Equitable Building &amp; Loan Association, 104 Ga. 814, 30 S. E. 911. This was another building and loan association case, and its decision depended largely upon the law peculiar to building and loan associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">We are. therefore of the opinion, as hereinbefore indicated, that the holders of the preferred stock are preferred stockholders of the corporation, and not creditors; that the provision of the stock certificate which provides in case of- the dissolution of the assets of the corporation that $11 per share shall be first paid to the holders of preferred stock is valid as against the holders of common stock, and that this was all the parties to the certificate intended; that if, by any construction of the provision, it could be held to have intended a preference as against the creditors of the corporation, it is void as being against public policy. What has been said also compels the holding that the agreement contained in the stock certificate that the corporation will redeem all its preferred stock on or before January 1, 1916, if con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>strued as allowing the corporation to pay the preferred stockholders $11 per share for the preferred stock, plus accumulated unpaid dividends, before paying the debts of the corporation, is void as being against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The decree of the district court, therefore, must be reversed, and the case remanded, with instructions to enter a decree avoiding the lien of the trust deed as against bona fide creditors of the corporation. And it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
