Pumphrey, the Mayor of the City of District Heights, Cheyenne Watson, Vice-Mayor and Commissioner of the City of District Heights, Americo Sesso, Commissioner of the City of District Heights, and the City of District Heights (collectively, \u201cappellants\u201d). The four-count complaint alleged defamation, violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, intentional infliction of emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>distress, and malfeasance in office. Appellants removed the action to federal court, which dismissed, with prejudice, the \u00a7 1983 claim and remanded the remaining state law claims to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">On September 9, 1997, appellants filed a motion to dismiss, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that they were protected from suit by various doctrines of immunity. On October 20, 1997, the trial court filed an order that denied appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Appellants filed this appeal, asking three questions, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">I. Were appellee\u2019s claims against Pumphrey, Watson, and Sesso barred by the doctrine of absolute immunity or the doctrine of public official immunity?</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">II. Was the action against the City of District Heights barred by the doctrine of governmental immunity?</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">III. Did the trial court err by denying appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss?</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">As to appellants\u2019 first question, to the extent that liability was based on the Commission\u2019s decision not to investigate Sesso, we hold that appellee\u2019s claims against Pumphrey, Watson, and Sesso are barred by the doctrine of absolute immunity. To the extent that his liability was based on the comments he allegedly uttered, we hold that Sesso is not entitled to absolute immunity and that the applicability of public official immunity must be resolved by the trial court. As to appellants\u2019 second question, we hold that appellee\u2019s claims against the City of District Heights are barred by the doctrine of governmental immunity. We decline to address appellants\u2019 third question as it relates to appellant Sesso because it involves matters not presently ripe for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">In affidavits attached to the complaint and incorporated therein, three employees of the Department of Public Works for the City of District Heights testified that appellant Americo Sesso made disparaging and racist remarks about appellee. Brian Edwards testified that, on August 2, 1996, he had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>conversation with Sesso in the Public Works\u2019 garage and that, during this conversation, Commissioner Sesso made defamatory comments about Commissioner Denny\u2019s race and professional abilities. Robert Vasquez testified that, on August 2, 1996, he was in the Public Works\u2019 garage and he heard Sesso make defamatory comments about Commissioner Denny\u2019s race and professional abilities. George Benton testified that he had heard Sesso make derogatory remarks about Commissioner Denny.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">According to her complaint, appellee asked Sesso for a public apology but none was forthcoming. Thereafter, during an open meeting of the Commission, appellee raised the issue of Sesso\u2019s comments and demanded that the matter be investigated. According to appellee, however, \u201cdefendant Mayor Mary Pumphrey, as head of the Commission, and the other defendant commissioners, brushed off these highly publicized slurs, refused to allow [her] to raise this matter again, and refused to launch an investigation into the incident.\u201d Appellee responded by filing the underlying complaint, alleging defamation, violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and malfeasance in office.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, which dismissed appellee\u2019s federal claim, with prejudice. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">Proceeding directly to the merits, this is an unfortunate case of name-calling and insults. While the racial epithets alleged may well give rise to causes of action under state law [See <em>Gaiters v. Lynn, </em>831 F.2d 51 (4th Cir.1987); see generally, Rodney A. Smolla, <em>Rethinking First Amendment Assumptions About Racist and Sexist Speech, </em>47 Wash. <em>&amp; </em>Lee L. Rev. 171 (1990),] federal law is clear. Federal civil rights statutes, including 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, are not transgressed. <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 712 [96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405] (1976). Denny\u2019s claim of violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is therefore DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The case was remanded to the circuit court for a determination on the remaining state law claims. Upon remand, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>lants filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that the remaining claims against Pumphrey, Watson, and Sesso were barred by the doctrine of absolute immunity and/or the doctrine of public official immunity, and that the claims against the City of District Heights were barred by the doctrine of governmental immunity. On October 20, 1997, appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss was denied by the trial court without comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">We are currently presented with an appeal of the denial of a motion to dismiss filed pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322(b). In reviewing the grant or denial of a motion to dismiss filed pursuant to this rule,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">\u2018we must assume the truth of all relevant and material facts that are well pleaded and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn from those pleadings. The complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears that no set of facts can be proven in support of the claim set forth therein.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-10\"><em>Simms v. Constantine, </em>113 Md.App. 291, 294, 688 A.2d 1 (1997)(quoting <em>Bennett Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc. v. NationsBank of Maryland, </em>103 Md.App. 749, 757, 654 A.2d 949 (1995), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>342 Md. 169, 674 A.2d 534 (1996) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">Because the denial of a motion to dismiss is not a final judgment, it is ordinarily not subject to interlocutory review. Appellants contend, however, that, because they asserted various immunity defenses in their motion to dismiss, the denial of that motion is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine. Before discussing the elements of that doctrine, we consider first the nature of the immunities asserted by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Pumphrey, Watson, and Sesso contend that the claims against them are barred by the doctrine of absolute immunity and/or the doctrine of public official immunity. In <em>Montgomery County v. Schooley, </em>97 Md.App. 107, 115, 627 A.2d 69 (1993), this Court held that it is \u201cbeyond dispute that municipal legislators enjoy the protection of immunity when acting in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity.\u201d <em>See also Manders v. Brown, </em>101 Md.App. 191, 205, 643 A.2d 931, <em>cert. denied, </em>336 Md. 592, 650 A.2d 238 (1994). We explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0vl\">[t]he purpose of this immunity is to insure that the legislative function may be performed independently without fear of outside interference.... To preserve legislative independence, we have concluded that \u2018legislators engaged \u201cin the sphere of legitimate legislative activity\u201d ... should be protected not only from the consequences of litigation\u2019s results but also from the burden of defending themselves.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlK\"><em>Schooley, </em>97 Md.App. at 116, 627 A.2d 69 (quoting <em>Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union, </em>446 U.S. 719, 731-32, 100 S.Ct. 1967, 64 L.Ed.2d 641 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">We have recognized previously, however, that not everything a municipal official does in his or her official capacity is legislative. <em>Manders, </em>101 Md.App. at 210, 643 A.2d 931. In fact, municipal officials often act as \u201cexecutives and administrators who enforce and administer the law, especially in county or commission forms of government where there is no separate executive official.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For instance, \u201cwhen municipal officials do more than adopt prospective, legislative type rules and take the next step into the area of enforcement,\u201d that activity is most appropriately characterized as executive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In lieu of designing a specific test for determining what is and what is not legislative activity, Maryland has adopted a \u201cfunctional approach\u201d to legislative immunity, where the scope of immunity is determined in light of the functions and duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>of municipal officials. See <em>Manders, supra; Mandel v. O\u2019Hara, </em>320 Md. 103, 576 A.2d 766 (1990). Under this approach, if the conduct engaged in by a municipal official can be characterized as \u201clegislative,\u201d the actor is absolutely immune from any liability or suit emanating from that action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Pumphrey, Watson, and Sesso also contend that, even if they are not entitled to absolute immunity, appellee\u2019s claims against them are barred by the doctrine of public official immunity. In Maryland, public official immunity is recognized both at common law and by statute. For common law public official immunity to apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">(1) the actor must be a public official, rather than a mere government employee or agent; (2) the conduct must have occurred while the actor was performing discretionary, as opposed to ministerial, acts; and (3) the actor must have performed the relevant acts within the scope of his official duties. If those three conditions are met, the public official enjoys a qualified immunity in the absence of \u2018malice.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aun\"><em>Thomas v. City of Annapolis, </em>113 Md.App. 440, 452, 688 A.2d 448 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In addition, the General Assembly has enacted a statutory public official immunity, which provides that \u201c[a]n official of a municipal corporation, while acting in a discretionary capacity, without malice, and within the scope of the official\u2019s employment or authority shall be immune as an official or individual from any civil liability for the performance of the action.\u201d Md.Code (1974, 1995 Repl.Vol., 1997 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 5-507(b)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d). In either form, common law or statutory, \u201c[p]ublic official immunity is qualified, not absolute.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Kenny, </em>121 Md.App. 482, 487, 710 A.2d 345 (1998). \u201cIt may be defeated by proof of malice, i.e. affirmative evidence that the official \u2018intentionally performed an act without legal justification or excuse, but with an evil or rancorous motive influenced by hate, the purpose being to deliberately and wilfully injure the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Davis v. DiPino, </em>99 Md.App. 282, 290, 637 A.2d 475 (1994), <em>rev\u2019d on other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number><em>grounds, </em>337 Md. 642, 655 A.2d 401 (1995)); <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 117, 660 A.2d 447 (1995)(\u201cPublic official immunity is not a defense to intentional torts.\u201d). Moreover, Maryland does not ordinarily provide public official immunity to public officials sued for violating an individual\u2019s state constitutional rights. <em>Ashton, </em>339 Md. at 102, 660 A.2d 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The City of District Heights contends that appellee\u2019s claims against it are barred by the doctrine of governmental immunity. The scope of governmental immunity was recently summarized by this Court in <em>Town of Port Deposit v. Petetit, </em>113 Md.App. 401, 688 A.2d 54, <em>cert. denied, </em>346 Md. 27, 694 A.2d 950 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u2018State agencies have normally been treated as if they were the State of Maryland for purposes of immunity, so that they enjoy the same immunity from ordinary tort and contracts suit which the State enjoys. \u201cThe reason for this is that State agencies exist merely as the State\u2019s hands or instruments to execute [the State\u2019s] will____\u201d Indeed, \u201cto hold [state agencies] responsible for negligence would be the same as holding the sovereign power answerable to its action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">Counties and municipalities, on the other hand, have not been accorded this broad general immunity from suit. It is true that they are instrumentalities of the State, created by the State to carry out some of the State\u2019s governmental functions. Nevertheless, under Maryland law, they have consistently been treated differently from State agencies and the State itself for purposes of immunity from suit. Thus, counties and municipalities have never been granted immunity in contract actions. Their immunity \u201cis limited to tortious conduct.\u201d And, as to tort actions, the immunity is limited. As previously noted, it is inapplicable to nuisance actions. It is also inapplicable to actions based on violations of constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">With regard to ordinary tort actions, counties and municipalities can rely on the defense of governmental immunity only when they exercise a function categorized as \u201cgovernmental\u201d rather than \u201cproprietary\u201d or \u201ccorporate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>While the governmental immunity of counties and municipalities is much narrower than the immunity of the State, nevertheless the immunity of counties and municipalities is derived from the State\u2019s sovereign immunity.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 418-19, 688 A.2d 54 (quoting <em>Board of Education v. Town of Riverdale, </em>320 Md. 384, 388-89, 578 A.2d 207 (1990) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The distinction between a \u201cgovernmental\u201d function and a \u201cproprietary\u201d function was explained in <em>Town of Brunswick v. Hyatt, </em>91 Md.App. 555, 605 A.2d 620 (1992). In that case, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">[Municipal immunity is not automatic, but when the municipality or county is engaged in a governmental function, immunity attaches.... The Court of Appeals ... outlined the test for determining whether a municipality is engaged in a governmental function as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">Where the act in question is sanctioned by legislative authority, is solely for the public benefit, with no profit or emolument inuring to the municipality, and tends to benefit the public health and promote the welfare of the whole public, and has in it no element of private interest, it is governmental in nature.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 559, 605 A.2d 620 (citations omitted; emphasis omitted). \u201cThe governmental-proprietary distinction has not been applied, however, when local governments have been sued for violations of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Town of Port Deposit, </em>113 Md.App. at 422, 688 A.2d 54. In that scenario, \u201cthere is ordinarily no governmental immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421, 688 A.2d 54 (quoting <em>Clea v. City of Baltimore, </em>312 Md. 662, 667 n. 3, 541 A.2d 1303 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">The Collateral Order Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"Af9\">Generally, a party may only appeal from a final judgment, that is, a judgment that settles the rights of the parties or concludes the cause.\u201d <em>Town of Port Deposit, </em>113 Md.App. 401, 409, 688 A.2d 54 (1997); C.J. \u00a7 12-301. Obvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ously, the denial of appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss did not constitute a final judgment on the merits. The Court of Appeals, however, \u201chas \u2018long recognized ... a narrow class of orders, referred to as collateral orders, which are offshoots of the principal litigation in which they are issued and are immediately appealable as \u201cfinal judgments\u201d without regard to the posture of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 688 A.2d 54 (quoting <em>State v. Jett, </em>316 Md. 248, 558 A.2d 385 (1989)). For an order to be appealable under \u201cthe collateral order doctrine,\u201d it must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afd\">l)conclusively determine the disputed question, 2) resolve an important issue, 3) be completely separate from the merits of the action, and 4) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><em>Nelson, </em>121 Md.App. at 485, 710 A.2d 345; <em>Town of Port Deposit, </em>113 Md.App. at 410, 688 A.2d 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In <em>Nelson, supra, </em>this Court \u201cdiscussed the jurisdictional posture of interlocutory appeals from orders denying summary judgment on immunity grounds, brought under the collateral order doctrine.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>121 Md.App. at 486, 710 A.2d 345. We explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">\u2018[a]n interlocutory appeal [of the denial of a motion for summary judgment premised on immunity] is permitted only because, if complete and absolute immunity exists, it may, under certain circumstances, encompass the right to be immune from the trial process itself, and, thus, if an immunity claim is wrongfully denied, absent an immediate appeal, the right not to be tried, if it exists is lost.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>113 Md.App. 603, 605, 688 A.2d 527 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The application of the collateral order doctrine to the denial of a motion for judgment on immunity grounds depends on the type of immunity asserted. In <em>Nelson, </em>we concluded that an interlocutory appeal of a denial of a motion for summary judgment premised on absolute immunity,</p>\n<p id=\"AX1N\">like the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy, is a time-bound right that fits precisely the framework of the collateral order doctrine: it is an important issue separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>and apart from the merits of the case that is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment because taking the case to a final judgment will destroy the right.</p>\n<p id=\"Akp\"><em>Id. </em>at 486, 710 A.2d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">When the denial of a motion for summary judgment is based on qualified or public official immunity, however, we concluded that</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">application of the collateral order doctrine is not as clear cut for two reasons. First, it may not be possible to determine whether the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity without resolving disputes of fact that go to the merits of the case. In that circumstance, the issue of qualified immunity is not \u2018collateral,\u2019 within the meaning of the collateral order doctrine: When ... resolution of the immunity defense depends upon disputed factual issues, or upon mixed questions of fact and law, an immediate appeal will .not lie, and review of the qualified immunity determination will have to await the trial court\u2019s resolution . of the factual questions.\u2019 Only when a qualified immunity defense can be decided without delving into and resolving disputed facts is an interlocutory order denying summary judgment sufficiently separate from the merits of the case to qualify as a collateral order. Second, even if the issue is truly collateral, the defense of qualified immunity may not be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment because it may not be tantamount to a right not to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\"><em>Nelson, </em>121 Md.App. at 486, 710 A.2d 345 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Finally, when the denial of a motion for judgment involves a claim of governmental immunity, the ruling is also subject to being reviewed under the collateral order doctrine. In <em>Town of Brunswick v. Hyatt </em>91 Md.App. 555, 605 A.2d 620 (1992), this Court reviewed whether a municipality was immune from liability under the theory of governmental immunity. Although the collateral doctrine was not specifically at issue in that case, we noted that, where the effect of the denial of a motion for summary judgment is to reject a defendant\u2019s claim of governmental immunity, an appeal \u201cdoes apparently lie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>under the collateral order doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556 n. 1, 605 A.2d 620 (citing <em>Board of Trustees v. Fineran, </em>75 Md.App. 289, 541 A.2d 170 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Because certain of the immunity defenses raised are such that, if applicable, appellants can avoid trial, we hold that the denial of the motion to dismiss in this case as to those issues is immediately reviewable under the collateral order doctrine. Thus, we shall now proceed to evaluate the merit of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Application</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Pumphrey and Watson</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">In this case, the asserted liability against Pumphrey and Watson is based exclusively on the Commission\u2019s decision not to investigate Sesso for the comments he allegedly made about appellee. Specifically, the complaint alleges, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">7. On or about July 29, 1996, and again on or about August 2, 1996, the defendant Commissioner Americo Sesso uttered extreme and outrageous racial, profane, gender-biased, and derogatory slurs against the female plaintiff. These slurs were uttered in public, outside of the realm of legislative immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">8. The slurs uttered by the defendant Sesso also attacked the plaintiffs educational and professional qualifications for the position of commissioner which she held.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">9. The plaintiff asked the defendant Sesso for a public apology. To this day, the defendant Sesso has not issued one.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">10. The female plaintiff, in open session of the Commission, raised the issue of these public verbal attacks by the defendant Co-Commissioner Sesso. The defendant Mayor Mary Pumphrey, as head of the Commission, and the other defendant commissioners, brushed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>off these highly publicized slurs, refused to allow the female plaintiff to raise this matter again, and refused to launch an investigation into the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">11. Although they were given by the powers of their position sole authority of investigation, the defendants refused to investigate and/or ask the defendant Sesso for his resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">12. By refusing to launch an investigation into the outrageous and extreme statements of the defendant Sesso, the defendants have constructively adopted defendant Sesso\u2019s slurs and attacks as their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Pumphrey and Watson contend that the Commission\u2019s decision not to investigate Sesso was a discretionary act made within the sphere of their legislative duties and that they are absolutely immune from liability or suit arising from that conduct. Appellee counters that the doctrine of absolute immunity does not apply to this action because the refusal to conduct an investigation of Sesso did not require appellants to act in their legislative capacity. We agree with appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">In <em>Walker v. D\u2019Alesandro, </em>212 Md. 163, 173, 129 A.2d 148 (1957), the Court of Appeals stated that municipal officials are entitled to absolute immunity for those acts taken \u201cwithin the actual field of the ... powers or duties as [a local government official] or so closely related thereto as to be entitled to an absolute privilege.\u201d Certainly, determining the agenda and the direction of official proceedings is a discretionary power that comes within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity. Thus, to the extent they are based on these activities, we hold that appellee\u2019s claims against Pumphrey and Watson are barred by the doctrine of absolute immunity and should have been dismissed, with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Sesso</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Unlike Pumphrey and Watson, Sesso\u2019s liability in this case is premised not only on his participation in the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>sion\u2019s decision not to investigate his comments but also on the defamatory comments he allegedly made about appellee. To the extent that his liability is based on the actions of the Commission, Sesso is entitled to the same absolute immunity as Pumphrey and Watson. To the extent that appellee\u2019s claims are based on the defamatory comments he allegedly made, however, Sesso is not entitled to absolute immunity, as there is no present basis for concluding that those comments were made within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Whether Sesso is entitled to public official immunity cannot be resolved on this appeal. While there is no question that Sesso was a public official when the alleged comments were made, the record does not fully reveal the context in which these statements were expressed. It is evident, however, that the alleged statements were communicated to employees of the City of District Heights, indicating the possibility, even though remote, that the statements were made as Sesso conducted discretionary business within the scope of his duties as a commissioner. Moreover, the public official immunity Sesso claims is available to him only if he acted without malice, and, \u201cordinarily, the presence or absence of malice is a fact to be determined at trial.\u201d <em>Town of Port Deposit, </em>113 Md.App. at 414, 688 A.2d 54. In sum, whether Sesso is entitled to the public official immunity defense must be determined by the trier of fact. Thus, to the extent it was based on the statements Sesso allegedly made about appellee, the order denying appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss is not a collateral issue, and this Court does not have jurisdiction to review this aspect of their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The City of District Heights</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">In this case, the only asserted liability of the City of District Heights arises out of the conduct of several commissioners at an \u201copen hearing\u201d of the Commission. Because we agree with appellants that appellee\u2019s complaint fails to allege adequately a violation of constitutional rights, the immunity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the City of District Heights in this case turns on whether the actions upon which liability is based are \u201cgovernmental\u201d as opposed to \u201cproprietary.\u201d We hold that the determination by the Commission not to investigate Sesso was a \u201cgovernmental,\u201d as opposed to \u201cproprietary\u201d or \u201ccorporate,\u201d act and that the City of District Heights is entitled to the same broad governmental tort immunity as a state agency. Accordingly, under the present circumstances, the City of District Heights enjoys a right not to be tried and, therefore, appellee\u2019s claims against it should be dismissed, with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Dismissal on the Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Finally, appellants argue that, even if they are not entitled to any of the asserted immunity defenses, this Court should still grant their motion to dismiss because appellee\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Having previously concluded that appellee\u2019s claims against Pumphrey, Watson, and the City of District Heights are, in fact, barred by various doctrines of immunity, we review appellants\u2019 argument only as it applies to Sesso, the sole remaining defendant to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The counts against Sesso are defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and malfeasance in office. As to Count I, defamation, the complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">16. The defendants, individually and jointly and severally, have gone outside of their duties by accusing the female plaintiff of being unfit to be a commissioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">17. Defendant Commissioner Americo Sesso made profane racial slurs and accused the female plaintiff of being unqualified and unfit to be a commissioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">18. The Defendants adopted the position of Defendant Americo Sesso by refusing to launch an investigation into these attacks and by refusing to ask for the resignation of Commissioner Sesso.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>19. At all times, the defendants knew that the public statements made against the female plaintiff \u2014 extremely racial and derogatory \u2014 were illegal, had no truth whatsoever, and were in fact, defamatory and personally malicious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\">20. The defendants acted with knowledge of the falsity of their statements and with the intent to harm the female plaintiffs employment as a commissioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">21. As the result of the false and defamatory statements made by the defendants, the character and reputation of the female plaintiff was harmed and her reputation and standing in the community was tarnished. All of these are crucial to the female plaintiff continuing her employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">22. All of the actions complained of, among others, are demonstrative that the defendants have acted outside the lawful scope of their authority and duty and their actions have been illegal as defined by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">As to Count III, intentional infliction of emotional distress, the complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">32. The aforesaid actions of the defendants were willful, intentional, reckless, and in deliberate disregard of a high probability that emotional distress would result to the female plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">33. That as a result of the aforesaid conduct of the defendants, the female plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer severe and extreme emotional distress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">As to Count IV, malfeasance in office, the complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\">35. The defendants have misused their powers of office as set forth herein above, including, but not limited to, stating and adopting defamatory slurs against a fellow commissioner and attempting to cover-up these public slurs, and other acts of wrongdoing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">36. At all times pertinent hereto, the defendants were clothed with the authority of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>37. All of these actions are illegal and beyond the scope of the duty of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">38. The defendants have attempted to create a despotism that is incompatible with the Constitution of the United States and the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">39. The actions of the defendants are in excess of any lawful authority and are in violation of the Charter of the City of District Heights, the authority given to public officers, and the defendants\u2019 public duties as fiduciaries to the citizens of the City of District Heights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Appellants give various reasons why appellee\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and why the trial court should have granted their motion to dismiss. As we noted earlier, however, the collateral order doctrine permits an appeal of only a narrow class of orders, which are treated as final judgments. On this appeal, however, the only grounds raised that justify an immediate review of the denial of the motion to dismiss were based on various doctrines of immunity, which we have already discussed. Thus, we decline to address appellants\u2019 additional challenges to the trial court\u2019s action until there is a final judgment on the merits. See <em>Planning Board of Howard County v. Mortimer, </em>310 Md. 639, 654, 530 A.2d 1237 (1987); Md.
