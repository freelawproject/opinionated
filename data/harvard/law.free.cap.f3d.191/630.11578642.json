JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">This case, initially involving a claim for compensation under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d), has evolved into a dispute between Equitable Equipment Company (\u201cEquitable\u201d) and its former insurers. The Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d) dismissed Equitable\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees for lack of jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">E. Elliot Jourdan died from injuries sustained while employed, from December 17, 1940, to July 1, 1973, at Equitable\u2019s Madi-sonville Shipyard. Jourdan\u2019s wife filed a claim for LHWCA benefits, and an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) awarded benefits in a decision and order filed March 22, 1988. Mrs. Jourdan died on December 18, 1997, and the claim for LHWCA benefits died with her. The insurance dispute between the parties lives on.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">When the original LHWCA claim was asserted, Equitable\u2019s insurer, Employers Insurance of Wausau (\u201cWausau\u201d), denied coverage. In the original benefits decision, the ALJ found that Wausau was not a responsible carrier, yet failed to make a finding concerning which former Equitable insurer, if any, was hable for the payment of Jourdan\u2019s benefits. On petition for modification, Equitable requested that the ALJ decide Jourdan\u2019s date of exposure to the asbestos that caused his injuries and determine the insurer responsible for coverage of those injuries. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company (\u201cAetna\u201d) and Fidelity <em>&amp; </em>Casualty Company of New York (\u201cFidelity\u201d), both former insurers of Equitable, were joined as parties to the modification proceedings. On August 16, 1994, an ALJ found that Aetna was the insurer responsible for payment of the benefits award. On October 22, 1996, the ALJ\u2019s decision was affirmed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">Meanwhile, Equitable filed a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees against Wausau, Aetna, and Fidelity. Equitable grounded its claims on the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(a), and on Louisiana law. The ALJ dismissed Equitable\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction, and the BRB affirmed. Equitable appeals the BRB\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-18\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b681-19\">This court reviews the BRB\u2019s interpretation of the LHWCA, an issue of law, <em>de novo, </em>affording no special deference to the BRB\u2019s construction because it is not a policymaking agency. <em>See Wilkerson v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., </em>125 F.3d 904, 906 (1997), citing <em>Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. Dir., OWCP, </em>449 U.S. 268, 279 n. 18, 101 S.Ct. 509, 515 n. 18, 66 L.Ed.2d 446 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The LHWCA vests jurisdiction in an ALJ over \u201ca claim for compensation.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 919(a), 919(d). An ALJ has \u201cfull power and authority to hear and determine all questions <em>in respect of such claim.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Equitable argues that its claim for attorneys\u2019 fees, which resulted from a breach of its insurers\u2019 duty to defend a compensation claim, is a question \u201cin respect of\u2019 a compensation claim. In <em>Gray &amp; Co., Inc. v. Highlands Ins. Co., </em>9 BRBS 424, 427-28 (1978), the BRB agreed, permitting an employer to prosecute a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees against its insurers under \u00a7 919(a). When Equitable filed its claim for attorneys\u2019 fees, however, the BRB overruled <em>Gray </em>and dismissed Equitable\u2019s claim for lack of jurisdiction. Equitable argues that this dismissal violated BRB procedural rules and constitutes too narrow an interpretation of \u00a7 919(a). Because BRB correctly held that the LHWCA does not provide for jurisdiction over this claim, we need not address Equitable\u2019s procedural arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">BRB precedent has steadily eroded the foundation of <em>Gray. </em>In <em>Busby v. Atlantic Dry Dock Corp., </em>the BRB refused to assert jurisdiction over a claim filed by an insurer for reimbursement of overpaid benefits from another insurer. <em>See </em>13 BRBS 222, 224 (1981). The BRB noted, \u201c[N]o aspect of any employee\u2019s claim was presented or decided by the [ALJ],\u201d and the \u201cequitable dispute between the carriers was therefore ... not properly before the [ALJ] <em>since this dispute is not a question in respect to a compensation claim properly before the [ALJ].\u201d Id. </em>at 225 &amp; n. 1 (emphasis added). In <em>Rodman v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>16 BRBS 123, 126 (1984), the BRB held that an ALJ had jurisdiction to resolve a coverage disputed between an insurer and its insured only to the extent that resolution of the dispute was \u201cnecessary in order to determine compensation liability in claims under the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126. Underpining these cases is a concern, expressed in <em>Rodman, </em>that the jurisdiction of a non-article III tribunal like those under the LHWCA workers compensation statute should be consistent with the <em>post-Gray </em>decision in <em>Northern Pipeline Const. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\"><em>Gray </em>is inconsistent with the later cases; its interpretation of \u00a7 919(a) stretches an ALJ\u2019s jurisdiction beyond questions \u201cin respect of\u2019 compensation claims. The only issue to be resolved in <em>Gray </em>was whether an insurer had breached its duty to defend an employer. <em>See Gray, </em>9 BRBS at 427-28. Jurisdiction in <em>Gray, </em>and this case, rests on too thin a reed, however. The contractual dispute between the insurer and the employer in <em>Gray </em>was not integral to deciding the compensation claim from which the duty to defend arose. The ALJ was not called upon to address an employee\u2019s right to compensation, to determine the carrier responsible for the payment of benefits, or to resolve a coverage dispute related to the payment of compensation. As in <em>Gray, </em>the sole issue in this case is a state law breach of contract claim between an insurer and its insured. Such a claim is beyond the jurisdictional reach of \u00a7 919(a), particularly when the underlying compensation claim has been resolved and no factual dispute regarding the compensation claim itself must be decided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Equitable maintains that its claim is cognizable under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(a); however, this argument flies in the face of the statute. Section 928(a) applies to a \u201cperson seeking benefits\u201d that \u201cutilize[s] the services of an attorney ... in the successful prosecution of his claim.\u201d The statute concludes, \u201c[A] reasonable attorney\u2019s fee against the employer or carrier ... shall be paid directly by the employer or carrier to the attorney for the claimant.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(a). Under \u00a7 928(a), an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>award of attorneys\u2019 fees is \u201cin addition to the award of compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on the express language of the statute, only a \u201cperson seeking benefits\u201d may assert an attorneys\u2019 fee claim. The statute does not provide for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to an employer or carrier. The BRB has reached a similar conclusion in two cases. <em>See Medrano v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>23 BRBS 223, 226 (1990); <em>Mackey v. Marine Terminals Corp., </em>21 BRBS 129, 132 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The BRB\u2019s decision and order, dismissing Equitable\u2019s claim for lack of jurisdiction, correctly interpreted the applicable law. Section 919(a) does not vest jurisdiction in ALJs to decide a contract dispute between an employer and its carriers when the cause of action is wholly unrelated to an underlying claim for compensation. Equitable\u2019s claim involves neither a determination of which carrier must pay compensation benefits nor a dispute over potential coverage of a benefits claim. Accordingly, the ALJ lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Equitable\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees. Likewise, \u00a7 928(a) does not confer a federal cause of action on an employer for the prosecution of, or vest jurisdiction in ALJs to resolve, an attorneys\u2019 fees claim of this nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-5\">. Because we agree with the BRB that <em>Gray </em>was improperly decided, we need not determine whether a three-judge panel of the BRB may overrule a prior panel or whether era <em>banc </em>consideration by the BRB is required under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 801.301(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
