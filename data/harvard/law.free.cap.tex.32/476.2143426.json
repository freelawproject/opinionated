It is sufficient if it be stated, in the language of the Code, that the \u201c assault \u201d was made \u201cwith intent to murder.\u201d If it he done with that intent, the punishment annexed by the statute fixes it as a felony, and no such verbiage as being \u201c feloniously \u201d done is required in the criminal pleading under the Code. The indictment being sufficient, and no error appearing in the rulings of the court, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
