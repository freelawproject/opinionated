The offense is defined in Paschal, Art. .2054. (Bosshard v. State, Supplement to 25th vol. Tex., 209 ; State v. Burton, 25 Tex., 420; State v. Ward, 9 Tex., 371; Smith v. State, 17 Tex., 191; Estes v. State, 10 Tex., 300.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b767-11\">The authorities cited and cases adjudicated under the statute against playing at a public house, have no analogy; there the place, and in this the <em>hind </em>of gaming, is prohibited.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b767-12\">Lindsay, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnKA\">The record shows no error committed by the court or jury on the trial of this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">The indictment was for betting on the game of <em>\u201c </em>faro.\u201d The \u2022charge is set forth with as much certainty as is required by law. In analogy to the cases of playing at cards, proscribed by statute, under certain defined circumstances, it is imagined that the <em>place </em>where the game of <em>\u201c </em>faro \u201d was played, dealt, or exhibited, must be alleged. It is not so, however. The laying the venue in the proper county is sufficient in the prosecution \u2022of this offense. Card playing is an offense only when done under certain circumstances specified in the act. The offense is not restricted by any local designation. The provisions of this act are general in its prohibition and denunciation. Art. 2054, Paschal\u2019s Digest, says: \u201c If any person shall bet at any gaming table, or bank, such as are in the six preceding articles mentioned, (in which articles \u201c faro \u201d is included,) he shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars, nor more than two hundred and fifty dollars.\u201d According to the common understanding of mankind, to <em>\u201c </em>bet \u201d is to lay a wager; to stake or pledge money or property, upon the event of a contest; which</p>\n<p id=\"b767-16\">_____ . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>contest, in this ease, was in the game called <em>\u201c </em>faro.\u201d The plac\u00e9is unimportant. If the game is played <em>at any place </em>for a \u201c bet,\u201d it is a violation of the statute. The law demands no \u2022 certainty about the locality. And this, perhaps, was intended by the Legislature to increase its sanction, as it was obviously the design to repress such games altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">If the convict in this case should be again indicted for the same offense, upon the proof offered by the State to establish the charge, there is nothing to prevent his production of proof to establish the identity of the transaction, under a plea of' former conviction. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
