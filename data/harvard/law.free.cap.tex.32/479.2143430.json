D. 1869, in the said county of Harris and State of Texas, did then and there fraudulently and feloniously steal, take and carry away, from the possession of Samuel W. Allen, two beeves, the same being cattle, each of the value of fifteen dollars, without the consent of the owner, and with the intent then and there to deprive the owner of the value thereof, and to appropriate the same to the use and benefit of him the said C.

By a bill of exception taken by his counsel, it appears that \u201c the district attorney having accepted the entire jury, the defendant examining each, juror on his <em>voir </em>dvre, when Mr. Henry Dupperman was called, examined and accepted by the defendant, whereupon the district attorney challenged him peremptorily, after having accepted him as a member of the panel, and the court set the said juror aside, aud the defendant excepted,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">To which was appended by the judge the following : \u2022 \u201c The above does not cover the entire case.

Beef is a generic term, and has reference to all quadrupeds of the bovine race. Thcindictment should charge particularly the description, or by appropriate name and gender.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-13\">The third is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-14\">\" The qualification <em>\u2018 </em>being cattle.\u2019 The word cattle in said indictment embraces all quadrupeds, as also all personal property, and is therefore bad and not descriptive of what kind of property.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-15\">Beef is defined by Mr. Webster as \u00a3\u00a3 an animal of the bovine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>genus, whether ox, bull or cow.\u201d The word therefore embraces-the whole bovine race.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-5\">The qualification \u201cbeing cattle,\u201d instead of describing the particular kind of beef taken, makes it still more complicated.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-6\">Cattle, Hr. Webster says, in the United States, in common usage, signifies only beasts of the bovine genus, oxen, bulls,, cows and their young.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-7\">The indictment in this case is too vague, indefinite and uncertain; by the terms used the State could have convicted the defendant of theft of a bull, ox, cow or a calf The indict-.ment does not specify what kind of an animal was stolen. Mr. Justice Lindsay, in delivering the opinion of this court, at its last session, in case 3091, Charles Jordt v. The State, said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-8\">\u201c If the theft of a specific domestic animal was committed, it should have been correctly charged in the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-9\">The appellant in that case was indicted for the theft of a horse, and the proof was he had taken a gelding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-10\">Mr. Justice Lindsay said, in referring to it: \u201cA conviction for the theft of a horse upon the proof of taking a gelding, would be as incongruous as that of stealing a mule or an ass upon a similar indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-11\">In the case under consideration the accused was convicted for the theft of two \u201c beeves.\u201d Were they bulls, oxen, cows or calves ? If the indictment is good, could the defendant plead this judgment in bar of another prosecution for the theft of two oxen belonging to S. L. Allen? If there was a felony committed it was the theft of two oxen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-12\">In the case of Bush v. The Republic (1 Tex., 455), Justice Wheeler, in delivering the opinion of the court, said: \u201c In an indictment for a statutory offense, the statute must be strictly pursued, and if the description of the offense embraced in the statute be departed from in any material respect, or if any ingredient in the definition of the offense be omitted, the indictment will be bad.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-14\">Again: \u201cAn indictment should allege the fact necessary to constitute the offense charged bv averments, direct, positive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>and certain, and not by way of argument and inference.\u201d (1 Tex., 455.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-5\">The appellant was indicted under Art. 766 O. &amp; W.'s Digest (Art. 2410 Pas. Dig.), which was amended November 12, 1866. (Gen. Laws 11th Leg., p. 200).</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-6\">Art. 766, before being amended, read: \u201cIf any person shall steal any ' neat cattle,\u2019 sheep, goat or hog, he1 shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than five years.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-7\">When amended, it was as follows: \u201c If any person shall steal any cattle, sheep, goat or hog, he shall, if the value of the property stolen is twenty dollars or over, be punished by confinement in the penitentiary,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-8\">The changes made in the law was, instead of \u201c neat cattle,\u201d it expressed cattle only, and fixed the punishment according to the value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-9\">The amendment does not cure the defect in the indictment. As before stated, the word \u201c cattle \u201d embraces every species of the bovine genus. The two beeves charged in the indictment may have been bulls or cows.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-10\">Justice Wheeler, in Burch v. The Republic, 1 Tex., 608, says: \u201c It will generally be sufficient if the indictment follow the exact words of the statute in describing the offense, and it is never safe to depart from them. But where the statute uses a generic term it is not enough to employ <em>that term only </em>/ but the pleader must also state the species according to the truth of the case.\u201d The same doetrine.is laid down in Arch. Cr. Pl., p. 48.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-11\">Again Justice Wheeler said: \u201c Where the statute, for instance, makes the malicious killing of cattle a felony, it is not enough in an indictment on the statute to charge the defendant with killing \u00a3 cattle \u2019 generally, but the particular species of \u2022cattle must be stated.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-12\">Does not the indictment in this case come within the reasoning of Justice Wheeler ? Here the defendant, instead of being indicted for malicious killing \u201c cattle,\u201d is charged with having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>stolen <em>\u201c </em>two beeves, the same being cattle.\u201d Two generic terms are used, neither of which separately would charge.an offense; and combined, fail to charge an offense with that certainty required by law. (State v. West, 10 Tex., 553.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-6\"><em>E. B. </em>Turner, Attorney General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b477-7\">Lindsay, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8a\">Neither the exception to the ruling of the court allowing the attorney for the State to challenge a juror after the panel had been accepted, nor to the permission to prove the value of the cattle in United States currency, can be regarded as an error which requires the revision of this court. In the conduct of public trials, for the attainment of the ends of justice there must be a large discretion accorded to tribunals of original' jurisdiction; and unless that discretion is most unwisely or wantonly exercised, an appellate court would transcend its authority to attempt to control it. The object of the investigation is to secure a fair and impartial trial; and if, at any time in its progress, either party should discover that a juror is in the box who is incompetent to try the cause, no reason can be perceived why, at the instance of either party, the progress of the cause may not be arrested, and a competent juror substituted in his place. Nothing in the Criminal Code forbids it, and the demands of justice most obviously require it. In the case of Hanks v. The State of Texas, 21 Texas, 526, it is held if a juror who sat upon the trial had prejudged the case, and the fact was not known till after the trial\u2014and, of course, not known at the time of his acceptance as a juror\u2014it was good cause for a new trial. Unless, therefore, the right of challenge by the State had been exhausted at the time of the discovery of the obnoxious juror in the box, it can be regarded in no other light than the exercise of a sound and wise discretion by the court to allow the challenge to be made, and the substitution of an unexceptionable juror in his place.'</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">This indictment was founded upon Article 2410, as amended by the act of the 12tli of November, 1866. Its language is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u201c if any person shall steal any \u2018 neat \u2019 cattle, sheep, goat or hog, he shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary not less than two, nor more than five years.\u201d The amendment omits the word \u201c neat \u201d in the article. The obvious purpose of the Legislature was to leave the word \u201c cattle\u201d in the act, with its popular and well understood acceptation. The word, originally, certainly had a more extensive and comprehensive meaning than it now. has in the American. States.. Tt. has.still a more extended signification in English parlance; and to give the term the restricted meaning which it only possesses in general American phraseology, the Englishman still uses some qualifying adjective, such as <em>\"black ovneat </em>cattle. The popular signification of the word in this, country, however,, is well understood, without particularity of definition. Manifestly, in, its popular, as well as in the sense in which the Legislature uses it in the amendment, it means a <em>sp&gt;ecies </em>of animals having an essential, identity in qualities, to be taken and considered either collectively or individually : just as sheep, hogs or goats, with which it is associated in the act, and is thus contradistinguished from other <em>species </em>of animals which are scientifically arranged under the <em>generic </em>term \u201c cattle.\u201d Mo one would pretend that in indicting a felon for stealing a sheep, a goat or a hog, it would be necessary to aver that the animal was a buck or ewe, a boar or a sow. The difference in relation to a horse or a gelding, an ass or a mule, results alone from the discrimination made by the Legislature itself, in Article 2409, Paschal\u2019s Digest.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The court is of opinion, therefore, that the indictment is good under the law; that the charge is sustained by the proof, and that there was no ruling by the court on ,the trial which could prejudice the legal rights of the party convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Wherefore, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
