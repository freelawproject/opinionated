Beck. and G-. H. Fitzlmgh, dated April 23d, 1863, and payable to the plaintiff one day after date. The petition averred that since the making of the note, Frances T.

Fitzhugh.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>In view of the opinion of this court there is no occasion to notice f,he defense of failure of consideration set up below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">The case came to trial at the Spring term (1869). The \u25a0 plaintiff introduced the note sued on, which is copied into the transcript, and immediately following it is an entry of the clerk of the court, in parenthesis, thus: ( \u201c This note has no revenue stamp on it, nor is there any evidence on it that it ever was stamped. B. B. Bandolph, clerk.\u201d) Nothing further with reference to the revenue stamp appears in the statement of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">The plaintiff suggested the bankruptcy of the defendant, F'itzhugh, and dismissed as to him.

(See Nash v. George, 6 Texas, 236 ; Callahan v. Patterson and wife, 4 Texas, 61; Howard and wife v. North, 5 Texas, 290; Booth v. Cotton, 13 Texas, 364, 365.) We night cite many other cases in point, but feel that it is useless to do so; and, indeed, that the correctness of this assignment can not be questioned for a moment, and upon it alone the case must be reversed. The second assignment presents the question of the correctness of the judgment in a two-fold view. First\u2014that the separate property of the wife should be specifically designated for its satisfaction, in order to authorize an officer to subject it to the satisfaction of this judgment. (Nash v. George, 6 Texas, 236.) Secondly\u2014to protect the common property from its operations. The statute expresses plainly the liability of the common property to be for debts of the husband without restriction, but limits its liability for debts of the wife to those contracted during the marriage and for neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>saries. (Paschal\u2019s Digest, Art. 4642.) Argument upon a proposition, of which the simplest statement affords the gamplest elucidation, would be superfluous, and tend to confusion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-6\">No brief tor defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b282-7\">Lindsay, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar0\">Upon a note executed by tlie wife while a <em>feme </em>sols, suit was brought against herself and her husband, and judgment rendered against them without qualification. It- is certainly the law of this State that the husband can not be made liable for the debts of the wife contracted before marriage. nevertheless, the separate property of the wife, though placed by law under the control of the husband, is still subject to the payment of her debts contracted prior to the marriage. And it is because of the control which the statute gives the husband over the separate property of the wife during the coverture, that the husband is a necessary party to a suit against the wife for debts contracted by the wife prior to the marriage. The property is in his legal custody. That custody can not be disturbed without making him a party. Although the judgment is proper enough against the husband and wife, because of this marital custody, yet, it ought to be specifically ordered in it that the execution, which issues thereon, is to be levied upon the separate property of the wife in his possession, or under his control. Every judgment of this character ought always to be so modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Besides this error in the judgment of tlie District Court, it is also assigned for error that there was no revenue stamp affixed to the note sued on. This is matter of inspection for tlie court which tried the cause. And as the original paper is not before this court, by agreement of the parties, nor has it been brought hither by application for process of this court, the determination of the fact can not be here assumed. As, however, from the peculiar condition of the case, the court will reverse and remand it for re-trial, it may expedite the dispensation of justice-by presenting now the rule of law which controls the question raised by the assignment of error for want of a revenue sta mp.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The note was executed on the 23d day of April, 1863. The act of Congress which fixed the <em>status </em>of this written instrument, Avas approved the 3d of March, 1863. In \u00a7 16 of that act are these two provisos: <em>\u201c </em>Provided, that no instrument, document or paper, made, signed or issued prior to the first day of June, 1863, without being duly stamped, or having thereon an adhesive stamp to denote the duty imposed thereon, shall, for that cause be deemed invalid and of no effect.\u201d And: \u201c Provided that no instrument, document, writing or paper, required by Iuav to be stamped, signed or issued, without being duly stamped prior to the day aforesaid, or any copy thereof shall be admitted or used as evidence in any court, until a legal stamp or stamps, denoting the amount of duty charged thereon, shall have been affixed thereto, or used thereon, and the initials of the person using or affixing the same, together with the date when the same is so used or affixed, shall have been placed thereon by such person. And the person desiring to use any such instrument, document, writing or. paper, as evidence, or his agent or attorney, is authorized, in the presence of the court, to stamp the same, as heretofore provided by laAV.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">It is by this act of Congress that the validity of this paper or note, as an instrument of evidence, is preserved, by affixing the stamp before or at the time of trial, in the presence of the court. The subsequent acts of Congress did not change the law in relation to instruments of writing in the condition of this note. The Aralidity of all such instruments, coming within the purvieAV of these provisos may still be preserved in the manner therein pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The judgment is reversed, the cause remanded, and a nev\u2019 trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
