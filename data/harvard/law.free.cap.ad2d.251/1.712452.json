Corp. v Central Wine &amp; Liq., </em>187 AD2d 314, 315, citing <em>Langley v Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>484 US 86, and <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>315 US 447; <em>ICC Bridgeport Ltd. Partnership v Primrose Dev. Corp., </em>221 AD2d 417). We would also note the absence of evidence of the filing of the satisfaction in accordance with the recording acts, and of canceled checks showing actual payment of the debt to the lender, a bank in which defendant guarantors, principals of the mortgagor, had heavily invested. Nor is there merit to defendants\u2019 claim of champerty (Judiciary Law \u00a7 489), where the mortgage loan had already fallen into default and been accelerated before its assignment to plaintiff <em>(see, Limpar Realty Corp. v Uswiss Realty Holding, </em>112 AD2d 834). We have considered defendants\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Concur \u2014 Sullivan, J. P., Milonas, Rosenberger, Nardelli and Williams, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
