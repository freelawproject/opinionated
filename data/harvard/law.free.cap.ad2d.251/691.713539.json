Our review of both the record and defense counsel\u2019s brief leads to the same conclusion. Pursuant to a plea bargaining agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced to a prison term of 2 to 6 years. Defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and his sentence was in full accordance with both the plea bargaining agreement and the relevant statutory requirements. The judgment is, accordingly, affirmed and defense counsel\u2019s application for leave to withdraw is granted <em>(see, People v Cruwys, </em>113 AD2d 979, 980, <em>lv denied </em>67 NY2d 650).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\">Cardona, P.
