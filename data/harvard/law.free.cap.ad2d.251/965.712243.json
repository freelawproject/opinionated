Memorandum: Plaintiffs appeal from an order denying their motion for partial summary judgment on liability on the Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) cause of action. Supreme Court concluded that there is a factual issue whether the activity in which Walter Czaska (plaintiff) was engaged, insulating second-story windows by stapling sheets of plastic over them, was the alteration of a structure within the meaning of the Labor Law rather than routine maintenance. We exercise our authority to search the record and grant summary judgment to defendant dismissing the Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) cause of action despite the absence of a cross motion <em>(see, Dunham v Hilco Constr. Co., </em>89 NY2d 425, 429-430; <em>Merritt Hill Vineyards v Windy Hgts. Vineyard, </em>61 NY2d 106, 110-111). The activity in which plaintiff was engaged constitutes routine maintenance as a matter of law and does not fall within the protection of the Labor Law <em>(see, Joblon v Solow, </em>91 NY2d 457; <em>Smith v Shell Oil Co., </em>85 NY2d 1000, 1002; <em>Cook v Parish Land Co., </em>239 AD2d 956; <em>cf., Ferrari v Niasher Realty, </em>175 AD2d 591).
