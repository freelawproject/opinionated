All three cases present the question whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission properly concluded that the employers failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the occupational disease presumption established in Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B). The facts in the three cases differ and will be described separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B) of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">Hypertension or heart disease causing the death of, or any health condition or impairment resulting in total or partial disability of . . . (iii) members of county, city or town police departments [and] (iv) sheriffs and deputy sheriffs . . . shall be presumed to be occupational diseases, suffered in the line of duty, that are covered by this title unless such presumption is overcome by a preponderance of competent evidence to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">\n<em>BASS v. CITY OF RICHMOND POLICE DEPARTMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">In October 1994, Claude A. Bass, Jr., suffered a temporary loss of vision in his left eye and was diagnosed with atherosclerotic blockages of his left carotid and right iliac arteries. He underwent surgery to correct these conditions and was unable to work for about one month after the operation. At the time, Bass was a police captain in the City of Richmond Police Department (the employer), where he had worked since 1964. He had been diagnosed with hypertension in the early 1970\u2019s and had taken medication for that condition since the mid-1980\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">In April 1996, Bass filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B), seeking temporary total disability benefits for his hypertension and vascular disease. At a hearing before a deputy commissioner, Bass presented evidence from Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Nicolas P. Tulou, his treating physician, who first stated that Bass\u2019 employment \u201cin large measure\u201d contributed to his hypertension and vascular disease, but later testified that job stress was only a \u201cplausible\u201d factor in the development of his condition. Dr. Tulou also stated that several non-work-related \u201crisk factors\u201d were present in Bass\u2019 case, including a family history of heart disease, a lengthy history of cigarette smoking, high blood cholesterol levels, and excess weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Dr. Ronald K. Davis, a vascular surgeon who treated Bass, stated that the probable causes of Bass\u2019 condition were \u201cgenetic and environmental,\u201d but that he could not \u201crule out\u201d occupational stress as a contributing factor. Dr. Michael L. Hess, a cardiologist who reviewed Bass\u2019 medical records at the request of the employer, stated that \u201cit was extremely difficult to incriminate\u201d job stress as the cause of Bass\u2019 condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The deputy commissioner awarded Bass compensation benefits, and the Commission affirmed the award, noting that Bass presented medical evidence that occupational stress \u201cplayed some part\u201d in the development of his condition, and that there was \u201cno medical evidence to the contrary.\u201d The Commission agreed with the deputy commissioner\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat, on a somewhat conflicting record, the claimant\u2019s evidence was sufficient to bring him within the purview of the presumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals reversed the Commission\u2019s award of benefits and dismissed Bass\u2019 claim. <em>City of Richmond Police Dept. </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>26 Va. App. 121, 493 S.E.2d 661 (1997). The Court noted that two physicians attributed Bass\u2019 condition to a genetic cause. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 493 S.E.2d at 667. The Court stated that, \u201c[u]nder the standard set forth in <em>[Augusta County Sheriff\u2019s Dept. </em>v. <em>Overbey, </em>254 Va. 522, 492 S.E.2d 631 (1997)], this evidence of a genetic cause sufficiently rebutted the statutory presumption that claimant\u2019s heart disease is work-related.\u201d <em>Bass, </em>26 Va. App. at 134, 493 S.E.2d at 667. The Court held that Bass failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence, under Code \u00a7 65.2-401, that his disease arose out of and in the course of his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 493 S.E.2d at 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\"><em>PATTON </em>v. <em>LOUDOUN COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">In July 1994, John B. Patton, Jr., suffered a myocardial infarction, or \u201cheart attack,\u201d and underwent emergency cardiac catheterization and angioplasty. The symptoms of the heart attack began while Pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ton was working on the patrol division evening shift in the Loudoun County Sheriff\u2019s Department (the employer), where he had been employed for about 14 years. Patton later had a recurrence of chest pain and, as a result, had coronary artery bypass surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Patton later filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim seeking temporary total disability benefits for his heart disease. At a hearing before a deputy commissioner, Patton introduced evidence from Dr. Carey M. Marder, his treating cardiologist. Dr. Marder noted that Patton had \u201cmultiple cardiovascular risk factors,\u201d including a past history of cigarette smoking, a history of adult onset diabetes, hypertension, a positive family history for heart disease, and high cholesterol levels in his blood. Dr. Marder stated that it was difficult to say how much of Patton\u2019s coronary artery disease was related to the stress of his employment, because \u201c[s]tress as an independent risk factor is very difficult to quantitate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Dr. Richard A. Schwartz stated that occupational stress, hypertension, a history of cigarette smoking, and possibly diabetes, were identifiable factors causing Patton\u2019s heart disease. Dr. Schwartz explained that coronary artery disease is a \u201cmultifactorial process\u201d and that none of the above factors could be specifically implicated or excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The employer presented the opinion of Dr. Stuart F. Seides, a cardiologist, who stated that although Patton experienced the onset of his heart attack while on duty as a police officer, \u201cit is highly likely that [the heart attack] would have occurred in or around the same time frame regardless of his activities.\u201d Dr. Seides stated that the presence of atherosclerosis is the most important factor in the development of a myocardial infarction, and that the \u201crelationship of occupation to the development of atherosclerosis is virtually nil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The deputy commissioner awarded benefits to Patton. The Commission affirmed the award, holding that the employer had not excluded work-related stress as a contributing cause of the claimant\u2019s heart disease. The Commission noted that both Dr. Marder and Dr. Schwartz concluded that \u201coccupational stress was one of the [causative] factors in the claimant\u2019s heart disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">While the employer\u2019s appeal of the Commission\u2019s decision was pending in the Court of Appeals, this Court decided the <em>Overbey </em>case. Patton then filed a petition asking the Court of Appeals to remand the entire case to the Commission for reconsideration \u201cunder the <em>Overbey </em>standard.\u201d Citing <em>Overbey, </em>the Court of Appeals held in an unpublished order that \u201cthe evidence of claimant\u2019s risk factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>and the medical opinions offered constituted \u2018competent medical evidence of a non-work-related cause\u2019 sufficient to rebut the presumption.\u201d <em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>Record No. 2015-97-4 (Feb. 6, 1998). However, since the Court was unable to determine whether Patton had proved \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that his heart disease arose out of and in the course of his employment,\u201d the Court remanded the case to the Commission to make specific findings regarding the credibility of conflicting medical evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\n<em>CITY OF HOPEWELL v. MICHAEL W. TIRPAK</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In February 1995, Michael W. Tirpak had a \u201cstress test\u201d as part of a routine physical examination scheduled by his employer, the City of Hopewell Police Department (the employer). During the test, Tirpak experienced a burning sensation in his chest and shortness of breath, and an electrocardiogram revealed some coronary abnormalities. A cardiac catheterization showed blockages in three of his coronary arteries. As a result, Tirpak had coronary artery bypass surgery. At the time of surgery, Tirpak was a supervising sergeant of the evening patrol shift for the City of Hopewell Police Department, where he had been employed since 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Tirpak filed a claim for temporary total disability benefits based on his heart disease. At a hearing before a deputy commissioner, Tirpak presented evidence from his treating cardiologist, Dr. Ashok Kumar, who stated that Tirpak had a 30-year history of smoking cigarettes, and that he had a family history of premature coronary artery disease. Dr. Kumar also stated that he could not exclude job-related stress as a cause of Tirpak\u2019s heart disease. Dr. J. James Zocco, the cardiac surgeon who performed Tirpak\u2019s surgery, stated that work-related stress could not be excluded as a contributing factor in Tirpak\u2019s heart disease. Dr. Zocco also stated that Tirpak had other coronary risk factors, including a family history of heart disease, a 30-year history of smoking cigarettes, hypertension, and elevated blood cholesterol levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The employer presented evidence from Dr. Stuart F. Seides, a cardiologist who reviewed Tirpak\u2019s medical records. Noting Tirpak\u2019s several \u201crisk factors,\u201d Dr. Seides stated that Tirpak\u2019s employment had \u201cnothing whatsoever\u201d to do with his coronary artery disease. The employer also presented evidence from Dr. Jack Freund, a specialist in internal medicine who reviewed Tirpak\u2019s medical records. Dr. Freund stated that, based on Tirpak\u2019s non-work-related \u201crisk factors\u201d for coronary artery disease, Tirpak\u2019s heart disease and heart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>attack \u201cwould have occurred no matter what type of employment he was engaged in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The deputy commissioner awarded Tirpak benefits, and the Commission affirmed the award, stating that it gave greater weight to the opinion of the treating physicians, who had stated that they could not exclude employment-related stress as one of the contributing factors. The Commission stated that \u201c[t]he employer fails to rebut the [statutory] presumption where a work related factor such as occupational stress is not excluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals held that the Commission\u2019s language \u201cindicated\u201d that it had applied an incorrect standard, which required the employer to exclude the possibility of a work-related cause of Tirpak\u2019s disease without regard to whether he had presented evidence of such a causal link. <em>City of Hopewell </em>v. <em>Tirpak, </em>28 Va. App. 100, 111-12, 502 S.E.2d 161, 166-67 (1998). The Court vacated the award of benefits and remanded the case to the Commission for further proceedings on the issue whether the employer had overcome the statutory presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 502 S.E.2d at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\n<em>APPLICATION OF THE STATUTORY PRESUMPTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B), the legislature included \u201c [h]pertension or heart disease\u201d among those diseases that \u201cshall be presumed to be occupational diseases . . . unless such presumption is overcome by a preponderance of competent evidence to the contrary.\u201d In <em>Page v. City of Richmond, </em>218 Va. 844, 847, 241 S.E.2d 775, <em>111 </em>(1978), we explained that the purpose of the statutory presumption is to establish by law, in the absence of evidence, a causal connection between certain occupations and death or disability resulting from specified diseases. We held that a claimant firefighter was entitled to compensation benefits because his employer had failed to overcome the statutory presumption by showing both that 1) the claimant\u2019s disease was not caused by his employment, and 2) there was a non-work-related cause of the disease. <em>Id. </em>at 847-48, 241 S.E.2d at <em>777.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">We again applied this two-part test in <em>Fairfax County Fire &amp; Rescue Servs. </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>222 Va. 535, 281 S.E.2d 897 (1981). There, a firefighter who developed sarcoidosis, a disease affecting the lungs, relied on the statutory presumption of occupational disease provided by former Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1. The employer produced medical testimony that the firefighter\u2019s employment did not cause his disease, but the employer failed to present any medical evidence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>non-work-related cause of the disabling disease. Since the employer failed to prove one of the two elements required to overcome the statutory presumption, we upheld the Commission\u2019s award of benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 539, 281 S.E.2d at 900; <em>see also Berry </em>v. <em>County of Henrico, </em>219 Va. 259, 265, 247 S.E.2d 389, 392 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">In <em>Doss v. Fairfax County Fire &amp; Rescue Dep\u2019t., </em>229 Va. 440, 331 S.E.2d 795 (1985), we applied the two-part test to a firefighter\u2019s claim for benefits for a respiratory disease. The claimant relied on the statutory presumption and presented no evidence to counter the employer\u2019s medical evidence that 1) the claimant\u2019s job did not cause his respiratory disability, and 2) the claimant\u2019s condition was \u201cmore than likely a hereditary phenomenon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441-42, 331 S.E.2d at 795-96. We held that the Commission did not err in ruling that the employer presented sufficient evidence to overcome the statutory presumption, and that the evidence concerning a \u201chereditary\u201d cause was sufficient to meet the <em>Page </em>requirement that the employer produce evidence of a non-work-related cause of the disease. <em>Id. </em>at 442-43, 331 S.E.2d at 796-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In <em>Overbey, </em>the employer acknowledged the applicability of the two-part test by conceding that, to overcome the statutory presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B), the employer was required \u201cto establish a non-work-related cause for [the claimant\u2019s] heart condition and that job stress was not the cause.\u201d 254 Va. at 526, 492 S.E.2d at 633. The claimant contended, however, that the presumption also imposed on the employer the burden of \u201cproducing a preponderance of evidence excluding the <em>possibility </em>that his heart disease was work related.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In rejecting the claimant\u2019s contention, we quoted from <em>Doss, </em>stating that, to overcome the statutory presumption, the employer merely \u201cmust adduce competent medical evidence of a non-work-related cause of the disabling disease.\u201d <em>Overbey, </em>254 Va. at 527, 492 S.E.2d at 634 (quoting <em>Doss, </em>229 Va. at 442, 331 S.E.2d at 796). This quotation was made in the context of our holding that, to overcome the statutory presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B), an employer is not required to exclude the <em>possibility </em>that job stress may have been a contributing factor in the development of a claimant\u2019s heart disease. <em>Id. </em>at 527, 492 S.E.2d at 634. However, because that quotation did not discuss both parts of the two-part test applied in <em>Page </em>and our other decisions, some confusion has resulted regarding the viability of both parts of that test. To clarify this matter, we reaffirm the two-part test employed in <em>Page </em>and our other decisions cited above con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ceming the elements of proof necessary to overcome the statutory presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The claimant in <em>Overbey </em>relied on the statutory presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B) and did not present any medical evidence. The employer presented medical evidence showing that 1) the claimant\u2019s job was not a cause of his heart disease, and 2) the disease was caused by several \u201crisk factors,\u201d including a history of heavy cigarette smoking, elevated cholesterol, a family history of heart disease, and diabetes mellitus. <em>Id. </em>at 525, 492 S.E.2d at 633. Thus, our holding in <em>Overbey </em>effectively applied the two-part test used in <em>Page, </em>while rejecting the claimant\u2019s attempt to add another requirement to the employer\u2019s statutory burden for overcoming the presumption established by Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\n<em>ASSESSMENT OF EVIDENCE UNDER CODE \u00a7 65.2-402(B)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Under the statutory language, the employer may overcome the presumption by producing \u201ca preponderance of competent evidence to the contrary.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B). To overcome the presumption the employer must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>both </em>that 1) the claimant\u2019s disease was not caused by his employment, and 2) there was a non-work-related cause of the disease. <em>See Newman, </em>222 Va. at 539, 281 S.E.2d at 899-900; <em>Page, </em>218 Va. at 847-48, 241 S.E.2d at 777. Thus, if the employer does not prove by a preponderance of the evidence both parts of this two-part test, the employer has failed to overcome the statutory presumption. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The determination whether the employer has met this burden is made by the Commission after exercising its role as finder of fact. In this role, the Commission resolves all conflicts in the evidence and determines the weight to be accorded the various evidentiary submissions. \u201cThe award of the Commission . . . shall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A); <em>Falls Church Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Laidler, </em>254 Va. 474, 478-79, 493 S.E.2d 521, 524 (1997); <em>Ivey v. Puckett Constr. Co., </em>230 Va. 486,-488, 338 S.E.2d 640, 641 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">In providing that the statutory presumption may be overcome by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary, Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B) implicitly directs the Commission as finder of fact to consider all evidence on the issue of causation presented by the claimant, as well as by the employer. When the Commission determines that the employer has failed to overcome the statutory pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>sumption, the claimant is entitled to an award of benefits under the Act. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-400 to -407.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">On appeal from this determination, the reviewing court must assess whether there is credible evidence to support the Commission\u2019s award. <em>Celanese Fibers Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, 229 </em>Va. 117, 121, 326 S.E.2d 687, 690 (1985); <em>Hercules, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gunther, </em>13 Va. App. 357, 361, 412 S.E.2d 185, 187 (1991). Thus, unlike the Commission, the reviewing court is not charged with determining anew whether the employer\u2019s evidence of causation should be accorded sufficient weight to constitute a preponderance of the evidence on that issue. <em>See Celanese Fibers Co., 229 </em>Va. at 121, 326 S.E.2d at 690; <em>Caskey </em>v. <em>Dan River Mills, Inc., </em>225 Va. 405, 411, 302 S.E.2d 507, 510-11 (1983); <em>Macica </em>v. <em>ARA Servs. Tidewater Vending, </em>26 Va. App. 36, 41, 492 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1997); <em>Shawnee Management Corp. </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>25 Va. App. 672, 679, 492 S.E.2d 456, 459 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><em>BASS </em>v. <em>CITY OF RICHMOND POLICE DEPARTMENT</em></p>\n<p id=\"AV\"><em>PATTON </em>v. <em>LOUDOUN COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we disagree with the employers\u2019 assertion that, since undisputed evidence showed there were non-work-related causes of both claimants\u2019 heart disease, this evidence was sufficient as a matter of law to overcome the statutory presumption. As we have stated, to overcome the statutory presumption, the employer must show by a preponderance of the evidence <em>both </em>that 1) the claimant\u2019s disease was not caused by his employment, and 2) there was a non-work-related cause of the disease. <em>See Newman, 222 </em>Va. at 539, 281 S.E.2d at 899-900; <em>Page, </em>218 Va. at 847-48, 241 S.E.2d at <em>777. </em>Thus, we conclude that the evidence of non-work-related causes of Bass\u2019 and Patton\u2019s heart disease, standing alone, did not overcome the statutory presumption, because that evidence satisfied only one part of the two-part test.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">We disagree, however, with the claimants\u2019 assertions that the records in their cases permit us to enter final judgment reinstating the Commission\u2019s awards. In both cases, the Commission failed to address the applicable two-part test and state whether the employer had met its statutory burden to overcome the presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B) by a preponderance of the evidence. Therefore, we will reverse both judgments of the Court of Appeals, vacate the Commission\u2019s awards, and remand the cases to the Court of Appeals for remand to the Commission to reconsider the evidence presented in accordance with the principles expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\n<em>CITY OF HOPEWELL v. TIRPAK</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The employer first contends that the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the Commission\u2019s determination that the claimant\u2019s evidence established a communication of occupational disease on February 17, 1995. We disagree with this contention, because the Commission\u2019s factual findings are binding on appeal. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A); <em>Falls Church Constr. Co. v. Laidler, </em>254 Va. at 478-79, 493 S.E.2d at 524; <em>Ivey </em>v. <em>Puckett Constr. Co., </em>230 Va. at 488, 338 S.E.2d at 641. Here, the Commission relied on the claimant\u2019s testimony that Dr. Kumar told him on that date that his heart disease was caused by \u201cstress on the job.\u201d Since the Commission accepted the claimant\u2019s testimony on this issue, we conclude that the Court of Appeals properly refused to disturb the Commission\u2019s factual finding on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The employer next asserts that the Court of Appeals \u201cignored the concession by Tirpak that Hopewell had rebutted the heart disease presumption.\u201d We disagree with the employer\u2019s argument, because the record shows that Tirpak conceded only that \u201cnon-work-related causes [of his disease] were adduced by the employer.\u201d He made no further concession, but merely addressed the proper outcome of the case in the event the Court of Appeals concluded that the employer had overcome the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Next, we disagree with the employer\u2019s argument that it would be denied due process if the statutory presumption is upheld in the face of credible evidence of non-work-related causes of the claimant\u2019s disease. In <em>Newman, </em>we stated that, by establishing the statutory presumption, the legislature made a public policy judgment allocating to the employer a burden of proof that carried file ultimate risk of non-persuasion. 222 Va. at 541, 281 S.E.2d at 901. We explained that the legislature\u2019s decision \u201cto cast that burden upon the employer infringes no constitutional right,\u201d because the employer may introduce evidence to overcome the statutory presumption. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the employer\u2019s right of due process is not violated by requiring it to produce a preponderance of the evidence in accordance with the two-part test set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">We also find no merit in the employer\u2019s central contention in this appeal, that the employer met the burden of proof set forth in <em>Overbey </em>to overcome the statutory presumption by proving a non-work-related cause of Tirpak\u2019s disease. As stated above, proof by a preponderance of the evidence of a non-work-related cause of a claimant\u2019s disease satisfies only one part of the two-part test applied in <em>Overbey </em>and several of our earlier decisions. To overcome the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>utory presumption, the employer must also establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant\u2019s disease was not caused by his employment. <em>See Newman, </em>222 Va. at 539, 281 S.E.2d at 899-900; <em>Page, </em>218 Va. at 847-48, 241 S.E.2d at <em>111.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Although we disagree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 characterization of the Commission\u2019s decision, we observe that the Commission did not state whether the employer met the required two-part test in accordance with its statutory burden of producing a preponderance of the evidence to overcome the presumption. Therefore, on remand, the Commission will be required to reconsider the evidence under that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Finally, we note that we have considered the remaining assignments of error raised by the employer. We conclude that they do not require discussion because they are resolved by our earlier analysis in this opinion, are beyond the scope of the judgment appealed from, or are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">For these reasons, we will affirm that part of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment addressing the issues of subject matter jurisdiction,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> due process, date of communication of occupational disease, and the absence of a concession by Tirpak regarding the statutory presumption. We will vacate the balance of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment, vacate the Commission\u2019s award of benefits to Tirpak, and remand the case to the Court of Appeals for remand to the Commission to reconsider the evidence presented in accordance with the principles expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Record No. 980612 \u2014 <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Record No. 980861 \u2014 <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Record No. 982126 \u2014 <em>Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\"> In its brief filed in this case, the employer withdrew its assignment of error challenging the Commission\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
