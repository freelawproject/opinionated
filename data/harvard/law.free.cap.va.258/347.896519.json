BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we will review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>Clagett v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 79, 84, 472 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1996), <em>cert, denied, </em>519 U.S. 1122 (1997). Yarbrough and Dominic Jackson Rainey had attended high school together in Mecklenburg County prior to Rainey\u2019s moving to Richmond with his mother. While on a subsequent visit to see his grandfather in Mecklenburg County, Rainey renewed his acquaintance with Yarbrough. On May 7, 1997, Yarbrough told Rainey of his plan to rob Cyril Hugh Hamby, the 77-year-old owner of Hamby\u2019s Store on U.S. Route 1 in Mecklenburg County. The following evening, Yarbrough went to Rainey\u2019s grandfather\u2019s house and told Rainey that \u201che was ready to go rob Mr. Hamby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Yarbrough and Rainey were seen walking along U.S. Route 1 toward Hamby\u2019s Store between 9:30 and 10:30 p.m. on May 8, 1997. Yarbrough was armed with a shotgun. The two men waited at a picnic table across the road until there were no customers in the store. Yarbrough hid the shotgun under his coat and the two men entered the store. At Yarbrough\u2019s direction, Rainey locked the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Yarbrough pointed the shotgun at Hamby and ordered him to come out from behind the store\u2019s counter. Yarbrough and Rainey took Hamby to the living quarters at the rear of the store where they found an electrical extension cord and string. Yarbrough brought Hamby back into the public area of the store, forced him to lie on the floor in an aisle, and tied Hamby\u2019s hands behind his back with the extension cord and string.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Yarbrough went to the store\u2019s electrical circuit box and turned off the outside lights. He then demanded that Hamby reveal where guns were hidden in the store. When Hamby denied having any guns, Yarbrough kicked Hamby in the head and upper left arm. Yarbrough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>then forced the store\u2019s cash register open by dropping it on the floor and took the money that was in the register.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Yarbrough returned to where Hamby was lying and, pointing the shotgun at him, again demanded to be told where guns were hidden in the store. When Hamby again denied having any guns, Yarbrough put down the shotgun, took a knife from his pocket, and began to cut Hamby\u2019s neck with a \u201csawing motion\u201d as Hamby pleaded with Yarbrough to stop. After cutting Hamby\u2019s neck at least ten times, Yarbrough rifled through Hamby\u2019s clothing and took his wallet. Yarbrough and Rainey took beer, wine, and cigarettes from the store and left by the back door. Yarbrough gave Rainey one hundred dollars in small bills and kept a larger sum for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Yarbrough and Rainey returned to Rainey\u2019s grandfather\u2019s house to change clothes and then went to the home of Conrad Dortch to buy marijuana. Dortch was not at home, so Yarbrough and Rainey waited on the porch and drank the wine taken during the robbery. Dortch arrived home at approximately 12:45 a.m. and sold Yarbrough a marijuana cigarette for $10. According to Rainey, Yarbrough was \u201cflashing\u201d his money. When Yarbrough and Rainey left Dortch\u2019s home, Rainey threw an empty wine bottle into the yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Yarbrough and Rainey returned to Rainey\u2019s grandfather\u2019s house where they spent the remainder of the night. Before leaving in the morning, Yarbrough threw his tennis shoes, which were stained with Hamby\u2019s blood, into a trash barrel behind the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Hamby\u2019s body was discovered at approximately 8:20 a.m. on May 9, 1997 by Betsy Russell, a former employee of Hamby\u2019s who had been informed by a neighbor that \u201cthere was something wrong at the store.\u201d A subsequent autopsy revealed that Hamby had bled to death as a result of deep, penetrating wounds to his neck. According to a state medical examiner, Hamby\u2019s wounds were \u201centirely consistent\u201d with an attempted beheading, however, because no major arteries were cut, it would have taken at least several minutes for Hamby to have bled to death. Hamby also had several blunt force injuries to his head and upper left arm consistent with his having been kicked with moderate force.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">On May 10, 1997, Dortch contacted the Virginia State Police and told them of his encounter with Yarbrough and Rainey. Police later recovered a wine bottle and label from Dortch\u2019s yard. The wine bottle was of a brand that was sold at Hamby\u2019s store.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">On May 14, 1997, police executed a search warrant at Yarbrough\u2019s home and recovered bloodstained clothing and a three-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>bladed \u201cUncle Henry\u201d pocketknife. Police also recovered Yarbrough\u2019s tennis shoes from the trash barrel behind Rainey\u2019s grandfather\u2019s house. DNA testing of the bloodstains found on Yarbrough\u2019s shoes and clothing established a positive match with Hamby\u2019s blood. DNA tests of blood traces found on the \u201cUncle Henry\u201d knife established that a mixture of Hamby\u2019s and Yarbrough\u2019s DNA was present on the blade of the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Forensic analysis of the bloodstain patterns on Yarbrough\u2019s clothing supported the conclusion that they were consistent with a spray of blood resulting from trauma. An expert testified that the bloodstains on the lower front of Yarbrough\u2019s shirt were made \u201cin close proximity to the trauma that released the blood.\u201d Several shoeprints found in the store were identified as having been made by Yarbrough\u2019s shoes, including those near the circuit box, behind the counter, and in the bloodstains near Hamby\u2019s head. Police also recovered Rainey\u2019s boots and identified prints found near Hamby\u2019s feet and in the living quarters as having been made by these boots.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">II. PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"A8I\">\n<em>A. Pre-trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">On September 8, 1997, after Yarbrough had been arrested, but before he was indicted for Hamby\u2019s murder, the Commonwealth filed a motion for the appointment of a special assistant prosecutor. In that motion, the Commonwealth relied on Code \u00a7 19.2-155, which permits the appointment of a special prosecutor where the local Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney is unable to fulfill his duties by reason of temporary disability or ethical disqualification. The Commonwealth further asserted that \u201cit would be proper to have another attorney <em>assist </em>in prosecuting [Yarbrough] because of the complex nature of the case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Following an <em>ex parte </em>hearing, the trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion and appointed Warren Von Schuch, an assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for Chesterfield County, as a special assistant prosecutor. In doing so, the trial court cited Code \u00a7 19.2-155 and made reference to Von Schuch\u2019s experience with complex cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">On September 25, 1997, Yarbrough filed a motion to vacate the appointment of Von Schuch. The trial court agreed to review its prior order and permitted Yarbrough to present argument opposing the Commonwealth\u2019s renewed motion for appointment of a special assistant prosecutor. After hearing argument from both Yarbrough and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Commonwealth, the trial court vacated the prior order and then granted the Commonwealth\u2019s renewed motion, again appointing Von Schuch to assist in the prosecution of Yarbrough. In doing so, the trial court relied on its inherent authority to administer cases on its docket, making no reference to Code \u00a7 19.2-155.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">During its December 1997 term, the Mecklenburg County grand jury indicted Yarbrough for capital murder of Hamby during the commission of a robbery, Code \u00a7 18.2-31(4), and robbery of Hamby, Code \u00a7 18.2-58. On January 30, 1998, Yarbrough filed a motion and supporting memorandum challenging the constitutionality of Virginia\u2019s capital murder statute and capital punishment sentencing and appellate review procedures on multiple grounds. The trial court heard argument on this motion and other pre-trial matters on May 4, 1998. In an order entered June 24, 1998 <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to May 4, 1998, the trial court overruled the motion in its entirety without specific comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\n<em>B. Guilt-determination Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">A four-day jury trial commenced in the trial court on June 23, 1998. At that trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence in accord with the above-recited facts. Rainey was the principal witness for the Commonwealth. In his testimony, Rainey stated that on the way to Hamby\u2019s Store he told Yarbrough that \u201cI was ready to go back to the house, I didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d Yarbrough threatened \u201cto do something\u201d to Rainey if he did not assist in the robbery. Rainey then described in detail the events leading up to the killing. According to Rainey, when Yarbrough pulled the knife from his pocket, Rainey protested and asked Yarbrough what he planned to do. Yarbrough did not respond and \u201cstarted to cut Mr. Hamby . . . around the [front of the] neck. And then after he finished, he cut him on the back of the neck.\u201d Rainey further testified that when Yarbrough first started the cutting, Hamby \u201cwas saying \u2018please\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">David Thompson testified that he saw Yarbrough and Rainey walking toward Hamby\u2019s Store between 9:30 and 10:30 on the evening of the murder. Dortch also testified, relating the incidents of his encounter with Yarbrough and Rainey later that night. The Commonwealth presented extensive testimony and physical evidence through police investigators and forensic experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Yarbrough moved to strike \u201cthe capital aspect of the murder charge\u201d on the ground that Rainey\u2019s accomplice testimony was the only evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>from which the jury could find that Yarbrough, and not Rainey, was the actual killer. Yarbrough contended that Rainey\u2019s testimony was unreliable and inherently self-serving. The trial court overruled the motion to strike stating that the Commonwealth had made out a <em>prima facie </em>case through Rainey\u2019s testimony and the forensic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Yarbrough called as witnesses the assistant principal and a teacher from the high school Yarbrough and Rainey had attended. Each testified that they knew Rainey and that \u201c[h]is reputation is not that good in reference to honesty.\u201d Yarbrough called no other witnesses and did not testify on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">At the conclusion of the evidence, Yarbrough renewed his motion to strike the capital element of the murder charge, again asserting that Rainey\u2019s testimony was not sufficiently credible to permit the jury to find that Yarbrough, and not Rainey, had cut Hamby\u2019s neck. The trial court overruled the motion. The jury returned its verdict against Yarbrough, finding him guilty of the capital murder and robbery of Hamby.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\n<em>C. Penalty-determination Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">After the jury returned its verdict finding Yarbrough guilty of capital murder and robbery, the penalty-determination phase of the trial immediately commenced. Prior to the presentation of evidence, the trial court received proposed jury instructions. At that time, the Commonwealth indicated that it would present evidence and argument solely on the issue of whether the death penalty was warranted because Yarbrough\u2019s crime was \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or an aggravated battery to the victim,\u201d commonly referred to as the \u201cvileness\u201d aggravating factor. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. Accordingly, the jury was not to be instructed to consider the probability that Yarbrough \u201cwould commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society,\u201d the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d aggravating factor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Yarbrough, asserting that he would be ineligible for parole if given a sentence of life imprisonment, proffered the following jury instruction: \u201cThe words \u2018imprisonment for life\u2019 mean imprisonment for life without possibility of parole.\u201d The Commonwealth opposed the instruction on the ground that <em>Simmons v. South Carolina, </em>512 U.S. 154 (1994), and its application in prior decisions of this Court required a \u201clife means life\u201d instruction only where the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>wealth sought to prove the future dangerousness aggravating factor. Yarbrough contended that where a \u201clife means life\u201d instruction is given, the jury tends to favor life imprisonment over the death penalty and that the Commonwealth chose not to present evidence on future dangerousness in order to avoid the applicability of such an instruction. Yarbrough asserted that the instruction was nonetheless appropriate as a matter of fundamental fairness and to assure a lack of juror confusion even in the absence of an assertion of future dangerousness. The trial court refused Yarbrough\u2019s \u201clife means life\u201d instruction, stating that it was not appropriate under the current state of the law in Virginia where the Commonwealth relies only on the vileness aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence during the penalty-determination phase of the trial consisted of the testimony of several of Hamby\u2019s relatives and an acquaintance. Yarbrough called his mother as a witness on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">During closing argument Yarbrough\u2019s counsel did not expressly assert that Yarbrough would be ineligible for parole, but did assert that \u201c[l]ife is life . . . [h]e will spend a long time in prison\u201d and suggested that Yarbrough\u2019s life span would determine the number of years he would serve in prison. After the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument, Yarbrough again sought to have the jury instructed that he would be ineligible for parole should he be given a life sentence, asserting that the Commonwealth had implicitly argued that Yarbrough would present a continuing danger to society if not given the death sentence. The trial court again refused to give the instruction, finding that the Commonwealth\u2019s argument had not implicated the issue of Yarbrough\u2019s future dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">After deliberating for some time, the jury sent a question to the trial court. The trial court indicated to counsel that \u201c[ijt is the same question we always have.\u201d The jury\u2019s note read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">If possible:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">Will you please define \u201clife in prison?\u201d Does that mean your entire life or does it have a certain limit such as 12 years? (is there a specific limit already set?)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">Does that also include parole will be offered after a specified number of years have been served?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">Yarbrough again urged the trial court to define life imprisonment as life imprisonment without possibility of parole. The Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>wealth again asserted that the instruction was not proper and asked the trial court to refuse to answer the jury\u2019s question. The trial court recalled the jury to the courtroom and responded to the question, saying</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">The only way I can answer [the jury\u2019s question] under the present law in Virginia, as I understand it, is to say to you that I can\u2019t answer it, and that is that in sentencing you must do what you feel is appropriate under the circumstances of this case and not concern yourselves with what might happen afterwards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The jury then deliberated further and sentenced Yarbrough to death for the capital murder of Hamby and to life imprisonment for the associated robbery charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\n<em>D. Post-trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Following the preparation of a pre-sentence report, the trial court received argument from counsel on confirming the jury\u2019s sentence of death. In arguing to set aside the death sentence, Yarbrough\u2019s counsel asserted the trial court was \u201cwrong in not telling\u201d the jurors that Yarbrough would have been parole-ineligible because \u201c[t]his Court knows the truth, that there is no parole.\u201d The trial court, without comment, imposed the jury\u2019s verdict and sentence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">We begin by noting that Yarbrough has neither briefed nor presented oral argument on the fourth assignment of error originally designated by him under Rule 5:22(b). That assignment of error asserted that the trial court erred in denying Yarbrough\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude certain physical evidence and laboratory analysis of that evidence for failure of die Commonwealth to establish the necessary chain of custody. At oral argument of this appeal, Yarbrough conceded that the failure to address an assignment of error constituted a waiver of the issue asserted therein. <em>Sheppard v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 379, 386, 464 S.E.2d 131, 135 (1995), <em>cert, denied, </em>517 U.S. 1110 (1996). Accordingly, we will not address the issue asserted in assignment of error number 4. Moreover, we will address the remaining assignments of error as originally designated in the Rule 5:22(b) statement. <em>Id. </em>at 385-86, 464 S.E.2d at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>\n<em>A. Issues Previously Decided</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In assignment of error number 7, Yarbrough raises various challenges to the constitutionality of Virginia\u2019s capital murder statute and the statutory scheme under which capital murder trials are conducted and death sentences are reviewed on appeal. The arguments raised within this assignment of error have been thoroughly addressed and rejected in numerous prior capital murder cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find no reason to modify our previously expressed views on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>B. Appointment of Special Assistant Prosecutor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In assignment of error number 1, Yarbrough asserts that the trial court erred in granting the Commonwealth\u2019s renewed motion to appoint as a special assistant prosecutor an assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney from another jurisdiction. Yarbrough contends that by its express terms Code \u00a7 19.2-155, the statute relied upon by the Commonwealth in originally seeking the appointment and cited by the trial court in its original order, applies only where \u201cthe attorney for the Commonwealth ... is unable to act, or to attend to his official duties as attorney for the Commonwealth, due to sickness, disability or other reason of a temporary nature,\u201d such as a fiduciary or familial relationship to the accused, or some other ethical bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Yarbrough correctly asserts that no conflict or disability was present that would have prohibited the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for Mecklenburg County from prosecuting the case. Indeed, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney served as lead counsel for the Commonwealth throughout the trial. Additionally,' Yarbrough asserts that a further provision of Code \u00a7 19.2-155 permitting a trial court to appoint \u201cas a special assistant attorney for the Commonwealth, without additional compensation, an attorney employed by a state agency\u201d upon request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>of the Commonwealth and upon a finding by the trial court that \u201csuch appointment will aid in the prosecution of a particular case or cases\u201d is also inapplicable. Yarbrough asserts that this is so because the special assistant prosecutor named by the trial court in this instance was an assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and, thus, he was an employee of a locality, not a state agency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">We need not address these contentions, however, because the trial court vacated its original <em>ex parte </em>order citing Code \u00a7 19.2-155. In the subsequent order appointing the special assistant prosecutor, entered after Yarbrough was afforded an opportunity to be heard and oppose the Commonwealth\u2019s renewed motion, the trial court relied solely on its inherent authority to administer cases on its docket. Thus, we need only be concerned with whether the appointment of a special prosecutor on motion of the Commonwealth falls within this broad discretion afforded to a trial court. This is a matter of first impression and one of obvious import to the conduct of criminal trials in this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Code \u00a7 15.2-1628(C), requiring the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorneys of most counties and their assistants to devote full time to their duties, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, no attorney for the Commonwealth or assistant required to devote full time to his duties shall receive any additional compensation from the Commonwealth or any county or city for substituting for or assisting any other attorney for the Commonwealth or his assistant in any criminal prosecution or investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The clear import of this statute, and an identical provision of Code \u00a7 15.2-1630 applicable to the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorneys for independent cities and their assistants, is that the prosecutors from one locality may call upon the prosecutors of another locality to assist in complex litigation. Indeed, because a Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, no less than any other member of the bar, is subject to the rules of professional responsibility, the duty of competence may require a Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney of lesser experience to seek the association of more experienced counsel when prosecuting a difficult, complex case. This being true, certainly a trial court does not abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>its discretion in permitting the Commonwealth to obtain the assistance of a Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney or assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney from another jurisdiction who has greater familiarity with the issues involved in such prosecutions and whose services are to be rendered without additional expense to the taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Yarbrough contends, however, that \u201c[a] prosecutor from outside the county will not have the same sense of dedication to the citizens of the county, including the defendant\u201d and, thus, \u201c[t]he out-of-county prosecutor has a legal disability\u201d analogous to that of the disability of a prospective juror who is excused from jury service because he or she has not been a resident of the locality in which a trial occurs for at least six months. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-337. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The statutory residency requirements for determining the pool of potential jurors in a locality may arguably be taken as securing the right of a defendant to a trial by a jury of his peers. To suggest, however, that a similar residency requirement should be imposed upon a prosecutor is totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In the first place, the statutes governing the appointment of assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorneys contain no requirement of residency in the locality in which they are employed. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-1628 and -1630. Secondly, as noted above, the rules of professional responsibility place upon a Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney the same burdens and duties as any attorney. Paramount among these responsibilities is the duty to perform competently and to perform his duties to the fullest extent permitted and required by the law. We presume that any Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, cognizant of his or her professional responsibility, will perform the duties required of the office without regard to the locality in which he or she is called upon to render service. Finally, and moreover, the appointment of a special assistant attorney for the Commonwealth does not prejudice the defendant. This is necessarily so simply because such an appointment does not alter the truth-finding process of the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">For these reasons, we hold that it rests within the sound discretion of the trial court to appoint a Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney or an assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to assist the regular Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney where the Commonwealth requests the appointment for good cause. In the present case, the trial court did not err in granting the Commonwealth\u2019s requested appointment of a special assistant prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\n<em>C. Credibility and Sufficiency of Evidence of Capital Murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">In assignments of error 5 and 6, Yarbrough asserts that the trial court erred in failing to strike the capital aspect of the murder indictment and in imposing the jury\u2019s verdict with respect to capital murder. As he did at trial, Yarbrough maintains that the evidence adduced by the Commonwealth fails to establish that he, and not Rainey, was the actual instigator and perpetrator of the robbery and killing of Hamby. Yarbrough asserts that Rainey\u2019s accomplice testimony lacked sufficient credibility and that, absent credible corroboration from direct testimony, the forensic evidence established only that Yarbrough was present at the time of the murder. Thus, he contends that the evidence failed to support the indictment for capital murder or, in the alternative, that the jury could not find him guilty of capital murder because of reasonable doubt arising from Rainey\u2019s accomplice testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Yarbrough further contends that even if he could be found guilty of capital murder, the evidence was insufficient for the jury to find in the penalty-determination phase that the killing involved torture or an aggravated battery and, thus, that the Commonwealth had failed to sustain its burden of proof as to the vileness aggravating factor.

Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 107, 113, 406 S.E.2d 39, 42, <em>cert, denied, </em>502 U.S. 944 (1991). Where the jury has seen and heard the witnesses and assessed their credibility and the weight of their testimony, its determination of the facts will not be overturned on appeal unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Code \u00a7 8.01-680. Where the testimony of an accomplice comports with and is corroborated by the forensic evidence, that testimony is not inherently incredible. <em>Cardwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 501, 512, 450 S.E.2d 146, 153 (1994), <em>cert, denied, </em>514 U.S. 1097 (1995). In such a case, the determination of whether the accomplice\u2019s version of events is to be believed rests soundly within the discretion of the jury. <em>See, e.g., Joseph v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 78, 86-87, 452 S.E.2d 862, 868, <em>cert, denied, </em>516 U.S. 876 (1995). Accordingly, we hold that Rainey\u2019s testimony, which was corroborated by the forensic evidence, was not inherently incredible and, thus, that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find that Yarbrough killed Hamby.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Similarly, the question whether Hamby was conscious during the murder is resolved by Rainey\u2019s testimony that Hamby pleaded with Yarbrough as Yarbrough cut Hamby\u2019s neck. Because this testimony was not inherently incredible particularly in light of the state medical examiner\u2019s testimony that it would have taken several minutes for Hamby to have bled to death, the jury reasonably could have found that Hamby was conscious throughout the entire ordeal. Moreover, the fact that the forensic evidence failed to establish that the 77-year-old victim struggled does not necessarily support the conclusion that he was unconscious. Indeed, it is just as reasonable for the jury to have concluded that Hamby did not struggle in order to show his submission to the threats being made by Yarbrough. While Yarbrough may selectively craft an interpretation of the evidence to suit his theory that Hamby was not conscious during the murder, \u201cthe trial court, and this Court on appeal, may not substitute its own judgment for that of the jury where a reasonable interpretation of the evidence supports the verdict.\u201d <em>Atkins v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 160, 176, 510 S.E.2d 445, 455-56 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In support of his contention that the murder did not involve an aggravated battery, Yarbrough asserts on brief that although the method by which the killing was accomplished was \u201cinept and inefficient ... the evidence never established that one or even several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>cuts would have resulted in Hamby\u2019s death.\u201d Thus, he argues that the jury could not find that the killing was the result of an aggravated battery beyond the minimum necessary to accomplish an act of murder. In essence, Yarbrough contends that because the forensic evidence showed that none of the individual cuts in Hamby\u2019s neck would have been fatal, Hamby\u2019s death from loss of blood was necessarily the result of all the multiple wounds and, thus, these wounds constituted the minimum force necessary to accomplish the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">In defining an \u201caggravated battery\u201d as \u201ca battery which, qualitatively and quantitatively, is more culpable than the minimum necessary to accomplish an act of murder,\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 478, 248 S.E.2d 135, 149 (1978), <em>cert, denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979), we have never expressly confined our consideration of the acts taken to accomplish the murder to those wounds which actually caused the victim\u2019s death. To the contrary, we have held that acts that facilitate the murder, such as restraining the victim by force or assaulting the victim in the commission of a predicate felony are additional factors to be considered. <em>See, e.g., Hedrick v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 328, 338-39, 513 S.E.2d 634, 640 (1999). Here, the evidence fairly establishes that Yarbrough both restrained and assaulted Hamby in order to facilitate the murder, acts which constituted an aggravated battery beyond that necessary to accomplish the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Moreover, in proving the aggravating factor of vileness under Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2, we have consistently held that it is necessary for the Commonwealth to prove only that the murder \u201cinvolves torture, depravity of mind, <em>or </em>aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d <em>Bunch </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 423, 442, 304 S.E.2d 271, 282, <em>cert, denied, </em>464 U.S. 977 (1983) (emphasis added); <em>see also Hedrick, </em>257 Va. at 339-40, 513 S.E.2d at 640. In other words, the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d indicates that only one criterion must be established, though the Commonwealth may attempt to prove more than one. Here, as we have demonstrated, the evidence established at least two of those criteria. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient for the jury reasonably to find that Yarbrough was Hamby\u2019s killer and that the manner in which the killing occurred was sufficiently vile to warrant imposition of the death penalty and, thus, that the trial court did not err in refusing to strike the capital aspect of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\n<em>D. \u201cLife Means Life\u201d Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In assignments of error 2 and 3, Yarbrough contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that he would be ineligible for parole if given a sentence of life imprisonment and that the trial court further erred in failing to respond to the jury\u2019s question on this issue with an instruction that life imprisonment means life without possibility of parole. In making his argument, both in the trial court and on appeal, Yarbrough asserts that the holding of <em>Simmons </em>should be extended to all capital cases, and not limited to those in which the prosecution relies on the aggravating factor of the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness to society. <em>See Simmons, </em>512 U.S. at 178 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). The Commonwealth contends that we have already limited the application of the <em>Simmons </em>holding to those instances where the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness is at issue and the defendant is, in fact, parole-ineligible, citing, <em>e.g., Roach v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 324, 346, 468 S.E.2d 98, 105, <em>cert, denied, </em>519 U.S. 951 (1996). Thus, the Commonwealth asserts that we have declined to extend the application of <em>Simmons </em>to a case where the defendant is parole-ineligible, but where the Commonwealth relies solely on the aggravating factor of the vileness of the crime. The trial court accepted the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that this was \u201cthe present state of the law in Virginia\u201d and refused to grant the proposed instruction both prior to charging the jury and in responding to the jury\u2019s inquiry on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The trial court correctly noted that this Court has not heretofore applied the holding in <em>Simmons </em>beyond the specific factual situation of that case. Indeed, following the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Simmons </em>and the subsequent abolition of parole in Virginia, we have not been presented with a capital murder conviction in which a defendant sentenced to death by a jury was parole-ineligible and the Commonwealth relied <em>solely </em>on the vileness aggravating factor, rather than relying on that factor and future dangerousness or future dangerousness alone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For example, <em>Roach, </em>cited by the Commonwealth, was submitted to the jury solely on the future dangerousness aggravating factor. Thus, we are presented with an issue of first impression. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>trial court erred in failing to grant the instruction requested by Yarbrough.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">As we have noted, both parties rely on <em>Simmons </em>as the principal basis for their respective positions on this issue. Yarbrough contends that <em>Simmons </em>created a broad due process right \u201cthat a jury be fully informed as to what the realities of a sentence are.\u201d The Commonwealth contends that <em>Simmons </em>is properly limited to those cases where future dangerousness is at issue because the possibility that a mistaken belief by the jury that the defendant is eligible for early release from a life sentence would necessarily prejudice the jury in favor of imposing the death penalty if the jury believed the defendant posed a continuing threat to society. The Commonwealth asserts that this prejudice is not invoked in the jury\u2019s determination of the vile nature of a crime already committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">We find neither of these views to be persuasive on the issue we are called upon to address in this appeal. The <em>Simmons </em>decision has no application to the present case because the defendant in that case did not challenge a conviction premised solely on the aggravating factor of vileness and, thus, the reliance of both parties on the analysis in that case is misplaced. <em>Simmons </em>was decided under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and in that decision the United States Supreme Court established a minimum level of protection applicable based upon a specific factual scenario.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While Virginia courts are required to adhere to that minimum standard, this Court must make its own determination about what additional information a jury will be told about sentencing to ensure a fair trial to both the defendant and the Commonwealth. In this context, we agree that \u201cthe wisdom of the decision to permit juror consideration of [post-sentencing events] is best left to the States.\u201d <em>California v. Ramos, </em>463 U.S. 992, 1014 (1983); <em>see also Simmons, </em>512 U.S. at 183 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Initially, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that we have declined, even by implication, to extend the rule in <em>Simmons </em>to a capital murder case where the defendant was parole-ineligible and the Commonwealth relied solely on the aggravating factor of vileness of the crime. Since the abolition of parole in Virginia through the enactment of Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1, a jury has imposed the death sentence only where the Commonwealth asserted the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>dant\u2019s future dangerousness to society.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, in every capital murder trial where future dangerousness was an issue and the crime occurred on or after January 1, 1995, the defendant has been parole-ineligible if convicted, and the trial courts of this Commonwealth have been required by <em>Simmons </em>to instruct the jury on the defendant\u2019s ineligibility for parole where such an instruction was requested by the defendant prior to the jury being instructed or following a jury\u2019s question to the trial court on that issue during deliberations. Accordingly, in reviewing such decisions, we have applied <em>Simmons </em>only under a factual scenario consonant with that considered by the United States Supreme Court in that case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Compare Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 485, 487, 450 S.E.2d 361, 363 (1994), <em>cert, denied, </em>514 U.S. 1085 (1995) (finding that defendant was not parole-ineligible) <em>with Mickens </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 423, 425, 457 S.E.2d 9, 10 (1995) (finding that defendant was parole-ineligible and remanding for resentencing). Thus, since the abolition of parole in Virginia, this appeal presents our first opportunity to consider whether the granting of an instruction on parole ineligibility is required in a capital case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>which the Commonwealth relied on the vileness aggravating factor alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">There is no constitutional right, under either the Constitution of Virginia or the United States Constitution, for a defendant to have a jury determine his sentence. <em>Fogg v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 164, 165, 207 S.E.2d 847, 849 (1974). Nonetheless, where the jury is delegated the responsibility of recommending a sentence, the defendant\u2019s right to a trial by an informed jury requires that the jury be adequately apprised of the nature of the range of sentences it may impose so that it may assess an appropriate punishment. <em>Cf. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>257 Va. 34, 43, 510 S.E.2d 232, 236 (1999). The underlying concern is whether issues are presented in a manner that could influence the jury to assess a penalty based upon \u2018\u201cfear rather than reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farris v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 305, 307, 163 S.E.2d 575, 576 (1968) (quoting <em>State v. Nickens, </em>403 S.W.2d 582, 585 (Mo. 1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Where information about potential post-sentencing procedures could lead a jury to impose a harsher sentence than it otherwise might, such matters may not be presented to the jury. Thus, it has long been held in this Commonwealth that it is error for the trial court to instruct the jury that the defendant would be <em>eligible </em>for parole or could <em>benefit </em>from an executive act of pardon or clemency.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Hinton v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 492, 496, 247 S.E.2d 704, 706 (1978); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 273, 279, 72 S.E.2d 693, 696-97 (1952); <em>Coward </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 639, 646, 178 S.E. 797, 799 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Unquestionably, it was this long-standing rule which prompted the trial court\u2019s refusal of Yarbrough\u2019s proffered \u201clife means life\u201d instruction and its response to the jury\u2019s question concerning the meaning of a life sentence. However, the present case presents the diametrically opposite situation: a case where information about post-sentencing procedures is needed to prevent a jury from imposing a harsher sentence than it otherwise might render out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>of speculative fears about events that cannot transpire. Accordingly, an examination in some detail of the cases which established this rule is warranted and guides our further analysis as to their continued application to capital murder prosecutions in light of the abolition of parole under Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In <em>Coward, </em>the jury in a drunk driving case made a specific inquiry as to \u201cwhat time the defendant would get off while he was confined in jail.\u201d 164 Va. at 643, 178 S.E. at 798. The trial court responded to this query by detailing for the jury the then applicable rules for \u201cgood behavior\u201d reduction of a sentence. <em>Id. </em>We held that this was error and that \u201c[t]hese jurors should have been told that it was their duty, if they found the accused guilty, to impose such sentence as seemed to them to be just. What might afterwards happen was no concern of theirs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 646, 178 S.E. at 800. This language from <em>Coward </em>has become the standard charge to a jury whenever an inquiry is made regarding the possibility of a defendant being paroled, pardoned, or benefited by an act of executive clemency.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In <em>Jones, </em>after determining that the defendant was guilty of first-degree murder, the jury inquired whether \u201cif they gave him life imprisonment. . . they would have any assurance that the defendant would not \u2018get out.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones, </em>194 Va. at 275, 72 S.E.2d at 694. The trial court responded that \u201cit could not give that assurance; that would be in the hands of the executive branch of the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The jury imposed a sentence of death on Jones. We reversed that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Noting that under the law then applicable, a defendant sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder was not eligible for parole, this Court asked rhetorically \u201cwho can say that the verdict here would have been rendered had the jury been told that the defendant could not be paroled after a sentence of life imprisonment and would not \u2018get out\u2019 unless pardoned by the governor?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278-79, 72 S.E.2d at 696. Accordingly, we held that the trial court\u2019s instruction was erroneous because \u201cit did not fully inform the jury upon the point to which their inquiry was directed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 72 S.E.2d at 696. Nonetheless, because the defendant would have been subject to parole if sentenced to a lesser term of years, or to pardon in any case, in giving instructions to the trial court for the remanded trial the majority adhered to the rule announced in <em>Coward </em>in order to avoid having the jury base its sentence \u201con speculative elements, rather than on the relevant facts of the case, [since this] would lead inevitably to unjust verdicts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 72 S.E.2d at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Concurring, Justice Spratley, joined by Justice Smith, opined that the defendant was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to inform the jury, as the defendant had requested, that if given a sentence of life imprisonment he would not be eligible for parole. <em>Id. </em>at 282, 72 S.E.2d at 698 (Spratley, J., concurring). Moreover, Justice Spratley opined that the failure to properly instruct the jury would inevitably result in juror confusion and \u201ca reaction, just as likely against the accused as in his favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 72 S.E.2d at 698. Asserting that the view expressed by the majority of other states at that time was that the jury could best perform its duty when given full knowledge of the possible consequences of the law, Justice Spratley concluded that \u201chad such information been given [to the jury] in simple and direct language\u201d no prejudice would have resulted. <em>Id. </em>at 283, 72 S.E.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The most succinct statement of the policy behind the rule announced in <em>Coward </em>is to be found in our subsequent decision in <em>Hinton. </em>In that case, the trial court responded to a jury\u2019s question concerning parole by instructing the jurors that \u201cearly release [of prisoners] is not for the Court or jury to be concerned about.\u201d <em>Hinton, </em>219 Va. at 494, 247 S.E.2d at 705. However, the trial court then described the manner under which early release might occur and told the jury that \u201c[s]ometimes people never serve their entire sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court concluded by stating that it \u201cwould like to advise [the jury] about the probability of early release, but I\u2019m not allowed to tell you what it is in order that you may take it into consideration when you fix punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494-95, 247 S.E.2d at 705. Following this instruction, the jury returned in only five minutes with a verdict imposing the maximum sentence possible for the defendant\u2019s offense. <em>Id. </em>at 495, 247 S.E.2d at 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Rejecting the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s statement comported with the holdings in <em>Coward </em>and <em>Jones, </em>we reversed Hinton\u2019s conviction. Noting that the issue was still a matter of serious contention among the states, we stated that \u201cVirginia is committed to the proposition that the trial court should not inform the jury that its sentence, once imposed and confirmed, <em>may be set aside or reduced by some other arm of the State.\u201d Hinton, </em>219 Va. at 495, 247 S.E.2d at 706 (citing <em>Coward, </em>164 Va. at 646, 178 S.E. at 799-800) (emphasis added). Rejecting the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s error was not sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversing the conviction, we stated the policy underlying our continued adherence to the rule from <em>Coward </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"?\">*?</page-number>[T]he jury\u2019s question would have been necessary only if one or more of the jurors contemplated voting for a sentence less than the maximum; the inquiry would have been superfluous if the jury had already decided to assess [the maximum penalty]. Thus, as a result of the improper emphasis on post-verdict procedures ... it [is] likely that some member of the jury, influenced by the improper remarks, agreed to fix the maximum penalty, when he or she otherwise would have voted for a lesser sentence. Consequently, prejudice to the defendant is manifest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">219 Va. at 496-97, 247 S.E.2d at 706-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In sum, the policy underlying the rule first announced in <em>Coward, </em>and subsequently affirmed in <em>Hinton, </em>is that the jury should not be permitted to speculate on the potential effect of parole, pardon, or an act of clemency on its sentence because doing so would inevitably prejudice the jury in favor of a harsher sentence than the facts of the case might otherwise warrant. This prejudice to the defendant was manifest in <em>Hinton, </em>where the jury was required to fix punishment at a specific term of years, and in <em>Jones, </em>where the jury could elect between a sentence of death, of life imprisonment without possibility of parole, or a term of years from which the defendant might be paroled after a time. We have upheld the rule from <em>Coward </em>and its progeny in capital murder cases where the defendant would have been eligible for parole if given a life sentence. <em>See, e.g., Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 278, 257 S.E.2d 808, 821 (1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">As we have noted above, the present case presents the converse situation. It is manifest that the concern for avoiding situations where juries speculate to the <em>detriment </em>of a defendant on post-sentencing procedures and policies of the executive branch of government requires that the <em>absence </em>of such procedures or policies <em>favoring </em>the defendant be disclosed to the jury. Where a defendant is convicted of capital murder in a bifurcated jury trial, in the penalty-determination phase of the trial the jury must select solely between a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole or one of death. The <em>Coward </em>rule simply does not address that unique situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">This unique situation arises from the fact that a defendant sentenced to life imprisonment for capital murder, a class one felony, is not subject to \u201cgeriatric parole.\u201d <em>See </em>note 7, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>while we recognize that the limitations placed upon the availability of parole by Code \u00a7\u00a7 53.1-40.01 and 53.1-165.1 may call into question the continued viability of the <em>Coward </em>rule in a non-capital felony case, as where, for example, a defendant subject to a maximum term of years for a specific crime would serve that entire sentence before being eligible for geriatric parole, we emphasize that our decision today is limited to the effect of Code \u00a753.1-165.1 on capital murder prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Undeniably, in the specific circumstance where the jury must select between only two sentences: death and life imprisonment without possibility of parole, the jury\u2019s knowledge that a life sentence is <em>not </em>subject to being reduced by parole will cause no prejudice to the defendant, and may work to his advantage. It is equally clear that <em>without </em>this knowledge the jury may erroneously speculate on the possibility of parole and impose the death sentence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the jury is instructed that the defendant\u2019s parole ineligibility is a matter of law and not one of executive discretion, there is no possibility that the jury would speculate as to whether \u201cits sentence . . . imposed and confirmed may be set aside or reduced by some other arm of the State.\u201d On the other hand, without this knowledge, there is a very real possibility that the jury may erroneously speculate on the continuing availability of parole. The real danger of this possibility is amply demonstrated by the jury\u2019s question in this case in which the jurors posited the hypothetical situation that Yarbrough might serve as few as twelve years of a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In short, whereas in the circumstances presented in some prior cases the availability of parole was not a proper matter for jury speculation because it might lead to the unwarranted imposition of harsher sentences, in the context of a capital murder trial a jury\u2019s knowledge of the lack of availability of parole is necessary to achieve the same policy goals articulated in <em>Coward </em>and <em>Hinton. </em>Moreover, a jury fully informed on this issue in this context is consistent with a fair trial both for the defendant and the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>wealth. Accordingly, we hold that in the penalty-determination phase of a trial where the defendant has been convicted of capital murder, in response to a proffer of a proper instruction from the defendant prior to submitting the issue of penalty-determination to the jury or where the defendant asks for such an instruction following an inquiry from the jury during deliberations, the trial court shall instruct the jury that the words \u201cimprisonment for life\u201d mean \u201cimprisonment for life without possibility of parole.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the trial court refused such an instruction, Yarbrough was denied his right of having a fully informed jury determine his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Finally, we must consider whether the comments concerning the effect of a life sentence made by Yarbrough\u2019s counsel during closing argument render harmless the prejudice resulting from the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the issue of Yarbrough\u2019s parole-ineligible status.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Commonwealth contends that Yarbrough adequately addressed this issue to the jury in his closing argument and, therefore, Yarbrough was not prejudiced.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Yarbrough\u2019s counsel argued that \u201c[l]ife is life . . . [h]e will spend a long time in prison\u201d and made other similar comments during the closing argument which implied that Yarbrough would be ineligible for parole. Clearly, as indicated by its subsequent inquiry to the trial court, the jury did not accept counsel\u2019s assertions as to the law. Accordingly, we cannot say that Yarbrough was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to respond to the jury\u2019s question with the appropriate instruction as Yarbrough had requested.

Indeed, that research was cited in <em>Simmons, </em>512 U.S. at 172-74 (Souter, J. concurring), and serves as the basis for a plurality of the United States Supreme Court continuing to urge expansion of the <em>Simmons </em>rule. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Texas, </em>522 U.S. 940, 940-41 and n.2 (1997) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (four justices dissenting from denial of certiorari). We note that in <em>Brown, </em>Justice Stevens observed that \u201cthe likelihood that the issue [of expanding the application of Simmons] will be resolved correctly may increase if this Court allows other tribunals \u2018to serve as laboratories in which the issue receives further study before it is addressed by this Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943 (citation from footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\"> We emphasize that the defendant must request the instruction.

In light of the view expressed by a plurality of justices in <em>Simmons, </em>512 U.S. at 178 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring), that the issue of parole ineligibility may be addressed in argument, our holding in <em>Williams </em>has clearly been called into question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"Amq\">joins, dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">I agree that Yarbrough\u2019s conviction of capital murder should be affirmed. I disagree, however, that his death sentence should be vacated and the case remanded for redetermination of the capital murder penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">The majority holds that in the penalty phase of a trial when the defendant has been convicted of capital murder, either upon the defendant\u2019s tender of a proper instruction prior to submitting the issue of penalty to the jury or upon the defendant\u2019s request for such an instruction following an inquiry from the jury during deliberations, the trial court shall instruct the jury that the words \u201cimprisonment for life\u201d mean \u201cimprisonment for life without possibility of parole.\u201d This viewpoint, based upon the idea of having a \u201cjury fully informed,\u201d even on matters not relevant for jury consideration, amounts to an unwise change in the landscape for trial of capital murder cases in Virginia when the crime meets the vileness aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">In Virginia, a jury\u2019s duty and responsibility, upon a finding of guilt, is to impose such punishment as is authorized by law and is just and proper under the evidence, considering the crime and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>defendant. All other matters, such as probation and parole, are not relevant for jury consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The majority seeks to justify its viewpoint by relying upon a purported distinction in the context of jury sentencing between parole ineligibility and parole eligibility. The majority discusses <em>Hinton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 492, 496, 247 S.E.2d 704, 706 (1978); <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 273, 279, 72 S.E.2d 693, 696-97 (1952); and <em>Coward v. Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 639, 646, 178 S.E. 797, 799 (1935), admitting those cases stand for the proposition that a jury should not be permitted to speculate on the potential effect of parole, pardon, and executive clemency. Yet, according to the majority, \u201cthe present case presents the converse situation,\u201d to those cases. Not so. When the real basis underlying the settled rule (until today) preventing a jury from speculating is understood, the present case does not involve a \u201cconverse situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u201cUnder our system, the assessment of punishment is a function of the judicial branch of government, while the administration of such punishment is a responsibility of the executive department. The aim of the rule followed in Virginia is to preserve, as effectively as possible, the separation of those functions during the process when the jury is fixing the penalty, in full recognition of the fact that the average juror is aware that some type of further consideration will usually be given to the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Hinton, </em>219 Va. at 496, 247 S.E.2d at 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">That statement is as applicable in 1999 as it was when written in 1978 because, even with the abolition of parole effective in 1995, \u201cfurther consideration\u201d by way of the Governor\u2019s constitutional power of executive clemency remains an avenue for relief from a mandatory life sentence for a capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Parenthetically, the majority\u2019s \u201cfairness\u201d concerns focus only upon the defendant, not the Commonwealth and her citizens. If the majority is truly concerned about \u201cfairness\u201d in directing that the jury be informed about the irrelevant matter of parole ineligibility, then the prosecution should be entitled to have the jury informed about the matter of executive clemency, in a spirit of \u201cfairness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Simply put, this Court, as a matter of state law, has held \u201c[i]n an unbroken line of capital cases . . . that parole is not a proper matter for consideration by a jury.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 353, 368, 416 S.E.2d 669, 677, <em>cert, denied, </em>506 U.S. 957 (1992). I would adhere to that principle in this case, and would affirm Yarbrough\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
