Those convictions are: (1) capital murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-31(4); (2) use or display of a firearm while committing murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1; (3) robbery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58; and (4) use or display of a firearm while committing robbery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">At the conclusion of the sentencing phase of a bifurcated trial, the jury fixed the defendant\u2019s punishment at death for the capital murder, 50 years for the robbery, and 5 years for each of the firearms offenses. The jury imposed the sentence of death based on its finding of future dangerousness under Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.2 and -264.4. After reviewing the post-sentence report required by Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5, the trial court sentenced the defendant in accordance with the jury verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">The defendant appealed his non-capital convictions to the Court of Appeals pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-406.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We certified that appeal (Record No. 990364) to this Court under the provisions of Code \u00a7 17.1-409 for consolidation with the defendant\u2019s appeal of his capital murder conviction (Record No. 990363) and the sentence review mandated by Code \u00a7 17.1-313.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">On appeal, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses, the finding of future dangerousness based on consideration of unadjudicated criminal acts, the admission of photographic evidence, and the court\u2019s refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>allow the defendant to mail a questionnaire to prospective jurors. After considering each of these arguments and conducting our statutory review pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313, we find no error in the defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence of death. Thus, we will affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AVU\">A. GUILT PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The criminal offenses for which the defendant was convicted occurred at a gas station and convenience store located in York County. The convenience store was equipped with a video camera recording system that monitored three areas of the premises, including the check-out counter and cash register. The camera focused on the cash register captured the incident that is pertinent to this appeal and recorded it on a video tape. That tape reveals the following sequence of events.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Near 3:38 a.m. on January 24, 1998, the defendant entered the convenience store, walked up to the check-out counter where Richard Sterling Burnett was working as a clerk, and pointed a revolver at Burnett\u2019s chest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After Burnett opened the cash register drawer, the defendant shot him in the chest. As Burnett was clutching his chest and struggling to remain in a standing position, the defendant walked around the counter, reached into the cash register drawer, and removed some money from it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He then fled from the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">A short while later, a customer at the convenience store discovered Burnett\u2019s body and called for emergency assistance. F.T. Lyons, an investigator with the York County Sheriff\u2019s Office, arrived on the scene about 4:25 a.m. Investigator Lyons found Burnett\u2019s body \u201con the floor . . . behind the register.\u201d He collected several items from the store for evidentiary purposes, including the video tape recording. He took the video tape to the sheriff\u2019s office where he used computer equipment to view it \u201cframe by frame.\u201d Lyons captured images from the video tape, digitized and saved them, and then printed several of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the images. He distributed those printed images to area law enforcement agencies and the media.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The sheriff\u2019s office subsequently received several telephone calls from persons who identified the defendant as the individual in the pictures that Lyons had distributed. Investigator Lyons then obtained warrants charging the defendant with capital murder, robbery, and use of a firearm in the commission of murder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The defendant was not apprehended, however, until January 31, 1998, after a high-speed chase through the streets of Richmond. During the police officers\u2019 pursuit, the defendant drove his car across a concrete median strip and struck a telephone pole, then proceeded to drive on the wrong side of the road, and accelerated through a roadblock. Eventually, the defendant jumped out of his vehicle and ran on foot until police officers captured him at the end of an alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">After placing the defendant under arrest, a police officer searched the defendant\u2019s person. During the search, the officer found a partially loaded .357 magnum revolver in the waistband of the defendant\u2019s pants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Investigator Lyons eventually took possession of the weapon recovered from the defendant and submitted it to the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services, Division of Forensic Science, for testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Scott A. Glass, a forensic scientist who works in the field of firearm and tool mark identification at the Division of Forensic Science, tested the revolver along with a \u201clead semi-wadcutter\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> bullet that had been removed from Burnett\u2019s chest during an autopsy. Based on the results of his analysis, Glass concluded that the bullet had been fired from the .357 magnum revolver.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Dr. Elizabeth Kinnison, a pathologist and an Assistant Chief Medical Examiner for the Commonwealth of Virginia, performed the autopsy on Burnett\u2019s body. During the autopsy, Dr. Kinnison recovered the bullet from the right side of Burnett\u2019s back where it was lodged. According to Dr. Kinnison, Burnett had \u201csustained one gunshot wound to the front of the left chest[,]\u201d which was the cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>death. Dr. Kinnison stated that Burnett died \u201c[p]rimarily from hemorrhage or bleeding from these wounds\u201d and that \u00a3\u00a3[t]he structures that were injured that were vital were the heart and the liver and the lung, which all would have caused internal bleeding.\u201d She further testified that a person sustaining this type of injury \u201c[mjight have been in some pain associated with the skin[,]\u201d would have suffered increasing problems with breathing as blood was lost, and would have become dizzy and eventually unconscious before dying.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">B. SENTENCING PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">During the sentencing phase of the trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence to prove the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness. The evidence concerned other criminal acts that the defendant had committed in three separate incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The first incident occurred on January 21, 1998. Lois Jones testified that when she and her boyfriend, Mark Scougal, returned home, Scougal discovered the defendant in a bedroom. The defendant pointed a gun at Scougal and ordered Scougal to drive him \u201csomewhere else\u201d because he was hiding from the police. As the defendant was forcing Scougal to a car, Jones retrieved a gun from her gun cabinet, loaded it, and went out onto the front porch of her house in order to stop the defendant. Although there was conflicting testimony about whether Jones then fired her gun up into the air, the defendant shot at Jones twice. His second shot hit Jones in the calf of her leg and shattered the bone. The defendant then demanded that Scougal give him the car keys, but when Scougal refused to comply, the defendant fled from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The second episode, also on January 21, 1998, involved Charles Powell and William Bottoms, two elderly gentlemen. While Powell and Bottoms were sitting in the front yard of Bottoms\u2019 Richmond home, the defendant approached the two men and ordered them to walk to the rear of the house. The defendant displayed a weapon to the men and stated that he \u201c[had] nothing to lose.\u201d After questioning both men about the location of their cars, keys, and wallets, the defendant took Powell\u2019s car and left in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Karen Glenn and Patricia Tuck testified about the third incident, which occurred on January 30, 1998. After Glenn, Tuck, and another woman arrived at a private residence in New Kent County to perform cleaning services, the defendant, who was already inside the house, approached the women, brandished a handgun, and yelled, \u201cBitches, get down.\u201d As they were starting to \u201cget down,\u201d die defendant hit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Tuck between her shoulder blades with the gun. He then ordered the three women to crawl on their stomachs to a bedroom. Once the women were in the bedroom, the defendant made them go into a closet. He then nailed a piece of plywood across the closet door. The women were trapped inside the closet for approximately four and one-half hours, until the homeowner returned and found them. During this ordeal, the defendant proclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m Dennis Orbe, I\u2019m wanted for murder, and it doesn\u2019t matter what I do.\u201d He also directed the women to empty their pockets and took money, checks, and other valuables, including the keys to Glenn\u2019s car, from them. He stole the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In accordance with Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B), the jury also heard evidence \u201cin mitigation of the offense.\u201d The defendant\u2019s mother and step-father testified about the defendant\u2019s troubled childhood and his problems with alcohol abuse. One of his friends described a change in the defendant\u2019s behavior shortly before the incidents in January 1998, and the administrator of a regional jail, where the defendant had been incarcerated, testified that he had received only one minor complaint with regard to the defendant\u2019s behavior during his confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The defendant also presented testimony from Dr. Thomas A. Pasquale, a clinical psychologist who had evaluated the defendant for purposes of mitigation and risk assessment regarding the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness. Dr. Pasquale testified that the defendant had exhibited suicidal intentions at least a year prior to the events that transpired in January 1998 and that the defendant was depressed, in part, over his perceived failure as a father and husband. Dr. Pasquale further reported that the defendant drank heavily and had an impulse control dysfunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">During his evaluation, Dr. Pasquale learned that the defendant\u2019s father had abandoned the defendant at an early age. Consequently, Dr. Pasquale opined that the defendant, who had recently located his father, might have wished to visit his father again and that he had decided to obtain money illegally to accomplish that purpose. According to Dr. Pasquale, the defendant thus \u201creasoned his way to intrude into a number of individuals\u2019 lives by way of robbery, home invasion, weapons discharge!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 brandishing and general intimidation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">In conclusion, Dr. Pasquale testified that he did not perceive the defendant as being a future danger in a prison setting unless he was able to access alcohol inside the prison, was abused by those within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the prison system, or was placed under conditions of duress while incarcerated. However, Dr. Pasquale stated that, if the defendant escaped from a penitentiary, it would be a \u201cvery dangerous, very risky\u201d situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">H. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">A. INSTRUCTIONS ON LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In his first argument,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the defendant asserts that his death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors. Specifically, he contends that the circuit court erred in refusing to grant an instruction on first degree murder and an instruction on determining the grade of the offense of homicide.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant makes the same argument on appeal but also asserts that the instructions should have been given to the jury because the question whether the defendant acted maliciously was disputed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">It is well-established in Virginia that jury instructions \u201care proper only if supported by the evidence, and that more than a scintilla of evidence is necessary to support a lesser-included offense instruction requested by the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donkor, 256 </em>Va. 443, 445, 507 S.E.2d 75, 76 (1998). We have also recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>nized that \u201cevidence showing a murder \u2018to have been deliberate, premeditated and wilful could be so clear and uncontroverted that a trial court could properly refuse to instruct on the lesser included offenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buchanan v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 389, 409, 384 S.E.2d 757, 769 (1989), <em>cert, denied, </em>493 U.S. 1063 (1990) (quoting <em>Painter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 360, 366, 171 S.E.2d 166, 171 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The evidence in the present case does not support the defendant\u2019s proffered instructions. An instruction on first degree murder was not warranted because the video tape clearly established that Burnett was shot in the chest during the commission of armed robbery at the convenience store. <em>See Bennett v. Commonwealth, 236 </em>Va. 448, 470, 374 S.E.2d 303, 317 (1988), <em>cert, denied, </em>490 U.S. 1028 (1989) (holding first degree murder instruction not warranted because defendant adduced no evidence that victim was not murdered during commission of robbery). Thus, the sole issue was whether the defendant was the person who killed Burnett, i.e., was he \u201cguilty or innocent of the capital offense.\u201d <em>Frye v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 389, 345 S.E.2d 267, 281 (1986). Also, the record does not contain a scintilla of evidence that the defendant acted without premeditation or malice so as to justify an instruction on second degree murder or voluntary manslaughter, respectively. <em>See Donkor, 256 </em>Va. at 445, 507 S.E.2d at 76. Accordingly, we find no error in the circuit court\u2019s judgment refusing to grant these two instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">B. FUTURE DANGEROUSNESS BASED ON UNADJUDICATED CRIMINAL ACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Next, the defendant challenges the imposition of the death penalty based on the finding that \u201che would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C). The defendant\u2019s attack with regard to this issue is threefold. He first asserts that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish future dangerousness because he \u201chad no prior history of significant violent offenses.\u201d He next contends that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard in determining future dangerousness. Finally, he argues that the introduction into evidence of unadjudicated criminal acts violates the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of Virginia because there is no requirement that such acts be proven beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not agree with any of the defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">As to the first prong of the defendant\u2019s attack, we find sufficient evidence of future dangerousness to support the imposition of the death penalty. During the month of January 1998, the defendant committed numerous criminal acts in three separate episodes, in addition to the robbery and murder of Burnett. On January 21, he entered Jones\u2019 home while no one was present and then shot Jones in the leg when she attempted to stop the defendant\u2019s abduction of Scougal. That same day, the defendant used a firearm to rob Powell. Then on January 30, the day before the defendant was apprehended, he abducted and robbed three women, again using a firearm, and left them in a small closet after nailing the door shut. This evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt \u201ca probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 19.2-264.4(C). Thus, the trial court did not err in refusing to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence with regard to the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The defendant\u2019s next argument is that the trial court adopted the wrong legal standard when it used the phrase \u201csufficient probable cause\u201d in the following statement, which the court made while overruling the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at sentencing: \u201cThe matter of future dangerousness, again, the evidence \u2014 there is evidence before the Court and before this jury and the jury will make the determination as to whether there is sufficient probable cause \u2014 probability that the Defendant is guilty of any future dangerousness.\u201d We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s contention for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">First, we believe that the court\u2019s use of that phrase was a misstatement because the court immediately corrected itself by using the term \u201cprobability.\u201d The term \u201cprobability\u201d is part of the criteria set forth in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C) for determining future dangerousness: \u201cThe penalty of death shall not be imposed unless the Commonwealth shall prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a <em>probability </em>based upon evidence of the prior history of the defendant . . . that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>also </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. Furthermore, the court properly instructed the jury in accordance with this statutory provision. Thus, we conclude that the trial court decided the motion to strike on the issue of future dangerousness under the appropriate standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">We also- find no merit in the third aspect of the defendant\u2019s argument regarding future dangerousness. The defendant asserts that the Commonwealth used unadjudicated criminal acts that had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish future dangerousness. However, most of the criminal acts about which the jury heard evidence had been adjudicated. The record shows that, before the sentencing hearing in this case, the defendant had been found guilty, based on his guilty pleas, of the offenses that he committed on January 21 in the City of Richmond and those that he committed on January 30 in New Kent County.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">As to those criminal acts that were unadjudicated on the date of the sentencing hearing in the present case, we have previously construed Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C) \u201cto permit the admission into evidence of unadjudicated misconduct.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 295, 317, 384 S.E.2d 785, 799 (1989), <em>cert, denied, </em>493 U.S. 1093 (1990). Moreover, we specifically held in <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 54, 66, 515 S.E.2d 565, 572 (1999), that evidence of each unadjudicated criminal act admitted to show a defendant\u2019s future dangerousness is not subject to the reasonable doubt standard. Rather, the finding of future dangerousness must be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>The defendant has offered no reason why we should depart from these precedents. Accordingly, we will not disturb the circuit court\u2019s judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">C. ADMISSION INTO EVIDENCE OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF VICTIM</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The defendant contends that the circuit court erred in overruling a pretrial motion in limine to exclude photographs of the victim, including autopsy photographs, from being introduced into evidence at trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant argues that, since he had stipulated that Burnett was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest, the Commonwealth offered the photographs solely to arouse the sympathy of the jury for the victim and to prejudice it against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Over the defendant\u2019s objections, the trial court admitted into evidence photographs exhibiting the following images: (1) the open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>cash register drawer and the victim slumped on the floor behind the check-out counter; (2) a closer view of Burnett\u2019s body sitting on the floor; (3) a small bruise on Burnett\u2019s back where Dr. Kinnison found the bullet; (4) the entry wound in Burnett\u2019s chest; (5) the victim\u2019s condition upon arrival for the autopsy and his blood-stained shirt; (6) Burnett with some of his friends; and (7) Burnett sitting at a sound booth in his church. These photographs accurately depict the crime scene and the victim, and are therefore not rendered inadmissible simply because they may be gruesome or shocking. <em>Walker, </em>258 Va. at 69, 515 S.E.2d at 574 (citing <em>Walton v. Commonwealth, </em>256 Va. 85, 92, 501 S.E.2d 134, 138, <em>cert, denied, </em>525 U.S. 1046 (1998)). The photographs are relevant to show \u201cmotive, intent, method, malice, premeditation and the atrociousness of [the defendant\u2019s] crimes.\u201d <em>Chichester </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 311, 326, 448 S.E.2d 638, 648 (1994), <em>cert, denied, </em>513 U.S. 1166 (1995) (quoting <em>Spencer, </em>238 Va. at 312, 384 S.E.2d at 796). Any prejudice to the defendant resulting from the admission of the photographs is outweighed by the photographs\u2019 probative value. <em>See Coe v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 83, 87, 340 S.E.2d 820, 823 (1986) (holding probative value of evidence must be balanced against any prejudicial effect). On appeal, we will not disturb a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in balancing those competing considerations absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s stipulation with regard to the cause of Burnett\u2019s death does not preempt the introduction of the photographs into evidence. <em>See Mackall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 236 </em>Va. 240, 253, 372 S.E.2d 759, 767-68 (1988), <em>cert, denied, </em>492 U.S. 925 (1989) (holding autopsy photograph of victim was admissible even if defendant stipulated identity of victim). Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs. <em>See Clagett v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 79, 87, 472 S.E.2d 263, 268 (1996), <em>cert, denied, </em>519 U.S. 1122 (1997) (\u201cThe admission into evidence of photographs of the body of a murder victim is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will be disturbed only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">D. INDIVIDUAL VOIR DIRE AND JUROR QUESTIONNAIRES</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Finally, in assignment of error number five, the defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s refusal to permit him to mail a questionnaire to each prospective juror. On brief, the defendant also argues that he was denied a full and fair opportunity to examine the</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>venire because the circuit court did not allow him to conduct individual voir dire. The defendant did not include the issue regarding individual voir dire in an assignment of error. Therefore, we will not consider it. Rule 5:17(c). As to the issue properly preserved, we find no error in the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The manner in which voir dire is conducted lies within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and its decisions concerning voir dire will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 236 </em>Va. 403, 410-11, 374 S.E.2d 46, 50 (1988), <em>cert, denied, </em>490 U.S. 1028 (1989). We have previously decided that a trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow a defendant to send a questionnaire to prospective jurors. <em>Hedrick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 328, 337, 513 S.E.2d 634, 639 (1999); <em>Strickler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 482, 489-90, 404 S.E.2d 227, 232, <em>cert, denied, </em>502 U.S. 944 (1991). Such a practice \u201cwould detract from the trial judge\u2019s \u2018opportunity ... to observe and evaluate . . . prospective jurors first hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 404 S.E.2d at 232 (quoting <em>Pope v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 124, 360 S.E.2d 352, 358 (1987), <em>cert, denied, </em>485 U.S. 1015 (1988)). \u201c[T]he opportunity to see and hear the veniremen, when questioned during voir dire, is crucial to the effective discharge of die trial judge\u2019s responsibility.\u201d <em>Strickler, </em>241 Va. at 490, 404 S.E.2d at 232. Thus, we conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">HI. PASSION, PREJUDICE, AND PROPORTIONALITY REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(1), we must determine whether the death sentence in this case was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors. Upon careful review of the record, we find no evidence that any such factor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>present or influenced either the jury\u2019s or the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision. The defendant\u2019s only contention with regard to this issue is that the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of prejudice because the trial court did not instruct the jury on lesser included offenses. We have already addressed that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(2) requires us to determine whether the sentence of death in this case is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313(E), we have accumulated the records of all capital murder cases reviewed by this Court. The records include not only those capital murder cases in which the death penalty was imposed, but also those cases in which the trial court or jury imposed a life sentence and the defendant petitioned this Court for an appeal. <em>Whitley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 66, 82, 286 S.E.2d 162, 171, <em>cert, denied, </em>459 U.S. 882 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In complying with the statutory directive to compare this case with \u201csimilar cases,\u201d we have specifically focused on cases in which an employee was murdered at a business establishment during the commission of robbery and the death penalty was imposed solely on the future dangerousness predicate.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g. Peterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 302 S.E.2d 520, <em>cert, denied, </em>464 U.S. 865, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>464 U.S. 1004 (1983) (accountant murdered during armed robbery of store; defendant had prior convictions for armed robbery, two of which occurred within three weeks of the capital murder); <em>Townes v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 307, 362 S.E.2d 650 (1987), <em>cert, denied, </em>485 U.S. 971 (1988) (female employee murdered during robbery of store; defendant had 22 prior convictions for forgery and uttering, 4 convictions for robbery, and convictions for maiming, felony escape, and use of a firearm); <em>Mackall, </em>236 Va. 240, 372 S.E.2d 759 (gas station cashier killed during armed robbery; defendant\u2019s criminal history included larcenies, burglaries, threats of violence to correctional officers, and possession of deadly weapon while incarcerated); <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 260, 435 S.E.2d 636 (1993), <em>cert, denied, </em>511 U.S. 1012 (1994) (store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>employee murdered during armed robbery; defendant previously convicted of grand larceny, assault, and possession of firearm as a convicted felon); <em>Chichester, </em>248 Va. 311, 448 S.E.2d 638 (employee killed during armed robbery of restaurant; defendant previously convicted of carrying concealed weapon; and nine days before capital murder offense, defendant robbed another restaurant); <em>Joseph v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 78, 452 S.E.2d 862, <em>cert, denied, </em>516 U.S. 876 (1995) (employee murdered during armed robbery of restaurant; defendant had assaulted police officer, had been in possession of loaded revolver and crack cocaine, and had participated in abduction of two store clerks during armed robbery). We have also reviewed cases in which the defendant received a life sentence, rather than the death penalty, for capital murder during the commission of robbery. <em>See, e.g. Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 736, 273 S.E.2d 784, <em>cert, denied, </em>454 U.S. 920 (1981); <em>Bowling v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 166, 403 S.E.2d 375 (1991); <em>Wilkins v. Commonwealth, </em>appeal denied, No. 840142 (Va. Oct. 10, 1984); <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>appeal denied, No. 830290 (Va. Jan. 25, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The purpose of our comparative review is to reach a reasoned judgment regarding what cases justify the imposition of the death penalty. We cannot insure complete symmetry among all death penalty cases, but our review does enable us to identify and invalidate a death sentence that is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(2); <em>see Tennessee v. Bland, </em>958 S.W.2d 651, 665 (Tenn. 1997), <em>cert, denied, </em>523 U.S. 1083 (1998) (The court\u2019s \u201cfunction in performing comparative review is not to search for proof that a defendant\u2019s death sentence is perfectly symmetrical, but to identify and invalidate the aberrant death sentence.\u201d). The defendant has not argued that the sentence of death in his case is disproportionate, and based on our review of this case and \u201csimilar cases,\u201d we conclude that the defendant\u2019s sentence of death is not excessive or disproportionate to sentences generally imposed in this Commonwealth for capital murders comparable to the defendant\u2019s murder of Burnett.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">For these reasons, we find no error either in the judgments of the circuit court or in the imposition of the death penalty. Therefore, we will affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Record No. 990363 \u2014 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Acz\">Record No. 990364 \u2014 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-13\"> Title 17.1 became effective on October 1, 1998, replacing Title 17. Although the parties briefed and argued this appeal under the provisions of Title 17, we will cite Title 17.1 in this opinion since the relevant provisions remain unchanged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> At trial, the Commonwealth introduced the video tape recording into evidence and played it for the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\"> The defendant had been in the store on two occasions on January 23 but had purchased nothing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b414-11\"> According to a territorial manager for the gas station and convenience store, the sum of $90.65 was missing from the cash register drawer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\"> In addition to these three charges, a grand jury subsequently indicted the defendant for use of a firearm during the commission of robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b415-11\"><em> </em>Willis L. Branch, Jr., the defendant\u2019s stepfather, testified that, sometime during the first or second week of January, he discovered that his .357 magnum revolver was missing from the home that Branch shared with the defendant and his mother. At trial, Branch identified the revolver recovered from the defendant as having the same serial number as the one that was missing from his home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b415-12\"> Branch testified that he kept \u201c.357 magnum, 158 grains semi-wadcutters\u201d as ammunition for his revolver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\"> The defendant\u2019s first argument encompasses numbers 1, 10, and 11 of his assignments of error. All references to the defendant\u2019s assignments of error are to those that he originally filed rather than to the assignments of error as the defendant renumbered them in his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">Although the defendant filed 17 assignments of error in this Court, he argued on brief only 10 of them. The assignments of error that he did not argue, and that we will therefore not consider, are numbers 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, and 17. <em>See Quesinberry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 364, 370, 402 S.E.2d 218, 222, <em>cert, denied, </em>502 U.S. 834 (1991) (holding assignments of error not argued on brief are waived for purposes of appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b418-11\"> Although the defendant stated at trial that he was not requesting an instruction on second degree murder, one of his proffered instructions included not only the elements of first degree murder but also those of second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. His other instruction advised the jury that, if a reasonable doubt exists as to the grade of the offense, the jury must resolve that doubt in favor of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b418-12\"> During oral argument, the defendant posited that the testimony elicited from Scott Glass, the forensic expert, during cross-examination supported the defendant\u2019s contention that the shooting of Burnett was \u201caccidental.\u201d Glass acknowledged that the weapon used to kill Burnett was a double-action revolver, meaning that the amount of \u201ctrigger pull\u201d (the force necessary to work the firing mechanism or cause the hammer to fall) required to fire the gun is less when the hammer is cocked than when the hammer is not in that position. But, Glass also testified that the gun was equipped with a safety mechanism called a \u201chammer block rebound system,\u201d which means that, even when the hammer is cocked, \u201cthe trigger has to be pulled and held in the most rearward position\u201d in order for the gun to fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\"> These three arguments cover numbers 2, 3, 13, and 14 of the defendant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b421-9\"> This argument addresses numbers four and seven of the defendant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\"> After the time limit for filing assignments of error had expired, the defendant filed a motion in this Court for leave to file an additional assignment of error in this appeal. In the new assignment of error, he asserted that the trial court gave the jury a verdict form that was inconsistent with the penalty phase jury instructions. The defendant based his motion on the recent decision of this Court in <em>Atkins v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 160, 510 S.E.2d 445 (1999). This Court denied the defendant\u2019s motion on May 10, 1999. Nevertheless, he argued, both on brief and orally, this issue concerning the verdict form. Because the defendant failed to preserve an objection to the verdict form at trial, the defendant is procedurally barred from raising the issue on appeal. Rule 5:17(c). Furthermore, we specifically denied his motion to file an additional assignment of error. Although we rely on the defendant\u2019s procedural default to resolve this issue, we note that the verdict form in this case did not have the problem addressed in <em>Atkins.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\"> This Court compiled a list of cases involving capital murder during the commission of robbery and a finding of future dangerousness in <em>Yeatts </em>v. <em>Comtnonwealth, </em>242 Va. 121, 143, 410 S.E.2d 254, 267-68 (1991), <em>cert, denied, </em>503 U.S. 946 (1992).
