Johnson and Kaheen Sandridge filed separate actions against defendant Carla M. Campbell seeking recovery of damages as the result of personal injuries allegedly received in a motor vehicle accident. In virtually identical motions for judgment, consolidated for hearing below, the plaintiffs alleged they were injured while passengers in a motor vehicle negligently operated by defendant that left a highway in Augusta County shortly after midnight on August 13, 1997, and collided with a tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Responding, the defendant filed a grounds of defense, counterclaim, and motion to dismiss in each action. The plaintiffs filed grounds of defense and demurrers to the counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">In the counterclaims, defendant made the following allegations. During the hours preceding the accident, she participated with a group of young persons, including the plaintiffs, in a card game at a private residence. The rules of the game required a player who \u201clost\u201d to consume a specific amount of beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">Defendant was 17 years of age at the time and several other participants also were minors. Plaintiffs Johnson and Sandridge were 24 and 21 years of age respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">According to the allegations, the plaintiffs \u201cencouraged\u201d the minors, including the defendant, to consume beer and use marijuana, which they supplied to her, so that defendant\u2019s eyes became \u201cred and she appeared to be under the influence of alcohol.\u201d Subsequently, plaintiffs \u201cprevailed upon\u201d defendant to drive her automobile with the plaintiffs as passengers. At the time of the accident, plaintiff Johnson \u201cdistracted her by making unwanted physical contact,\u201d causing her to lose control of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">In the grounds of defense to the counterclaims and in responses to requests for admissions, the plaintiffs admitted they participated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the card game. However, they denied encouraging defendant to participate and denied supplying her with beer or marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In the motions to dismiss, the defendant asserted that plaintiffs\u2019 actions were barred because each \u201cplaintiff\u2019s injury appears to arise as a consequence of his voluntary participation in an illegal act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Subsequently, after considering argument of counsel on the issues raised in the pleadings, the trial court dismissed the motions for judgment and the counterclaims. The court concluded that the plaintiffs voluntarily participated with defendant in a card game involving the consumption of alcohol by all players, including the minor defendant. The court noted that simple possession of alcohol by a minor is unlawful. Code \u00a7 4.1-305(A). The court also noted that plaintiffs rode voluntarily with defendant on a trip for their mutual benefit after she had consumed alcohol, and that no person under the age of 21 may lawfully operate a motor vehicle after she has consumed any alcohol, Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The trial court decided that violations of the foregoing statutes by a minor are acts of delinquency and that, by voluntarily participating with defendant in the commission of these acts, plaintiffs were guilty of contributing to her delinquency in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371. And, the trial court ruled as a matter of law that there was a \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the illegal conduct and the accident requiring dismissal of the actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Upon the counterclaims, the trial court concluded that defendant\u2019s allegations show \u201cshe voluntarily operated a motor vehicle after consuming enough alcohol and marijuana to be a contributing cause\u201d of the accident, and that \u201c[tjhis amounts to assumption of risk as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The trial court employed an odd procedure; it treated the plaintiffs\u2019 demurrers to the counterclaims as motions to dismiss and the defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment. Nevertheless, even though the procedure below was unusual, we can reach the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">The primary appellate issue is whether the trial court erred in ruling that any illegal conduct in which the plaintiffs may have participated was a proximate cause of the alleged injuries as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">Virginia permits the employment of the so-called \u201cillegality\u201d defense, which is based on the principle that a party who consents to and participates in an illegal act cannot recover damages from other participants for the consequences of that act. <em>Lee </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>255 Va. 279, 282, 497 S.E.2d 328, 329 (1998); <em>Zysk </em>v. <em>Zysk, </em>239 Va. 32, 34, 404 S.E.2d 721, 722 (1990); <em>Miller v. Bennett, </em>190 Va. 162, 164-65, 56 S.E.2d 217, 218 (1949). The consent must be \u201cfreely given without fraud or duress.\u201d <em>Zysk, 239 </em>Va. at 34, 404 S.E.2d at 722. The main premise for the rule is \u201cthe idea that courts will not assist the participant in an illegal act who seeks to profit from the act\u2019s commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Repeatedly, this Court has insisted that, before the defense can be successful, a causal relationship must be established between participation in the illegal act and the injuries or damage claimed. For example, in <em>Lee, </em>in which we affirmed the trial court\u2019s enforcement of the defense and in which the requirement of causation was not an appellate issue, we noted that the trial court held that the plaintiff voluntarily consented to participation in the illegal act that \u201cresulted\u201d in his injuries. 255 Va. at 282, 497 S.E.2d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In <em>Godbolt v. Brawley, </em>250 Va. 467, 463 S.E.2d 657 (1995), we discussed the illegality defense, although the case was decided on other issues. We said that the participant\u2019s intentional criminal act was not \u201cthe direct cause\u201d of his injury and that the facts of <em>Godbolt </em>differed from the facts in cases like <em>Zysk </em>and <em>Miller </em>in which there was a direct cause-and-effect link. <em>Godbolt, </em>250 Va. at 472, 463 S.E.2d at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In <em>Miller, </em>the Court said that, when the illegality defense is applied in tort actions, the consent or participation in an unlawful act by plaintiff precludes recovery for injuries sustained \u201cas a result of that act.\u201d 190 Va. at 165, 56 S.E.2d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">We emphasize the requirement of direct causation, which the trial court recognized, because defendant on appeal argues that the injury need not be a proximate result of the illegal act. Instead, defendant contends, the injury merely must be \u201can ultimate consequence\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s voluntary illegal acts. The defendant is wrong, whatever a standard of \u201cultimate consequence\u201d may mean, for the reasons we have just outlined.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Turning to the question whether any unlawful conduct of the plaintiffs was a proximate cause of their alleged injuries as a matter of law, we conclude that the trial court erred in so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">As a preliminary matter, we will assume without deciding that, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, the requisite level of \u201cparticipatory\u201d illegal conduct by plaintiffs is present. At this stage of the proceedings, the facts are in dispute concerning whether the plaintiffs merely were present in the defendant\u2019s company or whether they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>bought alcohol for defendant, supplied alcohol to her, encouraged her to consume alcohol, or persuaded her to drive a motor vehicle. This issue must be decided upon a full development of the facts, but we will give the defendant the benefit of the doubt on this issue at this juncture of the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Given the facts developed thus far, however, many of which are disputed, a jury question has been presented on the issue of proximate cause. For example, furnishing alcohol to defendant may be too remote an event to constitute proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. <em>See Williamson v. The Old Brogue, Inc., </em>232 Va. 350, 353, 350 S.E.2d 621, 623 (1986) (individuals, drunk or sober, responsible for own torts and drinking intoxicant, not furnishing it, is proximate cause of injury). Indeed, the motions for judgment did not claim that defendant\u2019s alcohol consumption caused the accident; thus, at this stage of the proceedings, the trial court erred in making a causal connection between defendant\u2019s drinking and the accident. Also, if plaintiff Johnson distracted defendant \u201cby making unwanted physical contact,\u201d as alleged, there is the factual question whether plaintiffs\u2019 prior illegal acts directly caused their alleged injuries. Consequently, we hold that the trial court should not have dismissed the motions for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Finally, defendant has assigned cross-error. She claims the trial court erred in dismissing the counterclaims. We agree. Even if the defendant drove the vehicle after using drugs and alcohol, as she alleges, and thus may have assumed the risk of injury, the question remains whether that conduct was a proximate cause of the accident in view of the disputed facts about what actually caused her to lose control of the vehicle. In other words, may a defendant assume the risk of \u201cunwanted physical contact\u201d by driving after consuming intoxicants?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Thus, the judgments of the trial court in these two cases will be reversed and die cases will be remanded for further proceedings on the motions for judgment and the counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
