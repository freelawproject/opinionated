We answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The facts are not disputed. In October 1997, the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, Bemie P. Welch, was operating a dump truck for his employer, C. W. Strittmatter, Inc., at a construction site in Fairfax County. At that time and place, defendant Miller &amp; Long Company of Maryland, Inc., owned a mobile crane being operated in the work by its employee, defendant Nathan Gunn. As a result of the alleged negligence of Gunn, the crane \u201ctoppled over,\u201d crushing the truck\u2019s cab and causing Welch\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">Welch\u2019s administrator filed this common-law action against the foregoing defendants seeking recovery of damages under the Death By Wrongful Act statutes, Code \u00a7 8.01-50, <em>et seq. </em>The plaintiff joined as defendants Royal Insurance Company of America, the uninsured motorist carrier for the dump truck, and Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO), the uninsured motorist carrier for the decedent\u2019s personal motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The parties agreed that the deceased was operating the truck in the scope of his employment with Strittmatter; that Miller &amp; Long, Strittmatter, the deceased, and Gunn were all engaged in construction work on one project at one site; that Miller &amp; Long and Strittmatter were subcontractors on the job; and that Miller &amp; Long and Gunn fell within the jurisdiction of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Defendants Miller &amp; Long (the decedent\u2019s statutory employer) and Gunn (the decedent\u2019s fellow servant) filed a plea in bar, asserting that a common-law action against them for negligence was barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Act, Code \u00a7 65.2-307 (rights and remedies granted to employee for payment of workers\u2019 compensation on account of death by accident exclude all other rights and remedies of employee\u2019s personal representative at common law on account of such death).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Defendant Royal Insurance Company filed a motion for summary judgment (treated by the trial court as a plea in bar), in which GEICO joined. The insurers asserted that the plaintiff could not recover any uninsured motorist benefits because plaintiff, not being legally entitled to recover any damages against either Miller &amp; Long or Gunn, could not satisfy the condition precedent to such uninsured motorist liability. The uninsured motorist statute requires motor vehicle liability policies to contain provisions undertaking to pay \u201cthe insured all sums that he is legally entitled to recover as damages\u201d from an uninsured motorist. Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The plaintiff urged application of 1997 amendments to Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B)(v) and (F), which generally provided that \u201cimmunity\u201d from liability for negligence of the operator of a motor vehicle shall not be a bar to an insured obtaining a judgment against the insurer. The plaintiff asserted that the crane was an uninsured motor vehicle by statutory definition because Miller &amp; Long and Gunn were \u201cimmune\u201d from liability for negligence under the Act. The plaintiff further asserted that the 1997 amendments now allow \u201cthe deceased insured\u201d to proceed with the action against the \u201cimmune\u201d defendants and that any judgment obtained would be enforceable only against the insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Following consideration of argument of counsel, the trial court, in a letter opinion, sustained the respective pleas in bar. We awarded the plaintiff this appeal from a September 1998 order dismissing the action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>On appeal, the plaintiff advances the same arguments presented below, and contends the trial court erred in dismissing the action. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">In <em>Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. v. Dodson, </em>235 Va. 346, 367 S.E.2d 505 (1988), we considered a case with facts virtually identical to those presented here, and interpreted the version of the uninsured motorist statute effective at that time. We held that Virginia law did not permit recovery by an insured\u2019s estate under the uninsured motorist provisions of die insured\u2019s motor vehicle liability policy issued by Aetna, when the insured was killed in a work-related motor vehicle accident and when the employer/vehicle owner and co-employee/vehicle operator both were insured under other policies, but when the exclusive remedy provision of the Act barred recovery under those other policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In <em>Dodson, </em>we said: \u201cBecause workers\u2019 compensation afforded the exclusive remedy against the decedent\u2019s employer and fellow employees for his accidental death, his statutory beneficiaries are not \u2018legally entitled to recover\u2019 damages against them. It follows that a condition precedent to Aetna\u2019s liability under its [uninsured motorist] endorsement was not met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 367 S.E.2d at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Nine years after <em>Dodson, </em>the General Assembly amended portions of the uninsured motorist statute pertinent here. <em>See </em>Acts 1997, ch. 170, 191. The statutory definition of \u201c <em>Uninsured motor </em>vehicle\u201d was amended to provide that the term \u201cmeans a motor vehicle for which . . . (v) the owner or operator of the motor vehicle is immune from liability for negligence under the laws of the Commonwealth or the United States, in which case the provisions of subsection F shall apply and the action shall continue against the insurer.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">At the same time, subsection (F) was amended to provide: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of subsection A [containing the \u2018legally entitled to recover\u2019 language], the immunity from liability for negligence of the owner or operator of a motor vehicle shall not be a bar to the insured obtaining a judgment enforceable against the insurer for the negligence of the immune owner or operator, and shall not be a defense available to the insurer to the action brought by the insured.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">We reject the plaintiff\u2019s argument that only the foregoing amendments control here. Initially, we disagree with the plaintiff that, because the alleged tortfeasors, defendants Miller &amp; Long and its employee Gunn, are not subject to a common-law judgment in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>action by the plaintiff, due to the exclusive remedy provision of the Act, the amendment terms \u201cimmune\u201d and \u201cimmunity\u201d describe the status of those defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">In this context, the terms contemplate total exemption from tort liability, such as that generally enjoyed by state and local governments. In the present situation, the tortfeasors were not exempt from liability. Rather, they, and their workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, were strictly hable to the plaintiff for payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Moreover, a clear statutory mandate trumps the plaintiff\u2019s effort effectively to disregard provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and to focus solely on the uninsured motorist statute, a part of the insurance laws. Code \u00a7 38.2-900, contained within the insurance title of the Code, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">\u201cAll acts and parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions of this title are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency. However, the provisions of this title shall not amend or repeal any provisions of Title 65.2 relating to workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Therefore, the exclusive remedy provision of the Act is not affected by the amendments to the uninsured motorist statute. Acceptance, as here, of workers\u2019 compensation benefits on behalf of the deceased employee excludes all other rights and remedies of such employee, his personal representative, and next of kin at common law or otherwise on account of the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Accordingly, because the Act afforded the exclusive remedy against the decedent\u2019s statutory employer (Miller &amp; Long) and a fellow servant (Gunn), the decedent\u2019s statutory beneficiaries under the wrongful death statutes are not legally entitled to recover damages against them. Thus, a condition precedent to the insurers\u2019 liability under the uninsured motorist statute was not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Consequently, the judgment of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
