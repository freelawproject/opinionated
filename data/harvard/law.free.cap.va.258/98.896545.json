However, each named party who is an individual, one officer or agent of each party which is a corporation or association . . . shall be exempt from the rule of this section as a matter of right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">In this appeal, we consider whether the circuit court erred in denying the plaintiff\u2019s post-trial motion for a new trial because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>corporate defendant designated as its agent, for purposes of Code \u00a7 8.01-375, its former employee, whose negligent acts and omissions were at issue in this litigation, thus permitting the former employee to observe the trial even though the circuit court had excluded the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Plaintiff, Lucille B. Motley, filed her motion for judgment against James N. Mobley, Tarmac Mid-Atlantic, Inc., and Tarmac America, Inc. She alleged that Mobley, while acting within the scope of his employment, negligently operated a truck, and that his negligence was a proximate cause of her injuries. The plaintiff nonsuited Mobley and Tarmac Mid-Atlantic, Inc., and the case was tried before a jury against Tarmac America, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">After the jury had been empanelled, defendant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cMr. Mobley is going to be my corporate designee. I\u2019d make a motion to separate the witnesses . . . .\u201d The circuit court granted the motion. Counsel for the litigants made their opening statements and presented evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">According to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the plaintiff was driving a car in a westerly direction on Broad Street in Richmond on February 22, 1996, about 10:45 a.m. This portion of Broad Street consists of four lanes of travel, two lanes extending in an easterly direction and two lanes extending in a westerly direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The plaintiff testified that as she was driving her car, a white vehicle \u201cwhipped over in front\u201d of her, and she swerved her car to the left to avoid it. The plaintiff, who was driving approximately 25 m.p.h., lost control of her car and traveled across the two lanes of eastbound traffic, \u201cslammed into a wall,\u201d \u201cbounced back onto the street,\u201d and injured a pedestrian.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">The plaintiff was unable to identify the white vehicle that entered her lane of travel. However, Thomas G. Aukward testified that as he was driving his car on Broad Street, he observed in his rearview mirror a white truck, similar to the truck that Mobley was driving, approach his car \u201cfairly quick.\u201d Aukward \u201cbraced himself,\u201d thinking that the white truck was going to collide with his car. As Auk-ward looked into his mirror a second time, the white truck \u201cwas gone,\u201d and as he was \u201ctrying to figure out where the vehicle went,\u201d he saw Motley\u2019s car \u201cskidding\u201d across the traffic lanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">Deborah K. Matthews, another witness, testified there was no doubt in her mind that the truck that Mobley was driving was the truck that entered the plaintiff\u2019s lane of travel. Floyd Marable, who also saw the accident, testified that the truck Mobley was operating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>was the only white truck in the area when the accident occurred. Marable stated that he observed the truck move into the plaintiff\u2019s lane of travel, and that the operator of the truck did not give a turn signal when the truck changed lanes. Charles B. Howard, a Richmond police officer, testified that Mobley stated at the scene of the accident that he had been operating his truck in the left westbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Mobley, who was present during the entire trial, testified that his truck was not involved in the accident and he operated his truck in the \u201cright lane all the time,\u201d and that Officer Howard\u2019s conflicting testimony was not true. At the conclusion of the evidence, the jury was instructed and returned a verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">After the circuit court had entered a judgment on the verdict, but before the court lost jurisdiction, the plaintiff learned that the defendant had terminated Mobley\u2019s employment before the trial, but the defendant failed to inform the plaintiff of this fact. The plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial and asked that the court vacate its judgment order because Mobley was not the defendant\u2019s employee and, therefore, he should not have been allowed to remain in the courtroom to observe the testimony of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Counsel for the litigants filed memoranda in support of their respective positions, and the circuit court considered argument of counsel. During the argument, defendant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cAt the time of trial [Mobley] was not an employee and the facts are that the plaintiff nonsuited him and that I said on the record that he was going to be the corporate designee.\u201d The circuit court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion and entered a judgment in favor of the defendant. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The plaintiff argues that she is entitled to a new trial because Mobley was not an agent of the defendant within the intendment of Code \u00a7 8.01-375 and, therefore, he was not entitled to remain in the courtroom once the circuit court ordered the exclusion of witnesses. The defendant responds that Code \u00a7 8.01-375 permits it to appoint <em>any person </em>as an \u201cagent of ... a corporation\u201d and, thus, Mobley was exempt from the statutory exclusion. We disagree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Code \u00a7 8.01-375 requires a circuit court trying any civil case, upon motion of any party, to exclude every witness. The statute, however, contains an exception for each named party who is an individual or \u201cone officer or agent of each party which is a corporation.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-375. The purpose of this statute is to discourage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>and expose fabrication and collusion by witnesses and to minimize the likelihood that witnesses will alter their testimony so that such testimony is consistent with testimony provided by other witnesses. <em>See, e.g., United Dentists, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>162 Va. 347, 352, 173 S.E. 508, 509 (1934). This statute is important to the administration of justice because the exclusion of witnesses will often assist the finder of fact in its quest to ascertain the truth. And, as Professor Wigmore observed, the sequestration of witnesses \u201cis (next to cross-examination) one of the greatest engines that the skill of man has ever invented for the detection of liars in a court of justice.\u201d 6 John H. Wigmore, <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 1838 at 463 (James H. Chadbourn ed. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">We hold that Mobley was not an agent of the defendant within the intendment of Code \u00a7 8.01-375 because he was neither employed by the defendant at the time of trial, nor did he have any other relationship with the defendant at that time. We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that it is entitled to appoint anyone as its agent for purposes of Code \u00a7 8.01-375 because such an interpretation would permit litigants to circumvent and frustrate the very purposes that the statute was designed to achieve. For example, the defendant\u2019s position, which we do not accept, would permit a corporate litigant to appoint as its \u201cagent of the corporation\u201d any witness whose testimony may be crucial to the determination of a case, thereby permitting that witness to observe the testimony of other witnesses and judicial rulings even though that person has no association or relationship with the corporate defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In view of our disposition of this case, we need not consider the plaintiff\u2019s remaining contentions. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court, and we will remand this case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
