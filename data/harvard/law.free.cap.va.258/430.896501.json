Code \u00a7 65.2-101. In the present case, the question presented is whether an employee who performs two separate jobs for her employer and is injured in one may combine the wages received from both in calculating the average weekly wage for compensation purposes. Finding that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the Commission) did not err in combining the employee\u2019s wages and awarding compensation accordingly, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">The employee, Delorice M. Cole (Cole), has been employed by the Dinwiddie County School Board (the School Board) as a school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>bus driver for thirty-one years and as a teacher\u2019s aide for twenty years. Each year, she signs a separate contract for each position, and she is paid by the School Board separately for each job. Although the School Board has only one bank account, Cole is paid from the Transportation Department\u2019s budget for her service as a school bus driver and from the Special Education Department\u2019s budget for her work as a teacher\u2019s aide.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">On December 2, 1996, while performing her job as a teacher\u2019s aide, Cole fell and injured her shoulder. Her injury did not prevent her from performing as a teacher\u2019s aide and she lost no time from work in that capacity, but the injury did prevent her performance as a school bus driver and she lost certain periods of time from work in that job.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">On January 30, 1997, Cole filed with the Commission a claim seeking the award of medical benefits as well as temporary disability benefits for periods of lost work as a school bus driver. A deputy commissioner heard the case. Applying what has been termed the \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d or the \u201csubstantially similar doctrine,\u201d the deputy commissioner found that, \u201c[ajlthough there are minor overlapping duties required in the jobs of bus driver and teacher\u2019s aide, ... the two jobs are not sufficiently \u2018similar\u2019 ... to aggregate the earnings in calculating the average weekly wage.\u201d Accordingly, the deputy commissioner awarded Cole no benefits for lost wages but did allow her \u201cmedical benefits causally related to the industrial accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Cole appealed to the full Commission. The Commission agreed that Cole\u2019s jobs were dissimilar but held that \u201c[s]ince the employer is the same, the wages earned in both jobs should be combined.\u201d <em>Cole v. Dinwiddie County School Bd., </em>76 O.W.C. 480, 485 (1997). Accordingly, the Commission calculated Cole\u2019s average weekly wage based upon her combined income from both positions and awarded her payment of temporary partial disability benefits for lost earnings. <em>Id. </em>at 485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The School Board appealed to the Court of Appeals, and that Court affirmed the Commission\u2019s award. <em>Dinwiddie County School Bd. v. Cole, </em>28 Va. App. 462, 465, 506 S.E.2d 36, 37 (1998). We awarded the School Board this appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Code \u00a7 65.2-101, part of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, states that \u201c \u2018[a]verage weekly wage\u2019 means . . . [t]he earnings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>of the injured employee <em>in the employment </em>in which he was working at the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury, divided by fifty-two . . . (Emphasis added.) The parties focus their argument on the phrase, \u201cin the employment,\u201d italicized above, and debate the applicability of the dissimilar employment rule to the situation at hand, <em>i.e., </em>where there are two jobs but only one employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The School Board argues that, in this situation, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act required the Commission \u201cto analyze the similarity of the employee\u2019s two jobs and to combine the earnings from each job only if the two employments are \u2018similar\u2019 \u201d and that the Commission \u201cwrongly disregarded the dissimilarity of Cole\u2019s two jobs . . . and combined the wages ... to calculate the average weekly wage.\u201d Cole argues that the substantial similarity doctrine simply does not apply \u201cwhen the employee works for <em>one </em>employer, albeit in two positions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-101 does not define the phrase, \u201cin the employment,\u201d or mention the terms, \u201csimilar,\u201d \u201csubstantially similar,\u201d or \u201cdissimilar.\u201d The statute, therefore, is not the source of the dissimilar employment rule. Rather, the rule originated in the decision of the Industrial Commission (now the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission) in <em>Thompson v. Herbert, 4 </em>O.I.C. 310 (1922). That' case involved an employee who worked part time as a handy man at a cold storage plant and part time as a teacher in the public schools. He was killed while working at the cold storage plant, and his widow sought to combine his earnings from that job with his earnings as a school teacher. Considering the same statutory language that is now contained in Code \u00a7 65.2-101 and finding that the deceased\u2019s two jobs were \u201ctotally different,\u201d the Commission held it was not permissible to combine wages earned in dissimilar employment because such action would \u201cnullify\u201d the statutory language defining \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d as \u201cthe earnings of the injured employee <em>in the employment in which he was working at the time of the </em>injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">This Court has considered the dissimilar employment rule on two previous occasions, and, in each instance, has applied the rule to deny the aggregation of earnings in dissimilar employment in calculating the average weekly wage. <em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Thrush, </em>255 Va. 14, 496 S.E.2d 57 (1998) (impermissible to combine wages from regular job as pipelayer with wages from temporary job as painter because of dissimilarity in work); <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Gloucester </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>Furniture Corp., </em>169 Va. 505, 194 S.E. 814 (1938) (impermissible to combine wages from full-time job as expert mechanic with wages from part-time job as steeplejack because of difference in character of work). But, like the situation in the <em>Thompson </em>case decided by the Commission, <em>Graham </em>and <em>Thrush </em>both involved two employers. So, all three of these prior decisions are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">In its opinion, the Commission inquired into the question \u201cwhy wages can be combined if the jobs are similar, but should not be combined if they are not.\u201d In response, the Commission said that workers\u2019 compensation is designed to place the economic burden of work-related injuries on industry and, more specifically, on the employer. The rationale for the proposition that the costs of work-related injuries should not be expanded beyond similar employment is to prevent the costs from being borne out of proportion to an industry\u2019s payroll. There is also a risk factor and a rationale that a low-risk industry should not have to bear the costs of an injury occurring in a high-risk industry. However, the question whether the employment is similar or dissimilar should not be relevant when the employer is the same and only the jobs are different.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The Court of Appeals took the same view. It recognized that \u201c[t]he substantially similar doctrine prevents combining salaries from two separate jobs if the jobs are not similar,\u201d but it said that \u201c[t]he rationale for applying the doctrine is not present when the two jobs are performed for the same employer.\u201d 28 Va. App. at 465, 506 S.E.2d at 37. The court cited the following reasons for its view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">If an employee works for only one employer, the burden [of a work-related injury] is not out of proportion to the employer\u2019s payroll or the industry\u2019s risks. The single employer is not being forced to assume responsibility for the wages paid by some other employer or the risks of some other industry. Combining a claimant\u2019s wages paid by a single employer for two jobs performed is fair to the single employer because that employer had already assumed the liability risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 464, 506 S.E.2d at 37. The court also said that the decision of the Commission was in keeping with the purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and entitled to deference because it was not wrong as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 465, 506 S.E.2d at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The School Board argues, however, that the Court of Appeals erroneously adopted a meaning of the statutory phrase, \u201cin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>employment,\u201d that emphasizes the relationship of the employee <em>with the employer </em>rather than the type of work being performed by the employee at the time of injury. \u201cIn effect,\u201d the School Board says, \u201cwhat the Court of Appeals has done is to change, by judicial fiat, the statutory phrase \u2018earnings of the injured employee in the employment\u2019 to \u2018earnings of the injured employee <em>with the </em>employer\u2019 in defining average weekly wage in this particular fact situation.\u201d This means, the School Board claims, that \u201can employer would be required to pay compensation based on combined earnings in two dissimilar jobs when performed by one employee, but not so if the same jobs were performed by two employees.\u201d The School Board maintains \u201cthat all an employer has to do to avoid this unfair result is to hire two employees to perform the two jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We disagree with the School Board. The Court of Appeals has not changed anything. It was presented a question of first impression, and it was writing on a clean slate. All it did was to apply clear statutory language in a context not previously considered, one differing from the context in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>where the dissimilar employment rule originated.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">When the context differs, nothing in Code \u00a7 65.2-101 prevents the placing of emphasis upon the relationship between employer and employee rather than the type of work being performed in determining average weekly wage. In <em>Thompson v. Herbert, </em>it was necessary for the Commission to place the emphasis upon the type of work being performed because, with two employers of differing identity, whether the two jobs differed or not became the crucial question.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Here, because the employer is of singular identity, the emphasis naturally is upon the employer-employee relationship and the character of the work becomes an irrelevant consideration. As a matter of common sense and simple logic, it cannot reasonably be doubted that Cole was working \u201cin the employment\u201d of the School Board when she was injured, regardless of whether the particular work she was performing at the time was similar to her other work, whether she had separate contracts for her two jobs, or whether her wages were charged to two separate budgets.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">But, should doubt remain, Cole is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. The provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cshould be liberally construed to carry out [its] humane and beneficial purposes.\u201d <em>Baggett Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>219 Va. 633, 637, 248 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>S.E.2d 819, 822 (1978). Affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals will accomplish these purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\"> Virginia Municipal Group Self-Insurance Association is also a party appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
