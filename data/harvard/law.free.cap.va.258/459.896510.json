Subsequently, during a 1998 eight-day trial, a jury convicted defendant Dexter Lee Vinson, upon not guilty pleas, of the following offenses in connection with the homicide: Capital murder in the commission of abduction with intent to defile, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-31(1); object sexual penetration, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2(A); abduction with intent to defile, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-48; and carjacking, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">The jury fixed defendant\u2019s punishment at death for the capital offense based upon the vileness and future dangerousness predicates of the capital murder sentencing statute. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4. Also, the jury fixed defendant\u2019s punishment at life imprisonment for each of the noncapital convictions. Following a February 1999 post-trial hearing, at which the trial court considered a probation officer\u2019s report, the court sentenced defendant in accord with the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">The death sentence is before us for automatic review under Code \u00a7 17.1-313(A), <em>see </em>Rule 5:22, and we have consolidated this review with defendant\u2019s appeal of the capital murder conviction. In addition, by order entered March 22, 1999, we certified from the Court of Appeals of Virginia to this Court the record of defendant\u2019s appeals of the noncapital convictions (Record No. 990613). The effect of this certification is to transfer jurisdiction over the noncapital appeals to this Court for all purposes. Code \u00a7 17.1-409(A). Those appeals have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>been consolidated with the capital murder appeal (Record No. 990612).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">As required by statute, we shall consider not only the trial errors enumerated by defendant but also whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The facts are virtually undisputed. The defendant, who did not testify at trial, now argues through his attorneys that, although he was present at the scene of the homicide, there are certain \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in the prosecution\u2019s evidence on the question whether he was the actual perpetrator of the offenses. However, when there are inconsistencies in this evidence, we shall construe the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as required by settled rules of appellate procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">On May 19, the victim, age 25, and her three children resided with Nethie Pierce and her children in Portsmouth. The victim and her children previously had lived with defendant, age 33, in Portsmouth for \u201cabout a year and a half.\u201d At the time of the homicide, the unmarried couple had been living apart about three weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">About 9:00 a.m. on the day in question, the victim borrowed Pierce\u2019s \u201c1988 red Beretta\u201d automobile to take the victim\u2019s children to school. \u201c[I]n a hurry to get the kids to school,\u201d the victim wore only a \u201cshift-type\u201d robe and underwear. Pierce\u2019s 14-year-old daughter, Willisa Joyner, rode with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">About 6:30 a.m. on the same day, Faye Wilson was completing a weekend stay with defendant in a Suffolk motel. Wilson owned a 1988 blue Mercury Tracer automobile, which she allowed defendant to use that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">After the victim delivered her children to school, she drove with Willisa to the home she had shared with defendant in order to \u201cget the mail.\u201d Upon arrival, Willisa \u201cgot out of the car,\u201d at which time the victim saw the defendant driving a blue automobile. Willisa reentered the red vehicle when the victim said, \u201c \u2018get back in the car.\u2019 \u201d As the victim \u201cstarted driving,\u201d the defendant twice rammed the rear of the red car with the front of the blue car.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">The victim stopped the red car and the defendant walked to the driver\u2019s side window where the victim was sitting. He then \u201cpunched\u201d out the window. Next, defendant \u201cgrabbed\u201d the victim, hit her in the face and chest with his hand, and \u201ctook her out of the car.\u201d The defendant held the victim by the arm and, in the presence</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>of bystanders, \u201csnatched\u201d off her robe leaving her standing in her \u201cunderclothes,\u201d screaming and bleeding from her nose and mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Next, defendant \u201ctook\u201d the victim to the blue car and \u201cmade her get in.\u201d When the blue car \u201cwouldn\u2019t start up,\u201d defendant \u201cput her\u201d in the red car \u201cand they drove away.\u201d Police officers arrived on the scene after defendant had abducted the victim; they obtained a description of defendant and of the red car.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Shortly thereafter, Vertley Hunter noticed from her home a red car, \u201cwrecked in the back,\u201d that was \u201cpulled off the street and parked behind\u201d a vacant house in her neighborhood; boards were nailed over the windows of the house. She observed a young \u201cwhite female\u201d and a young \u201cblack man\u201d sitting in the vehicle, with the female sitting in the driver\u2019s seat with \u201cher hand outside the window to duck off a cigarette that she was smoking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">According to Hunter, the man \u201cgot out on the passenger side of the car and went to the back . . . and got a piece of rope out.\u201d The man \u201cleaned back into the car\u201d holding the rope. Hunter heard the woman tell the man \u201cto leave her alone so she could go on with her life,\u201d and heard her \u201cask the Lord to spare her life because he was going to kill her.\u201d At that time, the man was \u201c[c]hoking her with the rope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Then, the man \u201cgrabbed her by the hair from the back seat of the car and pulled her over the seat . . . and he pulled the rope from around her neck at the same time.\u201d He then \u201cpulled her down in the floor\u201d and \u201ctold her that he was going to kill her.\u201d While the woman was still inside the car, the man \u201cslammed the door on her head twice,\u201d according to Hunter.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Next, Hunter saw the man kick dirt beside the car to cover blood that was on the ground. He then pulled off \u201ca board\u201d covering a window of the house, raised the window, and climbed inside through the window. Hunter saw the man enter the house twice and wipe blood from his person with a towel.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Hunter watched the events for a period of several hours until the man drove the red car into the woods behind the house and left the area around 11:00 a.m. During her testimony, Hunter identified defendant in open court as the man she observed committing the acts she described.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">Janice Green, who also lived near the vacant house, testified that during the morning of May 19, she observed a man \u201cmessing around\u201d with a red car in the yard behind the house. She saw the man pull \u201cboards off the house\u201d and enter the home twice. The sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ond time, the man \u201cwas dragging\u201d into the house from the car \u201csomething heavy\u201d; she \u201cthought it was a rug he was pulling.\u201d Green also identified defendant in open court as the man she observed at the vacant house.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">On May 20, 1997, Portsmouth detective Jan Westerbeck went to the vacant house and discovered the victim\u2019s body inside a recently \u201cbusted wall\u201d in one of the bedrooms. The body was nude and partially covered with a brown blanket; feces were found on and under her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Forensic evidence connected defendant with the crimes. His fingerprints were found on the abandoned red car, on the kitchen sink of the vacant house, and on a pane of glass from the house\u2019s kitchen window. Also, the victim\u2019s DNA was matched to a blood stain found on a pair of blue shorts belonging to defendant. According to the witness Hunter, defendant was wearing a \u201csky blue short set\u201d when she observed him. An expert placed the odds of the DNA on defendant\u2019s shorts being that of someone other than the victim at one in 5.5 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">An autopsy performed on the victim\u2019s body showed that she bled to death from deep cuts to both forearms, either of which would have been sufficient to cause death. The cut to the right forearm was two inches deep and severed two main arteries; the left forearm bore a similar wound that cut one artery. The victim did not die instantaneously; it \u201cprobably would have taken her a few minutes, several minutes to die,\u201d according to the medical examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The victim sustained numerous other injuries. For example, there were additional knife wounds on her shoulders, neck, and cheek. There were scratches on her buttocks and cuts on her torso and on one of her legs. She suffered \u201cblunt force trauma\u201d to her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Additionally, she sustained significant vaginal injuries inflicted while she was alive. She sustained a laceration of her inner vaginal lip, massive bruising over her vulva area, and a \u201cmassive laceration,\u201d which tore the tissue separating the vagina from the anus and which tore around her anal opening. In the medical examiner\u2019s opinion, the vaginal injuries were not caused by an erect penis; the inner damage that was done in the vaginal area \u201cwould have been done by an object being penetrated in Miss Felton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">During the penalty phase of the trial, to prove defendant\u2019s future dangerousness, the prosecution presented evidence that defendant had assaulted a police officer in 1987 who was attempting to arrest him; had assaulted a correctional officer in 1988 who was attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>move him to a cell; and had resisted arrest in 1997 near a Suffolk convenience store so violently that it took eight police officers to subdue him. Additionally, the Commonwealth presented evidence that defendant previously had been convicted of receiving stolen goods, attempted statutory burglary, and two offenses of hit and run with personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In mitigation, defendant presented testimony from his 1982 high school band teacher, his mother, his step-father, his supervisor in the construction work that he performed, and a minister. Defendant was described as a \u201cmentor\u201d to a blind student in the band, as one who was \u201cloved\u201d by the victim\u2019s \u201ckids,\u201d and as a person who would \u201cdo anything for anybody at work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Defendant also presented the testimony of two mental health experts, both of whom concluded that defendant suffers from \u201cintermittent explosive disorder\u201d and that he was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of law at the time of the crimes because of this disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In rebuttal, the Commonwealth presented testimony of another mental health expert who, while agreeing that defendant had \u201cthe characteristics\u201d of intermittent explosive disorder, said that \u201calmost all violent criminals\u201d fit that category of illness. This expert, Dr. Paul Mansheim, expressed the opinion \u201cthat there is at least a fifty percent chance\u201d that defendant would commit \u201canother violent offense in the next five years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">On appeal, defendant contends that Virginia\u2019s capital murder statutes are unconstitutional. Every ground of alleged unconstitutionality relied upon by defendant has been previously resolved by this Court adversely to his present contentions, and he has advanced no persuasive reason warranting a departure from our prior decisions. Thus, his contentions are rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Some of defendant\u2019s assignments of error are procedurally defaulted for lack of proper objection in the trial court. We will not consider for the first time on appeal nonjurisdictional issues not raised below. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Issues falling in this category are: The trial court erred in allowing opinion evidence upon the question whether the victim was the subject of object penetration; the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Mansheim\u2019s opinion that there was a fifty percent chance defendant would commit another violent offense within five years; and, the trial court erred by allowing use of a penalty verdict form that allegedly violated the state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The remaining issues raised by defendant generally relate to a pretrial matter, jury selection, several evidentiary questions, and sufficiency of the evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">First, defendant contends the trial court erred in not \u201cgranting Vinson a DNA expert.\u201d There is no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Prior to trial, defendant requested appointment by the court of an independent DNA expert. At a hearing on the motion, defendant acknowledged he could locate no such expert, and the court continued the matter until the next day to allow defendant additional time to search for such an expert, after noting defendant\u2019s \u201crequest is somewhat vague.\u201d The next day, defendant reported to the court that he had been unsuccessful in his search, and the trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The trial court was correct. Implicit in the court\u2019s ruling was the finding that defendant failed to demonstrate the required showing of need for appointment of such an expert. <em>See Husske </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 203, 211-12, 476 S.E.2d 920, 925 (1996), <em>cert, denied, </em>519 U.S. 1154 (1997) (indigent defendant seeking appointment of expert witness must demonstrate that subject necessitating expert assistance likely will be significant factor in defense and that defendant will be prejudiced by lack of expert assistance). Moreover, defendant had ample opportunity to locate an expert and, under these circumstances, there was no duty on the trial court to search independently for an expert witness for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Next, defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion during voir dire in seating certain prospective jurors and dismissing others. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Upon appellate review, this Court gives deference to the trial court\u2019s decision whether to retain or exclude prospective jurors. This is because the trial judge has observed and heard each member of the venire and is in a superior position to evaluate whether the juror\u2019s responses during voir dire develop anything that would prevent or substantially impair the juror\u2019s performance of duty as a juror in accord with the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath. <em>Stewart v. Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 222, 234, 427 S.E.2d 394, 402, <em>cert, denied, </em>510 U.S. 848 (1993); <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 246, 397 S.E.2d 385, 391 (1990), <em>cert, denied, </em>502 U.S. 824 (1991). A trial court\u2019s decision on this issue will be affirmed absent a showing of manifest error. <em>Id. </em>And, a juror\u2019s entire voir dire, not isolated portions, must be considered to determine a juror\u2019s impartiality. <em>Mackall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 240, 252, 372 S.E.2d 759, 767 (1988), <em>cert, denied, </em>492 U.S. 925 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Juror Clanton was properly stricken for cause. She stated unequivocally that if faced with the alternative of sentencing defendant to life imprisonment without parole, she would not even consider imposing the death penalty. The trial court\u2019s decision to exclude Clanton is supported by the record. Her views on imposition of the death penalty would substantially impair her ability to follow the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Likewise, and for the foregoing reason, we hold that the trial court did not err in striking Jurors Dickens, Nicholson, Scott, Warren, and Terrell. All of those jurors indicated they could not impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Furthermore, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to exclude jurors Richardson and Metcalfe. Although Richardson initially said during voir dire that he \u201cprobably would\u201d automatically impose the death penalty upon a finding of guilt of capital murder, he later stated that he would follow the court\u2019s instructions and consider the sentencing options of both life or death. Examining Richardson\u2019s entire voir dire, we cannot say the trial court erred in seating him as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Metcalfe stated she could fairly and impartially decide the case. Near the end of her individual voir dire, however, she expressed some \u201chesitation\u201d about serving on a capital murder jury, noting a concern for her \u201cpersonal safety.\u201d In deciding to seat Metcalfe, the trial judge said \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in her statements that would indicate she could not... be fair. Her demeanor was that of a pretty self-assured person.\u201d The trial court ruled properly in seating her.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Next, defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting in evidence a statement he made in Suffolk to a Portsmouth detective when he was arrested by Suffolk police, accompanied by the Portsmouth detective, on May 20, the day after commission of the crimes. During the first day of trial, defendant moved to suppress the statement, and presented evidence on the motion. He argued \u201che was arrested for no reason\u201d because \u201cthere was no warrant on file\u201d in Suffolk for his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The evidence showed there were outstanding misdemeanor warrants for defendant\u2019s arrest on file in Portsmouth, and that the Portsmouth detective knew about the warrants, although they were not in the officer\u2019s hands at the time of arrest. The evidence also showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>defendant, at that time, was under suspicion for abduction of the victim. Upon arrest, defendant \u201csigned a legal rights advice form\u201d and elected to make a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The trial court denied the motion to suppress and later admitted the statement in evidence through the Portsmouth detective\u2019s testimony. In the statement, defendant denied seeing the victim in the past 48 hours and denied having recently been in Portsmouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The trial court did not err in admitting the statement, which actually set forth an alibi and was not a confession. The arrest was proper because the arresting officers had knowledge of the outstanding misdemeanor warrants, and the police had every right to question him. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-81 (arrest for misdemeanor not committed in officer\u2019s presence valid under certain specified circumstances). However, even if there was a violation of \u00a7 19.2-81 and even if the statement somehow can be considered a confession, suppression of the statement was not required. <em>Thompson v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 117, 121, 390 S.E.2d 198, 200-01 (1990) (confession obtained during period of statutorily invalid arrest not subject to exclusion when accused constitutionally in custody and confessed voluntarily).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Next, defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting a blood sample when the custodian made a mistake in noting the date placed on the evidence envelope. There is no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Detective Westerbeck testified she was present when blood samples were taken from defendant on June 4, 1997. After the blood was taken by a physician, the vials were dated June 4, 1997 and turned over to Westerbeck. She initialed the vials, placed them in an envelope, and kept them in her exclusive care and custody until she gave them to an evidence technician. However, Westerbeck inadvertently dated the envelope into which she placed the vials \u201cJune 3, 1997.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Defendant objected to introduction of the blood samples, stating that a \u201csimple error like that in a case like this could be highly prejudicial.\u201d The trial court overruled the objection, after determining that the evidence the prosecutor was offering was, in fact, the blood taken from defendant on June 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">On appeal, defendant contends the blood samples were inadmissible because they were not properly authenticated and there was a defect in the chain of custody. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">The mistake in the date is inconsequential. And, a chain of custody is properly established when the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence affords reasonable assurance that the exhibits at trial are the same and in the same condition as they were when first obtained. <em>Pope </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 121, 360 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1987), <em>cert, denied, </em>485 U.S. 1015 (1988). These samples met that criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Next, defendant argues the trial court erred \u201cin not granting the motion to strike as to the capital murder charge, the abduction charge, the abduction with the intent to defile charge, the object penetration charge and the carjacking charge.\u201d Now conceding he was the person who abducted the victim, and not relying on any purported alibi, defendant contends the \u201ccircumstances suggest that Vinson drove away with Felton out of some misguided desire for reconciliation or a desire to punish her for leaving him, but not out of a specific intent to sexually molest her.\u201d He argues the eyewitness testimony that he was the perpetrator of the crimes is \u201cinconsistent\u201d and \u201cunworthy of belief.\u201d We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">A further recitation of the facts is unnecessary. It is sufficient to point out that the jury determines the credibility of the witnesses and that there is overwhelming credible evidence to establish defendant was the perpetrator of each of these crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The only offense which requires further elaboration is the carjacking charge. To prove carjacking, the Commonwealth was required to establish that defendant seized control of the red automobile with an intent to permanently or temporarily deprive the victim of the possession or control of the vehicle by means of violence directed to her. Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1(B). The testimony of Willisa Joyner amply supports the finding that both the victim and the red car were seized by defendant through the continuing use of violence directed to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Next, in an obtuse argument, defendant complains about the manner in which the Department of Corrections responded to a subpoena duces tecum for records about his unadjudicated criminal acts. He also complains about the receipt in evidence of \u201ccertain unadjudicated criminal acts allegedly committed by\u201d him. We reject both contentions. The first complaint merits no response. As to the second complaint, we merely note the law is settled in this jurisdiction that prior unadjudicated criminal conduct is admissible at the penalty stage of a capital murder trial to establish future dangerousness. <em>Poyner v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 418, 329 S.E.2d 815, 827-28, <em>cert, denied, </em>474 U.S. 865, 888 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Next, defendant argues the trial court erred in permitting Dr. Mansheim to testify in rebuttal about defendant\u2019s future dangerousness \u201cwhen the defense\u2019s medical testimony did not directly state future dangerousness.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Even though defendant\u2019s medical experts did not use the term \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d as applied to defendant, they opined about defendant\u2019s mental condition and offered excuses for defendant\u2019s behavior. Thus, the trial court properly allowed the prosecutor to present evidence in rebuttal regarding the probability of defendant\u2019s future behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Next, we reject defendant\u2019s conclusory argument that the trial court erred by permitting television cameras in the courtroom because his \u201cright to a fair and impartial jury\u201d was \u201cprejudiced\u201d by their presence. By statute, the trial court \u201cmay solely in its discretion\u201d allow cameras in the courtroom. Code \u00a7 19.2-266. There was no abuse of that discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Next, as we have said, we must determine whether the sentence of death in this case \u201cwas imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(1). Defendant candidly admits, \u201cThe record in this case does not clearly show passion or prejudice.\u201d Indeed, there is not a hint in the record that the determinations of vileness and future dangerousness were made arbitrarily. On the contrary, the record supports the conclusion that the sentence was appropriate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Finally, upon the question of disproportionality and excessiveness, we determine whether other sentencing bodies in this jurisdiction generally impose the supreme penalty for comparable or similar crimes, considering both the crimes and the defendant. <em>Bramblett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 263, 278, 513 S.E.2d 400, 410 (1999). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(2). In determining whether a death sentence is excessive or disproportionate, we consider records of all capital murder cases previously reviewed by this Court in which the death sentence was based upon both the vileness and future dangerousness predicates, including capital murder cases in which a life sentence was imposed. <em>Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 445, 462, 423 S.E.2d 360, 371 (1992), <em>cert, denied, </em>507 U.S. 1036 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">The defendant does not contend that the sentence is excessive or disproportionate. He merely reasserts an earlier contention, which was procedurally defaulted, that \u201cthe penalty verdict form in this case was so defective that the jury\u2019s intent cannot be deduced from it.\u201d We will not entertain such an argument because of the procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Manifestly, however, this sentence is not excessive or disproportionate. Defendant brutally beat and abducted the victim. Following the abduction, he beat and choked her, sexually assaulted her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>in a savage manner, and murdered her by inflicting deep cuts to both forearms. Furthermore, in addition to the vile nature of the offenses, the evidence established that defendant is a violent person who, in the Attorney General\u2019s words, \u201chas no respect for authority and who cannot be rendered non-violent even in a prison setting.\u201d Juries in the Commonwealth generally impose the death sentence for crimes like those committed by this defendant. <em>See, e.g., Cherrix </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 292, 313-14, 513 S.E.2d 642, 655-56 (1999); <em>Hedrick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 328, 342-43, 513 S.E.2d 634, 642 (1999); <em>Barnabei v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 161, 179, 477 S.E.2d 270, 281 (1996), <em>cert, denied, </em>520 U.S. 1224 (1997); and <em>Clozza v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 124, 138, 321 S.E.2d 273, 282 (1984), <em>cert, denied, </em>469 U.S. 1230 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Consequently, we hold the trial court committed no error, and we have independently determined from a review of the entire record that the sentence of death was properly assessed. Thus, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in the capital murder case and in the noncapital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Record No. 990612 \u2014 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5Z\">Record No. 990613 \u2014 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
