The dispositive issues are whether the Commonwealth had good cause for the <em>nolle prosequi </em>motion, and whether its motivation therefor constituted a bad faith or oppressive tactic amounting to prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">In 1995, David J. Harris falsely represented to his employee-union, the International Association of Firefighters (IAFF), that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>was in financial need as a result of unpaid medical expenses arising from the medical care of Harris\u2019 unborn son. Harris provided IAFF with an invoice for expenses, which Harris falsely represented as not having been paid by his insurer. In response to Harris\u2019 false representation, IAFF issued a check to Harris in the amount of $6,744.11. Subsequently, in an attempt to procure additional money, Harris made a second false representation to IAFF in the form of a fabricated invoice showing additional unpaid expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">On January 23, 1996, the Loudoun County General District Court held a preliminary hearing and found probable cause to believe that Harris had committed the felony offense of obtaining money by false pretenses from IAFF. Code \u00a7 18.2-178. The charge was certified to the grand jury. Subsequently, on February 12, 1996, Harris was indicted in a two-count indictment for obtaining money by false pretenses from IAFF and for attempting to obtain money by false pretenses from IAFF. Code \u00a7 18.2-26. At the Commonwealth\u2019s request, a jury trial was set for September 3, 1996. Harris was not held in custody pending his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">On August 15, 1996, the Commonwealth filed a motion for a continuance on the grounds that it had been unable to obtain documents essential to the prosecution from both a local financial institution and an out-of-state financial institution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 22, 1996, a hearing was held on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion. During argument, the Commonwealth conceded that \u201cthere\u2019s a speedy trial issue,\u201d but asserted that the case could be reset, subject to an available date on the trial court\u2019s docket, within the statutory nine-month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Harris opposed the granting of a continuance. He contended that witnesses for his case would be inconvenienced by the delay and that the Commonwealth had failed to act with appropriate diligence to obtain the documents. The trial court denied die motion and admonished the Commonwealth for not timely requesting the subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>to obtain the documents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth then moved to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the indictment. Over Harris\u2019 Objection, the trial court granted this motion and stated, \u201cMr. Harris, you are free to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>On October 15, 1996, the grand jury directly indicted Harris for the same offenses. By agreement with the Commonwealth, Harris appeared, accepted service, and was arraigned on the indictment on November 1, 1996. The Commonwealth had previously agreed to Harris\u2019 release on personal recognizance and, accordingly, Harris was not held in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">On March 31, 1997, Harris moved to dismiss the indictment. In a supporting memorandum, Harris contended that the Commonwealth lacked good cause for seeking the <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the original indictment as required by Code \u00a7 19.2-265.3. Relying on <em>Battle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 624, 406 S.E.2d 195 (1991), Harris contended that the Commonwealth had effectively continued the first prosecution in the form of the second, thus denying him his statutory rights of speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Harris further contended that, even if his statutory speedy trial right had not been violated, his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution had been prejudiced by the delay occasioned by the Commonwealth\u2019s <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the original indictment. Harris conceded that he could not \u201cdetermine . . . whether any evidence will be lost due to witness unavailability, or whether there will be an inability of any witness ... to now accurately recall events.\u201d However, he asserted that he had been prejudiced by a change in counsel necessitated when his original counsel ended his employment with the firm retained by Harris and discontinued his practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In a responding brief, the Commonwealth, relying on <em>Arnold v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 218, 443 S.E.2d 183, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>19 Va. App. 143, 450 S.E.2d 151 (1994) <em>(en banc), </em>contended that the motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the original indictment had been properly taken and, thus, Harris\u2019 statutory period in which to be afforded a speedy trial ran from the date of his arraignment on the second indictment. The Commonwealth further contended that Harris had failed to show that the delay was prejudicial, precluding a review of his claim for a violation of his Sixth Amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In a letter opinion, the trial court indicated that it would deny the motion to dismiss. Citing <em>Arnold, </em>18 Va. App. at 222, 443 S.E.2d at 185, the trial court held that the <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the original indictment \u201claid to rest that indictment, .... as though it never had existed.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court concluded that Harris\u2019 statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>speedy trial right was to be calculated from the date of his arraignment on the charges in the second indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The trial court continued in its opinion letter to consider Harris\u2019 claim that the delay in prosecuting him constituted a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The trial court concluded that \u201c[t]he evidence before the Court. . . does not justify the conclusion that any such deprivation has occurred.\u201d An order incorporating by reference the trial court\u2019s opinion letter was entered May 29, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">On July 29, 1997, Harris entered into a conditional plea agreement whereby he agreed to plead guilty to attempting to obtain money by false pretenses from IAFF while reserving his right to appeal the denial of his speedy trial claims. By order entered August 18, 1997, the trial court found Harris guilty of that offense, sentenced him to a suspended six months term of confinement, and ordered him to make restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Harris noted an appeal to the Court of Appeals. With respect to the speedy trial right under Code \u00a7 19.2-243, Harris contended that the trial court erred in finding that the <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the original indictment had been taken for good cause. He asserted that because the trial court had denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a continuance, there was no good cause for sustaining the motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>as well. Harris further asserted that the trial court erred in finding that there had been no improper motive in seeking the <em>nolle prosequi </em>and that this \u201cbad faith\u201d infringed upon his constitutionally protected right to a speedy trial. Harris also contended that the delays occasioned by the <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the original indictment had violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">In an unpublished opinion, <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 2087-97-4 (October 20, 1998), the Court of Appeals rejected Harris\u2019 assertion that the motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>had been granted without good cause. Noting that the result of a motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>being granted was more favorable to the defendant than where a case is merely continued, the Court of Appeals found that it was \u201cuncontroverted that the Commonwealth had not obtained documents indispensable to prosecution of [Harris] on the scheduled trial date.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>this context, the Court held that the Commonwealth had made a sufficient showing of good cause for the trial court to sustain a motion for <em>nolle prosequi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Having thus found that Harris lacked grounds to assert a violation of his statutory right to a speedy trial, the Court of Appeals concluded that there was no presumption of prejudice in the delay occasioned by his release from the original charges. The Court further concluded that Harris had failed to demonstrate actual prejudice as a result of this delay, thus he was precluded from asserting a violation of his Sixth Amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The Court of Appeals further held that the Commonwealth\u2019s motivation in making the motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>was that it was \u201cunable to properly prosecute the original indictment, without suggestion of unfair or oppressive tactics.\u201d Accordingly, the Court rejected Harris\u2019 assertion of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">On January 4, 1999, the Court denied Harris\u2019 petition for a rehearing <em>en banc. </em>We awarded Harris this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Harris first contends that the trial court\u2019s granting of the motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the first indictment without any showing of good cause by the Commonwealth was error and, thus, the second indictment was effectively a continuation of the original prosecution and subject to the speedy trial time limits of the original prosecution, which would have commenced from the date probable cause was found in the general district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, he contends the record is devoid of any basis upon which the trial court could have granted the motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>for \u201cgood cause.\u201d This is so, Harris asserts, because the Commonwealth could not rely on its argument in favor of the motion for a continuance as supporting its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>and offered no additional reason to support the motion before the trial court made its ruling. Harris further asserts that the trial court\u2019s denial of the continuance motion establishes that there was no good cause to support that motion and, thus, none to support the motion for <em>nolle prosequi. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We review the granting of a motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>under well-settled principles of law. Code \u00a7 19.2-265.3 provides that \u201c[n]olle prosequi shall be entered only in the discretion of the court, upon motion of the Commonwealth with good cause therefor shown.\u201d The express language of the statute commits a finding of good cause to the discretion of the trial court. \u201cIn reviewing an exercise of discretion, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. Rather, we consider only whether the record fairly supports the trial court\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Beck v. Commonwealth, </em>253 Va. 373, 385, 484 S.E.2d 898, 906 (1997). Accordingly, the granting of a motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>will only be overturned if there is clear evidence that the decision to grant the motion was not judicially sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Harris\u2019 contention that the Commonwealth could not rely on its argument in favor of a continuance to support its subsequent motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>is without merit. It is clear from the record that the Commonwealth sought the <em>nolle prosequi </em>as an alternative to the continuance and on the same grounds. That argument and its underlying factual assertions were before the trial court, and it was not necessary for the Commonwealth to reiterate its position under those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Harris\u2019 contention that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant the continuance is tantamount to a finding that there was no good cause to support the subsequent motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>is equally without merit. In denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a continuance, the trial court noted that Harris\u2019 concern for rescheduling his witnesses and the trial court\u2019s concern over the difficulty in setting a new date for a jury trial weighed against granting the motion. These concerns were not applicable to the subsequent motion for <em>nolle prosequi. </em>Moreover, as the Court of Appeals noted, whereas a continuance granted over the defendant\u2019s objection is not favorable to him in certain respects, a <em>nolle prosequi </em>provides him with the benefit of being released from the terms of his bond or from being held in custody. Thus, the trial court\u2019s determination of whether to grant the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>involved a different calculus from the one it had applied to the continuance motion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>record fairly supports the trial court\u2019s action in granting the <em>nolle prosequi </em>and, accordingly, there is no basis for finding that decision was not founded upon good cause shown by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Harris next contends that even if there was sufficient good cause to support the granting of the motion for <em>nolle prosequi, </em>the Commonwealth\u2019s motive therefor was improper. Harris asserts that the Commonwealth acted in bad faith and used \u201coppressive and unfair trial tactics\u201d in order to avoid the operation of the speedy trial statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Addressing the issue of prosecutorial misconduct in <em>Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 363 (1978), the United States Supreme Court stated, \u201cfor an agent of the State to pursue a course of action whose objective is to penalize a person\u2019s reliance on his legal rights is \u2018patently unconstitutional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>434 U.S. at 363. In the instant case, the record does not support a conclusion that the decision to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the indictment was made to penalize Harris for his reliance on his legal rights. Rather, the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>resulted from the Commonwealth\u2019s inability to go forward with the prosecution without a continuance in order to obtain essential documentary evidence. We recognize that the trial court found that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to obtain the necessary documents in a timely manner was, at least in part, due to a lack of adequate foresight and preparation on the part of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While such behavior is not to be encouraged, on this record it does not demonstrate bad faith on the Commonwealth\u2019s part. Nor does the decision of the Commonwealth to seek a <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the indictment rise to the level of oppressive tactics amounting to prosecutorial misconduct in this instance. <em>Cf. Battle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. at 630, 406 S.E.2d at 198 (prohibiting the use of the threat of <em>nolle prosequi </em>in order to increase the prosecutorial risk to a defendant to force a defendant to relinquish an advantage gained by the exercise of the defendant\u2019s legal rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Harris further contends that having failed to prepare adequately for trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s action in seeking a <em>nolle prosequi </em>constituted a violation of his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by providing the Commonwealth with an \u201c \u2018unlimited continuance\u2019 that circumvented [Harris\u2019] right to a speedy trial.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>essence, Hams is asserting that, even in the absence of an improper or vindictive motive, where the Commonwealth elects not to proceed with a prosecution because of a weakness in its ability to present its case, any subsequent attempt to prosecute the same charge should be treated as a continuation of the original prosecution. This contention is contrary to the well-established law of this Commonwealth concerning the effect of a <em>nolle prosequi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\u201cUnder Virginia procedure a <em>nolle prosequi </em>is a discontinuance which discharges the accused from liability on the indictment to which the <em>nolle prosequi </em>is entered.\u201d <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 929, 935, 234 S.E.2d 269, 273 (1977). A new indictment is a new charge, distinct from the original charge or indictment. \u201cWhen an original indictment is supplanted by a second indictment, the terms contemplated by [Code \u00a7 19.2-243] are to be counted from the time of the second indictment.\u201d <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>210 Va. 318, 322, 171 S.E.2d 243, 246 (1969); <em>see also Miller, </em>217 Va. at 934, 234 S.E.2d at 273; <em>Arnold, </em>18 Va. App. at 221-22, 443 S.E.2d at 185; <em>Presley v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 348, 350, 344 S.E.2d 195, 196 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The fact that a motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>comes close in time to the running of a defendant\u2019s speedy trial period does not obviate the ultimate effect of that motion. Once the motion is granted, the defendant is released from custody or the terms of his bond and is at liberty. While this may provide the Commonwealth with an opportunity to gather more evidence, it does not amount to an \u201cunlimited continuance\u201d because the defendant no longer suffers the consequences of being under indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">For these reasons, we find no merit to any of Harris\u2019 contentions in support of his claim that he was denied his statutory right to a speedy trial or that his due process rights were violated when the trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for <em>nolle prosequi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">We now consider Harris\u2019 contention that, even if the trial court did not err in granting the motion for <em>nolle prosequi, </em>he was nonetheless denied his right to a speedy trial as provided under the Sixth Amendment. In <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514 (1972), the United States Supreme Court listed four factors that are to be weighed in determining whether an accused has been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. These factors are the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, whether the defendant has asserted his right, and the prejudice to the accused from the delay. <em>Id. </em>at 530. The Court noted that prejudice to the defendant must be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>sidered in the light of the interests the speedy trial right was designed to protect: \u201c(i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired. Of these, the most serious is the last, because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Addressing each of the factors identified in Barker,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Harris asserts that the delay caused by the <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the original indictment creates a presumption of prejudice since he was not brought to trial for the offenses charged in that indictment until approximately nineteen months after the original probable cause hearing in the general district court. This delay, he asserts, \u201cwas deliberate in that the Commonwealth had not prepared for the original trial.\u201d Thus, while conceding that he was on a personal recognizance bond following his arrest in each instance, Harris contends that he \u201cwas kept in anxiety for more than nineteen (19) months.\u201d Harris further contends that he was prejudiced by the delay because he was required to substitute new counsel and was otherwise subjected to the inherent prejudice of being kept under suspicion of having committed a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The difficulty with all these contentions is that they fail to account for the effect of the <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the original indictment. We have already determined that the trial court did not err in granting the motion for <em>nolle prosequi. </em>As a result, Harris\u2019 claim for a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial relates only to the prosecution of the second indictment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record fails to disclose that the time it took to bring Harris to trial on the second indictment was occasioned by any factor other than the normal proceedings of the trial court, including Harris\u2019 own requests for discovery and pre-trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Nor does Harris point to any evidence in the record showing actual prejudice to his defense. Although Harris\u2019 original counsel left the employ of the firm Harris had retained for his defense, other members of that firm represented him throughout the proceedings. The aggressive nature of the defense they provided discloses no indication of any deficiency resulting from the change in lead counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"Aghq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Similarly, we find no support in the record of Harris\u2019 claim of generalized prejudice resulting from his being under indictment. Accordingly, we hold that the period between Harris\u2019 appearance to accept service of the second indictment and his subsequent conviction thereon did not constitute a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">For the reasons stated, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-8\"> The record reflects that the Commonwealth obtained subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>for these documents in May and July, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\"> Harris contends that the trial court offered the Commonwealth the option of withdrawing its request for a jury trial in order to obtain the continuance. The record reflects, however, only that the trial court noted that the request for a jury trial was a factor in its consideration of the motion for a continuance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> Although Harris had not expressly asserted a violation of his due process rights at this time, the trial court further stated that it found no improper motive or prosecutorial vindictiveness in the Commonwealth\u2019s decision to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the original indictment or in its electing to seek the later indictment of Harris for the same offenses and, thus, no basis for finding a due process violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\"> The Commonwealth contends that Harris failed to preserve his objection to the trial court\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d determination at the time that the motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>was granted. During oral argument, the Commonwealth further contended that Harris is barred from collaterally challenging the granting of the motion for <em>nolle </em>prosequi, asserting that his remedy was to have challenged the trial court\u2019s action on direct appeal. We disagree. At the time the motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>was granted, Harris was not an \u201caggrieved party . . . [petitioning] from [a] final <em>conviction </em>in a circuit court of a traffic infraction or a crime.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-406 (emphasis added). Accordingly, Harris had no right to petition the Court of Appeals for a review of the trial court\u2019s action at that time. Harris\u2019 right of appeal accrued only when he was convicted under the second indictment. The issues before us arise from his assertion of his speedy trial rights, including the claim that the original indictment was improperly terminated, during that prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\"> The record also reflects that the delay in obtaining the documents was caused in part by factors beyond the Commonwealth\u2019s direct ability to control.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\"> It is not disputed that Harris asserted the right as required by the third factor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b606-9\"> Harris concedes on brief that, taking into account his delay in accepting service of the indictment, his conviction on the second indictment occurred within the limits of Code \u00a7 19.2-243.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
