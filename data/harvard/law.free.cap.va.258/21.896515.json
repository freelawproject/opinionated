Code \u00a7 2.1-342(A) and (B). Among the records excluded are \u201cpersonnel records containing information concerning identifiable individuals.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.1-342(B)(3). The Act does not define the term \u201cpersonnel records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">In August 1997, appellants Bruce Moore and WVEC Television, Inc., filed a petition for mandamus and injunctive relief against appellee Ed Maroney, in his official capacity as City Manager for the City of Newport News, and against appellee Dennis Mook in his official capacity as the City\u2019s \u201cInterim\u201d Chief of Police. The defendants filed a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Upon consideration of memoranda of law and argument of counsel, the trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action in a June 1998 order, which did not state reasons for the ruling. The plaintiffs did not move to amend the petition and appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The sole assignment of error is: \u201cThe trial court erred when it ruled that documents relating to a police investigation of possible misconduct by a named public official are exempt from disclosure under [the Act] on the ground that they are personnel records within the meaning of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">We shall recite the sparse facts contained in this record according to settled principles of appellate review. A demurrer admits the truth of all material facts that are properly pleaded. All reasonable factual inferences fairly and justly drawn from the allegations must be considered in aid of the pleading. But a demurrer does not admit the correctness of the pleader\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Ward\u2019s Equip., Inc. </em>v. <em>New Holland N. America, </em>254 Va. 379, 382, 493 S.E.2d 516, 518 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">In the petition, the plaintiffs alleged that Moore was employed by WVEC Television as a news reporter and that the service area of WVEC included the City of Newport News. The plaintiffs further alleged that defendants transact public business and, in the course of their public duties, \u201cmaintain, create and possess certain official records\u201d relating to the City\u2019s \u201cCodes and Compliance Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">The plaintiffs also alleged that in May 1997, reporter Moore sent a letter request under the Act to the City Manager and the Interim Chief of Police, who \u201cwas at that time a custodian of the documents in question.\u201d The letter asked disclosure of: \u201cAny and all tapes, transcripts, photos and reports generated by the City\u2019s investigation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>possible misconduct by employees within the Newport News Codes and Compliance Department.\u201d The letter asked that the disclosure include \u201call material generated by the surveillance of\u201d a named former plumbing inspector and another individual not employed by the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The plaintiffs further alleged that defendant City Manager, in a June letter, refused the request and stated: \u201c \u2018The information which you have requested constitutes personnel and medical records of employees of the City of Newport News. Therefore, pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 2.1-342(B)(3), I must respectfully decline your request for copies of these records.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The plaintiffs also alleged that the investigation had ended and all action taken by the City with regard to it had been completed. Further, they alleged that the named plumbing inspector \u201chas retired.\u201d In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that \u201cthe information requested does not in any way constitute personnel records and is not contained exclusively in the personnel files of\u201d the plumbing inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Further, the plaintiffs alleged that the Interim Chief of Police \u201cis a custodian of the requested documents and is not a custodian of the personnel files of any employees.\u201d Additionally, plaintiffs alleged that the \u201cexemption\u201d cited by the City Manager was \u201cnot applicable\u201d because the records are not personnel records.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">In their request for relief, the plaintiffs asked for issuance of a writ of mandamus commanding the defendants to comply with the Act and to disclose \u201cimmediately\u201d the requested information. The plaintiffs also sought an injunction requiring defendants to comply with the Act. An affidavit of Moore corroborating the factual allegations and copies of the letters were filed with the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">On appeal, the plaintiffs, relying upon cases from other jurisdictions and upon opinions of the Attorney General of Virginia, contend the trial court\u2019s \u201cholding that a police investigation of official misconduct would be a part of a public employee\u2019s personnel record gives a new meaning to the term \u2018personnel records.\u2019 In light of the . . . Act\u2019s clear admonition that it be interpreted to effectuate disclosure and to minimize the effect of exemptions from disclosure, the lower court\u2019s interpretation is erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Continuing, the plaintiffs contend \u201c[i]t is impossible to conceive or articulate a rationale for holding that a police investigation of a public employee is a normal part of the personnel records of that employee. This is especially true where, as here, the investigation results in the employee\u2019s retirement rather than disciplinary action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>and the investigation was not internal, but was conducted by a separate public agency. In fact, the documents were still in the hands of the police department when the request was filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The trial court\u2019s ruling, according to the plaintiffs, \u201csuggests that, for public employees, a police department can be equated with a private company\u2019s personnel department, and that a police investigation is an appropriate evaluative tool for measuring the performance of public employees. Ruling that police surveillance tapes showing an official inspector\u2019s misconduct in the discharge of his professional duties is a typical employee record stretches the meaning of \u2018personnel records\u2019 as that term is commonly understood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Responding, defendants note that plaintiffs\u2019 request made reference only to an investigation of \u201cpossible misconduct\u201d of the City employee, and that the City\u2019s response said nothing about material related to a criminal investigation, which is exempt from disclosure under Code \u00a7 2.1-342(B)(1). Thus, \u201c[t]he only reasonable inference to be drawn from the pleadings,\u201d according to defendants, \u201cis that such investigative material as does exist relates to misconduct under the City\u2019s standards for employee conduct, not to crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Under these circumstances, defendants contend, \u201cthe exigencies of local government frequently require police officers to perform activities only marginally related, at best, to . . . traditional [police] functions.\u201d Defendants note that the City\u2019s Charter authorizes the City Manager to assign employees of any department to the temporary performance of duties in another department. Accordingly, defendants argue, police participation in an internal investigation in another municipal department does not alter the nature of the record and negate its classification as a \u201cpersonnel record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">We are confronted in this case with a problem similar to the one that we encountered in <em>LeMond v. McElroy, </em>239 Va. 515, 391 S.E.2d 309 (1990), another appeal under the Act. There, as here, we were presented with persuasive arguments on both sides of the important question presented. Yet, the appellate record was insufficient, and we refused \u201cto decide the issue in a vacuum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520, 391 S.E.2d at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">In order to demonstrate the dilemma, we will summarize the bare facts alleged in the petition. WVEC is a television station serving an area that includes the City of Newport News. Moore is a reporter for WVEC. The City Manager and Interim Chief of Police are duly appointed public officials who transact public business. Moore sent a request under the Act to defendants for certain desig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>nated records. The City Manager responded to the request stating that the requested information constituted \u201cpersonnel and medical records\u201d of City employees and were exempt from disclosure under the Act. The individual who was the target of the investigation has retired. At the time they were requested, the records were not contained in the employee\u2019s personnel file but were in the possession of the Interim Chief of Police. In this summary, we have disregarded the pleader\u2019s conclusions of law, such as, \u201cthe information requested does not in any way constitute personnel records\u201d; this is the ultimate issue of law in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The parties, on brief, have furnished us with additional facts unsupported by the allegations of the petition for mandamus, the legal sufficiency of which is tested by the demurrer. For example, the plaintiffs tell us that \u201c[p]olice investigative materials such as photos, surveillance tapes, etc., are not a standard part of a government employee\u2019s personnel file, nor are these materials normal evaluative tools for public employees.\u201d We do not know from this record what is a \u201cstandard\u201d part of personnel records in the City of Newport News, and we cannot judicially note that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Likewise, the defendants tell us that \u201c[u]pon receiving allegations of possible misconduct by a plumbing inspector in March 1997, the City of Newport News initiated an investigation. Because the inquiry was deemed to require specialized investigative skills and equipment, police officers were assigned to investigate. Before the police chief could forward the results of the officers\u2019 investigation to the employee\u2019s department head for his consideration of possible disciplinary action, the employee elected to retire.\u201d These assertions must be disregarded on demurrer, but they are consistent with our view that, under certain circumstances, investigative materials dealing with employee misconduct may indeed be a \u201cstandard\u201d part of employee personnel records. But we cannot judicially note that fact either.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Moreover, and significantly, we also do not know from the factual allegations, or inferences flowing therefrom, the precise nature of the records with which we are dealing. They have been described in general terms, <em>i.e., </em>\u201ctapes, transcripts, photos and reports\u201d as well as \u201cmaterial\u201d generated by surveillance. But we do not know, for example, whether the reports and surveillance \u201cmaterial\u201d are addressed only to the supervisor of the police investigator, in which case they may be purely police records, or whether they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>addressed to the head of the plumbing inspector\u2019s department, in which case they may indeed be personnel records.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u201cRoutinely, confidential records are filed for <em>in camera </em>inspection by a trial court and, if necessary, by an appellate court.\u201d <em>LeMond, </em>239 Va. at 520, 391 S.E.2d at 312. <em>See Gloucester County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Serv. </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>256 Va. 400, 403-04, 507 S.E.2d 81, 82-83 (1998) (report of investigation of alleged child abuse submitted for court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>review). Here, the plaintiffs made no effort to have the records at issue produced for examination by the trial court <em>in camera, </em>a practice that we encouraged in cases of this type in <em>LeMond, </em>239 Va. at 520, 391 S.E.2d at 312. In <em>LeMond, </em>as here, there was no evidentiary hearing; counsel for the parties merely made \u201cfactual representations and argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518, 391 S.E.2d at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Accordingly, we reach the same result here that we reached under similar circumstances in <em>LeMond. </em>The trial court\u2019s ruling will stand but without our approval. The judgment will not be reversed because the responsibility for presenting an adequate appellate record is upon the appellants who seek reversal of the decision below. <em>Id. </em>at 520-21, 391 S.E.2d at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Thus, the order appealed from will be</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b47-9\">JUSTICE LACY, with whom JUSTICE KEENAN and JUSTICE KINSER</author>\n<p id=\"AU2\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">This appeal comes to us from an order of the trial court sustaining the defendants\u2019 demurrer and dismissing the petition for writ of mandamus. Unlike a motion for summary judgment in which the trial court decides the merits of a claim, a demurrer only tests the sufficiency of factual allegations to determine whether the pleading states a cause of action. <em>Fun </em>v. <em>Virginia Military Institute, </em>245 Va. 249, 252, 427 S.E.2d 181, 183 (1993). To the extent factual matter is in doubt, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the allegations in the pleading. <em>See id. </em>at 253, 427 S.E.2d at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">In considering a demurrer the trial court is limited to consideration of the pleadings alone and may determine only whether the pleadings state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted. The trial court cannot resolve the merits of the case or expand the record before it by considering other evidence. In reviewing the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>sion of the trial court overruling or sustaining a demurrer, we are likewise limited to consideration of the pleadings alone and the facts contained therein. <em>Id. </em>at 252, 427 S.E.2d at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Applying these principles, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the petitioners, appellants here, failed in their burden to provide a record sufficient for us to review the decision of the trial court in this case. The record before us, although slim, contains the petition for a writ of mandamus, the demurrer, and the trial court\u2019s order granting the demurrer and dismissing the case. No further record is necessary or proper for our consideration in resolving the issue presented by this appeal. In the procedural posture of this case, taking the allegations in the pleading as true as we must, I conclude that the petition for a writ of mandamus sufficiently states a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In order to prevail on a petition for a writ of mandamus to enforce the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the material requested must be an \u201cofficial record\u201d maintained by a \u201cpublic body\u201d that is not exempt from disclosure under the terms of the Act. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-342, -346. In this case, the petition for a writ of mandamus described the material requested (\u201ctapes, transcripts, photos and reports generated by the City\u2019s investigation of possible misconduct by employees\u201d and \u201cmaterial generated by the surveillance\u201d of a former employee and a non-employee), identified the public body maintaining the material sought (the City, the City Manager and the interim Chief of Police) and asserted that the material sought was not a personnel record.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Nothing on the face of the petition flatly contradicts the assertions the petitioners make with regard to the nature of the material sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The respondents argue that because the petitioners describe the material sought in the petition for writ of mandamus as relating to \u201cpossible misconduct\u201d of employees the material is personnel records as a matter of law. Since employee misconduct is a personnel matter, argue respondents, the material is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Considering the pleadings as a whole, I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Personnel records are not defined by the FOIA. In the absence of provisions in the Act which unequivocally make the specific factual material described in this petition personnel records, the determination of whether the requested material constitutes personnel records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>will require development of a factual record and examination of such things as the precise nature of the material sought, the practice of the City with regard to the material it maintains as personnel records and the application of the purposes of the FOIA itself. Although, as the majority notes, both the petitioners and the respondents allege factual matters relative to these factors in their arguments and briefs, those factual matters cannot be considered by us in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">At this stage, it is impossible to say that material described in the petition as held by city officials and concerning a former employee and non-employee is personnel records. Thus, as the majority notes, resolution of the ultimate issue in the case \u2014 whether the material sought is exempt from disclosure under the personnel records exclusion \u2014 requires additional development of the record. Nevertheless, I cannot conclude that the appellants-petitioners failed to provide a sufficient record to determine the issue presented in this appeal, whether the petition can survive the demurrer filed by the defendants. Regardless of whether the petitioners might ultimately prevail, I believe the petition sufficiently alleged a cause of action upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">This conclusion normally would require that the trial court\u2019s judgment be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings. However, the petitioners\u2019 assignment of error and the arguments put forth under that assignment do not address the sufficiency of the pleadings. Rather, the petitioners argue the merits of the case, asserting that the records sought are as a matter of fact and law not personnel records. The petitioners do not ask that the case be remanded for further proceedings but that we conclude that the material requested is not personnel records and enter an order requiring production of the requested material. The relief requested by the petitioners, although within the scope of appellate review when considering a trial court\u2019s action on a motion for summary judgment, is not available when reviewing the sustaining of a demurrer. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal as improvidently granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b48-9\"> Petitioner\u2019s assertion that the material sought is not a \u201cpersonnel record\u201d is a mixed conclusion of fact and law. Although we are not required to accept bare conclusions of law on demurrer, we are required to accept conclusions that turn on the resolution of factual disputes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
