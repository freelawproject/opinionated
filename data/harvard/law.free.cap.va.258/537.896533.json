The capital murder conviction was based on the murder of Mary Ann Hughes in the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. Code \u00a7 18.2-31(4). Roach, who was 17 years old when the crimes were committed, was sentenced to death on the capital murder conviction based on the aggravating factor of \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d The trial court also sentenced Roach to three years\u2019 imprisonment for the use of a firearm in the commission of a murder and to life imprisonment for robbery. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment in <em>Roach v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 324, 468 S.E.2d 98, <em>cert, denied, </em>519 U.S. 951 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Roach filed the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus invoking the original jurisdiction of this Court. He alleges that his parents were not provided notice as required by former Code \u00a7 16.1-263 of proceedings in the Greene County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (juvenile court) that resulted in his transfer to the Greene County Circuit Court (circuit court) for trial as an adult.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that under our recent holding in <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>v. <em>Baker, </em>258 Va. 1, 516 S.E.2d 219 (1999) (per curiam), the failure to provide such notice renders his convictions void for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">On December 7, 1993, two juvenile petitions were issued against Roach, charging him with the capital murder of his 70-year-old neighbor, Mary Ann Hughes, and use of a firearm in the commission of that felony. On December 10, 1993, a third juvenile petition was issued, charging Roach with the robbery of Hughes. Also on December 10, 1993, Roach\u2019s father, John Edward Roach, and mother, Shirley Atm Roach, were personally served with written notice that a hearing would be held that day in the juvenile court to determine whether the criminal charges against Roach should be transferred to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The transcript of the December 10, 1993 hearing reflects that both parents were present. During that proceeding, the juvenile court heard various motions and scheduled the transfer hearing for February 11, 1994. The juvenile court also issued written notice of the February 11, 1994 hearing, and a sheriff\u2019s return of service of process reflects that both parents were personally served with notice of the hearing. On February 11, 1994, both parents were present in the juvenile court, and that court continued the case until May 6, 1994, \u201cfor transfer hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Prior to the May 6, 1994 transfer hearing, at the request of Roach\u2019s counsel, the juvenile court issued a witness subpoena for Roach\u2019s mother requiring her appearance at the hearing. Both parents appeared at the May 6, 1994 proceeding. During the hearing, at the request of Roach\u2019s counsel, the juvenile court excluded all witnesses, including Roach\u2019s mother, from the courtroom. After hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, the juvenile court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">The only thing in this case that I want to read the authorities more clearly on is the voluntariness of this statement [Roach\u2019s purported confession dated December 6, 1993] . . . [Assuming that that voluntariness is established and the Court is satisfied with it, I don\u2019t have any reservations about certifying this case. But it seems to me that the case, in meeting these standards [for transfer to the circuit court under former Code \u00a7 16.1-269], has to rest upon this statement being used in evidence, so that the statement, itself, is very essential and crucial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The juvenile court stated that it would take under advisement the issue of the admissibility of Roach\u2019s statement. In an order dated May 13, 1994, the juvenile court directed that Roach be transferred to the circuit court for further criminal proceedings. In that order, the juvenile court ruled, among other things, that \u201cfrom the evidence presented . . . there is probable cause to believe the juvenile committed the delinquent act[s] alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Roach noted his appeal from the transfer decision pursuant to former Code \u00a7 16.1-269(E). On June 16, 1994, the circuit court conducted a review of the transfer decision. On July 5, 1994, the circuit court entered an order stating that \u201c[a] review of the transcript of the transfer hearing [in the juvenile court] shows the statement was never admitted into evidence and it was necessary as evidence in order to show probable cause.\u201d The order remanded the case to the juvenile court \u201cfor a ruling on whether the Defendant\u2019s statement is to be admitted into evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">On July 22, 1994, the juvenile court conducted a hearing in response to the circuit court\u2019s order. The record does not show that Roach\u2019s parents were given notice of that hearing or that they were present in the juvenile court. At the hearing, the juvenile court heard argument concerning the admissibility of Roach\u2019s statement and whether the Commonwealth had established probable cause to believe that Roach committed the three offenses. After Roach made a motion to strike the evidence, the juvenile court reviewed the content of Roach\u2019s purported confession and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">Having reviewed that again, I find that the case should be sent up and that a motion to strike is overruled and I find that that statement in itself, coupled with the other evidence ... all of it led . . . to the conclusion that this was a case which should be transferred, and I restate that and confirm that decision, particularly in light of the remand which indicated that the Court should make a specific finding on the record that the statement is admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The juvenile court then entered an order entitled \u201cTransfer Order.\u201d In that order, the juvenile court specified that Roach\u2019s statement \u201cis hereby admitted into evidence\u201d and found that there was probable cause to believe that Roach committed the crimes charged. The order concluded: \u201cThis case is again Transferred and Certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>to the Circuit Court ... for further proceedings in accordance with the previous Transfer Order dated May 13, 1994.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\">The circuit court held a hearing on September 1, 1994, to complete its review of the juvenile court\u2019s transfer decision. After the hearing, the circuit court entered an order authorizing the Commonwealth to seek an indictment on all three charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Roach alleges that his parents were not given notice of all the transfer proceedings in the juvenile court. He argues that our decision in <em>Baker </em>compels a conclusion that the circuit court did not acquire jurisdiction to try him on the three felony charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In <em>Baker, </em>for the reasons stated in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, we affirmed the Court\u2019s judgment voiding the circuit court convictions of a juvenile because the required notice of transfer hearing was not provided to the juvenile\u2019s father. 258 Va. at 2, 516 S.E.2d at 220. The Court of Appeals held that \u201c[a] plain reading of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264 manifests legislative intent that both parents be notified and dispenses with this requirement only when the trial judge has certified on the record that the identity of a parent is not reasonably ascertainable.\u201d <em>Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va. App. 306, 312, 504 S.E.2d 394, 397 (1998). The Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[bjecause the notice of the initiation of juvenile proceedings was not properly served on the required parties, the transfer of jurisdiction was ineffectual and the subsequent convictions are void.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315, 504 S.E.2d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Roach contends that the May 6, 1994 transfer hearing was defective because his mother was not given the required statutory notice, and that her compulsory attendance as a witness at this hearing did not constitute a waiver of notice. Roach also asserts that the circuit court did not acquire jurisdiction over him as a result of the May 13, 1994 transfer order because the juvenile court did not make a \u201cvalid\u201d probable cause determination in that order. Roach contends that the July 22, 1994 hearing in the juvenile court, at which a probable cause determination was made, also was defective because neither parent was given notice of that hearing, which rendered the later proceedings in the circuit court void. We disagree with Roach\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">We consider these arguments in the context of the statutory framework established by the General Assembly for the adjudication of offenses allegedly committed by a juvenile. These statutes give the juvenile and domestic relations district courts \u201cexclusive original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>jurisdiction\u201d over \u201call cases, matters and proceedings\u201d concerning a juvenile who is alleged to have been delinquent. Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A). The transfer decision made by a juvenile and domestic relations district court is a proceeding within the meaning of this provision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When a juvenile court transfers a juvenile to a circuit court for further criminal proceedings, the circuit court has exclusive jurisdiction on appeal of that decision to review the juvenile court proceedings to determine whether \u201cthere has been compliance with [former Code \u00a7 16.1-269].\u201d <em>See </em>former Code \u00a7 16.1-269(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In 1993, when Roach was charged with the three felony offenses, the notice provisions of former Code \u00a7 16.1-263 stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">A. After a petition has been filed, the court shall direct the issuance of summonses, one directed to the child, if the child is twelve or more years of age, and another to the parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis, and such other persons as appear to the court to be proper or necessary parties to the proceedings .... The court may direct that oilier proper or necessary parties to the proceedings be notified of the pendency of the case, the charge and the time and place for the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">B. . . . Notice of subsequent proceedings shall be provided to all parties in interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The May 6, 1994 transfer hearing was a \u201csubsequent proceeding\u201d within the meaning of former Code \u00a7 16.1-263 and, thus, under the language of the statute, Roach\u2019s mother was required to be given \u201cnotice\u201d of that proceeding. Roach argues, however, that actual notice to the mother did not satisfy this requirement because she appeared under compulsory process and, therefore, did not \u201cwaive service of summons by written stipulation or by <em>voluntary </em>appearance at the hearing,\u201d as permitted by the statute. <em>See </em>former Code \u00a7 16.1-263(D) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">We find no merit in this argument because former Code \u00a7 16.1-263(D) refers only to the initial summons to be served on parties in interest. Following service of that summons, which was effected on both parents in this case, there was no prescribed method of notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>subsequent proceedings. <em>See </em>former Code \u00a7 16.1-263(B). The mother was served with a summons to appear as a potential witness, she appeared at the hearing, and she was excluded from the courtroom at the request of Roach\u2019s counsel while waiting to testify. Neither Roach nor his mother objected to the adequacy of the notice she received. Under these circumstances, we hold that the mother\u2019s appearance in court satisfied the statutory notice requirements of former Code \u00a7 16.1-263.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\">Our decision in <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 666, 222 S.E.2d 517 (1976), directly supports this conclusion. In <em>Turner, </em>the record failed to show that the juvenile\u2019s parents received written notice of his transfer hearing as required by former Code \u00a7 16.1-176(a)(3). However, his parents were present at the transfer hearing, along with the juvenile and his attorney, and no one objected to the adequacy of the parents\u2019 notice of the hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 668, 222 S.E.2d at 519. We held that when a parent had actual notice of a transfer hearing, any departure from the statutory requirement of written notice was a procedural, rather than a jurisdictional, defect that \u201cmay be cured or waived by the appearance of proper and necessary parties and a failure to object to inadequacy of notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668, 222 S.E.2d at 519. Thus, in the present case, any defect in the manner of notice to Roach\u2019s mother was cured by her appearance at the hearing and the absence of any objection at the hearing to the adequacy of that notice. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">We also find no merit in Roach\u2019s assertion that his mother\u2019s exclusion from the courtroom as a potential witness eliminated the substantive protection of the notice requirement because she was not able to be present with Roach at the hearing and provide him guidance. The mother was excluded from the hearing on the motion of Roach\u2019s counsel without any suggestion that her dual role as parent and potential witness required that she be allowed to remain in the courtroom. Thus, her absence from the courtroom during the hearing was attributable only to Roach, and not to the juvenile court or the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We next address Roach\u2019s contention that the May 13, 1994 order did not result in a valid transfer of Roach\u2019s cases to the circuit court, and that the transfer actually occurred at the July 22, 1994 hearing in the juvenile court, of which Roach\u2019s parents were not given notice. Contrary to Roach\u2019s assertion, the May 13, 1994 order demonstrates that the juvenile court made the findings required by statute for the jurisdictional transfer. Former Code \u00a7 16.1-269 did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>require the juvenile court to state the basis for its probable cause determination. Thus, the juvenile court was not required to include in its order a specific ruling on the admissibility of Roach\u2019s confession. <em>See </em>former Code \u00a7 16.1-269(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">On Roach\u2019s appeal from the May 13, 1994 order, the circuit court initiated its compliance review under former Code \u00a7 16.1-269(A)(3). At a June 16, 1994 hearing, the circuit court considered the sufficiency of the evidence of probable cause to show that Roach committed the charged offenses. This review of the juvenile court\u2019s probable cause determination was contrary to the directive of former Code \u00a7 16.1-269(E), which provided in relevant part that on a juvenile\u2019s appeal of a transfer decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">The circuit court shall, within a reasonable time after receipt of the case from the juvenile court, (i) examine all such papers, reports and orders and (ii) conduct a hearing to take further evidence on the issue of transfer, to determine if there has been compliance with this section, <em>but without redetermining whether the juvenile court had sufficient evidence to find probable cause, </em>and enter an order either remanding the case to the juvenile court or advising the attorney for the Commonwealth that he may seek an indictment. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">A court has only such jurisdiction as is granted to it by statute or by the Constitution. <em>Morrison v. Bestler, </em>239 Va. 166, 169, 387 S.E.2d 753, 755 (1990); <em>County School Bd. </em>v. <em>Snead, </em>198 Va. 100, 104-05, 92 S.E.2d 497, 501 (1956); <em>Humphreys v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 765, 772, 43 S.E.2d 890, 894 (1947). In granting the circuit court subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether the juvenile court complied with the transfer requirements of former Code \u00a7 16.1-269, the legislature expressly excluded from that authority any substantive review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding of probable cause. The juvenile court\u2019s order of May 13, 1994, showed on its face that the juvenile court found probable cause to believe that Roach committed the charged offenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, in conducting its compliance review of Roach\u2019s transfer, the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>had no authority to review this aspect of the juvenile court\u2019s transfer decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Because the circuit court exceeded its jurisdiction in ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding of probable cause, the July 5, 1994 order purporting to remand the issue of the admissibility of Roach\u2019s statement was void. <em>See Parrish v. Jessee, </em>250 Va. 514, 520-21, 464 S.E.2d 141, 145 (1995); <em>Morrison, </em>239 Va. at 170, 387 S.E.2d at 755-56; <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 143, 145, 207 S.E.2d 833, 835-56 (1974); <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>198 Va. 148, 151, 93 S.E.2d 130, 132 (1956). Thus, the proceedings in the juvenile court based on that order were a nullity, and the juvenile court\u2019s July 22, 1994 order also was void. <em>See Parrish, </em>250 Va. at 520, 464 S.E.2d at 145; <em>Morrison, </em>239 Va. at 170, 387 S.E.2d at 755-56; <em>New York, Philadelphia &amp; Norfolk R.R. Ferry Co. v. Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 428, 432, 83 S.E.2d 782, 784 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s effective consent to remand the issue of the admissibility of Roach\u2019s statement to the juvenile court does not alter this result because neither consent of the parties, nor waiver, can confer subject matter jurisdiction on a court. <em>Morrison, </em>239 Va. at 169-70, 387 S.E.2d at 755; <em>Brown, </em>215 Va. at 145, 207 S.E.2d at 836; <em>Snead, </em>198 Va. at 105, 92 S.E.2d at 501; <em>Humphreys, </em>186 Va. at 772-73, 43 S.E.2d at 894. Therefore, because the proceedings in the juvenile court on July 22, 1994, were a nullity and, thus, had no legal effect, the Commonwealth was not required to notify Roach\u2019s parents of that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">When Roach appeared in the circuit court with his parents and counsel on September 1, 1994, for review of the transfer decision, the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the transfer decision under former Code \u00a7 16.1-269 and the juvenile court\u2019s May 13, 1994 transfer order. Thus, the circuit court\u2019s order of September 1, 1994, which authorized the Commonwealth to seek an indictment in the case, confirmed the juvenile court\u2019s transfer decision and completed the jurisdictional transfer of Roach\u2019s offenses to the circuit court in compliance with the provisions of former Code \u00a7 16.1-269. We conclude, therefore, that the statutory notice requirements for a transfer hearing, recognized by this Court in <em>Baker, </em>were fully satisfied in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">For these reasons, we will deny Roach\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-11\"> Roach raised the same claims in a petition for writ of coram vobis filed in the circuit court. That court denied his petition by order dated July 30, 1999. Roach\u2019s appeal of the circuit court order is pending in this Court and has been consolidated with this habeas corpus proceeding. <em>See Roach </em>v. <em>Commonwealth of Virginia, </em>Record. No. 991817. We will decide the coram vobis appeal separately by order and, for reasons not germane to this appeal, we will affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\"> Effective July 1, 1994, the statutes governing the transfer of juveniles were repealed and replaced with new statutes. <em>See </em>1994 Va. Acts of Assembly, ch. 859 and ch. 949.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> Roach\u2019s argument that the juvenile court failed to make this probable cause determination is without merit, because the argument is based on Roach\u2019s unsupported allegation that the court failed to decide the admissibility of his statement in the week after the transfer hearing before entering the May 13, 1994 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
