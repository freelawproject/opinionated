LUA filed a motion for judgment against Dave\u2019s Cabinet in the circuit court and sought a judgment for an alleged balance due and owing for insurance premiums. Dave\u2019s Cabinet answered the motion for judgment and also filed a counterclaim against LUA.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">In the counterclaim, Dave\u2019s Cabinet asserted that LUA committed fraud by falsely representing that it could provide a savings in premium costs if Dave\u2019s Cabinet purchased its workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage from LUA. Dave\u2019s Cabinet further alleged that LUA knew, or should have known, that its policy of requiring Dave\u2019s Cabinet to report all workers\u2019 compensation claims, even those involving only minor injuries, would substantially increase the amount of premiums that Dave\u2019s Cabinet would pay for workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">The motion for judgment and counterclaim proceeded to trial by jury. After hearing evidence, the jury returned a verdict in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>LUA against Dave\u2019s Cabinet in the amount of $10,660. The jury also returned a verdict in favor of Dave\u2019s Cabinet on its counterclaim against LUA in the amount of $60,000. The circuit court entered judgment on both jury verdicts but reduced the amount of the judgment in favor of Dave\u2019s Cabinet to $42,000, which is the amount Dave\u2019s Cabinet had requested in the <em>ad damnum </em>clause of its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">We awarded LUA this appeal on two issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> LUA first asserts that the circuit court erred by refusing to set aside the jury verdict in favor of Dave\u2019s Cabinet because that verdict is inconsistent with the one in favor of LUA. Second, LUA contends that the circuit court erred by refusing to strike the evidence with regard to the counterclaim, and also in declining to set aside the verdict on that claim, because Dave\u2019s Cabinet failed to prove the elements of constructive fraud as a matter of law. Because we agree with LUA\u2019s second argument, we do not need to address the question whether the verdicts are inconsistent. Therefore, we will reverse, in part, the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Dave\u2019s Cabinet, which is located in Chesapeake, manufactures kitchen cabinets and cabinet moldings, and also performs mill work. The two owners of the company, David Alderman and David Boone, met a representative of LUA at an industry trade show. As a result of that meeting, Rob Robertson, a district manager for LUA, and Keith Wright, a LUA claims adjuster, visited the office of Dave\u2019s Cabinet to discuss the terms of LUA\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. At trial, Alderman testified that, during that meeting, Robertson stated that LUA worked exclusively with woodworking facilities and that LUA\u2019s knowledge of the industry would enable Dave\u2019s Cabinet to save money by implementing loss control procedures that would eventually reduce the amount of premiums that Dave\u2019s Cabinet would pay for workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">LUA then sent a plant engineer to inspect the facility at Dave\u2019s Cabinet. As a result of that inspection, LUA recommended changes in the manner in which Dave\u2019s Cabinet handled workers\u2019 compensation claims involving minor injuries. As Alderman had explained to Robertson, Dave\u2019s Cabinet had previously treated minor injuries \u201cin-house\u201d with appropriate first aid. For example, the company\u2019s prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>tice had been to remove splinters, clean and bandage small cuts, apply ice to mashed toes, wash sawdust out of eyes, and then allow employees with these injuries to return to work. Dave\u2019s Cabinet sent only those employees who sustained more serious injuries to a doctor or hospital for treatment. According to Alderman, Robertson stated that LUA wanted Dave\u2019s Cabinet to send all employees who suffered injuries at work to the hospital for treatment because of LUA\u2019s concerns about future liability and third-party verification. In other words, Dave\u2019s Cabinet was advised to report all injuries, including \u201csplinters, nicks, cuts, [and] mashed fingers,\u201d to LUA. Wright likewise advised Alderman that Dave\u2019s Cabinet was required to file a claim even if a \u201cBand-aid\u201d would take care of an employee\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Alderman, on behalf of Dave\u2019s Cabinet, entered into a \u201cSubscriber Agreement\u201d with LUA in May 1988. The subsequent \u201cWorkers Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance Policy\u201d that LUA issued to Dave\u2019s Cabinet required Dave\u2019s Cabinet to \u201c[pjrovide for immediate medical and other services required by the workers compensation law\u201d and to advise LUA \u201cat once if injury occurs that may be covered by this policy.\u201d According to Alderman, Robertson conceded that this policy requirement \u201cwould cost ... a little bit more money up front,\u201d but insisted that it would save Dave\u2019s Cabinet money in the long run.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">However, Dave\u2019s Cabinet experienced the opposite result. According to Alderman, LUA\u2019s requirement with regard to reporting and treating all workers\u2019 compensation claims did not effect a reduction in the amount of its premiums for workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage. Instead, it caused the company\u2019s \u201cexperience modification\u201d to increase significantly. That increase in the \u201cexperience mod\u201d resulted in higher insurance premiums for Dave\u2019s Cabinet.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Auz\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The standard of appellate review applicable to this appeal is well settled. As the party coming to this Court with a jury verdict that the circuit court approved, Dave\u2019s Cabinet \u201c \u2018occupies the most favored position known to the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ravenwood Towers, Inc. v. Woodyard, </em>244 Va. 51, 57, 419 S.E.2d 627, 630 (1992) (quoting <em>Pugsley </em>v. <em>Privette, 220 </em>Va. 892, 901, 263 S.E.2d 69, 76 (1980)). \u201cA trial court\u2019s judgment is presumed to be correct, and on appeal, we must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>therefrom in the light most favorable to the prevailing party at trial.\u201d <em>Evaluation Research Corp. v. Alequin, </em>247 Va. 143, 147, 439 S.E.2d 387, 390 (1994). When applying this standard, an appellate court must, however, set aside a judgment if it is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147-48, 439 S.E.2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">B. Fraud Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In support of its claim for fraud, Dave\u2019s Cabinet contends that LUA made two misrepresentations upon which Dave\u2019s Cabinet relied to its detriment. The first misrepresentation focused on the LUA policy requiring Dave\u2019s Cabinet to report all work-related injuries regardless of their severity and to send all employees with injuries to a hospital for medical care rather than treating employees with only minor injuries \u201cin-house\u201d with appropriate first aid. The second misrepresentation concerned the statement by LUA, through its representative, that LUA\u2019s policy would eventually save Dave\u2019s Cabinet money by lowering the amount of its premiums for workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage. We conclude that neither of these alleged misrepresentations can form the basis of an action for constructive fraud.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The elements of a cause of action for constructive fraud are \u201ca showing by clear and convincing evidence that a false representation of a material fact was made innocently or negligently, and the injured party was damaged as a result of his reliance upon the misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Mortarino </em>v. <em>Consultant Eng\u2019g Servs., </em>251 Va. 289, 295, 467 S.E.2d 778, 782 (1996). Robertson\u2019s and Wright\u2019s statements that LUA wanted Dave\u2019s Cabinet to report even minor work-related injuries and to have employees who sustained such injuries treated at a hospital were not misrepresentations of a material fact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They were, instead, statements regarding LUA\u2019s policy requirement. Although Dave\u2019s Cabinet did not agree with the requirement since it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>constituted a departure from its prior practice and eventually resulted in higher premiums for its workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage, LUA fully disclosed its required procedure for reporting and treating all workers\u2019 compensation claims, and Dave\u2019s Cabinet knew about and accepted that procedure when it purchased coverage from LUA. Consequently, Dave\u2019s Cabinet failed to prove an essential element of a claim for constructive fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">With regard to the second alleged misrepresentation, we recognize that Dave\u2019s Cabinet did not experience any reduction in the amount of its premiums for workers\u2019 compensation insurance but, in fact, incurred increased premiums. Nevertheless, Robertson\u2019s statement that LUA\u2019s policy requirement for reporting and treating all work-related injuries would eventually reduce the cost of workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage for Dave\u2019s Cabinet was merely an unfulfilled promise as to a future event and not a statement concerning an existing or pre-existing fact. \u201c \u2018[Fjraud must relate to a present or a pre-existing fact, and cannot ordinarily be predicated on unfulfilled promises or statements as to future events.\u2019 \u201d <em>Patrick </em>v. <em>Summers, </em>235 Va. 452, 454, 369 S.E.2d 162, 164 (1988) (quoting <em>Soble </em>v. <em>Herman, </em>175 Va. 489, 500, 9 S.E.2d 459, 464 (1940)). <em>See ITT Hartford Group, Inc. v. Virginia Fin. Assoc., Inc., </em>258 Va. 193, 203, 520 S.E.2d 355, 361 (1999), decided today. Thus, the statement cannot serve as the basis of a claim for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">For these reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court with regard to the counterclaim filed by Dave\u2019s Cabinet and enter judgment here in favor of LUA on that counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>Reversed in part and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\"> Dave\u2019s Cabinet did not assign cross-error with regard to the judgment entered against it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\"> Although the circuit court instructed the jury in this case with regard to both actual and constructive fraud, the court specifically overruled LUA\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict on the counterclaim, and entered judgment on that verdict, on the basis that the evidence supported a claim for constructive fraud. Dave\u2019s Cabinet did not assign cross-error to the court\u2019s failure to sustain the verdict in its favor on the grounds that the evidence also supported a claim for actual fraud. <em>See </em>Rule 5:17(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\"> The circuit court instructed the jury that Virginia law requires an employer to keep a record of all injuries occurring in the course of employment and that a report of injuries shall be made and transmitted to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission by the employer, its representative, or the insurance carrier for an insured employer. This instruction is a correct statement of the provisions contained in Code \u00a7 65.2-900(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
