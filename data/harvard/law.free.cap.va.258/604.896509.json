The principal issue raised by five of six assignments of error is whether, as Cochran contends, the trial court erred in overruling his motion \u201cto suppress the evidence of PCP because it was obtained as a result of an unreasonable seizure of his person in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Confirming the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court sentenced Cochran to a term of seven years in the penitentiary and a fine of $10,000.00. The Court of Appeals granted Cochran\u2019s appeal limited to the principal issue. On January 26, 1993, two of the three members of a panel of that Court reversed the conviction on the ground that \u201cappellant discarded the PCP while subject to an illegal seizure\u201d. <em>Cochran v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va. App. 619, 624, 426 S.E.2d 144, 147 (1993). The panel denied the Commonwealth\u2019s request for a rehearing, but by order entered February 25, 1993, the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Appeals granted a petition for rehearing en banc and stayed the mandate. By order entered July 13, 1993, an equally divided court sitting en banc affirmed the judgment of the trial court, withdrew the opinion of the three-judge panel, and vacated the mandate dated January 26, 1993. By order entered October 2, 1998 in response to Cochran\u2019s <em>habeas corpus </em>petition, this Court awarded Cochran leave to petition for appeal. We granted his petition by order entered April 22, 1999. Finding no error in the decision of die Court of Appeals sitting en banc, we will affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">First, we consider Cochran\u2019s sixth assignment of error concerning appellate procedure. Cochran argues on brief that the Court of Appeals \u201cerred in reversing the judgment of a panel . . . because a majority of the judges sitting en banc did not vote to reverse the judgment of the panel\u201d. Cochran relies upon Code \u00a7 17-116.02 (now recodified as \u00a7 17.1-402) which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">(D) . . . . The Court sitting en banc shall consider and decide the case and may overrule any previous decision by any panel or of the full Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">(E) . ... In all cases decided by the Court en banc, the concurrence of at least a majority of the judges sitting shall be required to reverse a judgment, in whole or in part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The language chosen by the General Assembly is plain. The \u201cjudgment\u201d subject to <em>reversal </em>\u201cin whole or in part\u201d by a majority of the Court sitting en banc includes the judgment entered by the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, absent a majority vote of the Court of Appeals sitting en banc <em>reversing </em>the judgment of the trial court, that judgment is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">This Court has reviewed both civil and criminal cases in which the Court of Appeals has applied that interpretation of the statute. <em>See, e.g., White </em>v. <em>White, </em>257 Va. 139, 143-144, 509 S.E.2d 323, 325 (1999); <em>Granados </em>v. <em>Windson Development Corp., </em>257 Va. 103, 106, 509 S.E.2d 290, 291 (1999); <em>Husske v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 203, 206, 476 S.E.2d 920, 921-22 (1996), <em>cert, denied, </em>519 U.S. 1154 (1997); <em>Lockhart v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 184, 184, 466 S.E.2d 740, 740 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The decisions of an equally divided Court of Appeals sitting en banc and applying that interpretation include <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>wealth, </em>28 Va. App. 562, 507 S.E.2d 625 (1998) (en banc); <em>Hebden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>26 Va. App. 727, 496 S.E.2d 169 (1998) (en banc); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>24 Va. App. 1, 480 S.E.2d 112 (1997) (en banc), <em>cert, </em>denied,_U.S._,118 S.Ct. 1073 (1998); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Extra\u2019s, Inc., </em>15 Va. App. 648, 427 S.E.2d 197 (1993) (en banc); <em>McIntosh v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va. App. 314, 399 S.E.2d 27 (1990) (en banc); <em>Diehl </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 139, 390 S.E.2d 550 (1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">In the face of these decisions, the General Assembly has not rejected or modified judicial interpretation of the statute in issue. \u201cUnder these circumstances, the construction given to the statute is presumed to be sanctioned by the legislature and therefore becomes obligatory upon the courts.\u201d <em>Vansant and Gusler, Inc. v. Washington, </em>245 Va. 356, 361, 429 S.E.2d 31, 33-34 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Overruling the assignment of procedural error, we turn to the principal question in issue. There is no consequential dispute in the facts relevant to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Deputy Sheriff Earl D. Chewning, Jr., on patrol in a marked car, was dispatched to a parking lot to meet an unknown person who had called concerning recovery of stolen property. When Chewning arrived at the lot that night, he noticed a car parked near a public telephone booth. The parking lot was well lighted, and Chewning could see the driver standing outside the car and two persons seated inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Chewning asked the driver if anyone had called the sheriff\u2019s department. Before he received a response, Cochran, the front seat passenger, started to get out of the car. Chewning asked Cochran to remain in the car while he \u201ctalked to the driver.\u201d The deputy sheriff testified that he did so \u201c[f]or my safety, because I didn\u2019t know exactly what was going on at that time.\u201d Cochran complied, and Chewning escorted the driver to the rear of the vehicle where he had a better view of the two passengers. As Chewning was talking with the driver, Cochran again opened the door of the car. Chewning instructed him to remain in the car, he complied, and Chewning resumed his conversation with the driver. Almost immediately, Cochran began to get out of the car again.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Chewning testified that \u201c[a]s he got out of the vehicle, he shoved a bluish colored bag up underneath the car and started back towards me.\u201d Chewning twice asked for Cochran\u2019s name, but Cochran\u2019s only response was \u201currrrr, like that.\u201d Cochran was \u201cvery wobbly on his feet, his eyes were very watery and red, and his speech was very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>slurred.\u201d Chewning asked Cochran \u201cto turn around and place his hands on top of the roof of the car.\u201d Chewning conducted a \u201cpat down\u201d search for weapons. Finding none, he retrieved the blue bag. Inside, he found three small plastic bags and a film canister. Each contained a strong smelling substance which Chewning recognized as likely to be illegal drugs. He placed Cochran under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621 (1991) and its progeny, including this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Woodson v. Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 401, 429 S.E.2d 27 (1993), the Commonwealth contends that the trial court correctly found that Cochran \u201cabandoned the bag containing the illegal drugs prior to any seizure of his person.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">As this Court made clear in <em>Woodson, </em>it must first be determined \u201cwhen [the defendant] was \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404, 429 S.E.2d at 29. \u201c[A] person has been \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980). This test is not applicable until the person submits to the officer\u2019s show of authority. <em>Woodson, </em>245 Va. at 404-05, 429 S.E.2d at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In our view, as evidenced by Cochran\u2019s repeated attempts to get out of the car, he did not submit to Deputy Chewning\u2019s authority until <em>after </em>he had attempted to hide the bag under the car, Chewning had identified its contents, and Cochran had been searched for weapons and placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Finding no merit in the assignments of error, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-12\"> The Amendment provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-11\"><em> </em>The panel decision was not a judgment because \u201cthe clerk of the Court of Appeals [had not forwarded] its mandate ... to the clerk of the trial court\u201d as required by Rule 5A:31.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
