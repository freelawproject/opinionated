App. 306, 504 S.E.2d 394 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">Central to the decision below was the interpretation of Code \u00a7 16.1-263(A), which provides, in part, that after a juvenile petition is filed, the court shall direct summonses \u201cto the parents\u201d of the juvenile. Here, even though the juvenile\u2019s mother received notice, the juvenile\u2019s biological father was not notified, there was no attempt to give him notice, and the circuit court made no certification on the record that the identity of the father was not reasonably ascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">Parenthetically, we note the statute has been amended effective July 1, 1999 to provide for notice to \u201cat least one parent.\u201d Acts 1999, ch. 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-10\">For the reasons set forth in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, we will affirm the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-11\">Furthermore, we decline the Attorney General\u2019s request that we apply this judgment prospectively only; retrospective application is mandated by <em>Gogley v. Peyton, </em>208 Va. 679, 160 S.E.2d 746 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b22-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
