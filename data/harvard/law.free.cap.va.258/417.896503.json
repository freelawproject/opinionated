She also filed common law claims against Crate, but those claims are not pertinent to our resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Prior to trial, the three school officials were dismissed on summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial, Crate admitted liability. In returning verdicts against Crate and the school board, the jury awarded damages in the following sums: $43,000 in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive damages against Crate, and $250,000 in compensatory damages against the school board. Judgment was entered on the verdicts, and the school board appeals. Applying well-settled principles of appellate review, we will review the facts in the light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>most favorable to the plaintiff who is fortified with a jury verdict approved by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In 1988 and 1989, more than two years before the secret videotaping that precipitated the present litigation began, Crate videotaped a number of team members in various track uniforms with their knowledge and consent. During this period, 14-year-old Lakesha Coletrain, a team member, agreed to Crate\u2019s request that she remain after track practice to be videotaped in her track uniform for a portfolio Crate said he was preparing for each girl. After the other members of the team had left the school, Coletrain went with Crate to a remote area of the school building where Crate videotaped her in eight different track uniforms.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Each time Coletrain changed uniforms, she went into a classroom and closed the door. Crate asked Coletrain to remove her underpants to change into one uniform that was cut high in the pubic area because he said that the uniform did not look good with the underpants. During the videotaping session, Crate instructed Coletrain to stretch her legs on the floor and over a hurdle. He told her that if the stretching hurt, she could grunt because it would not be heard on the videotape since he would talk over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Upon Coletrain\u2019s return home, her parents questioned her about the videotaping session and learned that Coletrain had been alone with Crate during the three to four hour period in which he videotaped her. The next day, her father went to the school and demanded that Crate give him a copy of the tape, which Crate did the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Both parents viewed the tape and the father testified that the tape \u201clooked like it had just been spliced,\u201d and was \u201cabout a three-minute version\u201d of the taping session. He also testified that the tape showed his daughter in eight different track uniforms that looked like bathing suits, that she had her leg propped up as if she were jumping a hurdle, that the camera was \u201czooming in on her crotch, zoomed in on her rear,\u201d that he heard Crate\u2019s voice in the background encouraging her to stretch her legs while in a stretching pose, and that Crate was also doing \u201ca lot [of] moaning and groaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Upon hearing the Coletrains\u2019 complaint about the tape and Crate\u2019s conduct the next day, the superintendent of schools ordered Judith Kirman, the high school principal, to conduct an investigation to ascertain whether Crate had done anything objectionable or inappropriate. Crate furnished copies of the videotapes to Kirman and the school officials who assisted in the investigation. The investigators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>viewed a copy of each track member\u2019s tape during their separate interviews with most of the team members and their parents or guardians.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">Although the Coletrains and another parent thought that Crate\u2019s actions were inappropriate, other parents did not. Kirman and the other school officials concluded that Crate had done nothing objectionable or inappropriate. In accordance with the school policy of \u201cprogressive discipline,\u201d no record of the incident was kept in Crate\u2019s personnel file because it was the first complaint against Crate and, upon investigation, it had been found to be groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Nevertheless, upon terminating the investigation, Kirman ordered Crate to modify his past practices by (1) confining the videotaping of team members to \u201ctrack meets when the girls were running,\u201d (2) taking a female chaperone to out-of-school-district track meets, and (3) refraining from driving team members home in his car after track practices. Although Crate violated the second and third orders on one or more occasions, there was no evidence that anyone was aware of his violation of the first order until the 1995 discovery of the secret videotaping.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">It was then discovered that, beginning in late 1991 or early 1992, Crate had concealed one of the school\u2019s video cameras in a storage room adjoining the women\u2019s locker room. He used the camera to secretly videotape track members, including the plaintiff, changing their clothes. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment claims that Crate\u2019s actions were in violation of her \u201cconstitutional right to bodily security and integrity to be free from unjustified intrusions on her personal security, and to personal privacy.\u201d The plaintiff also alleged that the school board had knowledge of Crate\u2019s activity and of his \u201cpropensity to behave inappropriately towards the students under his direction and control based on prior complaints,\u201d yet \u201cmade and enforced a policy of allowing defendant Crate to continue his inappropriate behaviors by failing to take immediate and decisive action to end such conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The school board has raised a number of questions on appeal, but we find dispositive issues concerning the school board\u2019s alleged violation of its duty to the plaintiff under \u00a7 1983 and the causal connection of that violation to the deprivation of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights. The plaintiff claims, however, that we cannot reach these issues because the school board failed to raise them in the trial court. We disagree with that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The record shows that in its motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s evidence at trial, the school board cited <em>Commissioners of Bryan County v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397 (1997), and argued as follows: \u201cCongress did not intend to impose liability on a municipality unless deliberate action attributable to [the] municipality itself is a moving force behind the plaintiff\u2019s deprivation of federal rights. . . . [I]t must be deliberate indifference on behalf of the school officials. . . . [T]he facts . . . cannot rise to the level of constituting an official policy of the School Board and a causal connection to a federal violation of the plaintiff\u2019s Constitutional rights. . . . There\u2019s been no deliberate indifference shown by anyone.\u201d We think these statements were sufficient to preserve for appeal the issues we find dispositive, and we will proceed to the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The right of action advanced by the plaintiff arises under a federal statute. Therefore, we apply federal jurisprudence in determining her rights. <em>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation </em>v. <em>Mapp\u2019s Ex\u2019r, </em>184 Va. 970, 974, 37 S.E.2d 23, 24 (1946); <em>Southern Ry. </em>v. <em>Wilmouth, </em>154 Va. 582, 589, 153 S.E. 874, 876 (1930). Although \u201cmunicipalities and other local governmental bodies are \u2018persons\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1983,\u201d a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must show that the governmental body itself \u201ccaused\u201d the deprivation of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Bryan County, </em>520 U.S. at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim is that the school board\u2019s facially lawful decision to retain Crate as a teacher after the Kirman investigation and not to take special precautions to prevent future improper conduct by him caused a violation of her constitutional rights. She relies primarily upon the 1988-89 videotaping of team members, the school\u2019s \u201cprogressive discipline\u201d policy, its allegedly inadequate investigation of those incidents, and its conduct following the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The school board responds that, as a matter of law, these matters of Crate\u2019s conduct prior to the secret videotaping were insufficient to establish the necessary violation of a duty to the plaintiff and a causal connection between the board\u2019s conduct and the subsequent deprivation of the plaintiff\u2019s federal rights. We agree with the school board.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">In <em>Bryan County, </em>a sheriff\u2019s facially lawful decision to hire a deputy sheriff without proper investigation of his background was claimed to have caused a violation of the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>when the deputy sheriff assaulted her upon her arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 520 U.S. at 399-400. In reversing the lower courts\u2019 affirmation of a jury\u2019s verdict against the county for such alleged violations, the Court noted that \u00a7 1983 does not impose liability on a county under traditional employer-employee relationships with an employee tortfeasor. Instead,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">[a] plaintiff must also demonstrate that, through its <em>deliberate </em>conduct, the municipality was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the injury alleged. That is, a plaintiff must show that the municipal action was taken with the requisite degree of culpability and <em>must demonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">520 U.S. at 404 (second emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Thus, although a governmental body may have been negligent in regard to the plaintiff\u2019s federal rights, in order to show that it \u201ccaused\u201d the violation of those rights, \u201c[a] plaintiff must demonstrate that [the governmental] decision reflects <em>deliberate </em>indifference to the risk that a violation of a particular constitutional or statutory right will follow the decision.\u201d 520 U.S. at 411. And, the required \u201c \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 is a stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.\u201d 520 U.S. at 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Reasonable persons might conclude that Crate should have been discharged or more carefully monitored after the Kirman investigation. However, in our opinion, the evidence is insufficient to support a conclusion by reasonable persons that the above-described school board actions reflected the required deliberate indifference to the risk that he would violate the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 rights in the manner alleged. Therefore, we hold, as a matter of law, that the school board did not cause the violation of the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court against the school board and enter final judgment here for the school board.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-12\"> Apparently, those three officials were not in office at the time of the acts giving rise to the alleged \u00a7 1983 liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b443-10\"> Bryan County stipulated that the sheriff was the final \u201cdecisionmaker\u201d for the county in the hiring matter. As such, the Court held that his actions fairly could have been treated as actions of the county. <em>Bryan County, </em>520 U.S. at 403-04.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
