The minority stockholder of the corporation has attacked the propriety of the transaction, primarily on the grounds that the corporation\u2019s directors, who were also its majority stockholders, breached their statutory and common law duties by failing to maximize the sales price, by authorizing a transaction in which they had a conflict of interests, and by failing to comply with the statutory procedures for selling the assets of a corporation, not in the ordinary course of business. Finding no error, we will affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment upholding the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">FACTS AND MATERIAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">In 1978, Ronald L. Willard and Cappellari, Inc. (Cappellari), acquired a building supply business located in Bedford County. Cappellari was a West Virginia corporation owned primarily by Amerigo S. (A.S.) and Rose Mary Cappellari. The purchasers incorporated the newly acquired business in Virginia under the name of Moneta Building Supply, Inc. (Moneta). Willard purchased 20 percent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>shares of stock issued in Moneta, and Cappellari purchased 80 percent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In 1986, A.S. and Rose Mary dissolved Cappellari and distributed its shares of Moneta stock in the following proportions: A.S. received 253 shares (49.8 percent), Rose Mary received 129 shares (25.4 percent), and David Lawrence Cappellari, the son of A.S. and Rose Mary, received 18 shares.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Willard owned the remaining 100 shares (19.7 percent) of Moneta stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">David served as president, director, and manager of Moneta from its inception until he resigned from those positions in 1996. Willard was Moneta\u2019s only other officer and director during those initial years until A.S. and Rose Mary dissolved Cappellari. Then, A.S. and Rose Mary, both of whom had lived in West Virginia and had participated very little in the operation or management of Moneta, moved to Virginia and eventually became officers and directors of the corporation along with David and Willard.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">No one disputes that Moneta experienced success in the building supply industry and achieved annual sales in excess of four million dollars by 1990. However, David became increasingly concerned about his future at Moneta because of a December 1, 1978 \u201cStock Purchase Agreement\u201d entered into among Moneta, Cappellari, and the Willards. That agreement granted each of Moneta\u2019s stockholders a right of first refusal in the event that any one of the other stockholders desired to dispose of shares of Moneta stock. David was dissatisfied with his percentage of ownership interest in Moneta and his inability to acquire additional shares from his parents due to the \u201cStock Purchase Agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Consequently, David began developing a business plan to start his own building supply company. On September 18, 1996, David resigned from his positions as an officer and director of Moneta. At an October 3, 1996 meeting of the Moneta board of directors, the board accepted David\u2019s resignation and elected A.S. as president of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Moneta, Rose Mary as vice-president, and Willard as treasurer. The board also decided to continue Moneta\u2019s operations and to retain David as the interim manager while the board searched for a new manager.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">On October 7, 1996, Willard called a special meeting of the stockholders. At that meeting, Willard offered to sell his shares of stock in Moneta for one million dollars. No action was taken on Willard\u2019s offer. During the meeting, David informed the stockholders that he might be interested in purchasing Moneta\u2019s assets, depending on what direction the company decided to take. When Willard was asked whether he might also be interested in purchasing the assets, he indicated that he was not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Subsequent to the meeting, Willard tendered a letter of resignation as a director and officer of Moneta. He cited \u201ccontinuing oppression and unfair treatment\u201d as the reasons for his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">After David\u2019s resignation from Moneta, he pursued his plans to open a building supply business. He incorporated a new company under the name of Capps Home &amp; Building Supply, Inc. (Capps). On October 8, 1996, David entered into a \u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d with Moneta for the \u201cexchange of certain information pertaining to [Moneta] and ... the acquisition of certain assets of [Moneta] by [David].\u201d A.S. executed the agreement in his capacity as president of Moneta.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">These events prompted Willard to file a suit seeking the dissolution of Moneta and a preliminary injunction to enjoin any Moneta stockholder from competing with Moneta until the corporation could be dissolved and the assets liquidated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The circuit court heard evidence and argument on October 24, 1996, and denied the requested injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">On November 15, 1996, Capps, through its counsel, submitted a proposed \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d to A.S. and Rose Mary, in their capacities as directors and officers of Moneta. In the agreement, Capps offered to purchase the assets of Moneta for approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>$1.3 million. The offer would expire, however, if not accepted by November 23, 1996. Capps also informed A.S. and Rose Mary that David had acquired bank financing to provide the necessary funds if the proposed agreement received the approval of Moneta\u2019s board of directors and stockholders. Finally, Capps included a valuation of Moneta\u2019s assets with the agreement. Hope Player and Associates, P.C., had prepared a valuation report (the Player report) for Capps and, in that report, opined that the fair market value of Moneta\u2019s assets as of September 30, 1996, was $1.3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">On November 19, 1996, A.S. and Rose Mary, as the only remaining members of Moneta\u2019s board of directors, held a special meeting of the board at their home to consider the offer from Capps. The board \u201cvoted unanimously to accept the offer and directed] the President to sign the Asset Purchase Agreement. . . reserving the right to negotiate the Seller\u2019s Representations contained in paragraph 4 of the . . . Agreement, and any other matters of concern to the shareholders.\u201d The board also voted to hire an independent certified public accountant or other valuation expert to evaluate whether the amount of the Capps offer reflected the fair market value of Moneta\u2019s assets. Finally, the board decided to refer the proposed transaction to the stockholders without any recommendation from the directors and to call a special meeting of the stockholders to be held on December 20, 1996, for the purpose of voting on the offer from Capps.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">On November 21, 1996, Capps submitted a revised \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d to Moneta. In exchange for a reduction in the purchase price of approximately $150,000, Capps agreed to assume certain liabilities of Moneta. A.S. signed the revised agreement as president of Moneta without first presenting the changes to the board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">A.S. then sent a notice to all Moneta stockholders advising them that a special meeting would be held on December 20 for the purpose of considering and voting upon the offer from Capps. The notice included a disclosure concerning the familial relationship among A.S., Rose Mary, and David, and copies of the revised \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d and the Player report.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">After receiving notice of the December 20 special meeting, Willard sent a letter, dated December 10, 1996, to A.S. and Rose Mary informing them that he believed that Capps\u2019 offer was too low and that it did not \u201cadequately reflect fair value.\u201d In that letter, Willard offered to purchase Moneta\u2019s assets for $400,000 more than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>amount Capps had offered. However, Willard stipulated that his offer was good only until 3:00 p.m. on December 13, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In a letter dated December 13, 1996, A.S. advised Willard that he and Rose Mary believed that it would be inappropriate for the board to consider his offer prior to the stockholders\u2019 meeting on December 20. Since Willard\u2019s offer specified that it would expire on December 13, A.S. encouraged Willard to come to the stockholders\u2019 meeting and present his offer at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">One day before the special meeting of the stockholders, Willard sent a second letter to A.S. and Rose Mary. In that letter, Willard increased his offer to $600,000 more than the amount offered by Capps. Willard also requested 30 days in which to evaluate the assets and determine if an even higher purchase price was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">As authorized by the board of directors, Moneta obtained an opinion from Dr. Larry A. Lynch, a business valuation expert, with regard to whether the amount of Capps\u2019 offer reflected the fair market value of Moneta\u2019s assets. In a report dated December 12, 1996, Dr. Lynch stated that the value of Moneta\u2019s assets ranged from $1,357,531 to $1,449,746, depending on the valuation method utilized. He concluded that Capps\u2019 offer of $1.3 million was fair and reasonable upon taking into consideration the fact that the \u201cgoing concern assumption may be affected by the loss of key personnel and pending litigation.\u201d A copy of Dr. Lynch\u2019s report was forwarded to the stockholders prior to the special meeting on December 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The stockholders\u2019 special meeting proceeded as called on December 20, 1996.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A.S., David, and Willard were in attendance. Rose Mary did not attend, but she had given A.S. her proxy for the purpose of voting her shares of stock.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> All parties in attendance were represented by legal counsel. At the meeting, A.S. informed the other stockholders about the recent offers tendered by Willard, including Willard\u2019s offer to sell his shares of stock in Moneta. A.S. advised Willard that he and Rose Mary would sell their stock for the same price per share, but Willard did not respond to that proposal. A.S. further stated \u201che would consider the best interest of the employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>of [Moneta] as well as other non-monetary factors including the business\u2019 customers, continuity of management and the realistic threat to [Moneta] from competition if the property were not sold to Capps.\u201d Willard noted his objections to the offer from Capps and reiterated that he had a counter-offer on the table. A.S. stated that the only item of business to be acted upon at the meeting was the offer from Capps. A.S. and Rose Mary, by proxy, then voted to accept the offer from Capps. Willard voted against the proposal, and David abstained from voting. Thus, a majority of Moneta\u2019s stockholders approved the revised \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">On April 23, 1997, Willard, on behalf of Moneta and all its stockholders, filed this shareholders\u2019 derivative suit pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.1-672.1 <em>et seq., </em>naming Moneta, A.S., Rose Mary, David, and Capps as defendants. In an amended bill of complaint, Willard sought to void the sale of Moneta\u2019s assets to Capps on the basis that the transaction violated the provisions of Code \u00a7 13.1-691 dealing with conflict of interests. He also requested an award of damages for breach of fiduciary duties, violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-499, and common law conspiracy; the imposition of a constructive trust over the income and assets of Capps; and an award of expenses, attorney\u2019s fees, and court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">During a bench trial, the circuit court heard testimony with regard to the facts already recited. In addition, the court received evidence from several experts who had appraised the value of Moneta\u2019s assets. These experts differed in their opinions with regard to the appropriate valuation method and the actual value of the assets. For example, Harry Schwarz testified that he valued the assets at $2,675,000 as of September 30, 1996, but acknowledged that he had not considered what effect, if any, David\u2019s leaving Moneta and opening his own building supply business would have on the value of the assets. Schwarz also included cash and securities in his valuation, but those assets were not sold to Capps.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Hope Player, who had prepared the Player report, testified that Moneta was surpassing its peers in terms of profitability. She attributed that accomplishment to David\u2019s superior management skills. Accordingly, she factored the effect of David\u2019s resignation into her valuation. Player also testified that, when comparing two offers to purchase, a prudent seller would take into consideration any contingencies associated with the offers, assuming that the buyers had equal motivation and ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Dr. Vittorio Bonomo, a professor of finance at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, opined that any amount over $800,000 was a fair price for Moneta\u2019s assets. Dr. Bonomo believed that, during the first seven years after David left Moneta and opened his own competing business, Moneta\u2019s annual profits would fall by an amount somewhere between $400,000 and $100,000, primarily for two reasons: Moneta would be splitting the market with another competitor and that competitor would have \u201ca good manager\u201d rather than just \u201ca norm manager.\u201d Thus, Dr. Bonomo opined that a director who was faced with the events that had occurred during the fall of 1996 would have to consider the subsequent financial consequences to Moneta if the Capps offer were not accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In a letter opinion dated May 14, 1998, the circuit court explained that \u201c[t]he wide discrepancy in valuation often depended upon the method utilized by the expert, and the extent to which the expert viewed, as a financial impact, the consequences of a competing business and the loss of key personnel.\u201d The testimony of Dr. Bonomo, Dr. Lynch, and Ms. Player was more persuasive to the court than that of the other experts. Finding that Willard had failed to present sufficient evidence to prove his claims, the circuit court dismissed each of the seven counts in his amended bill of complaint in an order dated June 4, 1998. We awarded Willard this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The standard of appellate review applicable to this appeal is well settled. Since the circuit court heard the evidence ore tenus, its factual findings carry the same weight as a jury\u2019s verdict. W.S. <em>Carnes, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors of Chesterfield County, </em>252 Va. 377, 385, 478 S.E.2d 295, 301 (1996). Under the provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-680, the circuit court\u2019s judgment cannot be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Thus, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants, the prevailing parties at trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">DIRECTOR\u2019S DISCHARGE OF DUTIES</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">In his first two assignments of error, Willard contends that the circuit court erred by ruling that A.S. and Rose Mary, as the only remaining directors of Moneta, did not have a duty to maximize the price received for the sale of Moneta\u2019s assets and by concluding that they discharged their duties in accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 13.1-690. Willard asks us to judge the directors\u2019 decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>sell Moneta\u2019s assets to Capps by the test articulated in <em>Revlon, Inc. </em>v. <em>MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings, Inc., </em>506 A.2d 173 (Del. 1986). The <em>Revlon </em>court held that the duty of a board of directors changed from one of preserving the corporate entity \u201cto the maximization of the company\u2019s value at a sale for the stockholders\u2019 benefit\u201d when it becomes apparent that the sale of the company is inevitable. <em>Id. </em>at 182. \u201cThe directors\u2019 role [in that instance] change[s] from defenders of the corporate bastion to auctioneers charged with getting the best price for the stockholders at a sale of the company.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">In addressing these issues, the circuit court found that A.S. and Rose Mary were not liable under Code \u00a7 13.1-690 because \u201c[t]he evidence . . . clearly demonstrate[d] that defendants A.S. Cappellari and Rose Mary Cappellari, as directors of [Moneta], engaged in an informed decision making process that . . . producefd] a defensible business decision.\u201d The court stated that \u00a7 13.1-690 does not require a director to maximize profits by accepting the highest bid when selling the assets of a corporation. Instead, a director is required to \u201cact in accordance with \u2018his good faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation.\u2019 \u201d The court further concluded that \u201c[a] director may consider not only the quantity of an offer to purchase assets, but the quality of the offer.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The General Assembly has mandated the standard by which to evaluate a director\u2019s discharge of duties in Virginia. The applicable statute is Code \u00a7 13.1-690:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">A. A director shall discharge his duties as a director, including his duties as a member of a committee, in accordance with his good faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">B. Unless he has knowledge or information concerning the matter in question that makes reliance unwarranted, a director is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">1. One or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director believes, in good faith, to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">2. Legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director believes, in good faith, are within the person\u2019s professional or expert competence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>3. A committee of the board of directors of which he is not a member if the director believes, in good faith, that the committee merits confidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">C. A director is not liable for any action taken as a director, or any failure to take any action, if he performed the duties of his office in compliance with this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">D. A person alleging a violation of this section has the burden of proving the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Code \u00a7 13.1-690(A) does not abrogate the common law duties of a director. It does, however, set the standard by which a director is to discharge those duties. If a director acts in accordance with that standard, Code \u00a7 13.1-690(C) provides a \u201csafe harbor\u201d that shields a director from liability for any action taken as a director, and for failure to take action. <em>Commonwealth Transp. Comm\u2019r v. Matyiko, </em>253 Va. 1, 6, 481 S.E.2d 468, 470 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In adopting Code \u00a7 13.1-690, the General Assembly rejected \u00a7 8.30 of the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA). <em>WLR Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>65 F.3d 1172, 1185 (4th Cir. 1995), <em>cert, denied, </em>516 U.S. 1117 (1996); The Revision of Chapters 1 and 2 of Title 13.1 of the Code of Virginia, Report of the Virginia Code Commission to the Governor and the General Assembly of Virginia, H. Doc. No. 13, at 48-49 (1985). That provision of the RMBCA requires a director to discharge the duties of the office in good faith, with the care that an ordinary prudent person in similar circumstances would exercise, and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The contrast between the provisions of Code \u00a7 13.1-690 and those contained in \u00a7 8.30 of the RMBCA convinces us that, in Virginia, a director\u2019s discharge of duties is not measured by what a reasonable person would do in similar circumstances or by the rationality of the ultimate decision. Instead, a director must act in accordance with his/her good faith business judgment of what is in the best interests of the corporation. Thus, the <em>Revlon </em>test is not applicable in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that A.S. and Rose Mary were entitled to consider the quantity and quality of the offers to purchase Moneta\u2019s assets.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Contrary to Willard\u2019s argument, they were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>required to accept an offer merely because it maximized the purchase price. Such a rule would mean that only one offer, among many, was in the best interests of the corporation. That result would erode the deference afforded a director\u2019s discharge of duties under Code \u00a7 13.1-690.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Turning to the facts of the present case, we agree with the circuit court\u2019s judgment that A.S. and Rose Mary engaged in an informed decision-making process. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 13.1-690(B), a director can rely on information and opinions from, <em>inter alia, </em>legal counsel, accountants, and other experts unless the director has knowledge that such reliance is unwarranted. Thus, a director may use an informed decision-making process in discharging the duties of the office as long as the director does so in good faith. <em>See WLR Foods, </em>65 F.3d at 1185. When a director resorts to such a process, the ultimate decision must still reflect the director\u2019s \u201cgood faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation\u201d in order to receive the benefit of the \u201csafe harbor\u201d afforded in Code \u00a7 13.1-690(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">A.S. testified that, when he received the first Asset Purchase Agreement, he compared the amount of the purchase price with a report dated July 15, 1996, from James T. Shepherd, a certified public accountant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Shepherd had estimated that the value of Moneta was $2,008,300. However, that amount included $240,900 for marketable securities that were not to be sold to Capps. Shepherd also did not include any discounts for marketability or minority interests. A.S. also testified that he looked at the balance sheets for Moneta and concluded that the amount of the offer approximated the total amount of the stockholders\u2019 equity. So, before the special meeting of the directors on November 19, A.S. and Rose Mary had had the benefit of this information along with the Player report. By the time the stockholders met on December 20, they had received Dr. Lynch\u2019s report in which he opined that the offer from Capps was fair to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Other factors were also relevant to the directors\u2019 discharge of their duties with regard to the sale of Moneta\u2019s assets. Willard first indicated that he was not interested in purchasing the assets, but then he made an offer that expired three days later. He did not submit his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>second offer until one day before the stockholders\u2019 special meeting. Furthermore, in Willard\u2019s second offer, he requested an additional 30 days in which to review the financial records of Moneta in more detail so that he could determine if an even higher purchase price was warranted. Thus, A.S. and Rose Mary were justified in their fear that the value of Moneta\u2019s assets would decline significantly if they waited and David opened his new business during those 30 days. A.S. and Rose Mary were obliged to consider this potential consequence. Even Willard had acknowledged the adverse impact that David\u2019s new business would have on the value of Moneta\u2019s assets.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Thus, we conclude that A.S. and Rose Mary, in their capacities as directors, acted in good faith and used their business judgment by pursuing a course to achieve the result that they considered to be in the best interests of Moneta. They discharged their duties in accordance with Code \u00a7 13.1-690 and are, therefore, protected by the \u201csafe harbor\u201d afforded under subsection C of that statutory provision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">CONFLICT OF INTERESTS</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Willard\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error address an alleged conflict of interests and a director\u2019s duty of loyalty. Specifically, Willard asserts that the circuit court erred by ruling that A.S. and Rose Mary did not have a conflict of interests in the transaction to sell Moneta\u2019s assets to a corporation owned by their son.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The statute at issue is Code \u00a7 13.1-691, which provides the following, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">A. A conflict of interests transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect personal interest. A conflict of interests trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>action is not voidable by the corporation solely because of the director\u2019s interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">1.

For the purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an indirect personal interest in a transaction if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">1.

Another entity of which he is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Relying on our decision in <em>Izadpanah v. Boeing Joint Venture, </em>243 Va. 81, 412 S.E.2d 708 (1992), the circuit court ruled that Willard had the initial burden of establishing a conflict of interests and that he failed to do so.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court determined that A.S. and Rose Mary, in their capacities as directors, did not have an \u201cindirect personal interest\u201d in the transaction, as that term is defined in Code \u00a7 13.1-691(B). Aside from the familial relationship between son and parents, the court also found no evidence of a \u201cdirect personal interest in the transaction.\u201d According to the court, the evidence actually demonstrated that David\u2019s resignation as an officer and director of Moneta and his new business plans had caused considerable discord between him and his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">As an alternative finding, the court determined that, even if A.S. and Rose Mary had conflicts of interests in their capacities as directors, the transaction was, nevertheless, \u201cfair to the corporation\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 13.1-691(A)(3). Thus, the circuit court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the sale of Moneta\u2019s assets was not a voidable transaction under Code \u00a7 13.1-691. Because we agree that the transaction was \u201cfair,\u201d we need not address whether A.S. and Rose Mary had a conflict of interests because their son owned the corporation that purchased the assets of Moneta.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">No inflexible rule can be established by which to test the \u201cfairness\u201d of a transaction. It depends largely on the nature and circumstances of the business action. But generally, a director must act in good faith, and the transaction must, \u201cas a whole, [be] open, fair and honest at the time it was consummated.\u201d <em>Deford v. Ballentine Realty Corp., </em>164 Va. 436, 449, 180 S.E. 164, 169 (1935); <em>accord Adelman </em>v. <em>Conotti Corp., </em>215 Va. 782, 789-90, 213 S.E.2d 774, 779 (1975). In sum, a transaction in which a director has a conflict of interests should bear \u201cthe earmarks of an arm\u2019s length bargain\u201d in order to be deemed \u201cfair to the corporation\u201d under Code \u00a7 13.1-691(A)(3). <em>Pepper v. Litton, </em>308 U.S. 295, 306-07 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Using these guidelines to review all aspects of the transaction in this case, we conclude that A.S. and Rose Mary carried their burden of proving that the sale of Moneta\u2019s assets to Capps was \u201cfair to the corporation.\u201d Although we believe that the standard by which a transaction is judged under Code \u00a7 13.1-691(A)(3) is more exacting than that under \u00a7 13.1-690, the facts that support the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that A.S. and Rose Mary exercised their \u201cgood faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation\u201d equally sustain the court\u2019s judgment on this issue and need not be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Furthermore, when A.S. and Rose Mary, acting as Moneta\u2019s directors, accepted the offer from Capps, it was the only offer that had been presented to the board of directors at that time. After Willard made his first offer, the directors did not refuse to consider it. Instead, they believed it would be inappropriate to take any action on the offer prior to the special meeting of the stockholders since the notice for that meeting had already been given to the stockholders. Even though Willard\u2019s first offer expired three days after he made it, A.S. encouraged Willard to present his offer to the stockholders. Willard did not make his second offer until one day before the stock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>holders\u2019 special meeting.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, that offer included Willard\u2019s request for 30 days in which to evaluate the value of Moneta\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">During the stockholders\u2019 meeting, A.S. informed everyone about Willard\u2019s offers. The stockholders had already received copies of the revised \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d and the reports from Dr. Lynch and Player. Thus, the directors and stockholders of this closely held corporation possessed all the available information concerning the value and sale of Moneta\u2019s assets. When the stockholders met on December 20, the options were either to accept the offer from Capps or to forego that opportunity to sell Moneta\u2019s assets and wait for the outcome of a further evaluation of the assets by Willard while David opened his competing business. Therefore, we conclude that the transaction was, \u201cas a whole, open, fair and honest at the time it was consummated\u201d and is, accordingly, not voidable under Code \u00a7 13.1-691.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Willard, nevertheless, asserts that a finding that the sale of assets is not voidable under Code \u00a7 13.1-691 does not necessarily resolve the question whether A.S. and Rose Mary are liable for breach of their common law duty of loyalty. Generally, we agree with that proposition. However, having established the \u201cfairness\u201d of the transaction under Code \u00a7 13.1-691(A)(3), it necessarily follows that A.S. and Rose Mary discharged their duty of loyalty in compliance with Code \u00a7 13.1-690.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">MAJORITY STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 RIGHTS</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">We next address Willard\u2019s contention that the circuit court erred by finding that A.S. and Rose Mary could \u201cavoid the fiduciary duties they owed as directors by simply referring the asset sale to themselves as shareholders and then voting \u2018as shareholders\u2019 to approve the transaction.\u201d Willard argues that directors cannot be allowed to abdicate their duties by replacing their \u201cdirectors\u2019] hats\u201d with their \u201cshareholders\u2019] hats.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">With regard to the duties of majority stockholders, the circuit court determined that A.S.\u2019s decision to vote his and Rose Mary\u2019s shares of stock to accept the revised \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d was not \u201cillegal, oppressive,, fraudulent, or wasteful.\u201d Absent a vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>lation of Code \u00a7 13.1-747,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the court opined that stockholders own their stock and can vote it.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In <em>Glass </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>228 Va. 39, 53-54, 321 S.E.2d 69, 78 (1984), we recognized that \u201cmajority stockholders [have] rights for which they [are] entitled to protection. They [have] the right to retain their stock, to control the management of the [corporation, and to act together to accomplish their legitimate aims.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Fein v. Lanston Monotype Mach. Co., </em>196 Va. 753, 766, 85 S.E.2d 353, 360 (1955), we stated that \u201c[t]he holders of the majority of the shares of a corporation have the right and the power, by the election of directors and by the vote of their stock, to determine the policy of their corporation and to manage and control its action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that A.S. and Rose Mary were entitled to exercise their rights as the majority stockholders by voting to approve the sale of assets to Capps. We agree with the circuit court\u2019s judgment that their conduct was not \u201cillegal, oppressive, or fraudulent\u201d under Code \u00a7 13.1-747. Any self-interest on the part of a majority stockholder \u201cis not a disqualification of the right to vote, in the absence of fraud or other disqualification.\u201d 196 Va. at 766, 85 S.E.2d at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR SELLING CORPORATION\u2019S ASSETS</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Willard next attacks the directors\u2019 compliance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 13.1-724.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Specifically, Willard asserts that A.S. and Rose Mary failed to follow the procedures contained in subsection (B)(1) in two respects: (1) that the board of directors failed to communicate the \u201cbasis for its determination\u201d that the proposed transaction would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>be submitted to the stockholders with no recommendation from the directors; and (2) that the proposed \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d sent to the stockholders for approval was actually different from the one approved by the board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The notice of the December 20, 1996 special meeting of stockholders disclosed the familial relationship among A.S., Rose Mary, and David. According to the circuit court, that relationship was a \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d that formed the basis of the decision by the board to refer the proposed transaction to the stockholders without a recommendation. We agree. Disclosure of the familial relationship in the notice for the special meeting of stockholders was sufficient notification of the basis for the board\u2019s decision. Thus, the disclosure satisfied the requirements of Code \u00a7 13.1-747(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The court also found that the terms of the revised \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement,\u201d which A.S. signed without board approval, fell within the authority to negotiate that the board of directors had granted to him at the special meeting on November 19, 1996. The minutes of the special meeting of the board of directors on November 19 reflect that the board authorized A.S. to sign the agreement but reserved the right for him to negotiate any matters of concern to the stockholders. In the revised document, Capps agreed to assume certain liabilities of Moneta; whereas, the original agreement stated that Capps \u201cshall not assume <em>any </em>liabilities of [Moneta].\u201d While this modification resulted in a reduction in the purchase price, we believe that the outstanding liabilities of the seller and the extent to which the buyer will assume those liabilities are matters of concern to stockholders. Thus, we conclude that A.S. acted within the authority granted to him when he executed the revised \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d and that the submission of that agreement to the stockholders for approval did not violate the requirements of Code \u00a7 13.1-724(B)(1), even though it contained some terms that were different from those in the original agreement approved by the board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">To summarize, A.S. and Rose Mary, as the only remaining directors of Moneta, discharged their duties in accordance with their \u201cgood faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation\u201d by approving the sale of Moneta\u2019s assets to Capps. They not only engaged in an informed decision-making process to the extent possible, given the limited amount of time in which they had to evaluate the offers from Capps and Willard, but they also considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>both the quantity and quality of the offers. Moreover, the transaction was \u201cfair to the corporation\u201d under the more demanding standard mandated by Code \u00a7 13.1-691(A)(3). A.S. and Rose Mary also complied with the procedures required in Code \u00a7 13.1-724 for the sale of a corporation\u2019s assets, not in the ordinary course of business. Thus, for the reasons stated, we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\"> Originally, Willard and his wife purchased the 20 percent interest in Moneta.

MacMillan, Inc., </em>559 A.2d 1261, 1282 n. 29 (Del. 1989), the court recognized that, in obtaining the highest price reasonably available for a corporation, a board of directors may consider \u201cthe adequacy and terms of the offer; its fairness and feasibility; the proposed or actual financing for the offer, and the consequences of that financing; . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>the risk of nonconsumation; the basic stockholder interests at stake; the bidder\u2019s identity, prior background and other business venture experiences; and the bidder\u2019s business plans for the corporation and their effects on stockholder interests.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\"> David had obtained the report from Shepherd when he first started developing his business plan.

Furthermore, the circuit court actually reviewed all the requested material <em>in camera </em>and ordered the defendants to provide some of the documents to Willard. \u201cGenerally, the granting or denying of discovery is a matter within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal unless \u2018the action taken was improvident and affected substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Brian </em>v. <em>Langley School, </em>256 Va. 547, 552, 507 S.E.2d 363, 366 (1998) (quoting <em>Rakes </em>v. <em>Fulcher, </em>210 Va. 542, 546, 172 S.E.2d 751, 755 (1970)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b174-13\"> The court also stated that if a plaintiff establishes a conflict of interests, the director then has the burden to prove compliance with Code \u00a7 13.1-691.

However, on brief, Willard asked this Court to reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision on this issue <em>if </em>we also reversed the court\u2019s approval of the transaction. Since we are affirming the circuit court\u2019s judgment, we need not address this assignment of error on its merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b179-5\">JUSTICE KOONTZ, with whom JUSTICE HASSELL</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">I respectfully dissent. In my view, only by placing form over substance can the record in this case support the trial court\u2019s judgment that Ronald L. Willard failed to carry his burden of proof that Amerigo S. and Rose Mary Cappellari, the sole directors and majority stockholders of Moneta Building Supply, Inc. (Moneta), did not discharge their duty of loyalty in compliance with Code \u00a7 13.1-690.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Without repeating the generally undisputed facts recited in the majority opinion, it is clear that the record establishes that Mr. and Mrs. Cappellari knew that the transaction in question involved the sale of Moneta\u2019s operating assets to Capps Home &amp; Building Supply Center, Inc. (Capps), a corporation owned by their son, David Lawrence Cappellari. In addition, the record establishes that although Mr. and Mrs. Cappellari were unhappy with their son\u2019s decision to leave Moneta and to open Capps in direct competition with it, they were aware that the acquisition of Moneta\u2019s assets would shorten the time until Capps would become operational and be a source of substantial income for their son. Indeed, this transaction would permit their son to begin operating Capps in Moneta\u2019s real estate with its entire inventory and, thus, become operational immediately upon the close of the transaction without the delays inherent in opening any new business. This benefit to their son is patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Under these circumstances, Mr. and Mrs. Cappellari had a conflict of interests in this transaction because they had a \u201cdirect personal . . . interest\u201d in that transaction as contemplated by Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u00a7 13.1-691. That statute does not define this term. However, \u201cdirect . . . personal interest\u201d is a broad term and, absent restrictive language in the statute, it is not limited to direct financial considerations. Rather, common sense dictates that where a parent is in a position as a director of a closely held corporation to assist his or her child in acquiring the assets of the corporation to the benefit of the child, that director has a direct personal interest in such a transaction as contemplated by Code \u00a7 13.1-691.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Notwithstanding this conflict of interests, I do not disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that on this record this transaction was not void or voidable under Code \u00a7 13.1-691. In the context of that code section, the record supports the trial court\u2019s judgment, and the majority opinion, that the transaction was \u201cfair to the corporation\u201d under Code \u00a7 13.1-691(A)(3). This is so because Capps\u2019 offer was at least consistent with the value of Moneta\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">However, Code \u00a7 13.1-691 by its express terms merely protects a conflict of interests transaction from being rendered void solely because of a director\u2019s conflict. This code section does not address the potential liability of a director who has a conflict of interests in a particular transaction. That issue is to be resolved under Code \u00a7 13.1-690, which requires the director to discharge his duties \u201cin accordance with his good faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation.\u201d It is in this context that I disagree with the conclusion of the majority opinion, on the particular facts of this case, that because the transaction in question was not voidable because it was \u201cfair\u201d under Code \u00a7 13.1-691(A)(3), it <em>necessarily </em>follows that the directors discharged their duty of loyalty in compliance with Code \u00a7 13.1-690.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">It is undisputed that on November 15, 1996, Capps offered $1.3 million to purchase the assets of Moneta, including its real estate, inventory, equipment, vehicles, supplies, office furniture, fixtures, improvements and the exclusive right to use the trade name \u201cMoneta Building Supply.\u201d Without question, once this transaction was complete Moneta would cease to exist as an operating business. All that would remain to be done would be a distribution of the proceeds of this sale to the shareholders. It is also undisputed that prior to the shareholder approval of this offer, the directors received two offers from Willard. In pertinent part, the last offer contained the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">I am now offering to pay $600,000.00 more than Capps for the same assets as set forth in the November 15, 1996 Asset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Purchase Agreement, and under the same terms an [sic] conditions as set forth therein, provided that the business is run in the ordinary course until closing and the telephone number of the business is included in the assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">I am making my offer without any real opportunity to investigate in detail the value of the assets of Moneta Building Supply, Inc. I am confident that if given that opportunity, I would further increase my offer substantially. Accordingly, while the foregoing offer remains in effect, I would request 30 days to fully evaluate the assets and determine whether a higher value is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">There is no suggestion in the record that Willard was not financially able to consummate this offer if it was accepted. Willard\u2019s offer of $600,000 more than the Capps offer was not conditioned upon being granted an additional 30 days in which to review financial records of Moneta in more detail. Thus, the record establishes that the directors had two competing offers to consider, and one in which they had a direct personal interest. Significantly, the latter offer was the lower of the two offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">In this context, the record does not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. and Mrs. Cappellari \u201cengaged in an informed decision making process that . . . produce[d] a defensible business decision.\u201d The record reflects that they never met as directors to consider Willard\u2019s offer. Thus, the record does not support the conclusion that they discharged their duties as directors in accordance with their \u201cgood faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 13.1-690. Rather, the record establishes that the directors preferred their son to be able to purchase Moneta\u2019s assets and that they engaged professional advice solely to shape a process under Code \u00a7 13.1-690 to accomplish that end. This was mere form over substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">While I agree with the majority that Mr. and Mrs. Cappellari were not required to accept Willard\u2019s offer merely because it maximized the purchase price and that they were entitled to consider not only the quantity of the offer but also the quality of the offer, the record simply does not support the conclusion that this was done. Moreover, because of their direct personal interest in the Capps transaction, it is clear that they were not exercising good faith business judgment because all their efforts were directed at upholding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Capps offer to the exclusion of any consideration of the Willard offer. Under these circumstances they were not entitled to the protection of Code \u00a7 13.2-690(C) and they failed to discharge their duty of loyalty in not considering the offer that would maximize the purchase price for Moneta\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case to the trial court for a determination of what damages, if any, Willard might establish in a new trial limited to that issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
