The district court found that Guerra\u2019s detention was governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a) and he was, therefore, entitled to a bond hearing. On appeal Respondents argue that Guerra\u2019s detention was authorized by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a), so he was not entitled to a bond hearing; they further argue that his continued detention would not violate due process because his removal is reasonably foreseeable. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Guerra, a native and citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States without inspection in 1998. Later that year he was placed in removal proceedings and ordered removed. He was removed in April 2009. The following year he again reentered the United States without inspection, and again he was removed. He then reentered without inspection a third time. Following his arrest, he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) on January 6, 2014. His 1998 removal order was reinstated pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">While Guerra was in detention, an asylum officer concluded that Guerra had a reasonable fear of returning to Guatemala and referred Guerra\u2019s case to an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) for a determination as to whether Guerra was eligible for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) or the Convention Against Torture. As of the date of this opinion, Guerra\u2019s withholding of removal proceedings are pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Guerra petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the Southern District of New York in June 2014. He argued that he was entitled to a bond hearing because his detention was authorized by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a) and aliens detained pursuant to that section are entitled to a bond hearing before an IJ under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1236.1(d). In the alternative, he contended that his detention violated due process. Respondents argued that his detention was authorized by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a), which provides for periodic custody reviews by ICE but does not authorize bond hearings before an IJ. Respondents also argued that his detention did not violate due process because his removal was reasonably foreseeable. The district court agreed with Guerra that his detention was governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a) and granted his petition; Guerra is currently free on bond. Respondents appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of habeas relief de novo. <em>Theodoropoulos v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">a. Rules Governing Detention of Aliens</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">If an alien who has previously had an order of removal entered against him reenters the United States, the Attorney General reinstates the final order of removal, and \u201cthe alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief\u2019 under the immigration laws. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5). The Attorney General, however, may not remove an alien to a country where the alien would face persecution or torture. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">If an alien subject to a reinstated removal order expresses to an asylum officer a .reasonable fear of returning to the country specified in the removal order, the case is referred to an IJ, for \u201cwithholding-only\u201d proceedings. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31(b), (e). In withholding-only proceedings, \u201call parties are prohibited from raising or considering any ... issues\u201d other than withholding or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>deferral of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.2(c)(3)(i). The IJ\u2019s order concerning withholding can be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), and from there, by a'petition for review, to a court of appeals. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31(e); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). An order of removal is considered \u201cfinal\u201d upon the earlier of a BIA decision affirming an IJ\u2019s order of removal or the passing of the deadline to appeal to the BIA an IJ\u2019s order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(47)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">As relevant here, two statutory subsections authorize detention of aliens. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a) authorizes the detention of an alien \u201cpending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States\u201d; under this section, ICE may detain an alien or release him subject to parole or a bond. If ICE elects to detain the alien, the alien may request a bond hearing before an IJ. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1236.1(d)(1). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a), by contrast, governs detention of aliens who are subject to a final order of removal. This section defines a 90-day \u201cremoval period\u201d after a removal order becomes \u201cadministratively final\u201d; during the removal period, detention is required. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(l)-(2).\u2018 After the removal period has expired, detention is discretionary, but a bond hearing is not authorized if removal is \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6); <em>see Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 699, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001) (holding that detention under \u00a7 1231(a) violates due process if removal is not \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">b. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">This case presents an issue of first impression in this Circuit: whether a reinstated removal order is \u201cadministratively final\u201d during the pendency of withholding-only proceedings. The answer to this question determines whether Guerra\u2019s detention is governed by \u00a7 1231(a) or instead by \u00a7 1226(a), and, in turn, whether he was eligible to be released on bond. None of our sister Circuits has ruled on this issue,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the various district courts to have considered the issue have reached conflicting conclusions. <em>See Reyes v. Lynch, </em>2015 WL 5081597, at *2 <em>&amp; </em>nn. 4-5 (D. Colo. Aug. 28, 2015) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u201cStatutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress .... \u201d <em>Park \u2018N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park &amp; Fly, Inc., </em>469 U.S. 189, 194, 105 S.Ct. 658, 83 L.Ed.2d 582 (1985). Here, the statutory text favors Guerra\u2019s interpretation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a) permits detention of an alien \u201cpending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.\u201d The statute does not speak to the case of whether the alien is theoretically removable but rather to whether the alien will actually be removed. An alien subject to a reinstated removal order is clearly removable, but the purpose of withholding-only proceedings is to determine precisely whether \u201cthe alien is to be removed from the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">The structure of the statute also favors Guerra\u2019s interpretation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a) authorizes the detention of aliens whose removal proceedings are ongoing. By contrast, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a) is concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>mainly with defining the 90-day removal period during which the Attorney General \u201cshall remove the alien.\u201d The former provision is the more logical source of authorization for the detention of aliens currently in withholding-only proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Although this case presents an issue of first impression, our precedent is not without guidance. We have held, in the similar context of asylum-only proceedings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that a denial of asylum is judicially reviewable even though it is not accompanied by a \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d We held that a contrary decision would \u201celevate form over substance.\u201d <em>Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 133-35 (2d Cir. 2006). In another case, we have held that an order of removal was not final when the BIA denied asylum and upheld the IJ\u2019s removal order but then remanded the alien\u2019s claims for withholding. Because the alien\u2019s \u201cremanded applications ... if granted, effectively would result in the cancellation of any order removing [him],\u201d the order was not final. <em>Chupina v. Holder, 570 </em>F.3d 99, 103 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Respondents do not dispute that Guerra, if his withholding application is denied, could petition this Court for review of that denial. They argue that the finality which permits judicial review is different from the finality which permits his detention under 8 U.S.C.- \u00a7 1231(a). They point to no authority for this proposition, however', and we have never recognized such \u201ctiers\u201d of finality. Moreover, the bifurcated definition of finality urged upon us runs counter to principles of administrative law which counsel that to be final, an agency action must \u201cmark the consummation of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.\u201d <em>U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs v. Hawkes Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1807, 1813, 195 L.Ed.2d 77 (2016) (quoting <em>Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 178, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997)). Accordingly, we must take 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a) at face value when it authorizes detention for aliens \u201cpending a decision on whether they are to be removed,\u201d and we need not create new principles parsing administrative finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">Respondents argue that the regulations interpreting the statutes are entitled to deference and that their interpretation of these regulations is also entitled to deference. While both propositions are undoubtedly true, <em>see Chevron, U.S.A, Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997), in this case <em>Chevron </em>deference is inapplicable because the regulations do not answer the question of which provision governs Guerra\u2019s detention. Certainly if a regulation provided that an alien in Guerra\u2019s position was subject to detention under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a), our review would be limited to whether the regulation was \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. The regulations Respondents cite, however, do not provide which section authorizes detention of aliens in Guerra\u2019s position. They discuss aliens who have not expressed a fear of returning and aliens who have been granted withholding but are still subject to detention. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 241.3, 241.4(b)(3), 241.8(f). Respondents\u2019 argument for <em>Chevron </em>deference assumes the dispositive question in this case. They argue that because Guerra\u2019s removal order is final, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>regulations (discussing aliens subject to final orders of removal) make clear that his detention is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a). Our holding that Guerra\u2019s removal order is not final during the pen-dency of his withholding-only proceedings disposes of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">For similar reasons, Respondents\u2019 position is not entitled to deference under <em>Auer. </em>An agency may not convert an issue of statutory interpretation into one of deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its. own regulations simply by pointing to the existence of regulations whose relevance is tenuous at best. <em>Cf. Gonzales v. Oregon, </em>546 U.S. 243, 257, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006) (\u201cSince the regulation gives no indication how to decide this issue, the Attorney General\u2019s effort to decide it now cannot be considered an interpretation of the regulation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Accordingly, the language and structure of the statutes dictate the conclusion that Guerra\u2019s detention during the pendency of his withholding-only proceedings is detention pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a). The regulations offer no contrary suggestion. Guerra was entitled to the bond hearing he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-5\">. The Ninth and Tenth Circuits have held that they lack jurisdiction over petitions for review filed while withholding-only proceedings are ongoing. <em>See Ortiz-Alfaro v. Holder, </em>694 F.3d 955, 958 (9th Cir. 2012); <em>Luna-Garcia v. Holder, </em>777 F.3d 1182, 1184 (10th Cir. 2015). Neither court, however, answered the question of which section authorized detention for aliens in Guerra's position. As discussed <em>infra, </em>Respondents do not challenge these cases, arguing instead that finality in the detention context differs from finality in the context of judicial review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">. Asylum-only proceedings arise when an alien enters the United States under the Visa Waiver Pilot program, \"under which certain aliens may enter the United States without a visa for up to 90 days if they waive their right to contest any action for [removal] (other than on the basis of an asylum application) against them.\u201d <em>Jean-Baptiste v. Reno, </em>144 F.3d 212, 216-17 (2d Cir. 1998); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1187.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
