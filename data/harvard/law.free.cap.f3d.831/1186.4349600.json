L. No. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2440, 2519 (1997) (reprinted in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A historical and statutory notes). In Poeklington\u2019s appeal, we reversed and vacated Pocklington\u2019s probation revocation and sentence on the ground that the district court had no jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3564(d), 3565(c), to revoke probation after the probation had expired. <em>United States v. Pocklington, </em>792 F.3d 1036 (9th Cir. 2015). Assuming this outcome is construed as a decision on the merits in favor of Pocklington \u2014 an issue the government disputes \u2014 attorney\u2019s fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>are not warranted because the government\u2019s position was not \u201cvexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">In assessing the nature of the government\u2019s position, the three components of the statute are \u201cdisjunctive; thus, the defendant need only prove one of the three elements to recover.\u201d <em>United States v. Manchester Farming P\u2019ship, </em>315 F.3d 1176, 1182 (9th Cir. 2003), <em>opinion amended on denial of reh\u2019g, </em>326 F.3d 1028 (9th Cir. 2003). Pocklington does not assert that the government\u2019s position was vexatious or in bad faith. Rather, he relies entirely on the \u201cfrivolous\u201d ground. No matter which ground is at issue, \u201cit is clear that, \u2018[e]ven in its earliest form, the Hyde Amendment was targeted at prosecutorial misconduct, not prosecutorial mistake.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Braunstein, </em>281 F.3d 982, 995 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>198 F.3d 1293, 1304 (11th Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">A case is frivolous when the \u201cgovernment\u2019s position was \u2018foreclosed by binding precedent or so obviously wrong as to be frivolous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Braunstein, </em>281 F.3d at 995 (quoting <em>Gilbert, </em>198 F.3d at 1304). We have described a frivolous position as \u201cgroundless ... with little prospect of success; often brought to embarrass or annoy the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 995 (quoting <em>Gilbert, </em>198 F.3d at 1299). Although the \u201cGovernment\u2019s case was not strong,\u201d it was not barred by precedent, obviously wrong, \u201cbrought to embarrass or annoy [Pocklington],\u201d or in the nature of \u201coutlandish ... prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d <em>Manchester, </em>315 F.3d at 1184.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">The issue we confronted in this appeal\u2014 \u201cwhether the requirements for extending probation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565 are jurisdictional\u201d \u2014 was a matter of first impression before our circuit. <em>Pocklington, </em>792 F.3d at 1039. Although we had previously referenced \u00a7 3565(c) as jurisdictional, we did not explain the context of this term, which has been used in multiple ways, and it was in a wholly different factual scenario. <em>See United States v. Castro-Verdugo, </em>750 F.3d 1065, 1070 (9th Cir. 2014). Nor had we addressed the impact of \u00a7 3565(c) on the circumstance of a <em>retroactive </em>extension of probation, invocation of equitable tolling, or plain error review. At the time of briefing and argument, several circuits had deemed forfeitable the claim Pockling-ton made for the first time on appeal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Madden, </em>515 F.3d 601, 608 (6th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Wimberly, </em>368 Fed.Appx. 556, 558 (5th Cir. 2010); <em>United States v. Burcham, </em>91 Fed.Appx. 820, 821 (4th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-8\">Retroactive application was a novel issue, but in our opinion we drew an analogy to a supervised release statute with identical language, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(i), that had been interpreted as jurisdictional in the real sense \u2014 meaning going to the power of the court <em>to </em>hear the matter. <em>See United States v. Garrett, </em>253 F.3d 443, 449 (9th Cir. 2001); <em>United States v. Vargas-Amaya, </em>389 F.3d 901, 907 (9th Cir. 2004). That analogy was appreciably strengthened by the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Merlino, </em>785 F.3d 79, 81 (3d Cir. 2015), which was argued and decided after briefing and argument in <em>Pocklington. </em>The Third Circuit held not only that \u00a7 3583(i) was jurisdictional, but also, critically, that this jurisdictional rule was' not subject to equitable tolling. <em>Id. </em>at 87-88. The concurring opinion in that case characterized the question as a \u201cclose issue.\u201d <em>Merlino, </em>785 F.3d at 94 (Ambro, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-9\">Finally, Pocklington presents no evidence that the government sought to \u201cembarrass\u201d or \u201cannoy\u201d Pocklington. <em>Braun-stein, </em>281 F.3d at 995. By all indications, the government was sincerely interested in revoking Pocklington\u2019s probation for plausible violations of the conditions of probation. Pocklington\u2019s creditors reported to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>the Probation Office that Pocklington was concealing millions of dollars in assets in violation of a condition of his probation that he make accurate financial disclosures. Pocklington, 792 F.3d at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">After careful review of the record, including briefing and argument on the merits and briefing on the Hyde Amendment, we conclude, though the question is close, that the government\u2019s position was not frivolous. We decline to assess fees against the government for testing an essentially untested legal idea. Pocklington\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the Hyde Amendment is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
