In light of Johnson v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), we hold that the District Court plainly erred in considering the state conviction to be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines. We will vacate Calabretta\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-26\">On March 15, 2013, Calabretta pleaded guilty to a two-count superseding information, charging him with conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B) and 846, and with conspiracy to launder the proceeds of drug trafficking activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)\u00a9 and 1956(h). Cal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>abretta was subject to a five-year mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to the stipulated charges in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In advance of sentencing, the parties and the District Court received a copy of the Presentence Report (the \u201cPSR\u201d), which included Calabretta\u2019s Criminal History Category and Total Offense Level. The PSR considered multiple prior state convictions in calculating . Calabretta\u2019s Criminal History Category, including a 1990 conviction for \u201cDeath by Auto\u201d and a 1994 conviction for \u201cEluding in the Second Degree.\u201d The PSR also considered those two convictions to constitute \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, and accordingly designated Calabretta as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under the Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Application of the career offender Guideline increased Calabretta\u2019s Criminal History Category from III to VI, and increased his Total Offense Level from 29 to 31. With the career offender Guideline, Cala-bretta\u2019s recommended Guidelines sentencing range was 188 to 235 months of imprisonment. Had the career offender Guideline not applied, his recommended Guidelines sentencing range would have been 108 to 135 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">At sentencing, the District Court adopted the PSR\u2019s calculation of Criminal History Category VI and Total Offense Level of 31, which included the application of the career offender Guideline. After considering the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (\u201csection 3553(a)\u201d), the District Court imposed a sentence of 120 months on each count to be served concurrently. Calabretta\u2019s sentence thus reflected a 68-month downward variance from the advisory Guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">In imposing Calabretta\u2019s sentence, the District Court extensively discussed Cala-bretta\u2019s earlier criminal convictions. The District Court noted that Calabretta became \u201cinvolved in this particular scheme approximately five years after he was released from jail on his prior convictions and ... [he] should have learned [his] lesson.\u201d Appendix (\u201cApp.\u201d) 141. The District Court also indicated that \u201ca very substantial sentence is required,\u201d in part, to \u201cget through to [Calabretta] that if [he] thought [he] had reformed, reforming by becoming a drug dealer is not reforming.\u201d App. 142. Additionally, the District Court denied Calabretta\u2019s request for a two-level reduction in his offense level, in anticipation of an amendment to the Guidelines. The District Court noted that Calabretta would be ineligible for a sentencing reduction under the amendment \u201cgiven [his] pri- or criminal record.\u201d App. 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">On September 11, 2014, the District Court entered the final judgment of conviction and sentence, which reflected the 120-month term of imprisonment imposed. Calabretta timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">II.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">At his sentencing, Calabretta did not challenge whether his state conviction for eluding in the second degree is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d so we will review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>District Court\u2019s determination of that issue for plain error. To establish plain error, Calabretta must show that (1) the District Court erred; (2) the error was clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute; and (3) the error affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, which in the ordinary course means that there is a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings. United States v. Marcus, 560 U.S. 258, 262, 130 S.Ct. 2159, 176 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2010); United States v. Tai, 750 F.3d 309, 313-14 (3d Cir.2014). If all three elements are established, then the Court may exercise its discretion to award relief. See United States v. Plano, 507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). That discretion should be exercised only in cases where the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Stinson, 734 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Calabretta argues that the District Court plainly erred in treating his conviction for eluding as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines, and that his case should be remanded for resen-tencing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Guidelines define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">1. has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">2. is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (emphasis added). The Government has conceded that Calabret-ta\u2019s eluding conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d only under what is known as the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the Guideline \u2014 as \u201cotherwise involving] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Gov\u2019t Letter Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 28(j) (Aug. 12, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">While Calabretta\u2019s appeal was pending, the United States Supreme Court decided Johnson v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), which held that an identically worded residual clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) was unconstitutional. Under ACCA, defendants are subject to a more severe punishment if they have three or more previous convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d \u2014 which included, under the statute\u2019s residual clause, \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to \u2022 another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Supreme Court prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>dent prior to Johnson had required courts to use a \u201ccategorical\u201d approach to determine whether a crime fell within ACCA\u2019s residual clause. See Sykes v. United States, 564 U.S. 1, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011); James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). The categorical approach prescribed that courts \u201cpicture the kind of conduct that the crime involves in \u2018the ordinary case,\u2019 and to judge whether that abstraction presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\u201d Johnson, 135 S.Ct. at 2557 (quoting James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192, 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">But in Johnson, the Supreme Court overruled its earlier cases \u2014 Sykes and James \u2014 that required courts to use the categorical approach to determine whether a crime was included in ACCA\u2019s residual clause. Rather, the Supreme Court invalidated, as unconstitutionally vague, ACCA\u2019s residual clause. The Supreme Court held that defendants were denied due process of law when their sentences were increased after application of ACCA\u2019s residual clause because the \u201cindeterminacy of the wide-ranging inquiry required by the residual clause both denies fair notice to defendants and invites arbitrary enforcement by judges.\u201d Johnson, 135 S.Ct. at 2557. The Court ruled that the indeterminacy inherent in both inquiries under the categorical approach \u2014 (1) imagining the conduct in \u201cthe ordinary case\u201d of a crime, and (2) imagining the \u201cserious potential risk\u201d of that \u201cordinary case\u201d \u2014 was, at least in combination, unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id. at 2557-58. The Court also noted the practical results of prior jurisprudence interpreting .the residual clause: numerous splits among the federal courts regarding the type of inquiry for determining what a crime is in \u201cthe ordinary case,\u201d and ultimately, which crimes fall within the residual clause. Id. at 2560. Therefore, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ijnvoking so shapeless a provision to condemn someone to prison ... does not comport with the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process.\u201d Id,</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Under the plain error standard, we must first consider whether the District Court committed an error when it considered the eluding conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in determining Calabretta to be a career offender under the Guidelines. Both the Government and Calabretta argue that, under Johnson, the identically worded \u201cresidual clause\u201d of \u00a7 4B1.2 of the Guidelines is likewise invalid. This question, however, is one for the courts \u2014 not the parties \u2014 to decide. \u201cConfessions of error ... do not relieve this Court of the performance of the judicial function.... [0]ur judgments are precedents, and the proper administration of the criminal law cannot be left merely to the stipulation of parties.\u201d Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 58, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">We hold that the \u201cresidual clause\u201d in \u00a7 4B1.2 of the Guidelines is unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>tionally vague.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This holding flows from our prior case law wherein we have interpreted the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d definition in the Guidelines identically to the \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition in ACCA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For example, in United States v. Hopkins, 577 F.3d 507 (3d Cir.2009), we considered whether a second degree misdemeanor escape offense under Pennsylvania law qualified as a crime of violence under the residual clause of section 4B1.2. The case was remanded to us by the Supreme Court to be considered further in light of Chambers v. United States, 555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009), an ACCA decision dealing with whether the offense of failing to report for incarceration was a violent felony. See Hopkins v. United States, 555 U.S. 1132, 129 S.Ct. 995, 173 L.Ed.2d 285 (2009). We applied Chambers and held that while the Supreme Court in that decision \u201cwas not called upon to construe the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, the definition of a violent felony under the ACCA is sufficiently similar to the definition of a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines that authority interpreting one is generally applied to the other.\u201d 577 F.3d at 511 (footnote omitted). In addition, we observed that the validity of our holding was \u201cdemonstrated by the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order in this case.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>More recently, in United States v. Marrero, 743 F.3d 389 (3d Cir.2014), we considered whether a simple assault was a crime of violence under the Guidelines residual clause of section 4B1.2. Notably, the case was back before a panel of our Court after being remanded by the Supreme Court in light of its decision in Descamps v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013) \u2014 a decision, like Chambers, involving application of the identical \u201cviolent felony\u201d provision of ACCA. See Marrero v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2732, 186 L.Ed.2d 930 (2013). Our analysis relied upon numerous cases decided under ACCA. 743 F.3d at 394-401. We held that although those cases \u201cinvolved sentencing enhancements under [ACCA] rather than the career offender Guideline, they nevertheless bind our analysis.\u201d Id. at 394 n. 2 (emphasis added). We explained that \u201c \u2018[precedent ... requires the application of case law interpreting \u201cviolent felony\u201d in ACCA to \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in U.S.S.G. 4B1.2[] because of the substantial similarity of the two sections.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting United States v. Herrick, 545 F.3d 53, 58 (1st Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">This approach of similarly interpreting the two residual clauses remains appropriate for the case before us now. Prior to Johnson, courts in this circuit were instructed to use the same categorical approach under both residual clauses for determining whether a conviction qualifies as a crime of violence \u2014 that is, \u201cwhether the elements of the offense are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.\u201d Marrero, 743 F.3d at 395 (quotation marks and emphasis omitted). But in Johnson, the Supreme Court held that the indeterminacy inherent in the categorical approach, under ACCA, denied defendants due process by \u201cdenfying] fair notice to defendants\u201d and \u201cinvit[ing] arbitrary enforcement by judges.\u201d 135 S.Ct. at 2557.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">It is apparent that if ACCA\u2019s residual clause \u201cinvites arbitrary enforcement,\u201d id. so does the residual clause in \u00a7 4B1.2. The process by which a sentencing court determines whether a prior conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is the same process that the Supreme Court held to be fraught with indeterminacy under ACCA. And the result of this indeterminate process\u2014 whether or not a defendant is designated a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.2 \u2014 will shift the \u201cbenchmark\u201d or \u201cframework\u201d of the district court\u2019s sentencing determination by changing the recommended sentencing range. See Peugh v. United, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2072, 2083, 186 L.Ed.2d 84 (2013) (indicating that the advisory Guidelines serve as a \u201cframework\u201d for \u201canchor[ing]\u201d sentencing decisions with the purpose of achieving \u201cuniformity\u201d in sentencing); Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (indicating that the Guidelines, although advisory, \u201cshould be the starting point and the initial benchmark\u201d in order to \u201csecure nationwide consistency\u201d in sentences imposed). See also Pawlak, 822 F.3d at 906 (\u201cPeugh reflects the Court\u2019s judgment that the Guidelines are subject to constitutional challenges because the Guidelines are the mandatory starting point for sentencing determinations and district courts can be reversed for failing to correctly apply them despite the judges\u2019 discretion to deviate from the recommended range. The Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Peugh rests on the very same principles of fair notice and avoiding arbitrary enforcement underlying the doctrine of due process.\u201d) (citations omitted). See generally 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(f) (\u201cThe Commission, in promulgating guidelines ... shall promote the purposes set forth ... with particular attention to the requirements ... for providing certainty and fairness in sentencing and reducing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>unwarranted sentence disparities\u201d)- This takes us back to first principles in sentencing, under which we require that courts calculate a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range as the first step in any sentencing, prior to application of the sentencing factors set out at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). United States v. Gunter, 462 F.3d 237, 247 (3d Cir.2006). \u201c[W]hen the starting point for the \u00a7 3553(a) analysis is incorrect, the end point, i.e., the resulting sentence can rarely be shown to be unaffected.\u201d United States v. Langford, 516 F.3d 205, 217 (3d Cir.2008). Thus, a defendant\u2019s recommended sentence (and ultimate sentence imposed) will likely be affected by how the sentencing court determines whether a prior conviction, viewed only in the abstract and not with reference to real-world facts, is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the \u00a7 4B1.2 residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Our holding also flows from our prior case law that considered constitutional vagueness challenges to the Guidelines. For example, in United States v. Maurer, 639 F.3d 72, 78 n. 4 (3d Cir.2011), we held that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave \u201ca person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of the conduct to which it applies\u201d and did not \u201cauthorize or encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d See also United States v. Jones, 979 F.2d 317, 319-20 (3d Cir.1992) (holding that U.S.S.G \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6) is not void for vagueness), superseded by Guideline on other grounds, U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 487 (eff. Nov. 1, 1993), as recognized in United States v. Roberson, 194 F.3d 408, 417 (3d Cir.1999). Our case law is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition that the Guidelines are sufficiently law-like to be subject to certain limits imposed by the Constitution. See, e.g., Peugh, 133 S.Ct. at 2082 (holding that erroneously applying amended Guidelines that are advisory but still increase a defendant\u2019s recommended sentence violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, as the \u201cchange in law presents a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). See also United States v. Savani, 733 F.3d 56, 66 (3d Cir. 2013) (holding that the rule of lenity applies to the Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">We note, however, that the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has declined to apply the vagueness doctrine to the advisory Guidelines. See United States v. Matchett, 802 F.3d 1185, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2015) (holding that the \u00a7 4B1.2 residual clause was not invalid after Johnson). But the court in Matchett focused only on whether the advisory Guidelines could deny fair notice to a criminal defendant, and not whether a criminal defendant is protected against arbitrary enforcement in an advisory Guidelines sentencing system. See id. at 1194. We conclude, for the reasons previously discussed, that regardless of whether defendants are entitled to \u201cfair notice\u201d under an advisory Guidelines system,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the due process concerns over arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>trary enforcement are implicated here. See United States v. Madrid, 805 F.3d 1204, 1210-11 (10th Cir.2015) (\u201cIf one iteration of the clause is unconstitutionally vague, so too is the other. ... Because the Guidelines are the beginning of all sentencing determinations, and in light of the unavoidable uncertainty and arbitrariness of adjudication under the residual clause, we hold that the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) is void for vagueness.\u201d (quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Johnson supports our conclusion. In its discussion of arbitrary enforcement, the Supreme Court cited to cases involving the \u00a7 4B1.2 residual clause to demonstrate that ACCA\u2019s residual clause is \u201cnearly impossible to apply consistently.\u201d See Johnson, 135 S.Ct. at 2560 (citing United States v. Carthorne, 726 F.3d 503 (4th Cir.2013); United States v. Whitson, 597 F.3d 1218 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam); United States v. McDonald, 592 F.3d 808 (7th Cir.2010); United States v. Williams, 559 F.3d 1143 (10th Cir.2009)). In addition, the Supreme Court vacated the sentences of some offenders who were sentenced under the residual clause of the Sentencing Guidelines, and remanded to the courts of appeals for further consideration in light of Johnson. See United States v. Maldonado, 581 Fed. Appx. 19 (2d Cir.2014), vacated, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2929, 192 L.Ed.2d 966 (2015); Beckles v. United States, 579 Fed.Appx. 833 (11th Cir.2014), vacated, \u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2928, 192 L.Ed.2d 973 (2015). As noted earlier, this type of Supreme Court action is significant. See Hopkins, 577 F.3d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">We hold that the residual clause of the career offender Guideline, like ACCA\u2019s residual clause, is infected with \u201chopeless indeterminacy,\u201d Johnson, 135 S.Ct. at 2558, and is unconstitutionally vague in light of Johnson.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that the District Court erred in determining that Calabretta was a career offender.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"> Second, the error here is plain.

Although our Court has not ruled on the precise question as to whether the residual clause of section 4B1.2 is void for vagueness,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we have previously entertained similar challenges, see Maurer, 639 F.3d at 78 n. 4, and we have held that Supreme Court cases construing ACCA \u201cbind our analysis\u201d of the career offender Guideline, Marrero, 743 F.3d at 394 n. 2.

Tann, 577 F.3d 533, 538 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Piano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770). The Supreme Court recently held that \u201c[wjhen a defendant is sentenced under an incorrect Guidelines range\u2014 whether or not the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence falls within the correct range\u2014 the error can, and most often will, be sufficient to show a reasonable probability of a different outcome absent the error.\u201d Molina-Martinez v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1338, 1345, 194 L.Ed.2d 444 (2016). The Government, however, \u201cremains free to point to parts of the record \u2014 including relevant statements by the judge \u2014 to counter any ostensible showing of prejudice the defendant may make.\u201d Id. at 1347 (quotation marks and alterations omitted). Accordingly, \u201cin the ordinary case a defendant will satisfy his burden to show prejudice by pointing to the application of an incorrect, higher Guidelines range and the sentence he received thereunder. Absent unusual circumstances, he will not be required to show more.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">Despite conceding that Calabretta is no longer a career offender, the Government maintains that the error did not affect Calabretta\u2019s substantial rights. The Government points to the District Court\u2019s downward variance and the District Court\u2019s explanation that \u201c \u2018a sentence of 120 months ... is the minimum sentence sufficient to secure the purposes of sentencing that are set forth in [section] 3553\u2019 \u201d as indications that the District Court would have imposed the same sentence irrespective of the Guidelines range. See Gov\u2019t Letter Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 28(j) (July 28, 2015) (quoting App. 143). We disagree with the Government\u2019s contentions. The record in this case does not \u201cshow ... that the district court thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the sentence it chose was appropriate irrespective of the Guidelines range.\u201d Molina-Martinez, 136 S.Ct. at 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">There are indications in the record that the application of the career offender enhancement did affect Calabretta\u2019s sentence. The District Court placed significant emphasis on Calabretta\u2019s criminal history and his lack of \u201creform.\u201d App. 141-43. The sentencing court noted that Calabretta was \u201cnot a stranger to the criminal justice system,\u201d that he \u201cshould have learned [his] lesson\u201d from his prior convictions, and that his eluding conviction, in particular, \u201ccompounded\u201d his lack of reform. App. 141. After focusing on Calabretta\u2019s prior convictions, the District Court indicated its belief that \u201ca very substantial sentence is required,\u201d in part, \u201cto get through to [Cal-abretta] that if [he] thought [he] had reformed, reforming by becoming a drug dealer is not reforming.\u201d App. 142. We do not think any of those observations inapt, but we cannot divine whether the District Court would have placed such emphasis on Calabretta\u2019s criminal history and his eluding conviction, had he not been designated a career offender convicted of multiple, prior \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Additionally, the District Court denied Calabretta\u2019s request for a two-level reduction in his offense level based on anticipated amendments to the Guidelines that lowered the offense level for certain narcotics offenses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In denying Calabretta\u2019s request, the District Court noted that Calabretta, as a career offender, would be ineligible for a sentence reduction under the amended Guidelines. App. 131-32. We cannot intuit whether the District Court would have granted the request if Calabretta were not a career offender, but we note that the District Court did grant such a request for two of Calabretta\u2019s co-defendants who were not designated career offenders with no objection from the Government.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See Gov\u2019t Br. at 9 n.6. And had the District Court granted the reduction, Calabretta\u2019s recommended Guidelines range would have been 87 to 108 months. Calabretta\u2019s 120-month sentence, then, would constitute a 12-month upward variance from that Guidelines range.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Moreover, we emphasize the sheer magnitude of the disparity between Cala-bretta\u2019s correct Guidelines range and his erroneously-enhanced Guidelines range. Designated a career offender, Calabretta had a Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months of imprisonment. Absent that enhancement, his range was calculated as 108 to 135 months of imprisonment \u2014 or perhaps 87 to 108 months of imprisonment with a Guidelines range reduction in anticipation of Amendment 782. The difference amounts to years of additional time in prison. By contrast, the Supreme Court held in Molina-Martinez that an erroneous Guidelines calculation that affected the defendant\u2019s range by seven months constituted plain error. 136 S.Ct. at 1344. The size of the miscalculation here thus weighs strongly in favor of the conclusion that the error affected Calabretta\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">We hold that the Guidelines miscalculation here is sufficient to show a reasonable probability that his sentence would have been different absent the error. We cannot assume here that the sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the career offender designation. To assume so \u2014 particularly when the record suggests that Calabretta\u2019s criminal history played a role in the ultimate sentence imposed \u2014 would \u201cplace us in the zone of speculation and conjecture.\u201d United States v. Zabielski, 711 F.3d 381, 387 (3d Cir.2013) (quotation marks and alteration marks omitted) (applying harmless error review). Therefore, Calabretta has demonstrated that the District Court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The Supreme Court has recently reminded us that \u201c[u]nder the Plano framework, appellate courts retain broad discretion in determining whether a remand for resentencing is necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Molina-Martinez, 136 S.Ct. at 1348. But that broad discretion should not be exercised reflexively when the other elements of the plain error standard are met. Plano, 507 U.S. at 737, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (\u201c[A] plain error affecting substantial rights does not, without more, satisfy the [plain error standard], for otherwise the discretion afforded by the [standard] would be illusory.\u201d); see United States v. John, 597 F.3d 263, 288-89 (5th Cir.2010) (\u201cThe discretion inherent in the plain-error standard is not tantamount to caprice, nor is it to be exercised because of sympathy or lack thereof for a particular individual or the public\u2019s or a judge\u2019s opinion as to the seriousness or heinous nature of a particular crime.\u201d). Cur discretion is properly exercised in case-specific circumstances where an error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d Plano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quotation marks omitted). That considerable standard has been met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Calabretta\u2019s advisory Guidelines sentencing range would have been sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>stantially lower if he had not been labelled a career offender. If the District Court had applied a two-level reduction in offense level in anticipation of Amendment 782\u2014 like it did with two of Calabretta\u2019s co-defendants \u2014 then Calabretta\u2019s sentence represents a 12-month upward variance from the applicable Guidelines range. Nor is this a situation where the District Court made clear that Calabretta\u2019s career offender status did not have an effect on his sentencing range. At his sentencing hearing, the District Court repeatedly emphasized Calabretta\u2019s criminal history and lack of reform following his prior convictions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, we cannot presume that the District Court would have likely imposed the same sentence had Calabretta not been designated a career offender. It is possible \u2014 perhaps even likely, given the below-Guidelines. sentences of Calabretta and those of his co-defendants \u2014 that the District Court still would have imposed a below-Guidelines sentence under the correct Guidelines range.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">We are convinced that if we were to affirm Calabretta\u2019s sentence, which was-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>imposed against the backdrop of a legally incorrect career offender designation and a significantly higher Guidelines range, it would indeed seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. See Madrid, 805 F.3d at 1212 (\u201c[Wjhen the correct application of the sentencing laws would likely significantly reduce the length of the sentence, circuit courts have almost uniformly held the error to implicate fundamental fairness issues.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); cf. Tai, 750 F.3d at 320 (\u201c[W]e exercise our discretion to correct the error because it increased the sentence without the necessary fact finding and thereby affected the integrity of the proceedings.\u201d).

However, a later panel of that court found that any such sentencing error was not \u201cobvious\u201d or \"plain\u201d in light of the circuit precedent holding that advisory Guidelines could not be void for vagueness. See United States v. Ellis, 815 F.3d 419, 421 (8th Cir.2016).

But the conclusion in Matchett that criminal defendants are never entitled to fair notice under an advisory Guidelines system does not necessarily flow from Irizarry. Under Irizarry, defendants do not have a due process right over any expectation to be sentenced within the advisory Guidelines range, when a district court, after considering the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), applies a discretionary variance and imposes a sentence outside of the recommended range. 553 U.S. at 713, 128 S.Ct. 2198. At issue in the case before us is not a district court\u2019s discretionary variance. We are instead concerned with the imposition of a sentence where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>criminal defendant has been incorrectly designated a career offender as a matter of law\u2014 a question over which we exercise de novo review. See United States v. Grier, 475 F.3d 556, 570 (3d Cir.2007) (en banc). However, as we hold that the due process concerns over arbitrary enforcement are implicated here, we need not decide whether the residual clause of section 4B1.2 also denied Calabretta fair notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">. In reaching this holding, we do not address the continued viability of other, similar residual clauses present in other statutes. In particular, we emphasize that the residual clause of ACCA and the career offender Guideline are not only identical in their wording but are also linked to a list of four enumerated offenses (preceding the residual clauses) that qualify as crimes of violence: burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) (limiting enumerated \u201cburglary\u201d offense to \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d). In Johnson, the Supreme Court indicated that ACCA\u2019s \"confusing list of examples\u201d may have contributed to that residual clause\u2019s arbitrariness and unpredictability. 135 S.Ct. at 2561. The language at issue here is the same in that regard. Thus, we need not consider \u2014 and so leave for another day \u2014 whether a similar residual clause without an exemplary' list of offenses would be subject to the same degree of due process concern that the Supreme Court identified in Johnson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"A1GB\">.

Calabretta\u2019s direct appeal was already pending at the time of the Johnson decision. See Griffith v.

Our dissenting colleague suggests that the applicability of Amendment 782 should not weigh in favor of exercising our discretion to remand for resentencing as retroactive relief is available to Calabretta now that he is no longer considered a career offender. However, a district court is limited in its ability to resentence a criminal defendant who is eligible for relief under Amendments 782 and 788. Unless a defendant received a sentencing departure pursuant to a Government motion regarding substantial assistance, a district court cannot grant a sentence reduction that is less than the minimum of the amended Sentencing Guidelines range. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. Thus, if Cal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>abrelta could only seek relief through a sentencing reduction motion made pursuant to Amendments 782 and 788, the minimum sentence he could receive is 87 months of imprisonment. If, however, we remand for resen-tencing, the District Court could decide to impose a sentence as low as 60 months \u2014 the mandatory minimum sentence. This difference also weighs in favor of us exercising our discretion to afford relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b164-10\">.

Our dissenting colleague contends that the District Court \u201cdid not apply the career offender Guidelines range,\u201d and emphasizes repeatedly that the District Court indicated that Calabretta's sentence was the \u201cminimum sentence sufficient.\u201d But the District Court did apply the career offender Guideline, even though it ultimately sentenced Calabretta to a below-Guidelines sentence. By indicating that it was imposing the \"minimum sentence sufficient,\u201d the District Court was simply following the statutory text of section 3553(a), which requires district courts to \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes [of criminal sentencing].\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). This \"parsimony\u201d principle is so inherent in the sentencing process that district judges need not even announce their adherence to it when sentencing a criminal defendant. See United States v. Dragon, 471 F.3d 501, 506 (3d Cir. 2006) (\"[W]e hold that district judges are not required by the parsimony provision to routinely state that the sentence imposed is the minimum sentence necessary to achieve the purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2).\u201d). Merely quoting this language should not insulate a sentence from harmless error or plain error review. The District Court never indicated that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of Calabretta\u2019s career offender status. Rather, the District Court imposed what it determined was the \"minimum sentence sufficient\u201d in considering the section 3553(a) factors \u2014 which includes \"the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set forth in the guidelines.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(A). Thus, if the District Court were applying the section 3553(a) factors as is statutorily required, then its calculation of the \"minimum sentence sufficient\u201d necessarily included consideration of the recommended Guidelines range, including Calabretta's career offender status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\">. Our dissenting colleague suggests that we are trying to \"have it both ways\u201d by \u201cattempting to undertake such a prediction [of what the District Court will do on remand] while, at the same time, arguing that [the dissent is] undergoing a speculative analysis\u201d of its own. Dissent Op. at 146-47. We are not speculating about the District Court\u2019s actions. The dissent, however, reads such certainty into this scant record that it would lead to affirmance of a 120-month sentence despite a significant Guideline miscalculation. Our position is that any prediction of what the District Court would have done about sentencing if it had calculated the Guidelines correctly necessarily calls for speculation and that is the very reason there must be a remand. As noted earlier, the Supreme Court recently instructed that such uncertainty weighs in favor of re-sentencing, not affirmance. See Molina-Martinez, 136 S.Ct. at 1347 (\"Where ... the record is silent as to what the district court might have done had it considered the correct Guidelines range, the court's reliance on an incorrect range in most instances will suffice to show an effect on the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. Indeed, in the ordinary case a defendant will satisfy his burden to show prejudice by pointing to the application of an incorrect, higher Guidelines range and the sentence he received thereunder. Absent unusual circumstances, he will not be required to show more.\u201d). The uncertainty here should be resolved by the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b166-6\">FISHER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ABV\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The majority holds that <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, <em>135 S.Ct. </em>2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), invalidates the residual clause of United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2, removing Michael Calabretta\u2019s status as a career offender. I agree with this portion of the majority\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">But, that is where my agreement with the majority ends, as based on the sentencing record, the majority also finds that the District Court plainly erred when it considered Calabretta\u2019s now-removed career offender status in imposing its sentence. Though I agree that <em>Johnson </em>should apply in this case and that Calabretta no longer meets the career offender criteria, I disagree that the District Court\u2019s careful and thoughtful analysis at sentencing,' which concluded in a sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, was plainly erroneous. I dissent specifically to address the erosion of the doctrine of plain error review in our Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">Michael Calabretta is no smalltime marijuana dealer, just selling some of his stash to a few Mends to support a habit or to make ends meet. Rather, for more than two-and-a-half years, he participated in an extensive cross-country conspiracy that distributed over 100 kilograms of marijuana and he personally laundered more than ten million dollars in drug sale proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">In spite of this formidable backdrop, Calabretta asks us to find that the District Court plainly erred when it imposed a 120 months\u2019 sentence, a sentence that was well below the career offender Guidelines range and can only be viewed as an act of leniency \u2014 the maximum leniency the District Court felt was deserved. We should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>grant his request because, as the District Court clearly found, Calabretta\u2019s sentence was the \u201cminimum sentence sufficient.\u201d J.A. 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">If a defendant fails to timely object at the time a sentence is pronounced, as Cal-abretta failed to, the unpreserved issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Flores-Mejia, </em>759 F.3d 253, 259 (3d Cir. 2014). In order to satisfy the first three prongs of plain error, an appellant must establish that an error occurred, that the error was clear or obvious, and the error affected his substantial rights. If those requirements are met, we move to the fourth prong and determine if the \u201cerror seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Marcus, </em>560 U.S. 258, 262, 130 S.Ct. 2159, 176 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). If after.a fact-intensive analysis we determine that the fourth prong has been established, we have the discretion to remedy the error. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Here, the fourth prong has not been met. The District Court based its sentence on Calabretta\u2019s serious and extensive underlying and prior criminal conduct, not on his career offender status \u2014 and it specifically found that 120 months\u2019 incarceration was the minimum sentence it would impose. This is not an unfair sentence. Nor is it one that will affect the integrity or public reputation of the judiciary. Further, the majority\u2019s holding is troubling because the plain error test, specifically its fourth prong, requires stringent application. This holding will not only affect Calabretta but may affect future proceedings: a broadened plain error analysis will now apply in these cases. I therefore respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Calabretta has a significant criminal history, and he committed a serious crime. The District Court carefully considered these concerns and the other factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and determined that, despite the career offender Guidelines range (that it erroneously found applied), a 120 months\u2019 sentence was sufficient but was the <em>minimum' </em>sentence sufficient. Where the District Court provides this type of specificity, remand is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">In considering Calabretta\u2019s sentence under the fourth prong, we must remember that remand is a discretionary action that we may take only after a full review of the underlying facts. There is no basis for exercising our discretion where evidence otherwise overwhelmingly supports the trial court\u2019s finding or is conclusive. <em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>271 F.3d 93, 106 (3d Cir.2001). Although a scant record cannot uphold a sentence based on an erroneous Guidelines range, \u201c[t]he record in a case may show ... that the district court thought the sentence it chose was appropriate irrespective of the Guidelines range. Judges may find that some cases merit a detailed explanation of the reasons the selected sentence is appropriate.\u201d <em>Molina-Martinez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1338, 1346, 194 L.Ed.2d 444 (2016). This rule of analysis, penned by the Supreme Court in its recent decision in <em>Molinar-Martinez, </em>is based on evidence that indicates the Guidelines are heavily relied upon by district courts in arriving at a sentence \u2014 in most cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">The Supreme Court observed that in a majority of cases, absent a Government motion, district courts imposed sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>within the adopted Guidelines range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This case is an outlier. And, the record provides a clear picture of what the District Court intended. Calabretta was subject to, based on the incorrectly calculated Guidelines range, 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. If \u00a7 4B1.2 had not applied, Calabretta\u2019s Guidelines range would have been 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. Ultimately, Calabretta was sentenced within the applicable Guidelines range that would have applied without the career offender enhancement, receiving a sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. This sentence was outside of the career offender Guidelines range by almost six years and was not the product of a Government motion. Calabret-ta\u2019s sentence is thus in the minority of cases cited in <em>Molina-Martinez </em>and upholding it would not garner ridicule of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">This is unlike a case our sister court grappled with after <em>Molina-Martinez. </em>In <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>823 F.3d 11 (1st Cir.2016); the First Circuit found plain error where the defendant received a sentence that was within an erroneously calculated Guidelines range, despite the district court\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s \u201cquite serious\u201d conduct and extensive criminal history. <em>Id. </em>at 18-19. The <em>Hudson </em>court made this finding, however, because the career offender Guidelines range was the \u201canchoring point\u201d for the imposed sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 19-20. Here, the District Court was aware of the career offender Guidelines range; carefully reviewed Cala-bretta\u2019s substantial underlying conduct, criminal history, and the other statutory sentencing factors; and found that 120 months\u2019 incarceration \u2014 a sentence substantially lower than the career offender Guidelines range \u2014 was the \u201cminimum sentence sufficient\u201d to suit the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. J.A. 143. The career offender Guidelines range was not the anchoring point here, the District Court specifically chose to not apply it to the final sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The majority focuses on the District Court\u2019s failure to specifically state how Calabretta\u2019s career offender designation affected the final sentence, but the record reveals that the District Court provided detailed reasons for how it arrived at the final sentence and why it did not apply the career offender Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Calabretta pleaded guilty to both a distribution offense and a money laundering offense, a plea that allowed him to escape a weightier sentence if the full import of his conduct in the distribution scheme had been considered. At sentencing, the District Court reviewed the underlying investigation which resulted in the recovery of over $1 million from Calabretta\u2019s residence, which was a small part of the earnings from the distribution scheme, and a log book that indicated that Calabretta was involved in laundering drug money through casinos. The District Court found it questionable that Calabretta\u2019s claimed income, which Calabretta said was gambling income, was not a part of the drug distribution scheme..Moreover, the District Court considered the need for deterrence given the purely monetary motivation that drove Calabretta\u2019s conduct, noting that Calabretta and his co-conspirators believed \u201cthat moving large amounts of marijuana was a good way to make lots of money and the record reflects that he did that.\u201d J.A. 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>As for Calabretta\u2019s prior criminal conduct, the District Court found especially-alarming the fact that Calabretta had \u201ctwo dead people whose deaths are directly attributable to [his], frankly, incredible conduct\u201d of drag racing and road rage. J.A. 141. The District Court also considered Calabretta\u2019s eluding offense, where he drove up \u00bfn exit ramp the wrong way, as well as other car thefts and burglaries that Calabretta had committed, which were not predicate offenses under \u00a7 4B1.2. Cala-bretta\u2019s serious criminal history was bolstered by the fact that he committed the drug distribution offense only five years after he was released from jail on his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The District Court did not focus on Cal-abretta\u2019s career offender status. To the contrary, it specifically determined not to sentence him within the career offender range: \u201c[T]he top of [the Guidelines range] was 235 months.... If I sentence you to the top of that [Guidelines range, you\u2019d be getting out when you were an old man.\u201d J.A. 143. The District Court instead focused on the specific case at hand \u2014 Cala-bretta\u2019s significant criminal history and culpability in the underlying offense. It found that it was \u201csatisfied that a very substantial sentence is required here in order to, first of all, deter others who might be inclined to make millions of dollars quickly and easily from doing it; secondly, to get through to [Calabretta] that if [he] thought [he] had reformed, reforming by becoming a drug dealer is not reforming.\u201d J.A. 142. This led the District Court to find that a sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment was the \u201cminimum sentence sufficient\u201d \u2014 -a sentence that was well below the career offender Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The majority faults this dissent for its focus on the District Court\u2019s \u201cminimum sentence sufficient\u201d language. The District Court\u2019s \u201cminimum sentence sufficient\u201d statement, however, followed the District Court\u2019s admonition that it would not sentence Calabretta within a Guidelines range that would lead to his release when he was an old man. The Guidelines range that the District Court chose not to apply, to meet that goal, was the career offender Guidelines range. It is therefore more than reasonable to focus on the \u201cminimum sentence sufficient\u201d language because it followed the District Court\u2019s finding that it was not going to sentence Calabretta within the career offender Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Based on the record before us, there is no plain error. Affirming Calabretta\u2019s sentence would not undermine the integrity of this Court. The District Court provided a detailed explanation of the imposed sentence, a sentence unconnected from the Guidelines. The District Court weighed Calabretta\u2019s potential for recidivism, and we should not ignore that consideration when conducting plain error review, especially where the sentence is far removed from the career offender Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 652 (5th Cir.2010) (considering the defendant\u2019s continued violations of the- law in upholding'his sentence even though the district court had conducted an erroneous Guidelines calculation at sentencing).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">The sentence imposed by the District Court fell within the now-applicable Guidelines range. The majority argues that the potential applicability of Amendment 782,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>which would make Calabretta\u2019s 120 months\u2019 sentence fall outside of the Guidelines range, should change the analysis in this case. But it does not. Calabretta\u2019s Guidelines range would be 87 to 108 months after applying Amendment 782. Calabretta would be eligible to receive a sentence of 87 months\u2019 imprisonment if the District Court, through its discretion, found that sentence to be appropriate. The majority asserts that because of this amended Guidelines range, the District Court could also decide to impose a sentence as low as 60 months, the mandatory minimum sentence for Calabretta\u2019s charged conduct. We cannot predict what the District Court will do. The majority is attempting to undertake such a prediction while, at the same time, arguing that I am undergoing a speculative analysis by relying on the District Court\u2019s actual words during sentencing. The majority cannot have it both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The large disparity between the prior applicable Guidelines range and the sentence imposed, a variance sentence without a Government motion, supports a finding under <em>Molina-Martinez </em>that the District Court gave a fair sentence that was unaffected by the career offender designation. Instead, the sentence was motivated by Calabretta\u2019s own conduct and was the \u201cminimum sentence sufficient\u201d to deter such conduct in the future. Still, the majority cites two of our opinions and a Tenth Circuit opinion in support of its position that such a finding would be \u201cspeculative.\u201d These <em>cases </em>\u2014 United <em>States v. Zabielski, </em>711 F.3d 381 (3d Cir.2013), <em>United States v. Tai, </em>750 F.3d 309 (3d Cir.2014), and <em>United States v. Madrid, </em>805 F.3d 1204 (2015) \u2014 actually support affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\"><em>Zabielski </em>was determined under a harmless error analysis and is distinguishable from our analysis here, which is more stringent. Even if generally applicable, we held that \u201can error is more likely to be harmless when it is clear from the record that the district court decided to vary from the advisory Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Zabielski, </em>711 F.3d at 388. It is clear from the sentencing record, for the reasons above, that the District Court was not considering the career offender Guidelines range. The majority\u2019s assertion that affirming would be based on \u201cspeculation\u201d is unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\"><em>Tai </em>is unhelpful to the majority for the same reasons. We held in <em>Tai </em>that where the record fails to provide guidance as to why a particular enhancement was provided, and the proper fact finding regarding that enhancement is not undertaken, this Court may find that the integrity of the proceedings are affected. <em>Tai, </em>750 F.3d at 319-20. Under such circumstances, this Court cannot speculate as to what facts were considered by the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 320. Again, the record here provides guidance. The District Court reviewed the underlying circumstances, disregarded the career offender Guidelines range, and sentenced Calabretta well below the erroneous range.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Finally, in <em>Madrid, </em>the Tenth Circuit applied <em>Johnson </em>to Madrid, a defendant that had erroneously been found to be a career offender. The court focused on Madrid\u2019s sentence of 188 months, a sentence at the lowest end of the erroneous career offender Guidelines range. The court found that the fourth prong had been met because the \u201ccorrect application of the sentencing laws would likely significantly reduce the length of the sentence\u201d because the now-applicable Guidelines range was 92-115 months. <em>Madrid, </em>805 F.3d at 1212 (internal quotation marks omitted). The facts are distinguishable here. Calabretta was subject to a sentence within the lower, applicable Guidelines range and the District Court chose to forego a career offender sentence, opting to instead sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Calabretta to 120 months, the \u201cminimum sentence sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">This Court should not fall into a trap of finding that every sentence that applied \u00a7 4B1.2\u2019s residual clause requires a remand. I am not suggesting that the fourth prong will never be met if <em>Johnson </em>is applied to others who were incorrectly found to be career offenders. But the sentence that Calabretta received is neither unfair nor will it undermine confidence in the judiciary. Consequently, I cannot assent to the majority finding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Given the record before us, I believe the majority fails to adhere to this Court\u2019s duty to narrowly apply the plain error rule, especially once it reaches the fourth prong. We must be forward thinking and look not only at the underlying proceeding but also to how future judicial proceedings will be affected by our plain error analysis in each case. <em>United States v. Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d 415, 457 n.22 (5th Cir. 2012) (Smith, J., dissenting). The majority\u2019s conclusion that the fourth prong has been met in this case will affect future judicial proceedings by broadening the application of plain error review. Review which has already been eroding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">This prong must be applied vigorously even where an error is found because of an intervening Supreme Court decision. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Huerta, </em>403 F.3d 727, 737 (10th Cir.2005) (discussing the applicability of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)). Consequently, it is important to carefully consider the fourth prong because \u201c[rjeversal for error, regardless of its effect on the judgment, encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process and bestirs the public to ridicule it.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">This public ridicule and encouragement of abuse of process is precisely what we must be aware of in ordering remand in this case. Even if Calabretta\u2019s substantial rights were affected, this \u201ccannot, \u2018without more,\u2019 satisfy the fourth prong of the plain-error analysis, ... and the Supreme Court has instructed that we are authorized \u2018to' correct only particularly egregious errors\u2019 on plain-error review.\u201d <em>United States v. Corso, </em>549 F.3d 921, 931 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">In sentencing matters, this means that we must consider the effect that a too low <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>or too high sentence may have. For instance, a sentence that is too-low will deny the public of its entitlement to a sufficient sentence, but one that is too-high will deny a defendant a certain amount of freedom. <em>United States v. </em>Williams, 399 F.3d 450, 456 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the District Court specifically stated that imprisonment of 120 months was the \u201cminimum sentence sufficient\u201d based on Calabretta\u2019s criminal history and his underlying conduct while discounting the career offender Guidelines range. Calabretta received leniency at the sentencing phase, a leniency that he likely did not deserve, but the District Court made clear this was the only break that Calabretta was entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">It is hard to determine what record, if not the one here, would not meet the majority\u2019s standard for plain error. A district court will now be required to specifically say, no matter what happens in the future, the sentence imposed is the only sentence it would give within its discretion. I do not believe that we should implement this rule. We must be especially cognizant of this consideration and ensure that plain error is found only in \u201cexceptional circumstances [for] particularly egregious errors,\u201d is \u201cused sparingly,\u201d and is not collapsed into a harmless error analysis. <em>Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d at 433, 435. When applying the specific facts in this case, I believe that the majority has lost sight of the stringent test we must apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">I dissent in order to caution this Court to review how the facts in this case will impermissibly broaden the doctrine of plain error review. The District Court\u2019s reasoned analysis at sentencing, and careful consideration of the correct sentence for a weighty drug dealer, requires Cala-bretta\u2019s sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment to stand, and remand, accordingly, should not be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-10\">. As the majority notes, <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>application to \u00a7 4B1.2 was considered by the Eleventh Circuit in <em>United States v. Matchett, </em>802 F.3d 1185 (11th Cir.2015). The <em>Matchett court was </em>concerned that other sections of the Guidelines may be invalidated if the void-for-vagueness doctrine is applied to \u00a7 4B1.2 via <em>Johnson </em>and rejected the petitioner's argument that <em>Johnson </em>invalidates \u00a7 4B1.2\u2019s residual clause. I recognize Judge Pryor\u2019s well-written opinion and the possible future consequences the adoption of <em>Johnson </em>may have. <em>See also United States v. Ellis, </em>815 F.3d 419, 422 (8th Cir.2016) (finding that it is not \"obvious that the guidelines are susceptible to a constitutional vagueness challenge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-16\">On the other hand, several circuits and this Court \u2014 as outlined by the majority \u2014 have applied ACCA holdings to identically-worded sections of the Guidelines, including those courts that have already considered <em>Johnson </em>and applied it to \u00a7 4B1.2. Accordingly, based on our precedent, I join the majority in applying <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-5\">. \"In less than 20% of cases since 2007 ... district courts imposed above- or below-Guidelines sentences absent a Government motion ...
