Mr. Mora contends that the sentence imposed by the district court was unnecessarily lengthy and, therefore, substantively unreasonable. After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-23\">We review a sentence for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51,128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reversal is appropriate if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-24\">The district court found \u2014 and there is no challenge to this finding on appeal\u2014 that Mr. Mora distributed 42.5 kilograms of cocaine. That quantity of drugs, com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>bined with a Criminal History Category of II, established an advisory range of 210-262 months\u2019 imprisonment under the Sentencing Guidelines for Mr. Mora. <em>See </em>D.E. 199 at 41. At sentencing, Mr. Mora, through counsel, requested a sentence toward \u201cthe lower end of the guidelines.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The government, in contrast, sought a sentence at the top of the guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 45-46. The district court, as noted above, sentenced Mr. Mora to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment after indicating that it had considered all of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and noting that the sentence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing. <em>See id. </em>at 47-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">Because Mr. Mora did not request a variance, and sought only a sentence near the lower end of the guidelines \u2014 i.e., a sentence of around 210 months \u2014 his challenge on appeal is to a sentence which is, at most, 30 months more than he requested.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We ordinarily expect that a sentence within the advisory guidelines will be reasonable, <em>see United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008), and on this record, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s 240-month sentence constituted an abuse of discretion. First, there was evidence that Mr. Mora sold one of the kilogram of cocaine for $30,000. <em>See </em>D.E. 198 at 31. Using that figure as a ballpark price, Mr. Mora\u2019s sales totaled approximately $1 million. Mr. Mora, in short, was not a small-time dealer. Second, Mr. Mora committed the narcotics offenses after re-entering the country illegally. Third, Mr. Mora used a number of aliases. Fourth, the district court found that Mr. Mora had obstructed justice by providing false testimony at the bench trial. <em>See </em>D.E. 199 at 41. Indeed, the district court said that it was \u201cunable to accept anything that [Mr. Mora] ha[d] testified about.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">Mr. Mora nevertheless asserts that the district court should have given more weight to the fact that he will be deported to Mexico once he completes his sentence. As Mr. Mora puts it, he \u201cwill have no reason to try and re-enter the [United States] once he is free\u201d and in \u201cmiddle age with no family or community ties here[.]\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 29. That argument does not carry the day for Mr. Mora, who has already chosen to re-enter the country illegally, with no family or community ties, to sell drugs. And, because there is no mandatory retirement age for those in the drug trade, there is no guarantee that Mr. Mora, who will be in his mid-50s when he finishes his sentence, will choose to engage in legitimate work once he is released.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b23-16\">. The government argues that we should review only for plain error, but we need not address this contention because the sentence is reasonable under the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b24-5\"><em>. </em>We do not mean to suggest that 30 months in custody is insignificant for Mr. Mora (or for any other defendant). We note only that, because of his request to the district court for a sentence towards the lower end of the guidelines, the reasonableness challenge is to a sentence that is at most 30 months more than he asked for.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
