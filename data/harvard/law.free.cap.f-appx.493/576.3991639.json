He argues that the district court committed reversible plain error when it increased his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Garcia did not object to the increase in the district court; therefore, review of his argument is for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To establish plain error, Garcia must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affected his substantial rights. If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but will do so only if it seriously impinges the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-19\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 12-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level if the defendant was previously deported after a conviction for a felony that is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and where the conviction does not receive criminal history points. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as any of several enumerated offenses, including aggravated assault. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment (n.l(B)(iii)). The commentary also defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201cany other offense ... that has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-20\">Garcia argues that his aggravated assault conviction is not an enumerated \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because the 1992 statute under which he was convicted encompasses behavior that is not within the plain, ordinary meaning of aggravated assault. The applicable statute provided, in relevant part, that a person commits an aggravated assault if, during the commission of an assault, the person: (1) \u201ccauses serious bodily injury to another\u201d; or (2) \u201cthreatens with a deadly weapon or threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ens to cause bodily injury or causes bodily injury\u201d to listed state, county, or municipal employees; or (3) \u201ccauses bodily injury to a participant in a court proceeding;\u201d or (4) \u201cuses a deadly weapon.\u201d Tex. Penal Code ANN. \u00a7 22.02(a)(West 1990). The statute also provided that an offense under \u00a7 22.02 was a third degree felony, except in limited cases involving a peace officer. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 22.02(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Where, as here, the statute contains a series of disjunctive elements, this court looks to specific documents to determine which subpart of the statute formed the basis of the conviction. <em>See United States v. Mungia-Partillo, </em>484 F.3d 813, 815 (5th Cir.2007). A review of these documents supports Garcia\u2019s assertion that he was convicted of the third degree felony of aggravated assault for committing an assault while using a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The Guidelines do not define the enumerated offenses that qualify as crimes of violence; therefore, this court uses a common sense approach, giving each offense its generic, contemporary meaning, and then determines whether the conviction falls within such meaning. <em>United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324, 327 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cWhen the statute of conviction encompasses prohibited behavior that is not within the plain, ordinary meaning of the enumerated offense, the conviction is not a crime of violence as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In <em>United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199 (5th Cir.2007), this court considered a more recent version of the Texas aggravated assault statute and concluded that the defendant\u2019s conviction under that statute qualified as the enumerated offense of aggravated assault and, thus, a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2. Garcia cites no circuit precedent which supports his assertion that the phrase \u201cor exhibits\u201d in the more recent version of the Texas aggravated assault statute undermines the applicability of <em>Guillen-Alvarez </em>to his case. Further, there is nothing in the court\u2019s decision in <em>Guilleiu-Alvarez </em>which would suggest a different result. Moreover, none of the cases cited by Garcia support his suggestion that the Texas courts have interpreted the term \u201cuse\u201d to include the mere \u201cinert presence\u201d of a weapon. Because Garcia cites no authority from this court which supports his contentions, this court will not find plain error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Garcia has failed to establish clear or obvious error in the district court\u2019s determination that his aggravated assault conviction was a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b). Accordingly, we need not decide whether the offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force against the person of another. <em>See, e.g., Guilleitr-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d at 199 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b599-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
