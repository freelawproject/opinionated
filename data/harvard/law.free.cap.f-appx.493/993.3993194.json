We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-20\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Berrio\u2019s challenge to the denial of his application for asylum and denial of relief under the Convention. Berrio failed to petition for review of the order of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), and his motion for reconsideration did not affect the finality of that order, <em>see Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2005). We dismiss this part of Berrio\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-21\">Berrio abandoned any argument that he could have raised about the denial of his motion to reconsider. Berrio quotes a part of the order denying his motion to reconsider, but he uses the quote in support of his argument that he suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution. Berrio fails to argue that the Board erred in denying his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>for reconsideration. <em>See Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1145 (11th Cir. 2010); <em>see also Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">We dismiss in part and deny in part Berrio\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
