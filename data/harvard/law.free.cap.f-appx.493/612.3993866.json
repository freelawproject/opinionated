He contends the court abused its discretion by: improperly <em>relying on his </em>alleged participation in the Fish Bowl drug-trafficking ring; failing to consider the various classes he completed during imprisonment; and refusing to reduce his sentence in retaliation for his successful appeal in <em>United States v. Rhine, </em>583 F.3d 878 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-23\">The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). In considering Rhine\u2019s motion, the district court was required to, and expressly did, assess the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The court properly considered Rhine\u2019s alleged participation in the Fish Bowl drug-trafficking ring as part of his history under \u00a7 3553(a)(1). <em>United States v. Rhine, </em>637 F.3d 525, 529 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012). Although Rhine contends the district court failed to properly consider his post-sentencing conduct, such consideration is not required. <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673 &amp; n. 10; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment n. l(B)(iii). Rhine\u2019s retaliation claim also fails:</p>\n<p id=\"b634-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b634-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
