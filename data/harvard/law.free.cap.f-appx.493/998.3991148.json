The district court imposed a sentence of 70 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the bottom of the advisory range of 70-87 months under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines. On appeal, Mr. Ramales-Castillo \u2014 who requested a downward departure and downward variance to a sentence of 36 months \u2014 contends that the 70-month sentence was substantively unreasonable. We disagree, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">We review a sentence for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Reversal is appropriate if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in'weighing the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>bane).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">On this record, the 70-month sentence, which was within the advisory guideline range, was not substantively unreasonable. First, as the district court noted, Mr. Ra-males-Castillo returned to the United States only a week after being removed, and this showed that he did \u201cnot intend to comply\u201d with the law. Second, after returning to the United States illegally, Mr. Ramales-Castillo was convicted of battery in Georgia. Third, Mr. Ramales-Castillo had a number of prior felony convictions\u2014 resulting in a criminal history category of V \u2014 and the district court found that he had \u201cengaged in pretty serious criminal activity\u201d ranging from \u201csignificant property offenses to significant drug offenses.\u201d Fourth, the district court considered, and rejected, the claim of cultural assimilation (under a downward departure theory and a downward variance theory), <em>see, e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. (n. 8), because Mr. Ramales-Castillo had moved to Georgia while his family remained in California, the conduct in which Mr. Ramales-Castillo had engaged \u201cpresented] serious risk to the community,\u201d and although Ramales-Castil-lo had been in the United States \u201cfor a long time, there [was] not a lot of evidence that he ha[d] become part of the American fabric.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
