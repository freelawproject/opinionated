Stevens argues, for the first time, that the district court should have used a lower base offense level because he had a minimal role in the conspiracy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-28\">Stevens agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to distribute cocaine in exchange for the dismissal of a second charge for distributing cocaine. At the change of plea hearing, Stevens admitted that he was a member of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Stevens\u2019 presentence investigation report stated that Stevens drove from Washington, D.C. to obtain a shipment of cocaine being delivered on a ship sailing from Panama to the Port of Savannah, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Georgia. The supplier offered an undercover agent $5,000 to retrieve the cocaine from a container on the ship and deliver the cocaine to Stevens. After federal agents seized the cocaine from the ship, the supplier told the undercover agent that Stevens was in Pooler, Georgia, and gave the agent Stevens\u2019 phone number to arrange the delivery. The agent met Stevens in a hotel room while Stevens\u2019 cohort, Walkes Crosdale, waited outside in a vehicle. Stevens conversed with the agent about the cocaine, and after the agent gave Stevens the cocaine, he arrested Stevens. Stevens agreed to cooperate with the authorities, and he delivered the cocaine to Letroye Barber in Beltsville, Maryland. Stevens did not challenge the facts in the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Stevens\u2019 presentence investigation report attributed to him 3.45 kilograms of cocaine. The report provided a base offense level of 28, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6) (Nov. 2011), reduced the level by two points for Stevens\u2019 minor role in the offense, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3B 1.2(b), and increased Stevens\u2019 offense level by two points for obstruction of justice, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. With a criminal history of II, the report provided an advisory guideline range between 86 and 108 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Stevens objected to the report. Stevens challenged the two-point enhancement of his sentence for obstruction of justice. Stevens also argued that he was entitled to a three-point reduction of his offense level for his acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">At the sentencing hearing, Stevens, through counsel, argued that he was entitled to a two-point reduction for his acceptance of responsibility, and he asked the district court to \u201cconsider the other considerations ... and apply a balancing test of some sort.\u201d Stevens requested that the district court consider his \u201cvery limited role\u201d in the \u201centire conspiracy\u201d in which he \u201chad limited participation\u201d and \u201ca specific job with a limited benefit.\u201d Stevens acknowledged that \u201cthe government ha[d] agreed to assign [him] a two-level reduction for a ... minor role,\u201d and Stevens asked the district court to \u201cconsider the fact that [he] was a minimal participant in [the] whole operation as just being a mere conduit for the drugs\u201d and \u201cto either find that [he was] somewhere in between that point, or either would play a minimal role due to the limitations and discretion and participation.\u201d Stevens then argued about the sentencing factors and requested that the district court \u201cconsider going below the guideline range or factoring in the other reductions which we have stated.\u201d The district court adopted the facts included in the presentence investigation report, denied Stevens\u2019 objections to the report, denied his request to vary downward from the advisory guideline range, and sentenced Stevens to 87 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">We review for plain error because Stevens did not object to the minor role assigned to him in the presentence report. Stevens instead requested leniency in sentencing, and he argued that a finding that he had served a minimal role supported his request to vary downward from the advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The district court did not plainly err by not granting Stevens a minimal role reduction. The record supports the adjustment to Stevens\u2019 offense level for playing a minor role because he was \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5. Stevens knowingly entered a conspiracy to distribute cocaine for which he was entrusted to transport a large quantity of that drug from Georgia to Maryland. To obtain a further downward adjustment for a minimal role, Stevens had to prove that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved\u201d in the conspiracy, as evidenced by a \u201clack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 BB1.2 cmt. n. 4; see <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 941-46 (11th Cir.1999). That Stevens served as a drug courier is not dispositive; instead, we look at his relevant conduct. <em>Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940-42. Of the four participants, Stevens had a lesser role than the supplier, but Stevens failed to introduce any evidence that his conduct was less significant than the conduct of either Crosdale or Barber.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">We AFFIRM Stevens\u2019 sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
