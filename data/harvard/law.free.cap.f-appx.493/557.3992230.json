He argues that the district court committed error by enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his prior Texas conviction for aggravated robbery. Because Sanchez-Lopez raised this argument in the district court, our review is de novo. <em>United States v. Sandoval-Ruiz, 543 </em>F.3d 733, 734-35 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), a defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by 16 levels if he was previously deported after a conviction for a crime of violence. The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 provides that a prior conviction is a crime of violence if it qualifies as an enumerated offense or has \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Robbery is an enumerated crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). In <em>United States v. Santiesteban-Heman-dez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378-82 (5th Cir.2006), we held that the definition of robbery under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 29.02 substantially corresponds to the generic, contemporary meaning of robbery and thus qualifies as an enumerated offense under \u00a7 2L1.2. Accordingly, it follows that the offense of aggravated robbery, as set forth in \u00a7 29.03 of the Texas Penal Code, is also a crime of violence because it includes every element required for a conviction under \u00a7 29.02. <em>See </em>\u00a7 29.03(a). Sanchez-Lopez therefore has not shown that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b579-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
