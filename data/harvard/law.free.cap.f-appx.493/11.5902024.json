For the following reasons, we shall affirm the district court\u2019s Final Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-16\">Alan Goldberg is the bankruptcy trustee in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy of Debtor, Akram Niroomand. In May of 2008, a judgment of $2,930,899.97 was entered against the Debtor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> About a year prior to this judgment, and eighteen months prior to filing for bankruptcy protection, the Debtor hired Howard D. Rosen and Don-levy-Rosen <em>&amp; </em>Rosen, P.A. to prepare numerous legal documents and to create and fund the Niroomand Family Trust, an offshore asset protection trust. The Debtor paid the law firm $45,000 in fees and costs for these services. At a later point, the Debtor repatriated the trust funds for fear of being held in contempt of the judgment against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-17\">The Trustee brought the underlying adversary proceeding against the defendants seeking to recover the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs as fraudulent transfers under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548. The Trustee\u2019s theory of fraud was that the Debtor was insolvent at the time of these transfers. The Trustee also asserted damage claims for legal malpractice and unjust enrichment against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-19\">The bankruptcy court conducted a bench trial of the Trustee\u2019s claims. The Trustee presented only the testimony of the Debt- or and then rested, although the district court admitted \u201cvoluminous documentary and testimonial evidence.\u201d Included in that evidence was the Debtor\u2019s Affidavit of Solvency executed when she retained the defendants\u2019 services in which she testified that she was solvent and could pay her anticipated debts, including lawsuit judgments. The record contained as well her Verified Answers to Written Questions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The Trustee offered no expert testimony in support of his legal malpractice claim against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">The Debtor testified that she was insolvent at the time of the transfers, but the record evidence, including her affidavits of solvency, was used to impeach her. As a result, the bankruptcy court did not credit her testimony. Instead, in response to defendants\u2019 oral motion for judgment based on partial pleadings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(c), the court found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-5\">The plaintiffs case consisted of one witness, which in the first place the Court did not find credible, but, in addition, the evidence presented is rather clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-6\">While, I never found any evidence about legal malpractice, I\u2019m looking for what could possibly be argued as unjust enrichment. As to the constructive fraud, fraudulent transfer, the Court thinks it\u2019s abundantly clear that there\u2019s been no establishment of insolvency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-7\">In fact, the record is abundant with records of solvency. The witness signed a solvency affidavit, which she said she did not read, but the Court notes \u2014 noted that the witness could remember some things in the way of financial numbers of a rather complicated structure down to the penny, and other things, she couldn\u2019t remember at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-8\">But aside from that, it\u2019s the opinion of the Court that the plaintiffs case is woefully lacking in any proof on any of the counts, and, therefore, the motion to dismiss should be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">In denying the Trustee\u2019s motion for a new trial, the bankruptcy court noted that the evidence at trial \u201cconsisted solely of the testimony of witnesses whose testimony totally supported the Defendants,\u201d and that \u201cthe evidence in this case is woefully lacking \u2014 in fact, the evidence is non-existent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">In reviewing the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment, the district court concluded that the evidence in support of the Trustee\u2019s claims was \u201cwoefully lacking.\u201d The district court noted that there was no evidence of legal malpractice or unjust enrichment, and that the credible evidence supported a finding that the Debtor was solvent, not insolvent, at the time she made the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-13\">Our review of the record supports the district court\u2019s view. We do not find any support in the record for the Trustee\u2019s claim that the bankruptcy court did not consider the documentary evidence in reaching its conclusions. Nor do we find support for the Trustee\u2019s assertion of clear error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that the Debtor was solvent at the time of the transfers. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8013; <em>Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 308, 119 S.Ct. 1961, 144 L.Ed.2d 319 (1999) (\u201cfindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\u201d). The bankruptcy court heard the Debtor\u2019s testimony and discredited it. This is entirely within its province. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8013. <em>See Grupo, id. </em>(\u201cdue regard shall be given to the opportunity of the [bankruptcy] court to judge the credibility of the witnesses\u201d). Further, the record supported a finding that the Debtor was solvent at the time of the transfer so that the bankruptcy court was entitled to make such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">Finding no clear error, we shall affirm the judgment of the district court upholding the bankruptcy court\u2019s Final Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-15\">There are cross-motions for sanctions pending in this case. In addition there is a motion to strike portions of the Trustee\u2019s reply brief. Finding no merit to these motions, they shall be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>AFFIRMED.
