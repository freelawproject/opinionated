The court sentenced him to a six month suspension of his driver\u2019s license, a $1,000 DEDR penalty, a $15 Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty and a $25 laboratory fee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The juvenile was apprehended after he fled at the sight of a police officer and ran home. As the juvenile was entering his house with the officer in pursuit, he dropped a plastic package containing a white powdery substance. A police officer who performed a field test on the substance reported that it was \u201cnot positive for cocaine.\u201d However, a State Police forensic scientist subsequently concluded on the basis of a laboratory test that the substance was cocaine. A \u201ccertified laboratory report\u201d of the State Police analysis was admitted into evidence over the objection of the juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In admitting the laboratory certificate into evidence, the trial court relied exclusively upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19, a section of the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act of 1986, A. 1987, <em>c. </em>106, which provides that the certificate of an employee of a state forensic laboratory shall \u201cbe admissible evidence of the composition, quality, and quantity of the substance submitted to the laboratory for analysis.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19b. A party intending to offer such a certificate must give notice of that intention to the opposing party at least 20 days before the proceeding begins. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19c.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The opposing party then has. 10 days to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>object and to state \u201cthe grounds for the objection.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cA proffered certificate shall be admitted in evidence unless it appears from the notice of objection and specific grounds for that objection that the composition, quality, or quantity of the substance submitted to the laboratory for analysis will be contested at trial.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The juvenile\u2019s only argument on appeal is that his rights under the Confrontation Clauses of the United States and New Jersey Constitutions were violated by the admission of the certified laboratory report pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The Supreme Court of the United States has consistently held that the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution \u201cdoes not necessarily prohibit the admission of hearsay statements against a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. -, -, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>3139, -, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, 651 (1990). Generally, for hearsay to be admissible under the Confrontation Clause, the state must show both that the hearsay has sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d to warrant its admission and that the declarant is unavailable. <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>56, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). But some forms of hearsay are considered sufficiently reliable to satisfy the requirements of the Confrontation Clause without showing the unavailability of the declarant. <em>See United States v. Inadi, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>387, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986). Thus, the threshold requirement for admission of any hearsay is a showing of reliability. <em>Idaho v. Wright, supra; Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>171, 181-184, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2775, 2782-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>2783, 97 L.Ed.2d 144, 156-158 (1987). This requirement can be satisfied either by a showing that \u201cthe hearsay statement \u2018falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,\u2019 or ... by \u2018a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Idaho v. Wright, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at -, 111 L.Ed.2d at 653, quoting <em>Ohio v. Roberts, supra, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>at 66, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\"> A laboratory report offered in evidence to prove the composition, quality or quantity of an alleged controlled dangerous substance is hearsay. <em>Evid.R. </em>63. Therefore, the party offering the evidence must establish its admissibility under a hearsay exception. And where the State offers such evidence in a criminal trial, it also must satisfy the requirements of the Confrontation Clause by showing that the hearsay exception is \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d or, alternatively, that the evidence possesses \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Idaho v. Wright, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at -, 111 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Our courts have previously considered the admissibility of laboratory reports to establish the composition, quality or quantity of controlled dangerous substances under the \u201cbusiness entries\u201d hearsay exception of <em>Evidence Rule </em>63(13) and the \u201cpublic reports\u201d exception of <em>Evidence Rule </em>63(15)(a). <em>See, e.g., State v. Matulewicz, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>27, 499 A.2d 1363 (1985); <em>State v. Flynn, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>215, 494 A.2d 350 (App.Div.1985), remanded to Law Division for reconsideration in light of <em>Matulewicz, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>446, 511 A.2d 634 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">In <em>Matulewicz </em>the issue was the admissibility of a laboratory report to prove that the substance found in the defendant\u2019s possession was marijuana. The Court stated that the linchpin of admissibility of a laboratory report under <em>Evidence Rule </em>63(13) is its reliability. 101 <em>N.J. </em>at 29-30, 499 A.2d 1363. It also stated that \u201cthe degree of complexity of the procedures utilized in formulating the conclusions expressed in the forensic chemist\u2019s laboratory report [is] critical\u201d in determining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>report\u2019s reliability. <em>Id. </em>at 30, 499 A.2d 1363. However, the Court found the record inadequate to determine the reliability of the procedures utilized in preparing the report. Consequently, it concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">... proofs should be adduced to reflect the relative degrees of objectivity and subjectivity involved in the procedure; the regularity with which these analyses are done; the routine quality of each analysis; the presence of any motive to single out a specific analysis for the purpose of rendering an untrustworthy report, and the responsibility of each State Police chemist to make accurate and reliable analyses. <em>[Id. </em>at 30, 499 A.2d 1363].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The Court also concluded that \u201cconcern for reliability remains paramount\u201d in determining the admissibility of a laboratory report under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(15)(a). <em>Id. </em>at 31, 499 A.2d 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Although the Court in <em>Matulewicz </em>was concerned solely with the interpretation of <em>Evidence Rules </em>63(13) and 63(15)(a), we conclude that the tests for admissibility under these state evidence rules also would provide adequate \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d to satisfy the requirements of the Confrontation Clause. We reach this conclusion because the \u201cbusiness entries\u201d and \u201cpublic reports\u201d hearsay exceptions interpreted in <em>Matulewicz </em>are \u201cfirmly rooted,\" <em>see McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 304 to \u00a7 320 (3d ed. 1984), or, alternatively, because the tests of admissibility set forth in <em>Matulewicz </em>provide \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>See Idaho v. Wright, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>US. </em>at -, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at -, 111 L.Ed.2d at 653. This conclusion is also supported by federal cases which have considered indicia of reliability similar to those identified in <em>Matulewicz </em>in ruling upon the admissibility of laboratory reports under the Confrontation Clause. <em>See, e.g., Pickett v. Bowen, </em>798 F.2d 1385 (11th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. McClintock, </em>748 <em>F.2d </em>1278, 1291-1292 (9th Cir.1984), <em>cert. </em>den. 474 <em>U.S. </em>822, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>75, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>61 (1985); <em>see also United States v. Oates, </em>560 <em>F.2d </em>45, 80-82 (2d Cir.1977); <em>cf. Idaho v. Wright, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at -, 111 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 653 (\u201cAdmission under a firmly rooted hearsay exception satisfies the constitutional requirement of reliability because of the weight accorded longstanding judicial and legislative experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>in assessing the trustworthiness of certain types of out-of-court statements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In admitting the laboratory certificate showing that the substance possessed by the juvenile was cocaine, the trial court did not refer to <em>Evidence Rules </em>63(13) and 63(15)(a) and consequently did not require the State to satisfy the tests of reliability set forth in <em>Matulewicz. </em>Rather, the court admitted the certificate pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19, without any preliminary showing of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Although the legislative commentary to the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act describes <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19 as a hearsay exception, this section does not condition the admissibility of a laboratory certificate upon a showing, as is required under a true hearsay exception, that \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the making of the statement provide sufficient assurance that the statement is trustworthy and that cross-examination would be superfluous.\u201d <em>Idaho v. Wright, supra, \u2014 </em>U.S. at -, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at -, 111 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 655. The admissibility of a laboratory certificate under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19 does not turn on a showing of its reliability but rather on whether the conclusions contained therein \u201cwill be contested at trial.\u201d Therefore, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19 is not a hearsay exception at all, much less a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d one, and its constitutionality cannot be sustained under the kind of analysis applicable to hearsay exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19 is similar to <em>Evidence Rule </em>3, which is designed to facilitate the proof of facts which are not genuinely in dispute. This rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">In civil proceedings, if the judge finds at the hearing that there is no bonafide dispute between the parties as to a material fact, such fact may be proved by any relevant evidence, and exclusionary rules shall not apply, except for Rule 4 or a valid claim of privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">The application of Rule 3 is limited by its express terms to \u201ccivil proceedings.\u201d We have previously observed that criminal cases were excluded from the rule, because a defendant \u201chas no responsibility to concede undisputed facts.\u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>Flynn, supra, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 219 n. 1, 494 A.2d 350. In fact, the Legislature may not constitutionally relieve the State of the burden of proving any element of an offense. <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 <em>U.S. </em>510, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2450, 61 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>39 (1979); <em>State v. Ingenito, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>204, 215 n. 4, 432 A.2d 912 (1981). Thus, if <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19 were construed to impose a burden on a defendant to present conflicting evidence in order to sustain an objection to the admission of a laboratory certificate offered by the State, it would be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">However, we believe that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:35-19 is susceptible to an interpretation which will facilitate the orderly and efficient conduct of trials under the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act while at the same time satisfying constitutional requirements. It is firmly established that a defendant may be required to participate in pretrial discovery in order to facilitate the trial of cases and to avoid unfair surprises to the prosecution. <em>See State v. Montague, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>387, 394-403, 262 A.2d 398 (1970); <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>379, 388, 221 A.2d 199 (1966), <em>cert. </em>den. 385 <em>U.S. </em>980, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>527, 17 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>442 (1966). For example, a defendant may be required to provide a notice of alibi before trial, stating the specific place where he claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense. <em>R. </em>3:11-1. In addition, a defendant who seeks discovery from the state may be required to furnish the state with the reports of his experts, the names of persons whom he may call as witnesses, written statements of witnesses and any tangible evidence in his possession. <em>R. </em>3:13-3(b). The constitutionality of rules establishing these kinds of pretrial procedures has been upheld on the basis that such rules serve \u201c[t]he State\u2019s interest in the orderly conduct of a criminal trial.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>400, 411, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>646, 653, 98 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>798, 811 (1988); <em>see also Williams v. Florida, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>78, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1893, 26 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>446 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Similarly, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:35-19 may be construed to establish a constitutionally valid pretrial procedure for deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>mining whether the State will be allowed to rely upon the certificate of its chemist. If the defendant does not file a timely objection to the certificate, any possible objection is waived and the certificate may be admitted. <em>McCormick on Evidence, supra, </em>\u00a7 52. If defendant does object, he must state specific grounds of objections under the criteria of admissibility set forth in <em>Matulewicz. </em>For example, a defendant may urge that the procedures involved in testing for a drug are highly complex or involve a large measure of subjectivity and consequently that an opportunity should be afforded to cross-examine the expert to determine how a particular test was conducted. A defendant also may urge that the laboratory certificate and any other supporting material submitted by the State do not contain sufficient information to determine the certificate\u2019s admissibility under <em>Matulewicz. </em>And where there is a factual issue as to the reliability of an expert\u2019s test procedures, the State will be required to develop a record to establish the conditions of admissibility of the laboratory certificate. <em>See State v. Matulewicz, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 32, 499 A.2d 1363; <em>R.K v. Dept. of Human Services, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>342, 348-349, 521 A.2d 1319 (App.Div.1987). In other words, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:35-19 may be construed to establish a procedural framework under which the State may ascertain before trial whether a defendant will object to the admission of a laboratory certificate and, if so, whether the certificate satisfies the tests of reliability set forth in <em>Matulewicz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The trial court misconceived the effect of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19 in admitting the State Police laboratory certificate analyzing the substance found in the juvenile\u2019s possession without requiring the State to make any preliminary showing of reliability. This certificate simply indicates that the substance was subject to \u201ccolor tests\u201d and \u201cinfrared spectrophotometry,\u201d as a result of which the State Police chemist concluded that it contained cocaine.. The State did not present any evidence regarding the degree of complexity of the tests conducted by' the State Police, the relative objectivity or subjectivity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>interpretation of the test results, the qualifications and experience of the person who performed the tests or any of the other criteria of reliability of laboratory tests identified in <em>Matulewicz, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 30, 499 A.2d 1363. Moreover, the State did not present any evidence regarding the differences between the field and laboratory tests performed on the substance in order to explain the disparate results produced by those tests. Consequently, the State failed to establish an adequate foundation for the admission of the laboratory certificate, and because this evidence constituted an essential element of the State\u2019s case, the juvenile is entitled to a new trial. <em>State v. Matulewicz, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 32-33, 499 A.2d 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the adjudication of delinquency and remand the matter for a new trial in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The juvenile also was sentenced at the same time for various other acts of delinquency. These sentences included an indeterminate term not to exceed one year at Jamesburg.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The State failed to comply with the requirement that notice of an intention to offer a laboratory certificate be given 20 days before trial. However, it argues that this failure should be disregarded because the juvenile did not object to the admission of the certificate on this ground and he does not claim that any prejudice resulted from the lack of notice. We have no need to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the consequences of the State\u2019s failure to provide timely notice, because the State did not in any event establish the prerequisites for admissibility of the certificate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Our courts have never suggested that the Confrontation Clause of the New Jersey Constitution, Art. I, para. 10, should be interpreted more broadly than the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Therefore, we consider the juvenile\u2019s argument solely under the United States Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
