Four actions were instituted against Daniel Moraca and his mother, defendant Jo Ann Moraca, now known as Jo Ann Moraca Yodice (Yodice), an insured of plaintiff Allstate Insurance Company. Yodice then made claims against Allstate under her homeowner\u2019s policy for defense and indemnity of the claims against her. Allstate then filed a declaratory judgment to determine coverage. Allstate appeals from an order denying its motion and granting Yodice\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The facts in this matter are not disputed. Daniel Moraca, seventeen, had been involved in two accidents within the first four months after he began driving, one of which he pleaded guilty to a charge of careless driving. On April 15, 1986, seven months after he began driving, Moraca was driving his automobile when he struck another automobile owned by Gerald Ramiza, causing the death of two persons and injury to two others. Four personal injury actions against Moraca and his mother, Yodice, arose out of the accident. The claims asserted against Yodice each contended that she failed to exercise sufficient control and supervision of her son in the operation of his automobile and was negligent in permitting her son to own and operate his automobile because she had reason to know of his reckless and negligent driving habits.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Yodice forwarded the complaints to Allstate for defense and indemnification under her Allstate homeowner\u2019s policy, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">Section II FAMILY LIABILITY AND GUEST MEDICAL PROTECTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">Coverage X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">Family Liability Protection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-12\">Losses We Do Cover:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Allstate will pay all sums arising from an accidental loss which an insured person becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damages covered by this part of the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Allstate reserved its rights and filed this action for a declaration of its obligations under its policy of insurance for the negligent supervision claims against its insured. Allstate contends that Yodice\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy expressly precludes coverage for the claims asserted against her under the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">Losses We Do Not Cover:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">5. We do not cover bodily injury or property damages <em>arising out of </em>the ownership, maintenance, use, occupancy, renting, loaning, <em>entrusting, </em>loading or unloading of <em>any </em>motorized land vehicle or trailer. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Yodice\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy was in effect at the time of the accident. She also carried an automobile liability policy issued by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, insuring Yodice and her personal automobile. Moraca was insured by an automobile insurance policy issued by Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Allstate determined that Yodice was an additional insured under her son\u2019s automobile policy and defends both under that policy in the underlying tort litigation. However, Allstate argued that Moraca and Yodice were entitled to excess coverage under Yodice\u2019s Liberty Mutual automobile policy, but not under the homeowner\u2019s policy specifically excluding such coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Yodice answered Allstate\u2019s complaint and counter-claimed for a declaratory judgment that her homeowner\u2019s policy provided coverage for the negligent supervision claims. The other defendants \u2014 plaintiffs in the personal injury actions \u2014 also answered alleging that Allstate was obligated under the homeowner\u2019s policy to defend and indemnify Yodice.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">The trial judge denied Allstate\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of Yodice. He determined that the homeowner\u2019s policy, not Yodice\u2019s automobile policy issued by Liberty Mutual, provided coverage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>required Allstate to indemnify and defend Yodice for negligent supervision claims in the personal injury action. An order was entered consistent with the trial judge\u2019s determination and Allstate appeals. Yodice has not appealed from the determination that Liberty Mutual does not provide coverage under her automobile insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Allstate, relying on <em>Scarfi v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 559 A.2d 459 (App.Div.1989), contends that the trial court erred in concluding that its homeowner\u2019s policy provided coverage for the negligent supervision claims against its insured, Yodice, arising out of her son\u2019s use of his motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Defendants Yodice and Gerald Ramiza, individually and as executor of the estate of Carol Ramiza, et al., and Katherine Ramiza contend that <em>Scarfi </em>continues the status quo and the exclusion does not preclude recovery under the Allstate homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Defendants Yodice and Ramiza argue that <em>McDonald v. Home Insurance Co., </em>97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501, 235 A.2d 480 (App.Div.1967), controls in this case since it is \u201con all fours\u201d with the issue at hand. In <em>McDonald, </em>the plaintiffs sued Home Insurance Company (Home) contending that their homeowner\u2019s policy required Home to defend them in an action brought by Walter Dorman for damages for the death of Dorman\u2019s son. Dorman\u2019s son was a passenger in a car owned by plaintiff\u2019s minor son, Mickey McDonald, and was killed when Mickey drove the car into a tree. Dorman\u2019s complaint alleged that the death of his son was caused by the two-fold negligence of the McDonalds: failing to supervise and control their child, knowing of his violent and dangerous habits; and causing or permitting Mickey to purchase and operate the car. 97 <em>N.J.Super </em>at 502-03, 235 A.2d 480. Home refused to defend the McDonalds on the ground that the homeowner\u2019s policy did not apply \u201cto the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of automobiles while away from the premises.\u201d 97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 503, 235 <em>A.</em>2d 480. However, the court held that Home was obliged to defend the McDonalds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">The <em>action </em>against the McDonalds was not based upon \u201cthe ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of ... automobiles <em>...\" </em>even though the immediate cause of the <em>injury </em>and death of Dorman, Jr. was Mickey\u2019s operation of the automobile. The action was based upon their alleged negligence in failing to supervise and control their child, knowing of his violent and dangerous habits____ The details of the alleged negligence were spelled out in the complaint and included causing and permitting Mickey to purchase and operate the automobile, but nowhere was it alleged that the McDonalds owned, maintained, operated or used the automobile, or that the automobile was negligently driven by them or their agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 503-04, 235 A.2d 480 (emphasis in original). The trial court relied upon <em>McDonald </em>in its determination that the automobile exclusion in a homeowner\u2019s policy did not apply to the facts presented in this case: The trial court did not have the benefit of <em>Scarfi, </em>which was decided subsequent to the trial court\u2019s determination of this matter. <em>Scarfi </em>distinguished, rejected and disapproved of <em>McDonald, </em>as did an overwhelming number of other jurisdictions. 233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 516-19, 559 <em>A.</em>2d 459; <em>see </em>cases cited <em>Standard Mut. Ins. Co. v. Bailey, </em>868 <em>F.2d </em>893, 898 &amp; n. 6 (7th Cir.1989) (\u201cOf the thirty-one jurisdictions that have considered the question, twenty-eight in number have held the policy exclusion [in homeowner policies] applicable to claims of negligent entrustment\u201d); <em>see also </em>Annotation, <em>Construction and Effect of Provision Excluding Liability for Automobile-Related Injuries or Damage From Coverage of Homeowner\u2019s or Personal Liability Policy, </em>6 A.L.R.4th 556, 572 (1981 &amp; Supp.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">In <em>Scarfi, </em>plaintiffs were directors of a corporation, Bratt &amp; Doxey Supply Co., that hired Bubineck to operate a dump truck owned by the corporation. The dump truck was involved in a collision with a school van as a result of which Carlos Arias instituted an action for personal injuries because of Bubineck\u2019s alleged negligent operation of the truck. Aetna\u2019s Business Auto policy insured the corporation against liability resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered auto. 233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 513, 559 A.2d 459. Arias amended his complaint to include claims against the plaintiffs/directors of the corporation for negligence in hiring and training Bubineck. The directors then instituted a declaratory judgment action against Aetna contending that a Comprehensive General Liability (CGL) policy issued to the corporation provided coverage to them for claims against them arising out of the accident. The CGL policy applied to injuries \u201ccaused by an occurrence\u201d but contained the following exclusionary provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">This insurance does not apply: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL\">(b) to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">(1) any automobile or aircraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">(2) any other automobile or aircraft operated by any person in the course of his employment by any insured____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 513, 559 A.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">In construing the CGL policy, the court in <em>Scarfi </em>reviewed the general tenets for construction of an insurance policy and concluded that \u201cwe have no hesitancy in concluding that, under the CGL policy, Aetna had no duty to defend or indemnify plaintiffs with respect to the underlying suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513-14, 559 A.2d 459. The court noted that the CGL policy issued to Bratt &amp; Doxey \u201cplainly and unambiguously excluded or exempted from coverage bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, operation or use of an automobile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515, 559 A. 2d 459. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-13\">Finally, the case relied upon by plaintiffs, <em>McDonald v. Home Ins. Co., </em>97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501 [235 A.2d 480] (App.Div.1967), is distinguishable and does not support a contrary result. <em>See Williamson v. Continental Cas. Co., supra, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>[95] at 99-100 [492 A.2d 1028 (App.Div.1985)]; <em>Barrels [Bar</em>tels] v. Romano, supra, <em>171 </em>N.J.Super. <em>[23] at 28 [407 A.2d 1248 (App.Div.1979)]. To the extent that </em>McDonald v. Home Ins. Co., supra, <em>may be read as support for plaintiffs\u2019 position, we disagree with that holding.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-14\"><em>Id. </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 519, 559 A.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">In reaching its conclusion, the court in <em>Scarfi </em>relied upon the earlier decisions of <em>Williamson v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>95, 492 A.2d 1028 (App.Div.1985), <em>Bartels v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>Romano, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>23, 407 A.2d 1248 (App.Div.1979) and <em>Westchester Fire Insurance Co. v. Continental Insurance Cos., </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 312 A.2d 664 (App.Div.1973), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>152, 319 A.2d 732 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">It cannot be denied that the present case bears a striking resemblance to <em>McDonald </em>in that defendant did not own the car driven by her son, Yodice\u2019s son also was a minor, and she had knowledge of his reckless driving habits. Nevertheless, <em>McDonald </em>is distinguishable in several respects concerning the language of the exclusionary clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Since the <em>McDonald </em>decision, the exclusionary language in homeowners\u2019 policies has been broadened considerably to eliminate coverage in claims involving motor vehicles. As noted above, the exclusionary clause in <em>McDonald </em>was limited \u201cto the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of automobiles while away from the premises.\u201d 97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 503, 235 A.2d 480. The exclusionary clause in the present case has been extended in at least three respects in order to limit coverage for injuries <em>\u201carising out of </em>the ownership, maintenance, use, occupancy ... [or] <em>entrusting </em>... of <em>any </em>motorized land vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The exclusionary clause in the homeowners\u2019 policies in <em>Williamson, Bartels, Westchester, </em>and <em>Scarfi </em>were limited to \u201ca motor vehicle owned, maintained, operated or used <em>by the insured </em>\u201d or words to that effect. <em>Williamson, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 97, 492 A.2d 1028; <em>Bartels, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 26, 407 A.2d 1248; <em>Westchester, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 34-35, 312 A.2d 664; <em>Scarfi, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 513, 559 A.2d 459. Here, the exclusion is not restricted to ownership by the insured; it applies to <em>\u201cany </em>motorized land vehicle\u201d regardless of \u201cownership, maintenance, [or] use.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The adjective \u201cany\u201d is \u201cused to indicate one selected without restriction.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>93 (1983). <em>See Marrero v. Corporacion de Renovacion Urbana Y Vivienda, </em>658 <em>F.Supp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>443, 445 (D.P.R.1987) (exclusionary clause in comprehensive general liability policy \u201cspecifically <em>excludes </em>from its scope \u2018bodily injury arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of ... <em>any vehicle </em>\u2019 \u201d) (emphasis in original). Thus, the exclusionary clause in the present case is not limited to ownership of the vehicle by Yodice. It applies to claims for bodily injuries arising out of the \u201cownership, maintenance, use, occupancy ... [or] entrusting\u201d of <em>any </em>vehicle for which a claim is made for personal injuries. <em>See Westchester, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 41, 312 A.2d 664 (exclusionary clause in homeowner\u2019s policy was applied to the \u201cownership, maintenance, operation, use ... of (1) automobiles\u201d). In <em>Westchester, </em>the court denied coverage under the homeowner\u2019s policy to Holkum, Sr., the father of a passenger who threw a stick out of the rear window of a car and injured a bicyclist.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">It seems clear to us that the language in the [automobile and homeowner\u2019s policies] is mutually exclusive and that, as used in the homeowner\u2019s policy, is specifically designed to exclude coverage provided under language in the standard family automobile policy for injuries arising out of the use of the motor vehicle insured thereunder. The significance of the exclusion in the homeowner\u2019s policy of coverage relating to use of automobiles is underscored by the specific inclusion of coverage with respect to animals, watercraft and tractors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 41-42, 312 A.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Exclusions in homeowners\u2019 policies or comprehensive general liability policies referring to the use, operation, maintenance, and ownership of automobiles, as in <em>McDonald, </em>have been broadened, as in the present case, to exclude injuries <em>arising out of the use </em>of automobiles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Westchester, </em>the court considered that the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d \u201cmust be interpreted in a broad and comprehensive sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 312 A.2d 664 (interpreting coverage clause). <em>See also Williamson, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 100, 492 A.2d 1028. Since <em>McDonald,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>insurers broadened the language of the exclusion to exclude coverage for injuries <em>arising out of the use </em>of automobiles. This distinction was recognized by the Minnesota Supreme Court____ Minnesota has thus joined the vast majority of the states applying the exclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-7\"><em>Pedersen v. Republic Ins. Co., </em>72 <em>Md.App. </em>661, 672, 532 A.2d 183, 188 (1987) (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). <em>Pedersen </em>noted that \u201c[a]t least 25 jurisdictions have held the policy exclusion in question applicable to claims of negligent entrustment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666 &amp; n. 2, 532 A.2d at 186 &amp; n. 2 (citing the 25 cases, including <em>Williamson). </em>The standard for liability <em>arising out of the use </em>of an automobile applies to a suit for negligent entrustment because no harm is done until the entrustee negligently drives the vehicle. <em>Ruggerio v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>107 <em>A.D.2d </em>744, 484 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>106 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The most apparent distinction in cases holding that an exclusionary clause in a homeowner\u2019s policy is either applicable or inapplicable is in the language of the exclusion itself. <em>Bailey, </em>868 F.2d 893, 899 n. 9. For example, in <em>Huggins v. Tri-County Bonding Co., </em>337 S.E.2d 12 (W.Va.1985), the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals held that a motor vehicle exclusionary clause was inapplicable to a negligent entrustment claim. The exclusionary clause in that case provided that the policy did not apply to \u201cownership, maintenance, operation or use ... of land motor vehicles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. In so holding, the Court specifically noted the policy\u2019s \u201clack of any expansive language such as used in other homeowners policies where the language in the automobile exclusion contains the phrase \u2018arising out of\u2019 the ownership, maintenance or use of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">Similarly, with the exception of two Colorado cases ... every other case holding the motor vehicle exclusion [in a homeowner\u2019s policy] inapplicable to a negligent entrustment claim involved a policy provision lacking the \"arising out of\u201d language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-10\"><em>Bailey, </em>868 F.2d at 900 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">In <em>McDonald, </em>the complaint did not specifically mention the tort of negligent entrustment. 97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 502-03, 235 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>A.2d 480. Nevertheless, the court cited <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 308 (negligent entrustment), 316 (Duty of Parent to Control Conduct of Child) (1965). 97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 504, 235 A.2d 480. The tort theory underlying either concept is negligence. <em>See Douglass v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>602 <em>F.2d </em>934, 937 (10th Cir.1979) (a complaint against a parent may be based on either negligent entrustment or negligent supervision). \u201cA parent, for example, like anyone else, may be negligent in entrusting to a child a dangerous instrument such as ... an automobile.\u201d <em>W. Prosser, Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a7 123, at 914 (5th ed. 1984) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Here, the exclusionary clause applies not only to ownership, maintenance, use or occupancy but also \u201centrusting ... of any motorized land vehicle.\u201d Therefore, the homeowner\u2019s policy in the present case specifically excludes coverage for negligent entrustment or supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Defendants point out that in <em>McDonald, </em>as here, the son, not the father, was the owner of the vehicle. Unlike <em>McDonald, in Bartels </em>and <em>Williamson </em>the vehicles were owned by the father and under the homeowners\u2019 policies the exclusions applied because the claims arose out of the ownership and use of a vehicle owned or operated by an insured. <em>Bartels, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 27, 407 A.2d 1248; <em>Williamson, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 105, 492 A.2d 1028. Yet, in <em>Westchester </em>the plaintiffs sued Richard B. Holcombe, whose son threw the stick out of the car, causing injuries to the bicyclist. 126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 40, 312 A.2d 664. Holcombe did not own the motor vehicle, nevertheless, this court held that the claim against Holcombe came within the exclusion of the homeowner\u2019s policy. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 312 A.2d 664. Further, the dump truck in <em>Scarfi </em>was owned by the corporation and the suit for negligence was against the individual directors who were not the owners. Nevertheless, this court held that the same type of exclusion under the comprehensive general liability policy precluded coverage for the individual defendants who were not insureds under that policy. 233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 515-16, 559 A.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In <em>McDonald, </em>the court held that the homeowner\u2019s insurance carrier was obligated to defend: \u201cThe <em>action </em>against the Mc-Donalds was not based upon \u2018the ownership, maintenance, operation, [or] use, ... of ... automobiles____\u2019 ... The action was based upon their alleged negligence in failing to supervise and control their child, knowing of his violent and dangerous habits.\u201d 97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 503, 235 A.2d 480. The court in <em>McDonald </em>looked only to the negligent conduct of the father and ignored the negligent conduct of the son. <em>See id. </em>at 503-04, 235 A.2d 480. This approach to negligent supervision or negligent conduct as excluded under a homeowner\u2019s policy is against the overwhelming weight of authority that followed the leading case of <em>Cooter v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>344 So.2d 496 (Ala.1977).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">While liability (apart from coverage) for negligent entrustment is not conditioned upon the entrustor\u2019s ownership or use of the vehicle, negligent use by one to whom it is entrusted is essential to recovery. It is the occurrence of these dual elements \u2014 negligent entrustment by the owner or custodian of the instrumentality plus its negligent use by the entrustee \u2014 that is missing in the rationale of those cases upholding coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">This approach is known as the \u201cinstrumentality\u201d theory for applying the exclusion to negligent entrustment of automobiles. <em>Pedersen, </em>72 <em>Md.App. </em>at 668, 532 A.2d at 187. The rationale of <em>Cooter </em>was cited and quoted in <em>Williamson, </em>thus rejecting the rationale of <em>McDonald </em>that only the negligent supervision of the parents gave rise to the cause of action. <em>Williamson </em>found: \u201cThe reasoning of <em>Cooter </em>is clearly apposite to the present case. But for Stanley Messer\u2019s negligent use of Mack Messer\u2019s [the father\u2019s] car, no liability could result to Mack Messer.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 104, 492 A.2d 1028. Thus, New Jersey adopted the instrumentality theory. Courts in many other jurisdictions, following <em>Cooter, </em>have held that injuries arising from the negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle are not covered by the standard homeowner\u2019s policy. <em>See </em>cases cited <em>Scarfi, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 516-19, 559 A.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\u201cOn the ground that coverage turns on the cause of injury, rather than on the legal theory asserted against the insured, a number of courts have held that negligent entrustment claims are precluded by the [homeowner\u2019s] policy\u2019s automobile exclusion.\u201d 7A <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 4500 (Berdal ed. Supp.1990) (citing, among others, <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co. v. Kosies, </em>124 <em>Ariz. </em>136, 602 P.2d 517 (Ct.App.1979) (exclusion applied because without the use or operation of an automobile no accident would have occurred); <em>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Gilstrap, </em>141 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>524, 190 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>425 (1983) (vehicle-related conduct did not exist independently of any use of the vehicle and coverage was precluded by the exclusionary clause in a homeowner\u2019s policy); <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Waterhouse, </em>424 A.2d 675, 682 (Del.Super.Ct.1980) (\u201cRegardless of when and where the judgment is made to entrust the O automobile, the essential triggering element giving rise to the tort is the use of the chosen instrumentality \u2014 the automobile\u201d); <em>Farmers Ins. Group of Oregon v. Nelsen, </em>78 <em>Or.App. </em>213, 715 P.2d at 492, <em>rev. denied, </em>301 <em>Or. </em>241, 720 P.2d 1280 (1986) (homeowner\u2019s policy with exclusion for liability arising out of the use of a motor vehicle did not depend on the theory of tort liability asserted and excluded liability on the theory of negligent entrustment); <em>Bankert v. Thresherman\u2019s Mut. Ins. Co., </em>110 Wis.2d 469, 329 N.W.2d 150 (1983) (farmowner\u2019s policy excluded coverage for negligent entrustment of motorcycle; insurance policy does not insure against theories of liability, it insures against \u201coccurrences\u201d that cause injuries)).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">In other words, \u201cnegligent entrustment of a motor vehicle is not independent of, but rather inextricably intertwined with, the more general concepts of ownership, operation, and use of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>868 F.2d at 898. <em>Bailey </em>noted that there are a minority of jurisdictions holding the exclusion inapplicable to claims for negligent entrustment. <em>Id. </em>at 899 &amp; n. 9 (citing <em>McDonald </em>as a minority holding). The view rejecting exclusion seems to require torturing the language in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>exclusionary clause. <em>Rubins Contractors, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co., </em>821 <em>F.2d </em>671, 676 (D.C.Cir.1987).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">Negligent entrustment is composed both of the entrustor\u2019s negligence in entrusting the instrumentality <em>and </em>the entrustee\u2019s negligent use of the instrumentality. Thus, the triggering element is <em>negligent use of the item, </em>for even if the entrustment was negligent, no cause of action could arise without an injury caused by negligent use of the item. Because negligent use is essential, negligent entrustment arises out of the use of a certain instrumentality. Thus, the exclusion applies. This construction is true to the exclusion\u2019s plain meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-6\"><em>South Eastern Fire Ins. Co. v. Heard, </em>626 <em>F.Supp. </em>476, 480 (N.D.Ga.1985); <em>see </em>cases cited <em>id. </em>at 480 n. 10 (applying the same rationale to negligent supervision).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">The isolation in <em>McDonald </em>of negligent supervision or entrustment from the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of an automobile is contrary to the vast weight of authority including subsequent cases in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Defendants point out that in <em>Williamson </em>and <em>Bartels </em>the automobiles were owned by the parents and operated by their sons. Insofar as the torts of negligent entrustment or negligent supervision are concerned, ownership of the instrumentality is not required but merely control of the activity. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 308, 316 (1965). <em>See also Cooter, </em>344 So.2d at 499; <em>accord Bailey, </em>868 F.2d at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Defendants further stress that in <em>Williamson </em>and <em>Bartels </em>coverage was excluded under the homeowner\u2019s policy based on ownership of the vehicles by the parents. They argue that here, as in <em>McDonald, </em>the automobiles were owned, not by the parent, but by the sons. Recall, however, that here the exclusionary clause pertains to any motorized land vehicle regardless of ownership, maintenance or use. Also, in <em>Westchester </em>the exclusionary clause applied \u201cto the ownership, maintenance ... [or] use ... of (1) automobiles.\u201d 126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 41, 312 A.2d 664. Further, in <em>Scarfi </em>the individual directors, who did not own the dump truck involved, were denied coverage under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>CGL policy issued to the corporation that excluded claims \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, [or] use ... of (1) any automobile ... owned or operated by ... any insured.\u201d 233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 513, 559 A.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Also, defendants note that in <em>McDonald, </em>the court was confronted with the issue of coverage or no coverage and that <em>Bartels </em>distinguished <em>McDonald </em>on the ground that there was no contention that McDonald owned, maintained, operated or used the automobile. <em>Bartels, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28, 407 A.2d 1248. <em>See also Williamson, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>at 102, 492 A.2d 1028; <em>Waterhouse, </em>424 A.2d at 681. Although here the record does not reflect the extent of coverage, nevertheless, the automobile owned and operated by Daniel Moraca was covered by automobile insurance. Insofar as coverage is concerned, \u201chomeowner\u2019s insurance is intended to cover risks attendant upon home and related activities, while automobile liability insurance is designed to provide basic coverage for all risks inherent in the use and ownership of motor vehicles.\u201d <em>Waterhouse, </em>424 A.2d at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">In 7a <em>Appleman, supra, </em>\u00a7 4501.02, at 255, it is observed that a homeowner\u2019s policy is merely a personal, comprehensive liability policy which \u201cis simply a combination of the many property and liability coverages desired by the average person.\u201d It is comparatively low in costs, and is primarily a non-business, nonautomobile policy that courts take cognizance of the parties\u2019 intent and reasonable expectations in executing the contract. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe homeowner\u2019s liability policy usually excludes the' ownership, maintenance, operation, or use of an automobile, and the loading or unloading thereof, away from the premises or ways immediately adjoining.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). <em>See also Waterhouse, </em>424 A.2d at 682. \u201cAlthough the homeowner\u2019s policy is not confined to protection for risks arising strictly out of the use of residential premises, it is, as the name suggests, home oriented.\u201d <em>Westchester, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 41, 312 A.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-9\">In order to fall under the ambit of \"arising out of the use\" it is sufficient to show only that the accident or injury \u201cwas connected with,\u201d \u201chad its origins in,\u201d \u201cgrew out of,\u201d \"flowed from,\u201d or \u201cwas incident to\u201d the use of an automobile.
