The plaintiff tendered a bill of exceptions, which was sealed, and the cause removed to this court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-12\"><em>H. Hubbell, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGm\">This case is clearly within the Act of 14th December, 1854, <em>P. L. </em>754. No seal is necessary to a notarial protest: <em>Sto. on Bills </em>195, 299. Notice of nonpayment to the agent was sufficient: <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>8th ed. 361, 521, 529, 503. The protest proves this was done. The bill being payable and protested out of this country, the dishonour of the bill is proved by the production of the protest, without proof of signature or seal: <em>Ch. on Bills </em>361, 489, 490, 642, and note; 20 <em>Wend. </em>85; 3 <em>Kent. Com. </em>93. The notice is sufficiently precise when it puts the party on inquiry: <em>Id. </em>501-2, 506 a, 502; <em>Act 5th April, </em>1849; 2 <em>Peters </em>121. The question of notice should have been left to the jury: 2 <em>J. C. </em>256, 337; 8 <em>J. R. </em>173; 11 <em>J. R. </em>187. If there was a spark of evidence it should have been left to the jury: 10 <em>Watts </em>397.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-13\"><em>Gh. Gibbons, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au_2\">The plaintiffs, by reading the affidavit of defence, proved that they had obtained the bill from the defendant by fraud \u2014 that he received no consideration for it \u2014 and that he had no notice of its non-payment. On the question of fraud and consideration they offered no further evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-14\">The Act of Assembly of Dec. 14, 1854, on which they rely, is not applicable in the case. Wherever the contract is sought to be enforced, it must be regulated and interpreted according to the law of the country in which it was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-15\">It is not a foreign bill, and therefore a notarial certificate of protest would only be evidence of the protest and nothing more: Etting <em>v. </em>Schuylkill Bank, 2 <em>Barr </em>356; Lloyd <em>v. </em>McGrarr, 3 <em>Barr </em>482. It is not evidence of notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-16\">But if the Act of 1854 embraces the whole world, the paper in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>evidence does not fall within it. It declares that the <em>official acts, ho., </em>of notaries public, <em>certified according to law, under their respective hands and seals of office, </em>&amp;c., \u201cmay be received and read in evidence as proof of the facts therein stated,\u201d &amp;c. It happens that this paper is without a seal, and does not even purport to be signed by a notary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Am4\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"ALT\">\"Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWuI\">As drawer and endorser of the protested bill, 'the defendant was entitled to notice of -its dishonour by the acceptor ; and in his affidavit of defence given in evidence against him by the plaintiffs, he swears that he had no notice of it, and never heard of it from any source for more than a year after its maturity. The only evidence relied on by the plaintiffs to affect him with notice, was the certificate of the notary at Rio de Janeiro that he had served the protest on Joshua M. Clapp (the acceptor), in his own name and <em>as agent of the drawer, PranJs Smith. </em>The utmost effect that can be claimed for this certificate is, that it proved notice to the party named; but it is not the slightest evidence of the agency of that party for the defendant. No statute and no rule of the law merchant makes a notarial certificate evidence of such a fact. It was susceptible of competent proof, but none was offered; and the court were right, therefore, in nonsuiting the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">There are sixteen errors assigned upon the record, but these observations answer them all sufficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The judgment is affirmed. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
