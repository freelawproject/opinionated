Johnston at different times and in small sums as per statement of the same hereto annexed, which, with the records of the cases therein mentioned or referred to, are made part of this case stated. The said George W. Johnston retained the said moneys so by him received, and has never paid the same or any part thereof to Joseph Smith, and has since died insolvent. The defendants are the sureties in the official bond of the said George W. Johnston, and in order to avoid a suit on the bond aforesaid, have requested the plaintiff to have a determination of his claim in this form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-7\">If the court should be of opinion that the defendants would be liable for the said money, or any part thereof, so paid to the said George W.

Are the sureties in the official bond of Johnston liable for this money ?</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The bond is conditioned for the payment according to law of all moneys received in his official capacity; that the money for which this action was brought, was received by Johnston as prothonotary, is admitted in the ease stated, and' for money so received the sureties- have agreed to be responsible. Besides, as matter of public convenience, and in accordance with an almost universal practice, we are of opinion that a suitor may lawfully pay the fees due to a prothonotary, whose term has expired, to the actual incumbent of the office, \u2014 and as a necessary consequence, the sureties of the officer receiving the - money are liable for its repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
