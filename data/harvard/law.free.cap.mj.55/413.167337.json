The convening authority approved the court-martial\u2019s sentence to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for 7 years, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The Court of Criminal Appeals found the simple assault and rape charges to be multiplicious and dismissed the assault charge. That court, in an unpublished opinion, directed that appellant receive 22% days of credit towards service of his sentence to confinement for prior punishment he received under Article 15, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 815, for the indecent assault for which he was convicted. Appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>petitions to the Court of Criminal Appeals for a new trial and reconsideration of its initial decision were denied.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">We granted review on the following issue: WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE COMMITTED ERROR WHEN, CONTRARY TO MILITARY RULE OF EVIDENCE 301(f)(3), HE ADMITTED TESTIMONY THAT, WHEN QUESTIONED BY AN INVESTIGATOR BEFORE TRIAL, APPELLANT ELECTED TO REMAIN SILENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY, AFTER DISCOVERING THE ERROR, MADE AN INADEQUATE AND UNTIMELY CURATIVE INSTRUCTION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">We hold that the investigator\u2019s comment on appellant\u2019s silence, in violation of Mil.R.Evid. 301(f)(3), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> was error, but it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">Appellant was the second highest ranking member of a 44-person team performing temporary duty at Sembach Air Base, Germany, in September 1996. During this temporary duty, he and Airman First Class D, the victim of the rape, sodomy, and assault consummated by battery, were billeted in rooms on the second floor of a building. On September 21, 1996, Airman First Class D was returning to her room after performing her duties. On the way to her room, she encountered appellant, who was standing in the hallway holding a beer. Appellant asked Airman First Class D to come into his room. She complied because she thought she was going to receive some corrective counseling. Once she was in the room, appellant locked the door, turned out the lights, and proceeded to rape and sodomize her while holding a knife at her throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">On November 14, 1996, appellant underwent a polygraph examination conducted by Special Agent (SA) Hunter, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). Appellant\u2019s military defense counsel was present during the examination. For this particular examination, military defense counsel and the AFOSI specifically agreed that appellant would waive his rights under Article 31(b), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 831(b), and could be questioned during the pre-polygraph interview as well as during the test itself. The parties agreed that there would be no post-polygraph interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">At trial, SA Hunter was called as a prosecution witness. Without differentiating between the pre-polygraph interview and the post-polygraph interview, SA Hunter related appellant\u2019s version of what occurred on the night of September 21, 1996. In short, appellant\u2019s version was that the victim was the sexually aggressive party, and the two had engaged in consensual sexual intercourse and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>consensual sodomy. The following questions and answers then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">TC: And at the conclusion of the interview, did you confront Sergeant Whitney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">WIT: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">TC: What did you tell him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">WIT: I told him that I didn\u2019t \u2014 did not feel he\u2019d been truthful in his answers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">Q: What did Sergeant Whitney tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">A: He did not say anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">Q: Did he make \u2014 after this, did the interview continue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">A: I escorted him to the door to exit; and on the way out, he extended his hand and thanked me for doing a good job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-13\">TC: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">Trial defense counsel did not immediately object to this line of questioning because this testimony, to the casual observer, referred to the pre-polygraph interview. After the questions by the prosecution, defense counsel clarified the direct examination. Following further examination, two court members asked virtually identical questions: \u201cWhy do you feel TSgt Whitney was not truthful during the interview?\u201d When the trial counsel registered a written objection to the questions, a session followed under Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 839(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">After learning at the Article 39(a) session that SA Hunter\u2019s opinion as to appellant\u2019s untruthfulness was based on his \u201cevaluation\u201d of the polygraph examination, the judge sustained the objection. <em>See United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). Based on the witness\u2019s response, the judge said he would instruct the members to disregard that portion of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">At the request of defense counsel, who thought it would be better to clarify SA Hunter\u2019s normal interview procedure for the court, the military judge recalled the members and the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-17\">Q: Special Agent Hunter, you testified that you stated to Tech Sergeant Whitney that you felt he was not being truthful, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-18\">A: Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-20\">Q: Is it your normal practice to make that statement to the subject of a subject interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-21\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-22\">MJ: Now, to deal with two other issues. You\u2019re to disregard his testimony about the fact that Sergeant Whitney didn\u2019t respond to that. That is not admissible evidence and I probably should have struck it earlier. So, please do disregard that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-23\">In regards to the questions by Captain Hansen and Colonel Walgamott, which is the same question, \u201cWhy did you feel that Tech Sergeant Whitney was not truthful during the interview,\u201d that\u2019s not a permissible question. The reason being is determination of truth is your realm, and nobody can come in here and tell you whether or not someone is being truthful. That\u2019s purely up to you to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-24\">PRES: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-25\">MJ: Any other questions by the members?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-26\">(Negative response by all members.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-27\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b527-28\">There were two evidentiary errors in this case. First, without objection, SA Hunter provided \u201chuman lie detector\u201d testimony. Second, contrary to Mil.R.Evid. 301(f)(3), SA Hunter testified that appellant did not respond to the polygrapher\u2019s challenge that appellant was not being truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-29\">\u201cHuman lie detector\u201d testimony is inadmissible. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Birdsall, </em>47 MJ 404, 410 (1998). Furthermore, SA Hunter\u2019s view that appellant was not being truthful reflects the opinion of a polygrapher and is inadmissible evidence pursuant to Mil.R.Evid. 707(a). As soon as he realized the error, the military judge took two steps to correct the problem. He recalled the members and, at the request of the defense counsel, elicited from SA Hunter that Hunter\u2019s challenge to appellant (that he did not believe him), which precipitated the unfortunate remark about appellant\u2019s silence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>was a routine statement made to all subjects who had just finished making a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">To further diminish the importance of SA Hunter\u2019s testimony, the military judge instructed the members that the question concerning SA Hunter\u2019s belief about appellant\u2019s honesty should never have been asked, and it was the members alone who were the finders of fact and the adjudicators of truth. By adding the instruction \u201c... determination of truth is your realm, and nobody can come in here and tell you whether or not someone is being truthful. That\u2019s purely up to you to decide,\u201d the military judge negated any question or inference that SA Hunter\u2019s opinion was either admissible or material evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">MiLR.Evid. 301 implements the constitutional and statutory privilege against self-incrimination. Rule 301(f)(3) provides that the \u201cfact that the accused during official questioning and in exercise of rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or Article 31, remained silent, refused to answer a certain question, requested counsel, or requested that the questioning be terminated is inadmissible against the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">SA Hunter\u2019s testimony that appellant did not respond to a challenge to his truthfulness was admitted in violation of Rule 301(f)(3) and was an error of constitutional proportion. The military judge, however, endeavored to cure this error by admonishing the members to disregard this portion of SA Hunter\u2019s testimony. The curative measure taken by the military judge in this case could have been clearer and more forceful. <em>See United States v. Garrett, </em>24 MJ 413, 417 (CMA 1987). Nonetheless, the president of the court acknowledged that he understood why two members\u2019 questions were not being asked, and he understood the judge\u2019s instruction to disregard testimony about appellant\u2019s silence. In the absence of contrary evidence, court members are presumed to understand and follow the military judge\u2019s instructions. <em>United States v. Holt, </em>33 MJ 400, 408 (CMA 1991); <em>United States v. Loving, </em>41 MJ 213, 235 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">This is a case that involved testimonial error, objection by counsel, and quick remedial action by the military judge. Having reviewed the entirety of the evidence, to include the victim\u2019s credible, persuasive testimony, we are satisfied that SA Hunter\u2019s \u201chuman lie detector\u201d testimony did not have a substantial influence on the findings. <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). We are also convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that appellant was not prejudiced by SA Hunter\u2019s comment about appellant\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\"> All Manual provisions are identical to the version in effect at the time of appellant's trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b528-9\">BAKER, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AUF\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">I agree with the majority opinion regarding the remedial actions taken by the military judge in this case. The military judge effectively performed his duty to ensure a fair trial by promptly providing clear, curative instructions in response to SA Hunter\u2019s opinion regarding appellant\u2019s polygraph examination. The testimonial error in this case was harmless, given the weight of the evidence against appellant, including the testimony of the victim, the improbability of appellant\u2019s account, and testimony regarding the victim\u2019s post-rape behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">I write separately to emphasize that <em>Wyrick v. Fields, </em>459 U.S. 42, 47, 103 S.Ct. 394, 74 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982), is both sword and shield. In <em>Wyrick, </em>the Court concluded that \u201c[disconnecting the polygraph equipment effectuated no significant change in the character of the interrogation\u201d and, therefore, Wyrick\u2019s consent to a polygraph interview without counsel present also constituted consent to the post-polygraph interview without counsel present. Essential to the Court\u2019s finding of waiver in <em>Wyrick </em>was the Court\u2019s conclusion that Wyrick\u2019s consent was voluntary and knowing, and that he intelligently waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">Wyrick also understood that he had the right to stop questioning (of any sort) at any time, and this understanding was reflected in writing, in plain language. Further, the Court\u2019s holding is limited to a specific right, the Fifth Amendment right to counsel. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Court expressly declined to address the dissent\u2019s argument that the questioning violated Wyrick\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, since those issues were not before the Court. Id. 49, 103 S.Ct. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">As the Court in <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 312, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998), reminded, Mil.R.Evid. 707, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.), is a <em>per se </em>rule against the introduction of polygraph evidence at courts-martial. Further, the Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Scheffer </em>relied in part on the conclusion that only reliable evidence should be admitted into evidence, and \u201cthere is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 118 S.Ct. 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">For these reasons, and in light of <em>Wyrick, </em>military judges should take great care to ensure that any waiver of rights associated with a polygraph examination is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, which means among other things that the accused knows and understands which rights are being waived. Military judges and counsel must also carefully watch the 707 backdoor to ensure, as Judge Wamsley did in this case, that allusions to polygraph examinations are immediately addressed and omitted from evidence. In light of the clarity of <em>Scheffer </em>and Mil. R.Evid. 707, intentional and inadvertent references to polygraph examinations elicited by counsel should not occur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
