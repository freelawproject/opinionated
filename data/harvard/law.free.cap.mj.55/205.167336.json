The court-martial sentenced appellant to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 6 months, forfeiture of $617 pay per month for 6 months, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The convening authority reduced the period of confinement to 4 months and 3 days but approved the remainder of the sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">This Court granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">WHETHER THE UNITED STATES ARMY COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT APPELLANT HAD FAILED TO ESTABLISH THAT THE MILITARY JUDGE COMMITTED PLAIN ERROR BY EXCLUDING EVIDENCE OF A PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENT WHEN A VALID BASIS OF ADMISSIBILITY HAD BEEN MADE AND THE MILITARY JUDGE KNEW THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS CRUCIAL TO THE DEFENSE CASE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">For the reasons set out below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">At about 3:00 a.m. on January 26, 1998, a civilian police officer stopped to render assistance to appellant, whose automobile was in a ditch. When appellant rolled down the window, the officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol. Appellant failed several field sobriety tests and was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. During an inventory of appellant\u2019s car in preparation for towing it, three cellophane bags of marijuana were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">At trial, three witnesses testified about appellant\u2019s possession, distribution, and use of marijuana. One witness, Private First Class (PFC) Sean Boggs, testified that he purchased marijuana from appellant and smoked marijuana with him after each purchase on \u201cabout seven or eight\u201d occasions. Defense counsel cross-examined PFC Boggs but did not ask him about any inconsistent, out-of-court statements. PFC Boggs was permanently excused as a witness with no objection from the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">During the defense case, Specialist (SPC) Timothy Sauls was asked to relate a conversation he overheard between PFC Boggs and appellant. The prosecution ' objected on hearsay grounds. During a hearing outside the presence of the members, the military judge asked, \u201c[Wjhat is it you want this witness to testify to?\u201d The following eollo-quoy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-13\">DC: Well, Your Honor, PFC Boggs \u2014 this soldier is privy to a conversation that Boggs had with Specialist Palmer when Boggs told Palmer that Palmer didn\u2019t do anything with regards to what he is being charged with. <em>And that statement was made by Boggs and it goes to his state of mind at the time the statement was made, and it\u2019s not going </em>\u2014 it\u2019s <em>not hearsay.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-14\">MJ: So, what you want to do is have this witness testify that on some occasion after the accused was charged, Boggs said to the accused, you didn\u2019t do what you \u00e1re charged with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-15\">DC: Something to that effect, Your Honor. Boggs made a statement after Boggs made his 24 February statement with regards to what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not true in his statement, and I believe this witness has some information that goes to the actual credibility of Boggs\u2019 statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-16\">MJ: Yes, Captain King? You are standing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-17\">ATC: Yes, thank you, Your Honor. First of all, Your Honor, if the defense wants to attack Boggs\u2019 credibility, he certainly could have asked this question of Boggs while he was on the stand. To offer hearsay under this \u2014 under this premise that it goes to some mental state or emotional condition of Boggs while having Sauls testify about it, the \u2014 the government submits it\u2019s not authorized, and that is clearly a hearsay case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>MJ: Well, I am going to sustain the government\u2019s objection to that one question. I do believe it is hearsay. <em>I have reviewed Military Rule of Evidence 803(3), an exception to the hearsay rule cited by defense counsel about then existing mental state, and I don\u2019t believe that this is the type of statement that would fall within that exception to the hearsay rule in that it\u2019s not talking about a mental state of Boggs as to what he is going to be doing at some point in the future. </em>It appears to me that what you are trying to do is get in through hearsay Boggs\u2019 opinion about something, so I am <em>not </em>\u2014 I <em>just don\u2019t see that this fits within the exception that you cited. </em>I am going to sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">(Emphasis added.) Defense counsel did not proffer any other basis for admitting SPC Sauls\u2019 testimony. After a short recess, the defense rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Appellant now argues that SPC Sauls\u2019 testimony was obviously admissible under Mil. R.Evid. 613, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to prove that Boggs made a statement prior to trial that was inconsistent with his testimony at trial, and that the military judge should have recognized it as such based on the context. The Government asserts that defense counsel did not proffer the evidence with sufficient specificity to put the military judge on notice of the grounds for admissibility now asserted on appeal. The Government argues that, because of the inadequate proffer, appellant failed to preserve the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Mil.R.Evid. 103(a)(2) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless the ruling materially prejudices a substantial right of a party, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\"><em>% </em>* $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the military judge by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">Mil.R.Evid. 613(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-13\">Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon, or the interests of justice otherwise require.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">Although the usual practice is to confront the witness with the inconsistent statement during cross-examination, it is permissible to delay any mention of the inconsistent statement until other witnesses are called. <em>See United States v. Callara, </em>21 MJ 259, 264-65 (CMA 1986); Stephen A. Saltzburg, Lee D. Schinasi, and David A. Schlueter, <em>Military Rules of Evidence Manual </em>809 (4th ed.1997); Drafters\u2019 Analysis of Mil.R.Evid. 613(b), Manual, <em>supra </em>at A22-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">MiL.R.Evid. 803(3), relied on by the defense at trial, provides that a statement is not hearsay if it is\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-16\">A statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), <em>but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed </em>unless it relates <em>to </em>the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of [the] de-clarant\u2019s will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">(Emphasis added.) In <em>United States v. Means, </em>24 MJ 160, 162 (CMA 1987), this Court held, \u201cWhen a ruling excludes evidence, appellate review of the correctness of the ruling is not preserved unless \u2018the substance of the evidence was made known to the military judge by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.\u2019 \u201d Military judges are not expected to be clairvoyant. When the basis for admissibility is not obvious, \u201can offer of proof is required to clearly and specifically identify the evidence sought to be admitted and its significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>United States v. Hudson, </em>970 F.2d 948, 957 (1st Cir.1992), cited by appellant, set out the general rule: If evidence is excluded at trial because it is inadmissible for the purpose articulated by its proponent, the proponent cannot challenge the ruling on appeal on the ground that the evidence could have been admitted for another purpose. A purpose not identified at trial does not provide a basis for reversal on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We review a military judge\u2019s ruling excluding evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>42 MJ 360, 363 (1995) . The proponent of evidence has the burden of showing that it is admissible. <em>United States v. Shover, </em>45 MJ 119, 122 (1996) . Because of defense counsel\u2019s vague and misdirected proffer, we hold that the military judge did not abuse his discretion by sustaining the Government\u2019s objection to the evidence. <em>Means, </em>24 MJ at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Defense counsel offered the evidence under Mil.R.Evid. 803(3) as evidence of PFC Boggs\u2019 state of mind. He did not sufficiently link Boggs\u2019 state of mind to the credibility of his testimony. He made no effort to reconcile his theory of admissibility with the limitation in Mil.R.Evid. 803(3) that makes it inapplicable to \u201ca statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Unlike the situation in <em>Hudson, swpm, </em>defense counsel never asserted that SPC Sauls\u2019 testimony was admissible to impeach PFC Boggs. Defense counsel did not mention Mil.R.Evid. 613, utter the word \u201cinconsistent\u201d or anything equivalent to it, or alert the military judge to the theory of admissibility now urged on appeal. Although Mil.R.Evid. 103(a)(2) does not require counsel to cite the rule by number or to quote specific words from the rule, counsel is required to alert the military judge to the significance of the proffered evidence. In this case, defense counsel did not allude to the inconsistency between Boggs\u2019 pretrial statement and his trial testimony as the basis for admission. Instead, he focused the military judge on the hearsay exception based on Boggs\u2019 state of mind. If defense counsel had two theories of admissibility, it was incumbent on him to alert the military judge to both theories, especially when it became apparent that the military judge was ruling only on the basis of Mil. R.Evid. 803(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">It is clear that the military judge was not alerted to the possibility of a prior inconsistent statement. He observed, without contradiction, that defense counsel was trying to \u201cget in through hearsay Boggs\u2019 opinion about something.\u201d Defense counsel made no effort at that point to focus the military judge on any inconsistency between Boggs\u2019 testimony in court and the conversation allegedly overheard by SPC Sauls.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\"> All Manual provisions are identical to the ones in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s court-martial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
