He was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 3 years, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The convening authority approved these results, and the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed in an unpublished opinion in October 1998. The decision was set aside by order of this Court (52 MJ 442) on September 20, 1999, and the case was returned to the Court of Criminal Appeals for further review concerning sufficiency of the evidence under Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 866(c). On remand, the lower court affirmed the findings and sentence in an unpublished opinion dated February 29, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">On appellant\u2019s petition, we granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">WHETHER THE LOWER COURT ERRED' WHEN IT ALLOWED A JUDGE WITH A CONFLICT OF INTEREST TO REVIEW APPELLANT\u2019S CASE ON APPEAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">Appellant asserts that Judge Dorman should have recused himself from the panel of the Court of Criminal Appeals reviewing his case. Prior to his appointment to the Court of Criminal Appeals, Colonel Dorman served as the Director of the Appellate Government Division of the Navy-Marine Corps Appellate Review Activity (Appellate Government Division). He served as Director from July 1995 to May 26, 1998. On June 16, 1998, Col. Dorman was sworn in as a judge on the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-17\">Appellant\u2019s case was docketed with the Court of Criminal Appeals in March 1997; a copy of the docketing notice and record of trial were provided by the court to both appellate divisions. Appellate defense counsel filed numerous motions for enlargement of time with the lower court. In accordance with the practice of the Appellate Government Division, the first seven motions went unopposed. Appellant\u2019s combined eighth-ninth motion for enlargement of time, filed on March 13,1998, and his tenth motion, filed on April 6, 1998, were opposed by the Government. In both instances, the Government\u2019s opposition to the motions for enlargement consisted solely of the assertion that \u201c[t]he Government believes that appellant has had ample time to research and raise potential issues, and requests this Court to set a date certain for appellant to file his Assignment of Errors and Brief.\u201d Both documents were filed by the Deputy Director of the Appellate Government Division during Col. Dorman\u2019s tenure as Director of the Division. The lower court granted appellant\u2019s combined eighth-ninth motion and the tenth motion for enlargement of time. Appellant filed an assignment of errors and brief with the court on August 4, 1998, more than 2 months after Judge Dorman left the Appellate Government Division and became an appellate judge. The Government filed its answer on September 3, 1998. The Court of Criminal Appeals issued its initial decision on October 29, 1998. Judge Dorman had joined the court at this point, but did not sit on the panel that issued the decision, which was composed of Judges Sefton, Troidl, and Anderson. After that decision was set aside by our Court, 52 MJ 442, the case was considered upon remand by a different panel of the Court of Criminal Appeals, composed of Judges Dorman, Rolph, and Naugle. That panel issued its decision on February 29, 2000. Appellant did not seek Judge Dor-man\u2019s disqualification at any point while the case was under consideration by the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>In an affidavit filed with our Court, Judge Dorman avers that he \u201chad no involvement\u201d with appellant\u2019s case while he was the Director of the Appellate Government Division; that he gave no \u201cspecific or general guidance\u201d to the Deputy Director about filing oppositions to the motions for enlargement in this case; and that he was \u201cnot aware\u201d that the Government had made replies in opposition to appellant\u2019s motions until the present appeal was filed with our Court. Judge Dor-man also stated that the Appellate Government Division, \u201c[w]ith rare exception, ... took no action on a record of trial until\u201d an appellant \u201cfiled assignments of error\u201d with the Court of Criminal Appeals. In light of these circumstances, he decided that he would generally recuse himself \u201cfrom participating in any case in which an appellant had filed a brief raising an assignment of error with the NMCCA on or before 26 May 1998, the day I was relieved of duties as the Director of the Appellate Government Division.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">II. STANDARDS FOR RECUSAL</p>\n<p id=\"AtT\">Title 28 USC \u00a7 455 governs the recusal of judges and is applicable to cases involving the actions of appellate military judges. <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>54 MJ 202, 205 (2000). Appellant claims that Judge Dor-man\u2019s participation in the review of his case violates the following provisions of \u00a7 455:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">(a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">(b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">(3) Where he has served in governmental employment and in such capacity participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular ease in controversy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Subsection (a) enhances public confidence in the judicial system by ensuring that judges avoid the appearance of partiality. <em>See Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., </em>486 U.S. 847, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 100 L.Ed.2d 855 (1988). The test for determining if recusal is necessary under this section is \u201cwhether a reasonable person <em>who knew all the facts </em>might question these appellate military judges\u2019 impartiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>39 MJ 131, 143 (CMA)(emphasis in original), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 874, 115 S.Ct. 200, 130 L.Ed.2d 131 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Subsection (b)(3) shields parties from having their case tried before a judge who may have formed opinions or gained knowledge via prior contact with the case in a governmental capacity. Recusal is mandatory for a judge who falls within the specific circumstances of this section because those circumstances are viewed as inconsistent with impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">The Federal Courts of Appeals have applied two different approaches to evaluating whether a judge who previously served as a U.S. Attorney may preside over a case investigated by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office during his or her tenure as the head of that office. The Ninth Circuit has applied a \u201cvertical imputation\u201d theory under which the knowledge and actions of subordinates are attributed to the U.S. Attorney, holding that \u201c[a] United States District Judge cannot adjudicate a case that he or she as United States Attorney began.\u201d <em>United States v. Ampriester, </em>37 F.3d 466, 467 (1994). By contrast, the Tenth Circuit has interpreted the phrase \u201cparticipated as counsel\u201d in subsection (b)(3) as connoting activity by the individual and has held that a judge is not required to recuse himself absent a specific showing of actual prior involvement with the case. <em>United States v. Gipson, </em>835 F.2d 1323, <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1044, 108 S.Ct. 2038, 100 L.Ed.2d 623 (1988). The court focused on the fact that Congress specifically amended the statute in 1974 to modify the phrase \u201cof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>counsel\u201d to read \u201cparticipated as counsel.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1326, citing 28 USC \u00a7 455(b)(3); <em>see also Mangum v. Hargett, </em>67 F.3d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1995)(agreeing with the analysis in <em>Gipson), cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1133, 116 S.Ct. 957, 133 L.Ed.2d 880 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">A trial or appellate judge\u2019s decision on recusal is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Lynn, </em>54 MJ at 205. In the present case, appellant did not question Judge Dorman\u2019s participation until his appeal before our Court. When an appellant does not raise the issue of disqualification until appeal, the reviewing court examines the claim under the plain error standard of review. <em>United States v. Schreiber, </em>599 F.2d 534, 536 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 843, 100 S.Ct. 86, 62 L.Ed.2d 56 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Our recent decision in <em>Lynn </em>involved a factually related case in which we held that Judge Dorman\u2019s prior position as Director of the Appellate Government Division did not require him to recuse himself under \u00a7 455(a) because (1) the Government took no action on the accused\u2019s case except to receive and store the record of trial during the period Col. Dorman headed the division; (2) the seven defense motions for enlargement of time filed during Col. Dorman\u2019s tenure went unopposed; and (3) there was unrebutted evidence that Col. Dorman had no involvement in the case while at the Appellate Government Division. 54 MJ at 203, 204, 206. We held that Judge Dorman\u2019s policy on recusal was \u201creasonable\u201d in light of the Division\u2019s practice of not reviewing the record until a brief was filed or until the eighth request for enlargement of time, <em>id. </em>at 204,\u201cbecause it limits his participation to those cases in which Appellate Government had no substantive involvement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The sole difference between <em>Lynn </em>and the present case is the fact that the Government opposed two of appellant\u2019s motions for enlargement of time \u2014 the combined motion for the eighth and ninth enlargements \u2014 and the tenth motion, while Col. Dorman headed the Division. In <em>Lynn, </em>we provided the following description of the Government\u2019s policy concerning responses to defense motions for enlargement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">[Ljengthy defense appellate delays are sufficiently common that the Government has gone to the extent of formulating a policy of not even opposing the first seven motions for enlargement of time, and indeed it appears that even the succeeding oppositions are quite perfunctory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 206-07 (footnote omitted). The same characterization applies to the record of the present case, which reflects government opposition limited to the rote assertion that \u201c[t]he Government believes that appellant has had ample time to research and raise potential issues.\u201d Such a perfunctory and mechanical response does not create a reasonable question about Judge Dorman\u2019s lack of impartiality, especially when, as in <em>Lynn, </em>appellant does not contest Judge Dorman\u2019s lack of knowledge about and personal involvement with appellant\u2019s case. We hold that no error was committed because Judge Dorman was not required to recuse himself under 28 USC \u00a7 455(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">Appellant argues that the present case should be distinguished from <em>Lynn </em>because Judge Dorman held supervisory power, which would impute the actions of the attorneys under his charge to him if we were to apply the Ninth Circuit\u2019s vertical imputation theory. <em>See United States v. Ampriester, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">As we noted earlier, the vertical imputation theory is one of two standards for viewing a judge\u2019s former role as attorney under the statute. The other is the Tenth Circuit\u2019s requirement for actual prior involvement. <em>See United States v. Gipson, supra. </em>The record and Judge Dorman\u2019s unrebutted affidavit demonstrate that he had no actual involvement with this case during his tenure at the Appellate Government Division. In view of the perfunctory nature of the oppositions filed by the Deputy Director in this case, in mechanical adherence to standard Division practice, we conclude that it is appropriate to apply the actual prior involvement standard to this case, rather than the vertical imputation standard. Accordingly, the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Judge Dorman did not recuse himself <em>sua sponte </em>did not amount to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">We reserve judgment as to which standard should be applied in other circumstances. There may be cases, for example, in which denial of an extension might have substantive consequences or in which the nature of the actions taken by the Deputy Director would involve deficiencies for which the Director could be held accountable and responsible. Regardless of which standard should be applied, we emphasize that the difficulty of determining which actions are so perfunctory that recusal is not required can be readily avoided in the future if judges appointed to the lower courts after prior appellate division service would recuse themselves from all cases that were pending during their tenure in the division.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals upon remand is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">. Our decision in <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>54 MJ 202 (2000), describes the practice of the Appellate Government Division in responding to defense motions for enlargement of time, as well as Judge Dorman's policy on recusal related to his prior assignment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b433-8\">BAKER, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A0s\">(concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">I agree with the lead opinion\u2019s sound conclusion that Judge Dorman had no \u201cactual prior involvement\u201d with this case. 55 MJ at 320. Therefore, based on the specific facts of this case, he did not violate 28 USC \u00a7 455(a) or (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">I write separately to emphasize the contextual nature of my vote and to articulate a different shade of analysis with respect to \u00a7 455(a). I do not believe that \u00a7 455(a) is susceptible to general rules of the road based on characterizations of an attorney\u2019s work as \u201csubstantive,\u201d \u201cnon-substantive,\u201d \u201cmechanical,\u201d or \u201crote.\u201d These terms may have meaning in a specific context, but they offer dim light as buoys to guide appellate judges through the rocks and shoals of \u00a7 455(a). Clearly, these terms are not relevant to a decision as to whether Judge Dorman was actually involved in this or any other case for the purpose of \u00a7 455(b); the majority opinion does not argue so.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">There are at least three analytic options for addressing \u00a7 455(a) questions, such as that presented in this case. First, courts could apply a strict blackletter interpretation to \u00a7 455(a) as Judge Sullivan has argued for in <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>54 MJ 202 (2000), and again today. This is attractive as a principle that guides with clarity and certainty of result. However, such an interpretation goes beyond what the law requires. The statutory language presents a reasonable-person test and not a strict-appearance standard. There are scenarios where a reasonable person knowing all the facts would not reasonably question a judge\u2019s impartiality, even where there is an initial appearance of partiality. This is one of them. A reasonable person knowing all the facts would not reasonably question Judge Dorman\u2019s impartiality in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">Second, while addressing cases as they come, courts can seek to distinguish between acts that are substantive and non-substantive in determining when to apply a theory of vertical imputation with respect to \u00a7 455(a); and, more broadly, in determining whether a judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. This is the approach taken in <em>Lynn </em>and by the majority of the Court today. These distinctions are not offered as black-letter law, but they do represent common-law guidance to the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">I believe a third analytic option is the most apt in applying \u00a7' 455(a). Courts can accept that as a matter of law, the application of \u00a7 455(a) is highly contextual so as to defy advance and meaningful guidance with general .terminology like substantive and non-substantive. While the non-substantive nature of an act may inform a specific decision as to whether a judge\u2019s impartiality is reasonably questionable, under this construct, it is simply too speculative to determine in advance that a reasonable person will generally find that non-substantive acts do not violate \u00a7 455(a). This is not a reliable benchmark.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">Terms like \u201crote,\u201d \u201cperfunctory,\u201d \u201cmechanical,\u201d \u201cnon-substantive,\u201d and \u201csubstantive\u201d are amorphous and subject to multiple and conflicting good-faith interpretations depending on the actor and their perspective. As those who have worked within a government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>bureaucracy know, substance and process are often flip sides of the same coin. To whom one sends a question or seeks a concurrence often dictates the measure of the substantive answer received. Likewise, a \u201cpro forma\u201d continuance can also have profound substantive effect. A lawyer given 1 day to respond to a brief will offer a different level of response than one given 2 weeks. When viewed from an accused\u2019s perspective, a. continuance can have a profound substantive consequence, depending on the skill, experience, and workload of his or her lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Whether or not the Appellate Government Division\u2019s actions were non-substantive in this case, Colonel Dorman\u2019s unrebutted affidavit and the majority opinion make clear that he took no action whatsoever involving this case. Colonel Dorman did not participate as counsel or express an opinion concerning the merits of this case. Further, while he set office policies and made clear to his subordinates that he was in command of the appellate government ship, the policy in question was applicable to all cases and, once established, did not require Colonel Dor-man\u2019s concurrence or consent before it was applied to particular cases. Therefore, Judge Dorman\u2019s impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned under \u00a7 455(a), unless we adopt an appearance standard that posits an inherent issue of partiality whenever an appellate government attorney subsequently serves as a judge of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Of course, there may be a difference between what is legally required and what is prudent. I readily agree with the majority that the difficulty in applying \u00a7 455(a) would be avoided if judges appointed to the Courts of Criminal Appeals after prior appellate division service recused themselves from cases that were pending during their tenure in the division.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">SULLIVAN, Judge (dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">I write to reaffirm my position in the <em>Lynn </em>case. <em>See United States v. Lynn, </em>54 MJ 202, 207 (2000)(Sullivan, J., dissenting). Here, Colonel Dorman was the Chief of the Appellate Government Division when his government subordinate filed opposition to two of appellant\u2019s motions in this case. Judge Dor-man thus later sat on a case in which he had a prior direct supervisory-attorney role. In my view, this contravenes Congress\u2019 will as reflected in 28 USC \u00a7 455(b)(3) and 455(a). <em>See United States v. Ampriester, </em>37 F.3d 466 (9th Cir.1994). In addition, the acknowledged filing of opposing legal documents by the Appellate Government Division in this case was more compelling than the <em>Lynn </em>case and warranted relief under the rationale of that case. I would remand this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">As such, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
