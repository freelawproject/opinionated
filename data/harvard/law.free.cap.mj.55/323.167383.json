The panel sentenced him to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for 10 years, total forfeitures, and reduction to pay grade E-l. The convening authority approved the sentence but suspended all confinement in excess of 6 years. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed only so much of the sentence as included a dishonorable discharge (reduced by the Naval Clemency and Parole Board to a bad-conduct discharge), confinement for 4 year\u2019s, total forfeitures, and reduction to pay grade E-l. 54 MJ 508, 514 and n. 3 (2000). We granted review on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-14\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-15\">WHETHER THE EVIDENCE FOR INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER WAS LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT WHEN APPELLANT DID NOT ACT WITH CULPABLE NEGLIGENCE AND THE VICTIM\u2019S NEGLIGENCE WAS A SU-PERCEDING CAUSE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">We resolve this issue against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-18\">The court below summarized the facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-19\">The facts are undisputed and tragic. On the night of 20-21 December 1997 at Camp Schwab, Okinawa, Japan, several Marines gathered in the third-floor barracks room of PFC Minnicks to celebrate the birthday of PFC Knox. Among those present were Corporal (Cpl) Tessier, Lance Corporal (LCpl) Epley and the appellant. All of the Marines, except for the appellant, had consumed large amounts of beer and vodka. The appellant had only two sips of a vodka drink and was not intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-20\">At some point during the festivities, the subject of hanging people out of the barracks room window was brought up. The Marines thought this would not only provide them with a thrill and something to do, but it would, in their minds, also be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>way they could show their comrades the ultimate trust they had in each other. Four of the Marines were lowered headfirst out of the third-floor window and were held by their ankles without incident. They used no safety devices. None of them believed that anyone would be dropped. As they were being edged out the window and lowered down the side of the building, each Marine would use his hands to steady himself. The fifth Marine to be lowered was LCpl Epley. LCpl Ep-ley wore a cast on his right arm and was one of the heavier Marines in the group. He and the appellant were good friends. As he willingly leaned out of the window, LCpl Epley could not use both of his hands to edge himself down the side of the building because of his injured arm. Cpl Tessier and the appellant were holding his legs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">According to the statement the appellant made to an investigator, LCpl Epley leaned out of the window with all of his weight, and his exit was different from the others because he \u201cwent right out\u201d instead of crawling out as the others had done. Prosecution Exhibit 4 at 6. As soon as LCpl Epley went out of the window, the appellant could feel that he was losing his grip. Within seconds, both Cpl Tessier and the appellant lost their hold on LCpl Epley, who fell to the ground. Despite the best efforts of numerous medical personnel, LCpl Epley died within a few hours. The cause of death was blunt force trauma. His blood alcohol level was .21.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">54 MJ at 509-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Before this Court, appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction for involuntary manslaughter because LCpl Eplejfs negligent manner in exiting the window was \u201ca superceding cause of his death\u201d that relieved appellant of criminal responsibility. Alternatively, he argues that Epley\u2019s death was not reasonably foreseeable from the standpoint of \u201ca reasonable eighteen to twenty-year-old\u201d Marine. Final Brief at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Our standard for reviewing legal sufficiency of the evidence is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)(em-phasis in original); <em>United States v. Turner, 25 </em>MJ 324 (CMA 1987). In resolving such questions, we are \u201cbound to draw every reasonable inference from the evidence of record in favor of the prosecution.\u201d <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>54 MJ 244, 246 (2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Blocker, </em>32 MJ 281, 284 (CMA 1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">The elements of involuntary manslaughter are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-12\">(i) \u201cThat a certain named or described person is dead;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-13\">(ii) \u201cThat the death resulted from the act or omission of the accused;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-14\">(iii) \u201cThat the killing was unlawful; and\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-15\">(iv) \u201cThat this act or omission of the accused constituted culpable negligence....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">Para. 44b(2), Part IV, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">Negligence is conduct that \u201cinvolves the creation of substantial and unjustifiable risk of which the person <em>should be aware </em>in view of all the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>22 MJ 448, 450 (CMA 1986)(emphasis in original). Culpable negligence is defined as \u201ca negligent act or omission accompanied by a culpable disregard for the foreseeable consequences to others of that act or omission.\u201d This means that the \u201cbasis of a charge of involuntary manslaughter may be a negligent act or omission which, when viewed in the light of human experience, might foreseeably result in the death of another.\u201d Para. 44c(2)(a)(i), Part IV, Manual, <em>supra. </em>The test for foreseeability is \u201cwhether a reasonable person, in view of all the circumstances, would have realized the substantial and unjustifiable danger created by his acts.\u201d <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>23 MJ 77, 80 (CMA 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\n<em>Reasonable Foreseeability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Having decided to participate with the deceased and the other Marines in a dangerous joint enterprise, appellant was bound by the circumstances that would have put a reasonable person on notice as to the risk he was creating or helping to create, and the foreseeable consequences of that risk. It was not necessary that appellant himself \u201cbe aware of the substantial risk he is creating, but only that a reasonable person would have realized the risk.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>22 MJ at 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In addition to the facts found by the Court of Criminal Appeals, the record contains additional evidence available to the members for their evaluation of the circumstances relating to the reasonable foreseeability of Epley\u2019s fall. The participants were aware of the cast on Epley\u2019s right arm that extended from his elbow down to his wrist and looped around his thumb. While appellant did not testify, his statements to investigators were admitted in evidence. In them he describes how when he entered the barracks room, he noticed Epley \u201cdrinking vodka and Kool-aid ... from a large size Burger King cup.\u201d Private Minnicks, one of the participants, testified that, to him, it appeared Epley \u201cwas under the influence of alcohol.\u201d Appellant also described one Marine as \u201cpassed out on the floor in the head\u201d when he got to the room. He also remembered a comment by Minnicks that \u201che had already drank about one ease of beer\u201d at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Appellant\u2019s statement also indicates that his motivation for participating in the \u201cgame\u201d was to show that \u201cyou could trust that person with your life.\u201d One could strongly infer from this statement that appellant realized the risk presented by the game included the real possibility of loss of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Another participant, PFC Grant, testified that while being lowered by his ankles, his loose-fitting trousers slipped down to about his thigh and he became nervous. At this point, Grant asked to be pulled back into the room and the holders complied. Appellant admitted to being one of those who held PFC Grant as he was lowered out of the window and described how his trousers had begun to slip off. He also admitted to holding Min-nicks and Tessier out of the window. Notwithstanding the- degree of alcohol use he encountered and the incident with Grant, appellant continued his participation as one of the holders until the game concluded with Epley\u2019s tragic fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Appellant relies on <em>United States v. Adams, </em>49 MJ 182 (1998), for the proposition that the objective-reasonableness standard must be applied from the viewpoint of appellant and the 18 to 20-year-old enlisted Marines participating in this dangerous enterprise. Adams had been convicted of having used provoking speech to a military policeman who was part of a group which \u201chad surrounded him and ordered him out of his car.\u201d The lower court in exercising its unique factfinding powers found as a matter of factual sufficiency that Adams\u2019 statements \u201cwould not provoke a reasonable military policeman to violence because of his special police training.\u201d We upheld the lower court\u2019s action as \u201ca permissible exercise of its factfinding power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">However, in doing so we made clear that from a <em>legal-sufficiency </em>standpoint, the status as a military policeman was but one of several <em>circumstances </em>to be considered in determining whether a reasonable person would have been provoked. <em>Id. </em>We did not hold or suggest that the objective standard of \u201ca reasonable person\u201d was being altered in any way. Thus, <em>Adams </em>simply stands for the proposition that all the circumstances surrounding the particular event are to be considered in determining the issue of legal sufficiency of the evidence of how a reasonable person would view the language. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">No authority offered by appellant stands for the proposition that the status or attributes of a particular person are to be imputed to \u201ca reasonable person.\u201d Adopting such a proposition would convert this long-standing common-law concept from an objective standard to a subjective one. We decline to do so. Thus, we are convinced that this record supports a finding by rational members that an objectively reasonable person would have known the risk he was creating and the foreseeable consequences of that risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\n<em>The Deceased\u2019s Conduct as a Superseding Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Appellant contends that LCpl Epley was contributorily negligent in deciding to join the enterprise and that the manner in which he pushed himself away from the windowsill while Tessier and appellant were holding him was a superseding cause eliminating appellant from the field of proximate causation. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Epley\u2019s decision to participate amounted to negligence on his part, that alone would not suffice to create the proximate cause of his death required in the context of this particular joint enterprise to exonerate appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The dangerous game of trust these participants engaged in is unlike drag-racing scenarios, for example, that result in convictions for homicide for the death of a co-participant. Some courts have held that a conviction for homicide cannot stand \u201cwhen the <em>sole </em>basis\u201d for attaching criminal liability for the death \u201cis the defendant\u2019s participation in\u201d the race. <em>Velazquez v. State, </em>561 So.2d 347, 348 (Fla. App. 3 Dist.1990)(emphasis added); <em>Thacker v. State, </em>103 Ga.App. 36, 117 S.E.2d 913 (1961)(dismissing indictment of surviving racer because it failed to allege any act of the defendant, save his own participation in the race, which caused the death); <em>State v. Uhler, </em>61 Ohio Misc. 37, 402 N.E.2d 556 (1979)(ruling that \u201ccriminal liability\u201d will not be imposed \u201con the survivor of a drag race whose only contribution to the death of the other participant was his own participation in the race\u201d). <em>Contra Goldring v. State, </em>103 Md.App. 728, 654 A.2d 939, 942-44 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">As the record makes clear, unlike a decision to participate in a race, this joint enterprise required more than just each participant\u2019s decision to participate. The objective of the game sought by the individual participants could not have been achieved but for the assistance of others in holding them outside the window. Thus, Epley\u2019s decision to expose himself to the danger could not have resulted in his death had appellant not agreed to be his holder, at least as far as appellant\u2019s liability is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Even if one is found \u201ccriminally negligent ... it is possible for negligence of the deceased ... to intervene between\u201d an accused\u2019s \u201cconduct and the fatal result in such a manner as to constitute a superseding cause, completely eliminating the defendant from the field of proximate causation.\u201d However, \u201c[tjhis is true only in situations in which the second act of negligence looms so large in comparison with the first, that the first is not to be regarded as a substantial factor in the final result.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooke, </em>18 MJ 152, 154 (CMA 1984)(quoting R. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>703 (2d ed.l969)(emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">The question, then, is whether the manner in which LCpl Epley hoisted himself away from the windowsill when compared to appellant\u2019s culpably negligent participation as one of his holders \u201cloom[ed] so large\u201d that appellant\u2019s actions could not \u201cbe regarded as a substantial factor in the fatal result.\u201d <em>See United States v. Lingenfelter, </em>30 MJ 302, 307 (CMA 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">As discussed earlier, the circumstances appellant encountered when he decided to participate foreshadowed a tragic <em>outcome. </em>Young Marines under the influence of alcohol, the clumsy handling of Grant, the intoxicated state of Epley and the others, and Epley\u2019s cast were bugles warning appellant that <em>something </em>might go terribly wrong during this unjustifiably dangerous game.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">This case is the tragic result of a group of young men\u2019s decision to confirm their trust in each other as Marines through foolhardy and dangerous means. While from the participants\u2019 perspective their actions may have been well intended, their lack of mature judgment resulted in the death of one of their brethren and appellant\u2019s best friend. The military expects young Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines to exercise good judgment in combat and no less in the barracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">We hold that a rational trier of fact could have properly concluded that a reasonable person in this scenario would have been on notice that he was participating in the creation of substantial risk of serious harm to the participants. Likewise, on this record the trier of fact could reasonably have found that dropping Epley to his death, when viewed in the light of human experience, was a foreseeable result of the culpable disregard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>required by the statute. Finally, we hold the evidence of record was sufficient to support a rational factfinder\u2019s conclusion that Epley\u2019s conduct was not a superseding cause and that appellant\u2019s conduct was a substantial factor in Epley\u2019s fall and thus, the proximate cause of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">SULLIVAN, Judge (concurring in part and in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">This case can be resolved solely under military case law. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>42 MJ 327, 330 (1995) (citing <em>United States v. Brown, </em>22 MJ 448 (CMA 1986), and <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>31 MJ 30 (CMA 1990)). As I have said before, \u201cThe Bible (Genesis 4:9) asks the question, \u2018Am I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u2019 ... There are <em>instances </em>in military life where the high standards set for membership in the profession of arms require that Armed Forces members not only take care of themselves but also their fellow warriors.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, supra </em>at 330-31 n. 5. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">This case is one of those instances.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
