Pursuant to his pleas, he was found guilty of one specification of possessing child pornography and two specifications of transporting child pornography in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 USC \u00a7 2252A as assimilated by Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 934. The military judge sentenced appellant to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 150 days, and reduction to pay grade E-l. On March 8,1999, the convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged, and on May 19, 2000, the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number><em>See United States v. James, </em>53 MJ 612 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">On November 16, 2000, this Court granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">WHETHER THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE \u201cAPPEARS TO BE A MINOR\u201d AND \u201cCONVEYS THE IMPRESSION\u201d THAT A PICTURE PORTRAYS A MINOR WITHIN 18 USC \u00a7 2252A WAS NOT UNCONSTITUTIONALLY OVERBROAD BOTH ON ITS FACE AND AS APPLIED TO APPELLANT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">We hold that the appellate court below did not err in affirming appellant\u2019s guilty-plea convictions of possessing and transporting child pornography under 18 USC \u00a7 2252A and Article 134. <em>See generally United States v. Hilton, </em>167 F.3d 61 (1st Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 844, 120 S.Ct. 115, 145 L.Ed.2d 98 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The record of trial shows that during 1998, appellant served aboard the USS FRANK CABLE (AS 40), stationed at Guam. Appellant lived in government quarters with another person, M.H. The roommate owned a personal computer and paid monthly fees for Internet access through a commercial provider. He also allowed appellant to use both the computer and the Internet account.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">From February to April 1998, appellant used the roommate\u2019s Internet account to \u201cswap\u201d files by downloading pictures from an Internet site in exchange for posting pictures to that same site. Appellant \u201cintentionally picked sites ... advertising] \u2018pre-teen pics\u2019 and downloaded\u201d at least three files that contained \u201cpictures of minors engaged in explicit sexual activity. After downloading\u201d these files, \u201cappellant viewed\u201d the pictures \u201cand saved\u201d the images onto his roommate\u2019s computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">On April 22, 1998, appellant entered a chat room offering a conversation on \u201cDad and daughter sex.\u201d While accessing the chat room through his roommate\u2019s account, appellant engaged in a discussion with someone called \u201cFast Girl,\u201d in fact the screen name of a male agent of the U.S. Customs Service posing as a female pedophile. \u201c[A]t Fast Girl\u2019s request, appellant uploaded a picture of a child he believed to be a minor engaged in sexually explicit activity\u201d and sent the picture electronically to Fast Girl. \u201cTwo days later, ... appellant uploaded\u201d another fifteen pictures which he \u201cbelieved\u201d were \u201cminors engaged in sexually explicit activity\u201d and sent them electronically to Fast Girl. The agent posing as Fast Girl received all the pictures back in continental United States. 53 MJ at 612-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">Appellant admitted the above facts and pleaded guilty to violating 18 USC \u00a7 2252A on at least three occasions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">Appellant asks this Court to set aside his convictions under 18 USC \u00a7 2252A and Article 134 for possessing and transporting child pornography. He contends that this federal statute is unconstitutional because it violates the First Amendment. <em>Cf. United States v. Mento, </em>231 F.3d 912, 915 (4th Cir. 2000), <em>cert, filed </em>Jan. 22, 2001. He particularly argues that this statute is constitutionally overbroad because it not only prohibits sexually explicit depictions of actual children, but also such pictures of virtual or apparent children as well. He asks that his guilty pleas to violating this unconstitutional statute be set aside as improvident. <em>See generally United States v. Prater, </em>32 MJ 433, 436 (CMA 1991) (an accused must \u201cshow a \u2018substantial basis\u2019 in law and fact\u201d exists for overturning a guilty plea on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">The Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 proscribes knowing transportation, knowing receipt, knowing distribution, and knowing possession of child pornography in interstate commerce \u201cby any means, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ing by computer.\u201d <em>See </em>18 USC \u00a7 2252A(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The term \u201cchild pornography\u201d is broadly defined in the U.S. Code. It includes not only a \u201cvisual depiction ... of sexually explicit conduct ... (A) ... involving] the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\u201d; but also \u201c(B) such visual depiction [which] is, or <em>appears </em>to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\u201d and \u201c(D) such visual depiction ... <em>conveys the impression </em>that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct[.]\u201d <em>See </em>18 USC \u00a7\u00a7 2256(8) (emphasis added). The military judge explained to appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">The term \u201cchild pornography\u201d means any visual depiction including photograph, video, picture of computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic mechanical or other means of sexually explicit conduct, where the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexual [sic] explicit conduct. Such visual depiction is or appears to be of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct or such visual depiction has been created, adapted or modified to appear that of an unidentifiable minor or it contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">MJ: The definition of \u201cchild pornography,\u201d \u201cvisual depiction,\u201d and \u201cminor\u201d again come under or come from section 2256 of Title 18 of the United States Code____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">R. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Appellant argues that the \u201cappears to be\u201d and \u201cconveys the impression\u201d language of the statute infringes on speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. He largely adopts the position of the Ninth Circuit in <em>Free Speech Coalition v. Reno, </em>198 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 876, 148 L.Ed.2d 788 (2001). There, the Ninth Circuit recognized that the definition of child pornography found in the federal statute (18 USC 2256(8)) constituted a \u201ccontent-based classification of speech.\u201d <em>Reno, </em>198 F.3d at 1091. As such, it stated that the Government had to show both \u201ca compelling interest\u201d served by this statute and how that statutory definition was \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to fit that interest. <em>Id. </em>Focusing on the \u201ccompelling interest\u201d of the state in proscribing child pornography mentioned by the Supreme Court in <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982), the Ninth Circuit held that the state had no compelling interest in regulating virtual or apparent child pornography where no minor was actually harmed. <em>Reno, </em>198 F.3d at 1096. \u201cNothing in <em>Ferber </em>can be said to justify the regulation of such materials other than the protection of the actual children used in the production of child pornography.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-17\">We disagree with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Free Speech Coalition v. Reno, supra, </em>and hold the definition of \u201cchild pornography\u201d in 18 USC \u00a7\u00a7 2256(8) and the prohibitions in 18 USC \u00a7 2252A are constitutional. The majority of the other federal courts of appeals that have considered this same issue have held this section of the Act to be constitutional. <em>See United States v. Hilton, </em>167 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>F.3d 61 (1st Cir.1999); <em>see also United States v. Acheson, </em>195 F.3d 645 (11th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Mento, </em>231 F.3d 912 (4th Cir.2000); and <em>United States v. Fox, </em>248 F.3d 394 (5th Cir.2001). In particular, we adopt the rationale of the First Circuit as elaborated in <em>United States v. Hilton, supra </em>at 72 (holding that \u201cappears to be\u201d language added prohibition against virtual child pornography to prohibition against actual child pornography as particularly defined in original statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The First Circuit in <em>Hilton </em>opined that suppressing the \u201cvirtual\u201d or apparent child-pornography trade constituted a compelling government interest that justified the expanded definition of \u201cchild pornography\u201d found in the federal statute. It acknowledged that this federal statute created a \u201ccontent-based\u201d restriction, 167 F.3d at 69, and applied the same \u201ccompelling state interest-narrow tailoring\u201d test as the Ninth Circuit in <em>Reno. See Hilton, </em>167 F.3d at 68. However, looking to the decision in <em>Osborne v. Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990), it maintained that the Supreme Court has recognized a broader governmental interest in regulating child pornography than approved in <em>Ferber. See Hilton, </em>167 F.3d at 70,73. As such, the First Circuit upheld the statute as constitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">As technology improves and access to technology increases, efforts to eradicate the child pornography industry could be effectively frustrated if Congress were prevented from targeting sexually explicit material that \u201cappears to be\u201d of real children. The government\u2019s interest in addressing these forms of child pornography is no less powerful than in instances where an actual child is actually used and abused during the production process. We will not second-guess Congress\u2019s decision to address the social ills posed by the various types of virtual child pornography.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-8\"><em>Hilton, </em>167 F.3d at 73.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">In any event, even if the First Circuit\u2019s approach to 18 USC \u00a7 2252A is not followed, appellant\u2019s convictions need not be invalidated. A narrow construction of this statute applying it only to pictures of actual minors would clearly render this statute constitutional even under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision. <em>See Free Speech Coalition v. Reno, supra </em>at 1086. Here, appellant\u2019s admissions \u201cobjectively support\u201d his pleas of guilty to violations of the more narrowly construed statute directed at sexual pictures of actual minors. <em>See generally United States v. Shearer, </em>44 MJ 330, 334 (1996) (\u201cAn inquiry into the providence of a guilty plea must establish the factual circumstances admitted by the accused which \u2018objectively\u2019 support his plea.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Appellant argues that no definite proof exists in his case that the pictures at issue showed actual minors. However, in the guilty-plea context, the Government does not have to introduce evidence to prove the elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt; instead, there need only be \u201cfactual circumstances\u201d on the record \u201cwhich \u2018objectively\u2019 support\u201d the guilty pleas, <em>ie., </em>that actual minors were in appellant\u2019s pictures. <em>See Shearer, </em>44 MJ at 334. Here, appellant pleaded guilty to the charged violations of 18 USC \u00a7 2252A (R. 11) and admitted that actual minors were in the charged pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">The judge in this case explained to appellant that an element of the crimes of possessing and transporting child pornography was proof that the subjects of the pictures were minors. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The third element of Specification 1, is that the visual depiction was produced by using at least one person who was a minor engaged in this sexually explicit conduct. Do you understand that element?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">MJ: And that element is the same for Specification 2 and Specification 3. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">R. 16. Moreover, appellant particularly admitted that the subjects of the pictures were minors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">Q. Now, why do you believe that \u2014 as far as describes those files \u2014 why you believe the files to be described as child pornography?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">A. Well, they depicted young females under the age of eighteen, which as you stated, that they, uh, they are minors. I believe that the pictures depicted minors under the age of eighteen and at least four contained minors engaged in sexual activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">Q. Do you believe that one of those persons involved in that conduct was a minor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">A. I believe the person in the picture was under eighteen, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-13\">Q. Now, when you say the person in the picture, was there one person or more than one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-14\">A. There were two persons in the picture, sii*. The <em>person </em>I\u2019m referring to \u2014 is I believe, the young lady, was a minor. I am not \u2014 I am not sure of the male.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">R. 27, 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">Appellant\u2019s admissions concerning the age of the subjects of the pictures in his case were amply supported by the pictures themselves which are attached to this record as exhibits. <em>See </em>R. 54-55 and Pros. Ex. 2-4. In addition he admitted that he went to various web sites looking for pictures of \u201cpreteen[s]\u201d and downloaded pictures from files labeled in a manner reasonably suggesting depiction of actual minors. R. 26, 38. Finally, appellant admitted that he visited chat rooms on the Internet with topics such as \u201cDad and daughter sex\u201d where pictures of minors were regularly requested and provided. R. 32. Viewed in its entirety, we conclude that the factual circumstances reflected in the record \u201cobjectively support\u201d appellant\u2019s guilty pleas to possessing and transporting child pornography depicting actual minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-10\">.

Second, Congress sought to ban computer-generated images that are \u2018virtually indistinguishable\u2019 from those of real children, but are made without live children. <em>Id. </em>... Third, the new law was designed to protect the privacy of actual children whose innocuous images are altered to create sexually explicit pictures.... Fourth, Congress wished to deprive child abusers of a \u2018criminal tool' frequently used to facilitate the sexual abuse of children.\u201d <em>Hilton, </em>167 F.3d at 66-67. <em>See United States v.
