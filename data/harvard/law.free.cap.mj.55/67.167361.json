He pleaded guilty to a single specification of wrongfully using marijuana, in violation of Article 112a, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 912a. On February 26, 1998, he was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge and reduction to the grade of Airman Basic (E-l). On March 30, 1998, the convening authority approved this sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. (ACM S29523 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App., 4 Feb. 2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-26\">On July 31, 2000, this Court granted review on the following question of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-27\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED WHEN SHE PROHIBITED AP<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>PELLANT FROM PRESENTING EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTS A PUNITIVE DISCHARGE WOULD HAVE ON HIS RETIREMENT BENEFITS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We hold that the military judge prejudicially erred when she determined that defense sentencing evidence on appellant\u2019s expected retirement pay was irrelevant and too confusing for admission at his .court-martial. <em>See United States v. Becker, </em>46 MJ 141 (1997); <em>see also United States v. Loya, </em>49 MJ 104 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">At the time of appellant\u2019s trial he had served 18 years and 3 months in the Air Force. The prosecution made a motion in limine to prevent the defense from offering evidence of the financial effects a bad-conduct discharge could have on his expected retirement benefits. The defense acknowledged that it intended to introduce such evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Defense Exhibit E for Identification was a \u201cMemorandum for ADC\u201d dated 26 Feb. 98, and signed by Technical Sergeant Donna E. Maler, Superintendent, Relocations. It addressed the subject of \u201cRetirement Pay Calculations\u201d for appellant. It estimated that appellant would receive $901.00 pay per month if he retired as an E-5, his current pay scale; $725.00 as an E-4; $622.00 as an E-3; $525.00 as an E-2; and $468.00 as an E-l. These estimates were based on the 1998 pay scale and were before taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Assistant trial counsel preemptively argued that such evidence should not be admitted. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">Your Honor, the Government objects to Defense Exhibit E on the basis of Military Rule of Evidence 403, holding that such evidence is so collateral as to be confusing to the members, and such confusion substantially outweighs whatever probative value it may have, if any, under Rule 402. Last June the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces decided two cases; <em>United States v. Greaves </em>and <em>United States v. Becker, </em>which clarified the 1989 <em>United States v. Henderson </em>case, by holding that there is no <em>per se </em>irrelevance rule for this kind of evidence, if retirement benefits are not vested. Each case must be decided on its own facts and the decision rests within the discretion of the military judge. <em>Greaves </em>was distinguished from <em>Henderson </em>based on the fact that the accused was eligible for retirement in only 2 months at the time of the trial. And the court said that he was, \u201cPerilously close to retirement.\u201d Henderson was 3 years away at the time of his trial. Becker was also within weeks of becoming retirement eligible and the court also said, \u201cAppellant was literally knocking at retirement\u2019s door at the time of his court-martial.\u201d Sergeant Luster, on the other hand, is around 2 years from retirement. I think the actual figure is 21 months. He retires 9 November \u201999, is his retirement date. And furthermore, he\u2019s much farther away than in <em>Greaves </em>and <em>Becker, </em>and furthermore, the offense he committed was last September and he wasn\u2019t even inside of 2 years when the offense was committed. The government feels that he does not meet the standard of what is perilously close to retirement, or knocking at the door. And the Government believes the case is factually much closer to <em>Henderson </em>than to either <em>Greaves </em>or <em>Becker </em>and that\u2019s the basis for our motion, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">Defense counsel argued that such evidence should be admitted in this case. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">Your Honor, the defense believes that it is incredibly relevant for the members to have an idea of what a punitive discharge would mean to Staff Sergeant Luster. As you know, as in <em>United States v. Becker, </em>it was ruled that the military judge, the trial judge, erred when he refused to admit defense mitigation evidence of the projected dollar amount of retirement income which the accused in that case might be denied if a punitive discharge had been adjudicated. There is really a two-prong test and as the prosecution has alluded to, a lot has to do with how close is the accused to retirement. In this particular case, Staff Sergeant Luster is a little under 21 months away from retirement. And it\u2019s the military judge\u2019s discretion as to how close to retirement is that really. It is a lot less than the 3 years in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>that the prosecution talked about. And the second prong, of course, would be, does Staff Sergeant Luster have to reenlist to reach retirement. And that is something that is talked about in <em>United States v. Becker, </em>where Becker did not have to reenlist to retire. And in this particular case, if you take a look at the personal data sheet, Staff Sergeant Luster would be eligible for retirement on 9 November \u201999, when his current enlistment expires. Based on the case law, and when you take a closer look at that, the defense submits that Staff Sergeant Luster is situated a lot closer to Becker in that he will be allowed to retire at the end of his current enlistment and after over 18 years of service in the United States Air Force, just under 21 months away. The defense would argue that that is perilously close to retirement, where he is in his last enlistment. He doesn\u2019t have to reenlist to retire and the members should have an idea of just how serious a punitive discharge would be in this case. As the <em>Becker </em>court stated, the sentencing authority should, in this particular case, should determine that the accused richly deserves a punitive discharge and also know what the loss of benefits of the substantial value over the remainder of his lifetime would mean. The sentencing authority shouldn\u2019t have to make that decision, however, while merely speculating about the significant impact of a punitive discharge. If the members were not allowed access to this type of data that you have in front of you, that the Military Personnel Flight has provided, the members would merely be guessing as to what type of financial penalty a punitive discharge or reduction in rank would have in Staff Sergeant Luster\u2019s case. And, therefore, we ask that you do allow that evidence to go forward. Thank you, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The prosecution responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">Your Honor, I would, first of all, say that reenlistment is just a factor to be considered and if you think about it logically, a person who is 3 years out, like Henderson, may not have to reenlist anyway, you know, before they retire as well, because you can have a 4-year enlistment. <em>So, the thing that is critical is the length of time until retirement. It\u2019s 2 years away, you know; it\u2019s far too long to be confusing the members about the effects of this retirement. And on that basis tve think it\u2019s just too confusing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">ATC: I have here <em>Becker, Greaves, </em>and <em>Henderson </em>for you to review copies of, if you would like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">MJ: That would be good. I need to review them again. I have looked at them before, but not recently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">The military judge subsequently granted the prosecution\u2019s motion in limine. She said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\"><em>[T]he court\u2019s decision is, I\u2019m not going to allow those to be admitted. </em>I will .allow counsel to talk generally about someone with 18 years of service and to question them in terms of <em>voir dire </em>about some of that. And that they clearly understand that a bad-conduct discharge would mean that he couldn\u2019t serve out the remaining 21 months of his enlistment and, therefore, be eligible. So, I will allow all of that and I can clarify either in the instruction to the members about punitive discharge. I could even add, if counsel would request, although, and I know members do have these questions, that that would include the inability \u2014 or the \u2014 that would preclude the accused from serving out the remainder of his enlistment and, therefore, becoming eligible for retirement benefits, I could clarify in instructions. I don\u2019t have a problem with that, I think that makes it clear if there are any questions. And then if they come back with any questions, like I\u2019ve had, about reductions and impacts on ability to retire, then we take those as they come. <em>Part of it is because it\u2019s almost 2 years, and in this particular type of offense, wrongful use of marijuana, and again, I know we don\u2019t instruct members on this either, the AFI 36-3208 clearly provides that, unless there is a waiver, and there could be, and I don\u2019t know if the commander or whoever would support that. In fact, unless those criteria are met, and they could decide it\u2019s experimen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>tal and it fits in that criteria, a discharge action has to be initiated. </em>And it does talk about members in the 16 to 20 year getting lengthy service consideration, and it has to go to a specific headquarters, and it lists it in the regulation, which I don\u2019t need to refer, which does tend to state that there is lengthy [service] consideration. But if I look at this case, unlike the other cases where we\u2019re talking 2 or 3 months from retirement <em>where the accused would, therefore, be eligible and nothing would preclude an accused from being retired, in this case, if the unit decided to initiate action and the accused didn\u2019t get a bad-conduct discharge, there would be sufficient time for that to go through that process, if the accused went to a board and there was a decision to discharge him, to potentially lose his benefits in that route. Therefore, when I consider all of these in this particular case with that length of the 21 months, I do think it\u2019s not, if you will, collateral, but it becomes more confusing as to what he be eligible for, at what time, and with that being that length of time, where a unit would still be able to potentially initiate action, he would be discharged anyway and not get them. </em>And the purpose is for them to determine whether a bad-conduct discharge is warranted. I would be willing, however, to address, as I said, in my instruction to make it very clear to the members that when I talk about punitive discharge and bad-conduct to add that wording that I talked about so that it\u2019s really clear and they understand that it would make him ineligible to serve the remainder of his enlistment and, therefore, become eligible in 21 months to potential retirement benefits. <em>But to go into the specifics of what those are, I think, at this point, it\u2019s irrelevant because it\u2019s so far out. </em>But again, if they would ask a question about high year tenure or anything like that, whether he had to be discharged, then I think we can address it and we have the document that provides us the information. So, that would be my ruling. I\u2019m not going to allow those in, but if the defense requests, I will add that to my instruction to make it very clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">DC: At this time, the defense would request that type of instruction, your Honor. MJ: Okay. Are we ready to proceed with <em>voir dire?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The Court of Criminal Appeals, 2000 WL 283905, held that the military judge\u2019s ruling concerning the loss of retirement benefits did not prejudice appellant, stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATK\">Although the trial judge granted the government motion and refused to admit evidence of the appellant\u2019s potential retirement benefits, she allowed counsel to <em>voir dire </em>the members about the appellant\u2019s 18 years of service; allowed him to argue the appellant\u2019s lengthy service during his sentencing argument; and the appellant mentioned the same during his unsworn statement. At the appellant\u2019s request, the trial judge tailored an instruction on the effects of a punitive discharge on the appellant\u2019s yet-as-earned retirement benefits to the facts and circumstances of his case. She instructed the members as follows: \u201cThis court may adjudge a bad-conduct discharge. Such a discharge deprives one of substantially all benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Air Force establishment and will deny the accused in this case the opportunity to serve the remainder of his 21-month 'enlistment <em>and, therefore, preclude the eligibility for retirement benefits.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Unpub. op. at 2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">The first question before this Court is whether the military judge erred in excluding evidence of appellant\u2019s estimated retirement pay at various ranks if he was not punitively discharged at this court-martial. In <em>United States v. Becker, </em>46 MJ 141, we held such evidence was clearly admissible under RCM 1001(c)(1)(B), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1984,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the accused is \u201cliterally knocking at retirement\u2019s door at the time of his court-martial\u201d and he requests \u201can opportunity to present\u201d such evidence and he has \u201csuch evidence to present.\u201d We rejected a <em>per se </em>rule precluding such defense evidence simply because an accused was not actually retirement eligible at the time of his court-martial. <em>Id. </em>at 144 (quoting Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 Judge Johnston\u2019s separate opinion). The clear import of this and related decisions concerning expected retirement pay is that it is a critical matter of which the members should be informed in certain cases before they decide to impose a punitive discharge. <em>See generally United States v. Sumrall, </em>45 MJ 207, 209 (1996); <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>25 MJ 423, 424 (CMA 1988) (loss of retirement benefits \u201coften [is] the single most important sentencing matter to that accused and the sentencing authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Our decisions, however, do provide a military judge with a certain amount of discretion in determining whether to allow evidence regarding the loss of retirement benefits in a particular case. <em>See United States v. Greaves, </em>46 MJ 133, 139 (1997). The judge\u2019s decision should not be based solely on the number of months until an accused\u2019s retirement where other facts and circumstances indicate that the loss of these benefits is a significant issue in the ease. <em>See United States v. Becker, supra </em>at 144. Here, appellant had 18 years and 3 months of military service and he was serving an enlistment which would normally result in his eligibility for retirement. <em>Cf. United States v. Henderson, </em>29 MJ 221, 222 (CMA 1989). Moreover, the probability of retirement, but for a punitive discharge, was not otherwise shown by the Government to be remote, and the expected financial loss was substantial. <em>See United States v. Greaves, supra </em>at 139; <em>United States v. Sumrall, supra </em>at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The military judge, on her own initiative, rejected evidence of these facts and instead focused on the regulatory possibility that appellant would not be retired even if he was not punitively discharged at this court-martial. She noted appellant\u2019s potential for administrative separation for drug use under \u201cAFI 36-3208\u201d and the fact that the time remaining on his enlistment was sufficient to conduct an administrative discharge board. She concluded that this circumstance rendered the whole matter of loss of retirement benefits too \u201cconfusing\u201d to present to members and \u201cirrelevant\u201d because his retirement was not guaranteed. <em>See United States v. Luster, supra </em>(CCA opinion at 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">We disagree with the reasoning of the military judge. She effectively established a guaranteed retirement standard (no possible regulatory impediment to retirement) before this evidence could be admitted. Our case law has rejected <em>per se </em>rules of this type. <em>See United States v. Becker, </em>46 MJ at 143 (this Court rejects rule requiring strict retirement eligibility at time of trial). Moreover, her conclusion concerning appellant\u2019s retirement was based on admitted speculation. She conceded that administrative separation on this ground was not mandatory and the command could seek a waiver or meet certain regulatory criteria. In addition, she admitted that there was no basis in the record for her to conclude that the command would or would not seek a regulatory waiver. Finally, the members were fully capable of and responsible for determining this regulatory possibility and its import after a full presentation of evidence by both sides. <em>Cf. United States v. Perry, </em>48 MJ 197, 199 (1998). In this light, we conclude that the military judge relied on erroneous legal principles in deciding to exclude the profferred defense evidence. <em>See United States v. Travers, </em>25 MJ 61, 63 (CMA 1987) (abuse of discretion occurs where judge relies on erroneous legal principles).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">The second question before us is whether appellant was materially prejudiced by the judge\u2019s erroneous decision to exclude this defense evidence. Article 59(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 859(a). The exclusion of evidence of \u201cthe value of [an accused\u2019s] projected retirement\u201d has been found to be prejudicial error where the servicemember had 19 years and 8$ months of active service and had reliable evidence showing the projected loss. <em>See United States v. Becker, supra </em>at 142. Here, appellant had 18 years and 3 months of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>service and needed only to successfully complete his current enlistment to be eligible to retire. He also had no record of prior convictions or non-judicial punishments (although he was not a perfect airman) and he had reliable evidence as to the projected loss of retirement income as a result of a punitive discharge. In these circumstances, where the decision to award a punitive discharge was such a close call <em>(see also United States v. Eversole, </em>53 MJ 132, 134 (2000)), we are \u201cleft in grave doubt\u201d about the influence of the judge\u2019s error on the sentence. <em>See generally Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The Court of Criminal Appeals nevertheless concluded that appellant was not materially prejudiced because \u201cthe members were not left \u2018largely unguided in a critical sentencing area.\u2019 \u201d It relied on our decision in <em>United States v. Greaves, </em>46 MJ at 138, for this standard for reversal and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">The trial judge\u2019s ruling did not preclude the appellant from exercising his broad right to present mitigation evidence to the court-members during sentencing. Evidence in the record of trial could not be clearer that a punitive discharge would deny the appellant of [sic] his potential retirement benefits. Furthermore, we are confident that members chosen for court-martial duty under Article 25(d)(2), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 [8]25(d)(2) criteria are generally aware of the monetary effect resulting from the loss of retirement benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Unpub. op. at 3. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Our decision in <em>Greaves, </em>dealt with an instruction that the members were not to consider the effect of a punitive discharge on expected retirement pay, given in light of questions by the members. It is clear that the members of this appellant\u2019s court-martial were instructed properly by the military judge on this issue. (A bad-conduct \u201cdischarge ... will deny the accused in this case the opportunity to serve the remainder of his 21-month enlistment and, therefore, preclude the eligibility for retirement benefits.\u201d) However, in <em>Becker, </em>decided the same day as <em>Greaves, </em>we further held that an accused could also be materially prejudiced if he was denied the right to present to the members a detailed and comprehensive picture of his expected financial loss to demonstrate the financial impact of a punitive discharge. <em>Becker, </em>not <em>Greaves, </em>controls.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">In this light, the critical question is not whether the members generally understood that retirement benefits would be forfeited by a punitive discharge. Instead, we must ask whether appellant was allowed to substantially present his particular sentencing case to the members on the financial impact of a punitive discharge. <em>See United States v. Loya, </em>49 MJ 104; <em>see also United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 317, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). In our view, appellant was significantly disadvantaged when he was required to present a more general sentencing case relying on oblique references in <em>voir-dire </em>questions to the members and in counsel\u2019s argument. <em>See United States v. Becker </em>and <em>United States v. Sumrall, </em>both <em>supra; United States v. Henderson, </em>29 MJ at 223. This disadvantage was exploited by trial counsel who in his closing argument asserted \u201cthat a punitive discharge ... doesn\u2019t take your money away.\u201d Accordingly, in view of all the circumstances of appellant\u2019s case, we find prejudicial error. <em>See United States v. Becker, supra </em>at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals as to findings is affirmed and as to sentence is reversed. The sentence is set aside. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force. A rehearing on sentence may be ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-4\">. \"Matter in mitigation of an offense is introduced to lessen the punishment to be adjudged by the court-martial.... \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\">. We need not speculate whether the members of appellant\u2019s court-martial could infer the dollar amount of appellant's expected retirement loss from other evidence of appellant's pay at various pay grades presented at this court-martial for a different purpose. It suffices to say that <em>United States v. Becker, </em>46 MJ 141 (1997), comprehends a full and fair presentation of this critical information to the sentencing body, not after-the-fact speculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b184-12\">CRAWFORD, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">The sole issue in this case is whether the military judge abused her considerable discretion in refusing to admit a document that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>reflected sums appellant would receive at various levels between pay grades E-5 and E-l if permitted to retire from the United States Ah- Force. Prior to rejecting this evidence (Defense Exhibit E for Identification), the military judge announced on the record that the evidence was irrelevant and posed a risk of confusing the members. Both are sound reasons for excluding evidence under the Military Rules of Evidence and case law. <em>See </em>Mil.R.Evid. 401, 402, and 403, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.); <em>United States v. Becker, </em>46 MJ 141 (1997). The majority concludes that the military judge \u201crelied on erroneous legal principles\u201d in rejecting the evidence and thus she abused her discretion. 55 MJ at 71. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">This Court\u2019s standard of review on the admission or exclusion of sentencing matters is highly deferential, reversing only for a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See United, States v. Zakaria, </em>38 MJ 280, 283 (1993). <em>See also Becker, supra </em>at 143; <em>United States v. Loving, </em>41 MJ 213, 273 (1994), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>517 U.S. 748, 116 S.Ct. 1737, 135 L.Ed.2d 36 (1996). The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d has a variety of definitions. <em>See </em>S. Childress &amp; M. Davis, <em>Federal Standards of Review </em>\u00a7 4.21 (3d ed.1999). Definitions of \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d from this Court have appropriately fluctuated depending on the action being tested on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In <em>United States v. Travers, </em>25 MJ 61, 62-63 (1987), we set out this basic definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">An \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d exists where \u201creasons or rulings of the\u201d military judge are \u201cclearly untenable and ... deprive a party of a substantial right such as to amount to a denial of justice\u201d; it \u201cdoes not imply an improper motive, willful purpose, or intentional wrong.\u201d <em>Guggenmos v.

Pettegrew, </em>128 Neb. 783, 260 N.W. 287 (1935).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard is a strict one and has been defined in <em>United States v. Yoakum, </em>8 MJ 763 (ACMR 1980), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>9 MJ 417 (CMA 1980), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">To reverse for \u201can abuse of discretion involves far more than a difference in ... opinion____ The challenged action must ... be found to be \u2018arbitrary, fanciful, clearly unreasonable,\u2019 or \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 in order to be invalidated on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">Quoting <em>United States v. Glenn, </em>473 F.2d 191, 196 (D.C.Cir.1972).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-14\">\u201cAn abuse of discretion arises in cases in which the judge was controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from legal, conclusions, is without evidentiary support.\u201d <em>Renney v. Dobbs House, Inc., </em>275 S.C. 562, 274 S.E.2d 290, 291 (1981), citing <em>Stewart v. Floyd, </em>274 S.C. 437, 265 S.E.2d 254 (1980).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">Since <em>Travers, </em>this Court has taken the potpourri of \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d definitions found therein and applied them in different contexts. In <em>United States v. Miller, </em>47 MJ 352, 358 (1997), we tested denial of a continuance for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-16\">\u201creasons or rulings [which] ... are clearly untenable and ... deprive a party of a substantial right such as to amount to a denial of justice\u201d; [this] \u201cdoes not imply an improper motive, willful purpose, or intentional wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">Yet, later in the same opinion we tested the denial of a defense request to produce a witness based on \u201cwhether \u2018on the whole,\u2019 denial of the defense witness was improper.\u2019 \u201d 47 MJ at 359, quoting <em>United States v. Ruth, </em>46 MJ 1, 3 (1997). In <em>Ruth, </em>we said that \u201c[t]he reviewing court should not set aside a judicial action \u2018unless it has a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-18\">In <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>48 MJ 81 (1998), we tested action on a motion to suppress by the standard that \u201c[t]o reverse for an abuse of discretion involves far more than a difference in ... opinion.... The challenged action must ... be found to be arbitrary, fanciful, clearly unreasonable, or clearly erroneous in order to be invalidated on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83 (internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>omitted)(citmg <em>Travers, </em>25 MJ at 62). <em>Accord United States v. Johnson, </em>49 MJ 467, 473 (1998) and <em>United States v. Miller, </em>46 MJ 63, 65 (1997) (evaluating a military judge\u2019s discretion to admit evidence under Mil.R.Evid. 403); <em>United States v. Barron, </em>52 MJ 1 (1999) (testing exercise of discretion in not disqualifying a previously qualified expert witness for improper action). On some occasions, the Court has reversed a judicial ruling without articulating an abuse-of-discretion standard under the facts of that ease. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Grill, </em>48 MJ 131 (1998)(two dissenters found no abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">While the term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d might be vexingly expansive, its definition cannot be exacting without unnecessarily curtailing \u201cthe broad powers\u201d of the military judge at trial. <em>See United States v. Rosser, </em>6 MJ 267, 271 (CMA 1979). I can find nothing in this military judge\u2019s ruling that convinces me that it was arbitrary, fanciful, clearly unreasonable, or untenable. Neither does the majority-</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">A military judge also abuses her discretion if she improperly applies legal principles when rejecting a piece of evidence. <em>See Becker, </em>46 MJ at 143; <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>41 MJ 177, 185 (CMA 1994); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>37 MJ 352, 356 (CMA 1993). The majority\u2019s reliance on this abuse-of-discretion application falls of its own weight. <em>See </em>55 MJ at 69-70 (quoting military judge\u2019s explanation for her ruling).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Before making her ruling, the military judge reviewed two recent cases from this <em>Court </em>\u2014 Becker, and <em>United States v. Greaves, </em>46 MJ 133 (1997). In <em>Becker, </em>a unanimous decision, we held that \u201crelevance of evidence of potential loss of retirement benefits depends upon the facts and circumstances of the individual accused\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143. The error in <em>Becker </em>was the military judge\u2019s misreading of <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>29 MJ 221 (CMA 1989), and <em>\u201cper se </em>excluding] defense evidence of the estimated value of appellant\u2019s expected military retirement.\u201d 46 MJ at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\"><em>Greaves, </em>also an unanimous opinion from this Court, found that the judge erred by instructing the members not to consider the impact of a punitive discharge on appellant\u2019s impending retirement eligibility, in light of two questions posed by court members.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">Contrary to the views of the majority today, a military judge does not abuse her discretion so long as she does not adopt an iron clad, <em>per se </em>rule regarding evidence of retirement benefits (or loss thereof), or improperly answers questions related to retirement. To use Professor Rosenberg\u2019s analogy,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this Court has fenced off only a portion of the pasture land. So long as the military judge provided appropriate instructions and answers to retirement issues, and didn\u2019t restrict the retirement-benefit evidence of an accused \u201cknocking on retirement\u2019s door,\u201d 46 MJ at 144 (19 years, 10 months in Greaves\u2014 46 MJ at 134; 19 years, 8$ months in <em>Becker </em>\u2014 id. at 142),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> she was free to apply her discretion to any proffered evidence. As we have held, judges are \u201cpresumed to know and apply the law correctly.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Raya, </em>45 MJ 251, 253 (1996). Here the judge was faced with the ticklish decision of admitting evidence that could mislead the members into thinking that appellant\u2019s retirement was a \u201csure thing,\u201d when she knew that Air Force regulations required a commander to initiate administrative action if there had been no discharge by a court-martial for drug use. The court members are presumed to have knowledge of this Air Force regulation as well. <em>See United States v. Tolkach, </em>14 MJ 239 (CMA 1982). I am also confident that when these court members (a major, two captains, a senior master sergeant, two master sergeants, and a technical sergeant) deliberated on sentence, they were fully cognizant of one fact known to every servicemember of their rank \u2014 retired pay for 20 years of active duty service (which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>is all appellant expected) is 50 percent of base pay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Either including or excluding the proffered defense exhibit without placing that evidence in context would both confuse the members and undermine the criminal justice system. Faced with this dilemma, the military judge prevented confusion by excluding the speculative retirement pay chart. This ruling thus precluded any rebuttal evidence concerning virtually mandatory (absent waiver) administrative separation for drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">However, the military judge did not preclude counsel from focusing on appellant\u2019s retirement. She ruled that counsel could comment on retirement eligibility during both <em>voir dire </em>and sentencing argument. The centerpiece of trial defense counsel\u2019s argument was a plea to punish appellate in some way other than by awarding a bad-conduct discharge and depriving him of an opportunity to become retirement eligible in 21 months. Additionally, at appellant\u2019s request the military judge instructed the members that a bad-conduct discharge deprives one of substantially all benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs as well as all retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Since I conclude that this military judge did not go beyond the legal principles set forth by this Court in <em>Becker </em>and <em>Greaves, </em>and did not establish any <em>per se </em>rule for admission of retirement-eligibility evidence, there has been no clear abuse of her discretion, either through misapplication of the law or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Accordingly, I would affirm the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-8\">. <em>See </em>M. Rosenberg, <em>Judicial Discretion of the Trial Court, Viewed from Above, 22 </em>Syracuse L.Rev. 635, 650 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-14\">.

The military judge\u2019s instructions (which were given to the members both verbally and in writing) included accurate assessments of appellant's base pay at the various grades from E-5 to E-l. <em>See </em>Appendix. The difference between the monthly figures appellant was denied the opportunity to present and the figures easily ascertained by the members was de minimus. Accordingly, trial defense counsel\u2019s rejected exhibit added nothing to the member\u2019s basis of knowledge concerning retirement benefits or the loss thereof. Thus, the instruction did not cover the last column in the Appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
