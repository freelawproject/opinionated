The cause of death was determined to be \u201cmanual strangulation, either alone or in combination with one of the other forms of asphyxia,\u201d such as use of a ligature like the necklace PFC Shanklin was wearing or \u201cburking\u201d \u2014 a combination of smothering and pressure on the chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">Appellant lived with PFC Shanklin, her 3-year-old daughter, and her 15-year-old sister, Kijafa Walker, until June 23, 1995. (R. 826, 828-30, 965) On that date, appellant and PFC Shanklin had a physical altercation in her quarters. PFC Shanklin called the Military Police, who apprehended appellant and removed him from the quarters. The next day, June 24, appellant\u2019s commander ordered him to stay away from PFC Shankliris quarters. Appellant\u2019s conviction of willful disobedience of this no-contact order is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-18\">On the afternoon of July 7, 1995, the day before her death, appellant went to PFC Shankliris quarters and asked Kijafa when she would return. Kijafa told appellant that she would return at about 1:00 p.m., and appellant waited \u201coutside walking up and down, up and down.\u201d PFC Shanklin actually returned between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m., accompanied by Sergeant (SGT) Harris, her squad leader, who was teaching her how to drive a car with a manual transmission. They continued to drive around for about 30 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-19\">PFC Shanklin and appellant then conversed sometime between 4:00 p.m. until about 6:00 p.m., when appellant left PFC Shankliris quarters and went to the quarters of Staff Sergeant (SSG) Kimberly Rogers, with whom he was then living. Appellant and SSG Rogers had an argument that evening, which ended when Rogers told him that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want him anymore\u201d because she thought he was involved with another woman named Carla [PFC Shankliris first name]. According to SSG Rogers, he responded as if he \u201cdidn\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-20\">Appellant then went to the Noncommis-sioned Officers\u2019 (NCO) Club at Schofield Barracks, where he became involved in a conversation with SSG Michael Jones about Jones\u2019 relationship with PFC Shanklin. Although SSG Jones insisted that he was just \u201cfriends\u201d with PFC Shanklin, appellant ended the conversation by saying, \u201cI love her, she loves me, and may the best man win.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>SSG Jones noticed appellant\u2019s white four-door Cadillac parked in the NCO Club parking lot. He last saw appellant between 7:45 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">SSG Jones went to PFC Shanklin\u2019s quarters, and from about 9:15 p.m. until 12:45 a.m., they drove around in Jones\u2019 truck. They had intended to return earlier but were delayed because they had a flat tire. Appellant called PFC Shanklin at about 9:30 p.m., but her sister told him that she was not home.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Kijafa testified that she was awakened during the night by a female scream that sounded frightened and \u201clike it didn\u2019t get a chance to finish.\u201d She looked into the hallway, saw nothing, and then went back to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m., SGT Christopher Robinson, who shared a common bedroom wall with PFC Shanklin, also heard a loud, shrill scream that \u201cwas cut off.\u201d He then heard \u201ca rhythmic thumping\u201d for about 15-30 seconds. At about 5:00 a.m. he heard a car door slam.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">At about the same time, Ms. Marion McCloud, who lived across the street, was awakened by a loud noise. She looked out the window and saw a white car parked in the parking lot, \u201cwhich was unusual because usually no white cars parked there at night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The next morning, Kijafa attempted to awaken PFC Shanklin by calling her name. She noticed that PFC Shanklin was not moving, had foam coming from her mouth, and had bruises on her arm. She went outside and told SGT Robinson, who was working on his car, that she could not awaken PFC Shanklin. Kijafa asked SGT Robinson to ask his wife to come outside, and she then asked Mrs. Robinson to help her awaken PFC Shanklin. SGT Robinson and his wife went to PFC Shanklin\u2019s bedroom, where he saw foam and blood coming from her mouth and noticed that she was cold and stiff. He also noticed that the bedroom window was open with the blinds down and a dresser seemed out of place. According to Kijafa, PFC Shanklin never opened the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">SGT Robinson talked to the Military Police, and Kijafa paged appellant several times. When appellant called back, Kijafa told him that \u201csomething happened and you need to get over here.\u201d After appellant repeatedly asked why, SGT Robinson took the telephone and said, \u201cSomething happened to Carla.\u201d Appellant responded \u201calmost jokingly,\u201d \u201cWhy, is she dead?\u201d SGT Robinson said, \u2018Yes,\u201d and appellant \u201cstarted to cry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">Kijafa testified that she did not tell appellant that PFC Shanklin was dead. In cross-examination, however, she admitted that she initially told an agent from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) that she told appellant that PFC Shanklin \u201cmight be dead.\u201d She testified that she was \u201cshaken up\u201d and answered without thinking when she talked to the CID, but she insisted at trial that she did not tell appellant that PFC Shanklin was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Another soldier drove appellant to PFC Shanklin\u2019s quarters. When the soldier asked appellant why he was crying, appellant said, \u201cCarla\u2019s dead.\u201d Appellant also told the soldier that \u201che knew they were going to try to pin it on him because [she] was his girlfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">Appellant was questioned by CID Special Agent (SA) West. Appellant told SA West that he spent the night with SSG Rogers, except for about 30 minutes around midnight when he drove his car to a Texaco station, left it there, and walked back. Appellant\u2019s alibi was contradicted by SSG Rogers, who testified that appellant left around 11:00 p.m. and did not return until daybreak. Appellant did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">When he interviewed appellant, SA West observed scratches on his arms and a gouge on his index finger. SSG Rogers testified that, on July 9, appellant pointed to the scratches on his arm and said, \u201cGirl, you tore me up,\u201d and \u201cKim, you scratched me, you did scratch me.\u201d SSG Rogers denied scratching appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">Mr. George Grady testified that around 9:30 a.m. on July 8, 1995, the day after PFC Shanklin\u2019s death, appellant came to his house with a container \u201cabout the size of a shoe box\u201d and asked him to- get rid of the box for him. As they were talking, appellant seemed nervous and said, \u201cI \u2014 I\u2014I did this \u2014 I did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>something.\u201d Mr. Grady threw the box into a dumpster without opening it.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) tests were performed on a substance found under PFC Shanklin\u2019s fingernails, as well as blood samples taken from appellant, the other suspect, and PFC Shanklin\u2019s daughter and sister, to determine their respective DNA profiles. The tests did not exclude the possibility that the material under PFC Shanklin\u2019s fingernails contained the DNA of more than one person. The tests excluded all donors of DNA samples as possible sources of the material, except for appellant and PFC Shank-lin.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The prosecution\u2019s expert, Ms. Meghan Clement, explained the testing process. She testified that the DNA from the material under PFC Shanklin\u2019s fingernails was tested for eight separate genetic systems. Appellant\u2019s DNA and the DNA of the material under PFC Shanklin\u2019s fingernails matched each other in all eight genetic systems. Ms. Clement testified that all the other suspects, as well as PFC Shanklin\u2019s sister and daughter, were excluded as possible sources because their DNA did not match the material under the fingernails in at least one genetic system.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">On cross-examination, Ms. Clement testified that, after the testing of appellant\u2019s DNA, her laboratory started testing for two additional genetic systems. Neither Ms. Clement nor any other witness stated how many known genetic systems there were at the time of trial or how many systems could have been reliably identified by the DNA test used in this case, <em>see </em>55 MJ at 273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The DNA evidence in this case was not tested for the two additional genetic systems. Ms. Clement opined that the possibility of excluding appellant as a donor of the DNA by testing for the two additional genetic systems was remote, because she had never seen a case where there were six or seven matches followed by a failure to match in the eighth, ninth, or tenth tests. Defense counsel did not challenge her assertion or question her regarding the number of cases on which her assertion was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">The DNA evidence was of considerable interest to the members, as evidenced by questions from six of the eight members. Their questions pertained to the possibility of contamination of the samples, the potential for multiple contributors, the explanation for the limited readings from PFC Shanklin\u2019s right fingernail, the possibility of mistakes in the chain of custody, and the possibility of a retest.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">\n<em>Expert Assistance (Granted Issue and Specified Issue III)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Before trial, appellant asked the convening authority for expert assistance. He specifically asked that Dr. Patrick Conneally, PhD, be appointed under Mil.R.Evid. 502, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.), as a defense consultant on DNA evidence. He also asked that Dr. Conneally be produced at government expense as a defense expert witness. On April 4, 1996, the convening authority approved the request to employ Dr. Conneally.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">At a motions hearing on April 23, 1996, defense counsel informed the military judge that Dr. Conneally had advised employing someone else who was an expert in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing. Defense counsel informed the military judge that he was \u201cattempting to contact Doctor Conneally to get his suggestions on someone\u201d to perform the PCR testing. The defense filed a motion to preserve the evidence for further DNA testing and requested the convening authority to provide funds for DNA testing by an independent laboratory. The estimated cost of DNA retesting was $3000-4000. The military judge granted a defense motion to preserve the evidence for possible retesting, but the convening authority denied a defense request for funds to obtain an independent DNA test.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">Dr. Conneally recommended that Dr. Edward Blake be retained. Dr. Blake operates a DNA testing laboratory in California and had indicated his willingness to conduct additional DNA testing. Dr. Blake informed the defense that LabCorp, the laboratory used by the Government, had not followed \u201cthe standard general criminal forensic testing standards\u201d in conducting its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>At a motions hearing on May 15, 1996, the defense asked the military judge to order that funds be made available to hire Dr. Blake as a defense consultant and to conduct another DNA test. When asked by the military judge what would be accomplished by additional testing, defense counsel explained that they were concerned with possible contamination of the samples and misidentification of the sample taken from appellant. The military judge cautioned defense counsel, \u201c[Djon\u2019t make this DNA evidence into something more than it really is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">After considerable discussion about the need for DNA retesting, defense counsel informed the military judge: \u201cThe defense position really is that we would like to substitute Doctor Blake for Doctor Conneally[.]\u201d Defense counsel informed the military judge that $6000 was approved to retain Dr. Con-neally, but only $1000 had been spent. Nevertheless, the military judge denied the defense request, explaining her decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">It\u2019s up to the defense to figure out from the get go who they wanted as an expert. The convening authority, in good faith, relied upon the defense representation, looked at Doctor Conneally\u2019s qualifications. And we were litigating the issue of DNA experts earlier on face value as it was presented to the convening authority, Doctor Conneally appears to have impeccable credentials. Now, at the time that you requested the expert that was when the time was to decide who could provide the defense requested assistance. The convening authority gave the defense what they wanted and there\u2019s nothing before me to suggest that it\u2019s fundamentally unfair to require the defense to go with the expert that they asked for and the convening authority in good faith gave them for the purposes of preparing for trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The military judge left the door open for the defense to ask the convening authority to substitute Dr. Blake for Dr. Conneally. The defense asked the convening authority to substitute Dr. Blake for Dr. Conneally, but the convening authority denied the request, prompting the defense to ask for a continuance \u201cfor at least one month.\u201d In its request, the defense asserted that the funds allocated for Dr. Conneally were sufficient to retain Dr. Blake. Finally, the defense explained its reasons for the change of experts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">The fact of the matter is that the state of Hawaii does not have any forensically trained DNA labs of testing experts and the defense therefore needed the consultation of Dr. Conneally to be pointed in the right direction to a forensic expert, such as Dr. Blake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">The military judge denied the defense request for a continuance, remarking that \u201cthere is still nothing new in this appellate exhibit that would cause me to reconsider my earlier ruling on this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Defense counsel then informed the military judge that he had not requested that Dr. Conneally be summoned to testify, and he reiterated that Dr. Conneally had recommended that the defense retain Dr. Blake to retest the DNA samples \u201cand also because Doctor Blake has expertise in forensic and criminology where Doctor Conneally does not.\u201d The military judge adhered to her earlier rulings and reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">[Wjhen the defense makes a request to the convening authority for an expert by name and the convening authority grants it, then the convening authority can rely that the defense has done its homework and has determined that this defense expert possesses the requisite qualifications at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">At oral argument before this Court, appellant government counsel asserted that a retest would have delayed the trial by one and a half months. Appellate defense counsel asserted that consultation with Dr. Blake would have taken only \u201ca couple of days,\u201d and a retest could have been accomplished within 24 hours after Dr. Blake received the samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">When trial on the merits began on June 12, 1996, the defense did not present any expert testimony at trial. The record does not reflect whether defense counsel consulted further with Dr. Conneally after the military judge denied the request to employ Dr. Blake.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Appellant now contends that the military judge was arbitrary and capricious in denying the defense requests to substitute Dr. Blake for Dr. Conneally, retest the unknown material found under PFC Shanklin\u2019s fingernails, and verify that the blood samples used by the Government\u2019s laboratory was actually appellant\u2019s. The Government argues that appellant was provided with \u201cmore than ample expert assistance\u201d and that the military judge did not abuse her discretion by denying the request for retesting, because appellant failed to identify any substantive defects in the chain of custody or point to any evidence of contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">When an accused asks for expert assistance, \u201che must demonstrate the necessity for\u201d it. <em>United States v. Garries, </em>22 MJ 288, 291 (CMA), cert. <em>denied, </em>479 U.S. 985, 107 S.Ct. 575, 93 L.Ed.2d 578 (1986). An accused is not entitled to a specific \u201cexpert of his own choosing,\u201d but is entitled only to \u201ccompetent assistance.\u201d <em>United States v. Burnette, </em>29 MJ 473, 475 (CMA), cert. <em>denied, </em>498 U.S. 821, 111 S.Ct. 70, 112 L.Ed.2d 43 (1990). We review a military judge\u2019s decisions on requests for expert assistance for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Short, </em>50 MJ 370, 373 (1999), cert. <em>denied, </em>528 U.S. 1105, 120 S.Ct. 843, 145 L.Ed.2d 712 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The necessity for expert assistance is not at issue in this case. The only issue is whether appellant was provided \u201ccompetent assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">In this case, the DNA testing was done in 1995 and appellant was tried in 1996. At that time, PCR testing was relatively new. Indeed, many appellate courts were still struggling to determine if PCR testing was sufficiently reliable to be admissible. <em>See </em>2 Paul C. Giannelli &amp; Edward J. Imwinkelried, <em>Scientific Evidence </em>\u00a7 18-5(A) at 53-54 n. 165 (3d ed.1999); <em>see also </em>Federal Judicial Center, <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence </em>[hereafter 1994 Reference Manual] 277 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">With the rapid growth of forensic-science techniques, it has become increasingly apparent that complex cases require more than general practitioners. <em>See </em>Edward J. Im-winkelried, <em>Expert Witness: An Unheralded Change, </em>The National Law Journal at A10 (February 5, 2001). Well before this case was tried, courts began finding that forensic DNA testing was beyond the ken of many traditional \u201cexperts.\u201d See 1994 Reference Manual at 63; <em>see also </em>Federal Judicial Center, <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence </em>490 (2d ed.2000) (\u201cCourts have noted the lack of familiarity of academic experts\u2014 who have done respected work in other fields \u2014 with the scientific literature on forensic DNA typing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">The prosecution\u2019s DNA expert in this ease testified that DNA initially was used for medical research, to identify genes that cause diseases. She testified that her employer, LabCorp, divided its operation into three functional areas: medical diagnosis, paternity testing, and forensic testing. Finally, she testified that, in the short time between the DNA testing of the evidence in this case and appellant\u2019s trial, tests for two additional genetic systems were implemented at her laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">Defense counsel asserted, without contradiction by the prosecution, that there were no DNA testing laboratories in Hawaii. Thus, the defense was required to find an appropriate expert in mainland United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">Dr. Conneally\u2019s curriculum vitae demonstrates that his expertise was in the area of medical genetics, not forensic testing. He told appellant\u2019s defense counsel that appellant needed an expert in forensic PCR testing. Dr. Blake is an expert in forensic testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">The substitution of Dr. Blake for Dr. Con-neally or the addition of Dr. Blake to the defense team would not have incurred any increased cost to the Government. In this case appellate government counsel have asserted that the trial might have been delayed 6 weeks, while appellate defense counsel have insisted that it would have taken only a \u201ccouple of days\u201d for defense counsel to consult with Dr. Blake and 24 hours to retest the sample. At trial and on appeal, govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ment counsel did not assert that a delay of 6-8 weeks would have prejudiced their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The DNA evidence was the linchpin of the prosecution case. It excluded all possible suspects except appellant. Appellant was on trial for murder, facing a life sentence, and needed the tools to competently test the prosecution\u2019s DNA evidence. On its face, the Government\u2019s DNA evidence appeared incomplete, because it was not subjected to the tests for two additional genetic systems that were developed after the Government\u2019s evidence was first tested. The two additional tests were evidence of the rapid pace of development in the area of PCR testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">While defense counsel was not as articulate as we would like in explaining why Dr. Con-neally could not provide \u201ccompetent assistance,\u201d it is clear from the record as a whole that the defense needed expert assistance in the technical aspects of PCR testing, not the general scientific principles underlying it. It is also clear from the military judge\u2019s exhortation \u2014 \u201c[Djon\u2019t make this DNA evidence into something more than it really is\u201d- \u2014 that she did not fully appreciate the complexities or importance of the DNA evidence and the rapidly advancing technology of DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Appellant needed more than generalized expertise in genetic medical diagnosis; he needed specific assistance in the then-new and rapidly evolving techniques of PCR testing. Appellant needed an expert to testify how many genetic systems were capable of being compared with the technology then available. He needed an expert to challenge or contradict Ms. Clement\u2019s assertion that additional tests probably would not exclude appellant as a suspect. Dr. Conneally either could not or would not provide those tools. The defense proffer was that Dr. Blake could have provided those tools at no additional cost to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The defense request for Dr. Blake was timely. Nineteen days after the request for Dr. Conneally was approved, the defense informed the military judge that they needed an expert in PCR testing. Almost a month before trial, the defense specifically requested Dr. Blake. There is no evidence of bad faith or witness shopping, and no indication that the prosecution would have been prejudiced by any delay. <em>See generally United States v. Miller, </em>47 MJ 352, 358 (1997) (factors to be considered in deciding whether to delay a trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The military judge did not focus on the issue whether Dr. Conneally was able or willing to provide the needed expertise. Instead, she focused on taking defense counsel to task for requesting an expert who was either unable or unwilling to provide what the defense needed, <em>i.e., </em>expertise in PCR testing. <em>See United States v. Weisbeck, </em>50 MJ 461, 465-66 (1999) (military judge abused discretion by denying expert assistance that went to heart of defense and would have delayed trial only 6 weeks, and military judge focused only on \u201cholding the defense\u2019s feet to the fire\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">We conclude that the military judge\u2019s focus on holding the defense\u2019s feet to the fire arbitrarily deprived appellant of the tools he needed. Accordingly, we hold that the military judge abused her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Although appellant did not receive the competent expert assistance that was necessary, we are unable to determine whether the court-martial\u2019s findings of guilty were \u201csubstantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). In our view, the interests of justice will be best served by returning this case to the Judge Advocate General and giving appellant an opportunity to demonstrate to the Court of Criminal Appeals, with the assistance of an expert in PCR testing, how he would have changed the evidentiary posture of this case if the military judge had granted his request for Dr. Blake. <em>See United States v. Curtis, </em>31 MJ 395 (CMA1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">\n<em>Legal and Factual Sufficiency (Specified Issues I and II)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Appellant asserts that the court below, 54 MJ 331, made numerous findings of fact that are unsupported by the record. Among the asserted factual errors are the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">(1) The court below found that \u201cMs. McCloud saw a white car driving away\u201d (un-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>pub. op. at 4); she testified only that she saw a white car in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">(2) The court below found that Kijafa Walker \u201cran outside and requested help\u201d from SGT Robinson (unpub. op. at 4). Appellant asserts that Kijafa made \u201csmall talk\u201d with SGT Robinson and then told him that she could not awaken PFC Shanklin. The record of trial reflects that Kijafa \u201cstarted in with small talk\u201d and then told SGT Robinson that she could not awaken PFC Shanklin; and that she then asked to speak with Mrs. Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">(3) The court below found that appellant responded to SGT Robinson\u2019s request to \u201ccome over to the quarters\u201d by spontaneously asking, \u201cWhy is Carla dead?\u201d (Unpub. op. at 4) (comma omitted after \u201cWhy\u201d in unpublished opinion); the record reflects that Ki-jafa initially told the CID that she told appellant that PFC Shanklin \u201cmight be dead,\u201d but that she recanted that statement at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">(4) The court below stated: \u201cAppellant\u2019s alternative explanation for the scratches [on his hands and arms] was that they occurred while he was working on his car.\u201d Unpub. op. at 6. Appellant asserts that no member of the defense team ever claimed that he was scratched while working on his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The Courts of Criminal Appeals are unique in that they are charged with \u201cthe duty of determining not only the legal sufficiency of the evidence but also its factual sufficiency.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 MJ 324 (CMA 1987). They must be \u201cconvinced of\u2019 an appellant\u2019s \u201cguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325. If our Court is in doubt whether the court below properly determined the factual sufficiency of the evidence, the remedy is to remand the case for a proper factual review of the findings of guilty. <em>Id. </em>Our Court \u201cwill not overturn findings of fact by a Court of Criminal Appeals unless they are clearly erroneous or unsupported by the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Tollinchi, </em>54 MJ 80, 82 (2000), citing <em>United States v. Avery, </em>40 MJ 325, 328 (CMA 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">In this case, we need not decide whether the factual-sufficiency determination by the court below was defective, in light of our decision regarding the Granted Issue and Specified Issue III.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is set aside. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General for remand to the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Judge Advocate General will provide $5000 to appellant for employment of Dr. Blake or another equivalent expert. Thereafter, appellant will have 90 days to file supplemental pleadings with the court below, which may order a factfind-ing hearing if the additional pleadings make it necessary. The court below will reconsider the factual and legal sufficiency of the evidence in light of any additional matters submitted by appellant, taking specific cognizance of the factual errors asserted by appellant as the basis for Specified Issue I. In the alternative, the court below may order a rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b389-14\">CRAWFORD, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ahk\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s view that \u201c[t]he necessity for expert assistance is not at issue in this case,\u201d 55 MJ at 275,1 believe the sole issue is whether appellant demonstrated that Dr. Blake\u2019s expert assistance was necessary. A concession that an appellant is entitled to interpretive assistance from one expert does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>turn a necessity-for-a-second expert question into an adequacy-of-expert-assistance inquiry. That appears to be what the majority has done. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">Upon a showing of necessity, any accused is entitled to competent assistance of an expert. <em>See Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985); <em>United States v. Gunkle, </em>55 MJ 26, 31 (2001); <em>United States v. Short, </em>50 MJ 370, 372 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1105, 120 S.Ct. 843, 145 L.Ed.2d 712 (2000); <em>United States v. Ndanyi, </em>45 MJ 315, 319 (1996); <em>United States v. Burnette, </em>29 MJ 473, 475 (CMA), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 821, 111 S.Ct. 70, 112 L.Ed.2d 43 (1990); <em>United States v. Garries, </em>22 MJ 288 (CMA), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 985, 107 S.Ct. 575, 93 L.Ed.2d 578 (1986). This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>has adopted a three-pronged test for showing that expert assistance is necessary. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>39 MJ 459, 461, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 965, 115 S.Ct. 429, 130 L.Ed.2d 342 (1994). <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>51 MJ 445, 455 (1999). It is the defense\u2019s burden to show (1) why the expert is needed; (2) what such expert assistance would accomplish for the defendant; and (3) why defense counsel is \u201cunable to gather and present the evidence that the expert assistant would be able to develop.\u201d Once defense counsel has met this <em>Gonzalez </em>test and shown necessity, the Government must provide \u201ccompetent\u201d expert assistance. <em>See Ndanyi, </em>45 MJ at 319. Additionally, \u201c[d]efense counsel are expected to educate themselves to obtain competence in defending an issue presented in a particular case.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>39 MJ 235, 238 (CMA), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 931, 115 S.Ct. 324, 130 L.Ed.2d 284 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">By specifically approving the defense request to hire Dr. Conneally, the Government conceded that appellant was entitled to expert assistance in interpreting the DNA findings of LabCorp, and nothing more. <em>See </em>RCM 703(d), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.). The Rules for Court-Martial are not written to provide trial defense counsel with \u201ca credit card\u201d once necessity for one expert witness is established. If Dr. Conneally was unable to provide the advice for which money was appropriated, then it was incumbent on defense counsel to demonstrate, anew, necessity, using the <em>Gonzalez </em>test, for Dr. Blake. To say that because money had been set aside for one expert (Dr. Conneally) for a particular purpose, that money belonged to defense counsel and could automatically go to a different expert (Dr. Blake) for different assistance is contrary to RCM 703(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Tfie sole hypothesis under which trial defense counsel argued the necessity of Dr. Blake\u2019s expert assistance was that the victim\u2019s fingernails (and skin under the fingernails from which DNA analysis was made) were somehow \u201ccontaminated.\u201d Dr. Blake was not shown to be a relevant and necessary expert witness on the subject of contamination. Accordingly, the military judge properly denied the defense\u2019s request to substitute Dr. Blake for the previously funded Dr. Conneally.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Detailed defense counsel requested the general court-martial convening authority to approve employment of Dr. Patrick M. Con-neally, Ph.D., an expert consultant in the field of DNA analysis, on March 20,1996. In support of his request, detailed defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">Defense believes that it is necessary that an expert consultant review the Government\u2019s DNA analysis, review the Government\u2019s findings and procedures, independently analyze the data, and familiarize defense counsel with DNA uses generally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Later in the same request defense counsel wrote: \u201cShould Government grant Defense\u2019s request for Dr. Conneally\u2019s services, there is the probability that Dr. Conneally will testify as a Defense expert witness in the case of <em>U.S. v. McAllister.\" </em>Defense counsel had been in possession of LabCorp\u2019s <em>(see </em>55 MJ at 279, infra) findings and report for 2 months prior to this request to employ Dr. Conneally. Presuming defense counsel to be both competent and ethical, we must presume that defense counsel and Dr. Conneally talked about LabCorp\u2019s report and PCR testing procedures prior to defense counsel\u2019s March 20 request to employ Dr. Conneally as an expert. On April 4, 1996, the convening authority approved Dr. Conneally\u2019s employment, as well as that of another expert, Dr. Hardman, a forensic pathologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Pursuant to a government motion to admit DNA evidence, the military judge held a hearing on April 23, 1996. Prior to taking testimony, the military judge asked defense counsel whether they were \u201csatisfied\u201d with their DNA expert (Dr. Conneally). Civilian defense counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">He was approved at least for \u2014 to act as a consultant. There was not approval for him for funding for trial testimony. We did send him the materials. We did have a consultation. He recommended, frankly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>that we retain someone who is an expert in PCR testing, specifically.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">After determining that defense counsel was shopping for an expert and \u201cattempting to contact Dr. Conneally to get his suggestions on someone, hopefully out of California,\u201d the military judge cautioned counsel that they needed to submit the request for any additional expert witnesses first to the convening authority and that it was \u201cnot up to the Government to find\u201d their expert witnesses for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Trial counsel later on presented witnesses who were present at PFC Shanklin\u2019s autopsy. In particular, evidence was adduced that explained how Dr. Ingwersen cut the deceased\u2019s fingernails and how these fingernails were collected and preserved. Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination clearly focused on the possibility of contamination during the autopsy process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In particular, counsel explored whether the deceased\u2019s hands had been covered prior to the autopsy. Questioning revealed that PFC Shanklin\u2019s hands and feet had been wrapped in paper bags prior to the autopsy. Defense counsel also asked whether any of the participants in the autopsy coughed or sneezed during the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Mr. Overson, from the CID lab in Atlanta, explained his receipt of the items to be tested from the CID office in Hawaii and the transfer of these items to LabCorp for testing. Again, the theme of potential contamination played a prominent part in the examination and cross-examination of Mr. Overson. Counsel established that Mr. Overson saw dirt or a substance that appeared to be dirt under the deceased\u2019s fingernails, and that the deceased used fingernail polish. Cross-examination also established that Mr. Overson \u201cdid not see any apparent blood, apparent skin,\u201d or \u201cany apparent other substance extraneous to the fingernail scrappings which I would call a definite biological substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">Following Mr. Overson, Ms. Meghan Clement, Assistant Director of Forensic Identity Testing at Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Incorporated, was qualified as an expert witness. Ms. Clement testified that the \u201cscientific community has been conducting DNA testing probably since the late 70s, early 80s.\u201d She noted that \u201cthe scientific community has reached the conclusion that as long as a test is performed properly and proper controls are employed that DNA testing in a forensic arena is reliable and acceptable.\u201d Ms. Clement explained that the forensic scientific community recognized three types of DNA testing, one of which, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), was used in appellant\u2019s case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She observed that there were \u201cnumerous major laboratories, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\u201d that were \u201cdoing some type of PCR analysis or initiating it in validation studies.\u201d She remarked that LabCorp was certified by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and that the laboratory participated in proficiency testing programs sponsored by CAP as well as Selmark Diagnostics from London, England.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">At trial, Ms. Clement testified that Lab-Corp tests ten areas (or particular genetic systems) for DNA. In the case at bar, Lab-Corp examined eight particular DNA target areas \u2014 DQ Alpha, LDLR, GYPA, HBGG, D7S8, GC, D1S80, HUMTHOl. When these specimens were initially submitted for examination, LabCorp was testing only eight different areas for DNA. The two other areas, which LabCorp had added by the time of trial, were not validated when the samples <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>related to appellant\u2019s case were undergoing analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The best answer to the majority\u2019s supposition that additional testing may create a different result can be found in the record of trial. During recross-examination of Ms. Clement, defense counsel asked \u201chow can it be said with any assurance that matches would not be found if the tests were carried out to their fullest extent?\u201d Ms. Clement answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">With DNA analysis if there is a difference at a single genetic system, in other words, if there is a characteristic which is not found in evidentiary materials, then that person is excluded immediately. Whether you test 1 system or whether you test 10 systems they will be excluded the minute you find one characteristic which is different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The remainder of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination focused on showing that the DNA may have been contaminated through sneezing or improper handling of the fingernails. Ms. Clement explained that \u201c[wjithin our laboratory there have been a couple instances of contamination which has been detected. Generally, the most common form of contamination is by the analyst [sic] themselves. And we have complete profiles on every technologist who works there.\u201d If additional DNA testing, as the majority wishes, found contamination by a technologist at LabCorp, it would provide no benefit to appellant unless appellant can somehow make a laboratory analyst in the Research Triangle of North Carolina a suspect in a murder that took place in Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">At the time she announced her findings on the Government\u2019s motion to admit LabCorp\u2019s DNA testing results, the military judge informed counsel that any defense request for further DNA testing would need to be submitted to the United States not later than close of business on April 29.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 29, government counsel received a FAX from the accused\u2019s civilian defense counsel requesting the retesting of \u201calleged DNA fingernail material\u201d by Forensic Science Associates in Richmond, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">At an Article 39(a) session on May 15, 1996, civilian defense counsel asked the military judge to allow substitution of Dr. Edward Blake for Dr. Conneally as the defense DNA expert. Counsel informed the military judge that Dr. Blake ran Forensic Science Associates, a DNA testing laboratory in California, and that he would retest the fingernail evidence. Defense counsel stated that Dr. Blake had labeled LabCorp as a \u201cpaternity testing lab\u201d without \u201cspecific experience in criminal forensic testing.\u201d In response to the military judge\u2019s question to civilian defense counsel as to whether Dr. Blake\u2019s California lab was certified, the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">CDC: I believe so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">MJ: Because it\u2019s not listed in the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-13\">CDC: \u2014I would have to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-14\">MJ: It is not listed in the offer nor is it listed in the qualifications for Doctor Barker [sic] nor \u2014 Mr. Barker [sic] nor or [sic] any qualification listed down for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-15\">CDC: He is the person who invented one of the DNA tests\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-16\">TC: I don\u2019t believe he invented DQ Alpha, ma\u2019am. The person who invented DQ Alpha got the Nobel Prize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-17\">MJ: Yeah, that\u2019s my recollection too, although it\u2019s certainly not in evidence. Because in the, I guess what passes to be a curriculum vitae for Doctor Barker [sic], he lists only two areas that that lab tests in whereas LabCorp tested, according to the exhibits submitted along with the government\u2019s response, that the testing was actually done like in eight different areas. So, how on earth can this lab retest what it doesn\u2019t have the capacity to retest? And there\u2019s no showing of any kind of controls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>that the requested lab employees, there\u2019s no showing of any testing, I guess that\u2019s done by peer review organizations on any sort of regular basis. In other words, I guess what I\u2019m asking for is even if this retesting were done, how would this \u2014 how would you set a foundation for this under <em>United, States versus Youngberg </em>or <em>Mer-rell Dow </em>case? Because that was the whole point of Megham Clement coming and testifying was to lay the foundation which is required to be laid for scientific testimony. That\u2019s not in the offer here, because I think what I\u2019m reading is the basis of your motion is you think the convening authority applied an incorrect standard in reviewing the request for independent testing. So, I guess my question is what do you think the standard is for testing DNA evidence? Because what I read is that there are some broad statements that you have to, you know, clip the nails in half and I don\u2019t recall Meghan Clement ever testifying about whether nails were clipped or not clipped. What I recall her saying is that the materials are still available for retesting. Does the government \u2014 do you know?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">(Emphasis added.) At that point defense counsel adopted the \u201cpossibility of contamination\u201d theory as a reason for needing Dr. Blake\u2019s expertise. After applying the law announced by this Court in <em>United States v. Gonzalez, United States v. Kelly, </em>and <em>United States v. Garries, </em>all <em>supra; </em>and <em>United States v. Mosley, </em>42 MJ 300 (1995), the military judge found that defense counsel had not met his burden of showing what Dr. Blake\u2019s laboratory would contribute to the defense case other than providing a mere possibility of something being discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Having failed to show the necessity for Dr. Blake\u2019s expert assistance, counsel then argued his alternative theory to contamination: a failure in the chain of custody that caused defendant\u2019s blood sample to be mislabeled as a reason for needing Dr. Blake\u2019s assistance. Finally, defense counsel argued \u201cfundamental fairness.\u201d In reply the military judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">MJ: I see your point but there still has to be some kind of showing of likelihood of error for it to arise to an issue of fundamental fairness. Remember <em>Mosley </em>was a $250.00 EME test that had never been performed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">MJ: So, that is a different situation. That would be like you coming in and saying, \u201cDoctor Blake only performed DNA for the government on two DNA areas, yet there is a lab called LabCorp that could test in eight different areas which would reduce the likelihood of an incorrect result.\u201d Then I might look at it differently if there are tests that would be available that could do more. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re asking for here. And this is not a <em>Mosley </em>type issue when you\u2019re talking about $250.00 EME test. This does not arise to an issue of fundamental fairness in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">Lastly, civilian defense counsel said: \u201cThe defense position really is that we would like to substitute Dr. Blake for Dr. Conneally \u2014 \u201d The military judge correctly noted that this substitution-of-experts issue was not before the court because the \u201cconvening authority, in good faith, relied upon the defense representation, looked at Dr. Conneally\u2019s qualifications ... [and] gave the defense what they wanted.\u201d This Court has never held that once a convening authority funds a necessary defense expert that those funds then come under the dominion and control of either defense counsel or the funded expert witness for use to hire different experts as they see fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">RCM 703(d) clearly states that it is the convening authority who \u201cauthorize^] the employment\u201d and \u201cfix[es] the compensation for the expert,\u201d not the defense counsel. The only remedy for refusal to provide judicially determined expert help is abatement of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">Accordingly, one must then look at the military judge\u2019s findings to see whether she abused her discretion by refusing to order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>substitution of Dr. Blake and his Richmond, California, laboratory for Dr. Conneally.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">When one sorts through the fog surrounding defense counsel\u2019s three written requests for substitution of DNA expert assistance, argument of counsel, and responses to questions in the record of trial, it is obvious that defense counsel wanted a retest of the victim\u2019s fingernails based on his theories that the chain of custody which got appellant\u2019s blood sample to LabCorp in North Carolina was faulty and that there was a possibility of contamination. Defense counsel failed to specifically allege or show that Dr. Conneally was incompetent to render the assistance for which he was hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">There is absolutely no allegation that Lab-Corp\u2019s findings were somehow improper unless they had received contaminated fingernails or tainted blood. Counsel was unable to identify any irregularity in the testing of the deceased\u2019s fingernails or even make an offer' of proof that would warrant hiring Dr. Blake and his laboratory. For example, counsel never argued how additional testing might point to another theory of the crime or cause of death. <em>Cf. Barnabei v. Angelone, </em>214 F.3d 463, 474 (4th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1300, 121 S.Ct. 24, 147 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2000). Accordingly, defense counsel did not demonstrate necessity for this second DNA expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The chain-of-custody issue and the potential mix-up of vials of blood, to include appellant\u2019s, was thoroughly litigated at trial. Defense counsel\u2019s piercing cross-examination failed to undermine the reliability of the handling and custody of either the victim\u2019s or appellant\u2019s vials of blood drawn in Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The issue of potential contamination was more than thoroughly explored by defense counsel during his cross-examination of those witnesses who conducted the autopsy, as well as his cross-examination of Ms. Clement. The defense theory was that the deceased\u2019s fingernails had become contaminated in some manner by those conducting the autopsy (such as sneezing on them) and as a result of that contamination, the DNA test was unreliable. Testimony revealed, however, that the victim\u2019s hands were wrapped before the autopsy and palms were facing down after being exposed. Therefore, there was much less opportunity for any contaminates (and none were ever shown to exist) to get under the nails. Further questioning showed the victim\u2019s fingernails were short anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Expert witnesses are not necessary for a knowledgeable defense counsel to adequately test a chain of custody or the possibility of sample contamination. Appellant\u2019s civilian defense counsel was well prepared and did a good job of contesting both areas. The court members obviously decided that neither was an impediment to finding Specialist McAllister guilty. As defense counsel failed to demonstrate why Dr. Blake was \u201cnecessary\u201d under this Court\u2019s <em>Gonzalez </em>test, the military judge did not err. The mere possibility of assistance from an expert does not rise to the level of necessity. <em>See Mosley, </em>42 MJ at 307 (Crawford, J., dissenting); <em>Moore v. Kemp, </em>809 F.2d 702, 712 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>481 U.S. 1054, 107 S.Ct. 2192, 95 L.Ed.2d 847 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">LEGAL AND FACTUAL SUFFICIENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">Defense counsel had two theories of the case: (1) PFC Shanklin died of natural causes (a seizure); and (2) somebody murdered her but it wasn\u2019t appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">Counsel\u2019s theory that PFC Shanklin died of natural causes was premised on the fact that the victim had passed out on one or two occasions in the Hawaiian heat while standing at attention during formations. The findings of the autopsy \u2014 that the victim died as a result of suffocation due to strangulation\u2014 certainly did not advance this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">Appellant\u2019s second theory, that someone other than him killed PFC Shanklin, can also be put to rest by the evidence. Contrary to the defense\u2019s assertion, the DNA evidence is not the only evidence that places appellant at the murder scene or shows that he had the opportunity to kill the victim. Appellant convicted himself without ever taking the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">Appellant\u2019s statements to his fellow soldiers; past physical altercations with the victim, which included periods of choking; his futile attempts to get Staff Sergeant Rogers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>to manufacture an alibi for him; his mysterious visit to Sergeant Grady with a box and a request for Grady to get rid of that box on the morning after the murder; as well as appellant\u2019s highly incriminating remark (\u201cWhy, is she dead?\u201d) when first told that \u201csomething happened to\u201d PFC Shanklin are legally sufficient for a rational factfinder to convict appellant of PFC\u2019s Shanklin\u2019s murder. <em>See Jackson v.

While I share the majority\u2019s concern with some of the minor factual discrepancies in the Court of Criminal Appeals decision, I do not find the factual-sufficiency determination by the court below to be defective.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\">. As an example, defense counsel asked whether those assisting the pathologist and collecting evidence were wearing gloves, medical clothing, masks, or hairnets; how many other people were in the room; whether the envelope into which the fingernails were dropped after clipping was sealed; and whether the CID agents who collected evidence at the autopsy wore medical accoutrement on their return trip to the office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\">. The technique called polymerase chain reaction was invented by Kary Mull\u00eds in 1985. It enables an examiner to \"find and amplify specific segments of DNA from complex mixtures.\u201d Griffiths et al., <em>Modem Genetic Analysis </em>21 (W.H. Freeman and Co., New York (1999)). \u201cPRC is very sensitive and can detect target sequences that are in extremely low copy number in a sample.\u201d Additionally, this technique requires no lengthy cloning procedures and \"no restriction digestion of the substrate DNA is needed ..., because the primers will hone in on the appropriate sequence of native DNA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\">. Defense counsel informed the judge that Dr. Conneally had not appeared at the April 23 Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 839(a), session due to his unavailability. Although there was some uncertainty whether Dr. Conneally would testify because his rates exceeded the amount allowed under the Joint Travel Regulation, the military judge announced that \"money\u2019s not going to be the determining factor on whether he comes. If he has got pertinent information, I can order that a subpoena be issued and he testify as a $35.00 a day witness if he's got matters relevant to a case that the United States is a party.

It does so on the basis that the judge abused her discretion in denying appellant\u2019s request for expert assistance from Doctor Blake and denying his request for a continuance and a retest of a DNA sample. The majority (55 MJ at 276) concludes that the judge acted \u201carbitrarily\u201d in denying these motions because she \u201cfocus[ed] on holding the defense\u2019s feet to the fire\u201d for \u201crequesting an expert who was either unable or unwilling to provide\u201d tools to challenge the Government\u2019s DNA evidence. <em>See generally United States v. Weisbeck, </em>50 MJ 461, 466 (1999). I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The premise of the majority opinion is flawed and, accordingly, I cannot join its conclusion. In my view, the military judge was \u201cfocused\u201d on the defense\u2019s burden to show its requests for government assistance were necessary for a fair trial as required by our case law. <em>See United States v. Kelly, </em>39 MJ 235 (CMA), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 931, 115 S.Ct. 324, 130 L.Ed.2d 284 (1994). The military judge stated in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">IWjhen the defense makes a request to the convening authority for an expert by name and the convening authority grants it, then the convening authority can rely that the defense has done its homework and has determined that this defense expert possesses the requisite qualifications at that time. It was stated that Doctor Conneally could provide assistance to the defense in this case and now you\u2019re telling me he\u2019s not even a forensic scientist. Well I guess he teaches DNA analysis, <em>it still appears to me that one who teaches DNA analysis could review the evidence in this case and give a helpful opinion, but there\u2019s still nothing in here showing why Doctor Blake is necessary in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">R. 483 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Previously, the judge denied a defense request for retesting appellant\u2019s blood sample, relying <em>on </em>cases <em>from our </em>Court which require a necessity approach to these requests as well. She ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">There\u2019s nothing that has been raised by the defense in this motion to show anything [more] than the mere possibility of something being discovered should there be retesting. In other words, what I\u2019m saying in a roundabout fashion, is that the standards that I must employ in \u2014 let me see, I\u2019ve got \u2014 I guess I should put the cases on the record, in <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>39 MJ 459; <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>39 MJ 235; <em>United States v. Garries, </em>22 MJ 288; <em>United States v. Mosley, </em>42 MJ 300, which applies the Supreme Court standards in expert assistance provided by the Government for the defense case. But those standards have not been met in this motion and the convening authority applied the right standards when he was reviewing under RCM 703.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-14\">She later said on this same request:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-15\">I\u2019ll make a finding here that Special Agent Forringer testified that he took custody of Specialist McAllister\u2019s vial of blood after watching it been [sic] draw [sic] and watching the vial. Special Agent Benavidez testified that he took custody of the Jones\u2019 vial; he saw it being labeled; and he [had] custody and control over that vial. The two vials were transported by different agents in different vehicles, stored in different locations. The chain of custody has already been litigated at the prior Article 39(a) session. Maybe all of the labeling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>was not 100% perfect but that\u2019s not what a chain of custody requires. <em>There is no showing of a likelihood or a true possibility of mix-up of those samples. </em>On the vial of Specialist McAllister, the chain of custody had the name McLasiter, that is where Mr. Overson called to verify the name of the individual to verify that the correct sample was about to be tested. And I find that he did verify the identity of the individual who had actually donated that particular sample. So, there is nothing to suggest to me that there is any real possibility of a mix-up of samples within the chain of custody procedures. So, that does not support a retest and neither does \u2014 at government expense, neither does the possibility of contamination in a lab just because of the difficulty in avoiding contamination in that setting when there is no real showing of a true possibility of contamination in that particular lab doing these particular tests. That does not say that the defense cannot, at its own expense, have a retest, provided it can be accomplished by the day of trial in this case. Or cannot cross-examine the witness on the inherent validity of DNA analysis because of the complexities of maintaining a contamination free environment. Those will be matters for the members to determine or to weigh in weighing the value of that evidence in their own minds. But I am denying the defense motion to compel the Government to pay for a retest and to grant a continuance until such time as that should be done. <em>There\u2019s just not a sufficient showing in this case to compel the Government to do it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">R. 446-47 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The Court of Criminal Appeals also affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">As to the second DNA expert request, we apply the same standard, that is, appellant must meet his burden of demonstrating the necessity for Dr. Blake\u2019s services. In approving the defense request for Dr. Conneally, the convening authority gave the defense more than they were entitled to receive, <em>i.e., </em>a specifically named expert consultant. Dr. Conneally\u2019s curriculum vitae established him as an eminently qualified expert with over thirty years experience in medical genetics culminating in his current position as the Distinguished Professor of Medical Genetics and Neurology, Indiana University School of Medicine. His appointment to the defense team gave the appellant more than \u201cthe \u2018basic tools\u2019 necessary to present his defense.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>39 MJ at 237 (citing <em>Ake, </em>470 U.S. at 77, 105 S.Ct. 1087). Appellant failed to advance any plausible reason why Dr. Con-neally could not provide the necessary expert assistance. <em>The request for Dr. Blake to be substituted for Dr Conneally was not based on any inability on Dr. Conneally\u2019s part to provide the necessary assistance. It was instead a thinly veiled attempt to get the re-test that had been denied by the military judge. </em>Indeed, as noted by the convening authority in his denial of the requested substitution, the request for Dr. Blake was identical in nineteen of twenty-one paragraphs to the request for the retest that had been denied. As <em>the defense failed to demonstrate any reasonable necessity, ' the military judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the defense request to substitute Dr. Blake for Dr. Con-neally.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">As to the defense request for a re-test of the DNA specimen, we again apply the <em>Garries </em>reasonable necessity standard, that is the defense \u201cmust demonstrate something more than a mere possibility of assistance\u201d from a re-test. <em>See Robinson, </em>39 MJ at 89. The defense request was based on (1) a possible mix-up of appellant\u2019s blood specimen with that of SSG Jones, and (2) possible contamination of the fingernail specimen either at the crime scene or at the laboratory. We find the possibility of a mix-up of the blood specimens to be so infinitesimal as to be nonexistent. The only \u201cdefect\u201d that appellant could point to was the slight misspelling of his name on the DA Form 4317. That \u201cdefect\u201d was adequately explained by SA Forringer and is so de minimis as to have absolutely no effect on the chain of custody. As to the possible contamination, the defense failed to produce even a scintilla of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>evidence of any contamination. The defense merely asked speculative questions of[,] <em>if </em>someone sneezed or coughed on the decedent\u2019s fingernails!,] <em>could </em>that have contaminated the specimen. That is a far cry from producing any evidence that any person <em>did </em>cough or sneeze on the decedent\u2019s fingernails. The defense\u2019s conelu-sional assertion, that there may have been contamination because DNA testing is by its nature sensitive, was unsupported by any evidence. In addition to failing to identify any defect in the chain of custody or any contamination of the sample, the defense failed to identify any laboratory error, any misconduct or negligence by any laboratory personnel, or any misinterpretation of the test results. Unlike the drug test in <em>United States v. Mosley, </em>42 MJ 300 (1995), the DNA retest in the instant case would not have been minimal in terms of time and resources. We find that the military judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the defense request for a re-test of the DNA specimen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Unpub. op. at 10-11 (first emphasis added; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">In sum, the majority\u2019s narrow view of the basis for the military judge\u2019s rulings in this case dictates the result it reaches on this appeal. <em>See United States v. Weisbeck, </em>50 MJ at 466. While I agree with the <em>Weisbeck </em>decision, I do not agree it is applicable in this case. Moreover, the evidence in this case is more than sufficient under the test of <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Accordingly, I dissent to the majority effectively reversing a jury conviction of murder on the slender reed which mistakes this case for the real injustice suffered in <em>Weisbeck. </em>There was no injustice in this trial and the conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
