In accordance with a pretrial agreement, the convening authority approved only so much of the sentence as provided for a bad-conduct discharge, twelve months of the adjudged sixteen months of confinement, and reduction to Private El.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The appellant assigned one error in this Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866, appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-4\">THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED TO THE SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE OF THE APPELLANT BY FAILING TO TIMELY DISCLOSE HIS FINANCIAL INTEREST AS A POLICYHOLDER IN USAA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> UNTIL AFTER FINDINGS WERE ENTERED WHERE USAA WAS A VICTIM OF TWO OF THE THREE CHARGED OFFENSES AND A MAJOR THRUST OF THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S SENTENCING CASE WAS THE IMPACT OF APPELLANT\u2019S ACTIONS ON THE MEMBERS/POLICYHOLDERS OF USAA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Finding no error prejudicial to the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, we resolve the assigned error against the appellant. UCMJ art. 59(a), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">While assigned in Germany, the appellant participated in an insurance fraud scheme with a local national. As the appellant admitted during the guilty plea inquiry and in a stipulation of fact, he conspired with an automobile body shop owner to vandalize the appellant\u2019s car for the purpose of making a false claim against his automobile insurer, USAA, so that he could pay to refinish his entire car. In furtherance of the conspiracy, they scratched a Nazi swastika, a Nazi \u201cSS,\u201d and an anti-American obscenity into the paint surface. After USAA discounted the amount claimed because of preexisting damage for which the company had previously paid a claim, they paid the appellant 2,700 German marks (approximately $1,400). Subsequently, the appellant agreed to help the body shop owner scratch automobiles owned by soldiers who lived in the appellant\u2019s housing area. Under the agreement, the appellant was to recommend the body shop to the victimized soldiers in exchange for the body shop owner completing the work on the appellant\u2019s car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">During the sentencing phase of the trial, the government elicited testimony from Mr. Mueller, a \u201cclaims handler\u201d for USAA, who testified that fraudulent claims increased company expenses and impaired its competitive advantage. Mr. Mueller further explained that USAA is a member-owned company, and fraudulent claims could lower members\u2019 dividends and increase rates. He testified that in the previous year, fraudulent claims cost the company about twenty-five million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">Immediately following Mr. Mueller\u2019s testimony, the military judge disclosed that he had been a USAA policyholder for about eighteen years and invited counsel to conduct voir dire on the issue. The military judge stated that he did not feel he was in any way a victim of the appellant\u2019s crimes, and he assured the parties that his \u201cstatus as a USAA policyholder [would] have no [a]ffect upon [his] determination of a fair and appropriate sentence or the findings\u201d he had previously entered. The defense counsel and trial counsel declined to challenge the military judge based on his status as a policyholder with USAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">In closing arguments on sentencing, the trial counsel suggested a sentence of a dishonorable discharge, confinement for three years, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. In support of the suggested sentence, the trial counsel concentrated his argument on the nature of the appellant\u2019s crimes, including the use of abhorrent symbols and the staged anti-American vandalism for personal gain, the appellant\u2019s premeditated greed, the damages to his fellow soldiers and the community, and the conspiratorial nature of his crimes. The trial counsel also asked the military judge to consider the impact of the appellant\u2019s crimes on the policy-holders of USAA by asserting that \u201cevery member\u2019s dividend was reduced in some small degree by this offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Rule for Courts-Martial 902(a) [hereinafter R.C.M.] provides that \u201ca military judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which that military judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Rule for Court Martial 902(b) enumerates specific grounds upon which a military judge shall self-disqualify, including when the military judge, or a member of his or her family, \u201c[i]s known by the military judge to have an interest, financial or otherwise, that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d Under R.C.M. 902(e), military judges are precluded from accepting a waiver of any ground for disqualification under subsection (b), but \u201c[w]here the ground for disqualification arises only under subsection (a) of this rule, waiver may be accepted provided it is preceded by a full disclosure on the record of the basis for disqualification.\u201d The discussion sections under R.C.M. 902 state that military judges should inform themselves about their financial interests and that the participants at trial should raise possible grounds for disqualification at the earliest reasonable opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">As admitted in his brief, the \u201c[a]ppellant does not argue that any trial judge who is a USAA policyholder is automatically disqualified [from a case such as this] solely because of this status.\u201d Instead, the appellant\u2019s assignment of error focuses on the military judge\u2019s failure to timely disclose his status as a USAA policyholder and his alleged failure to fully disclose his financial interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">As for the timing of the military judge\u2019s disclosure, we find nothing improper or erroneous by this military judge\u2019s failure to disclose his policyholder status until a potential ground for his disqualification unfolded with the government\u2019s presentation of Mr. Mueller\u2019s testimony. Until then, the impact of the appellant\u2019s crimes upon USAA members was not an apparent issue. We seriously doubt that most military judges would identify this as a potential issue based solely on the charges and the matters presented during the guilty plea inquiry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">In any event, we see no prejudice to the appellant in the military judge\u2019s timing of his disclosure. The military judge provided the opportunity to conduct voir dire, and the trial defense counsel exercised it. The military judge offered the appellant the opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>to challenge him for cause, but the appellant declined. We infer that the trial defense counsel\u2019s decision not to challenge the military judge reflected his satisfaction that the military judge\u2019s impartiality was not compromised by his policyholder status. <em>See United States v. Burton, </em>52 M.J. 223, 226 (2000); <em>see generally United States v. Hill, </em>45 M.J. 245, 249 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The remaining issues presented by this case are whether the military judge\u2019s policyholder status constituted a nonwaivable disqualification under R.C.M. 902(b)(5) because he had a financial interest that \u201ccould be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding\u201d; and, if not, whether the military judge abused his discretion by not disqualifying himself under R.C.M. 902(a) because his \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Although we find no military cases directly on point, the federal circuits provide instructive secondary authority, particularly because they apply the federal statute upon which R.C.M. 902 was based.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(1998 ed.), R.C.M. 902 analysis, app. 21, at A21-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">To the extent that the military judge enjoyed any financial interests in USAA, they were limited to his interests in minimizing his insurance rates and maximizing his dividends. Common sense dictates, however, that such indirect interests would not be substantially affected by the outcome of this criminal case. As this was a criminal trial conducted under the UCMJ, the military judge had no authority to enter a civil judgment against a party or to order restitution. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 201(a)(1) discussion. We perceive no way in which the outcome of this court-martial could directly impact the financial interests of USAA or its members. To the extent that the outcome of this trial might have some deterrent effect on others who may be inclined to defraud USAA, we conclude that such a connection to the military judge\u2019s financial interests is tenuous and remote. Certainly, the outcome of this trial would not <em>substantially </em>affect the military judge\u2019s financial interests, which is the standard for disqualification under R.C.M. 902(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">The federal courts have reached similar conclusions in criminal cases in which the judge\u2019s financial interests were far more substantial and direct. <em>See United States v. Aragon, </em>No. 99-50341, 2000 WL 868566, 2000 U.S.App. LEXIS 15423 (9th Cir. June 29, 2000) (unpub.) (the judge owned debentures in a bank defrauded of approximately $60,000 by the accused); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>119 F.3d 1377 (9th Cir.1997) (the judge owned stock in a bank defrauded of $70,000,000 by the accused); <em>United States v. Nobel, </em>696 F.2d 231 (3d Cir.1982) (the judge was a \u201csubstantial stockholder\u201d of an insurance company defrauded of approximately $476,000 by the accused).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">These federal cases held that the judges were not disqualified under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(4) because the defrauded institutions were not parties to the trials, the judges did not have financial interests \u201cin the subject matter in controversy,\u201d and the judges\u2019 interests were not interests which could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceedings. They also addressed whether the judges should have disqualified themselves under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) on the basis that their impartiality might reasonably have been questioned. On this issue, the circuits are not unanimous, although the weight of authority favors the conclusion that the judges did not abuse their discretion in not disqualifying themselves.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">The circuit courts cite several factors in reaching the conclusion that the judges\u2019 impartiality could not be reasonably questioned. First, the financial institutions are not parties to the trial. <em>U.S. v. Sellers, </em>566 F.2d 884, 887 (4th Cir.1977). Second, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>apparent reason why a judge\u2019s ownership the stock of a victim financial institution, by itself, would lead to a conclusion that a judge would be partial in a criminal trial. <em>Id. </em>Third, and most compelling, any financial interest the judge had in the victim financial institution was so remote or miniscule, in relationship to the financial size of the institution, as to be nonexistent. <em>United States v. Hooper, </em>No. 00-4188, 2000 WL 1208187, at *1, 2000 U.S.App. LEXIS 21630, at *2 (4th Cir. Aug. 25, 2000) (unpub.); <em>Aragon, </em>2000 WL 868566, at *1, 2000 U.S.App. LEXIS 15423, at *4; <em>Rogers, </em>119 F.3d at 1384; <em>Sellers, </em>566 F.2d at 887. <em>Of </em>course, whether the judge\u2019s interests are insubstantial and/or remote are factual questions affecting whether his or her impartiality reasonably may be questioned. of</p>\n<p id=\"b829-3\">We judicially note that the military judge in this case was one of 4.3 million members of USAA, a company with sixty billion dollars in assets.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The outcome of this case had no demonstrable or direct financial effect on USAA or its members. Whatever potential or consequential effect the case might have on their financial interests because of deterrence can be likened to a ripple in a great sea of financial currents. In the context of the circumstances of this case, we choose to follow the majority of the federal courts in concluding that the military judge\u2019s financial interests as a member of USAA were so remote and insubstantial as to be essentially nonexistent. We hold that his interests could not reasonably be affected by the outcome of the trial under R.C.M. 902(b)(5).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We decline to apply waiver by the appellant of the R.C.M. 902(a) basis for disqualification, but hold that there was no reasonable basis for questioning the military judge\u2019s impartiality under R.C.M. 902(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">We have considered the matters raised personally by the appellant under <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A. 1982), and find they do not warrant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Judge BROWN and Judge VOWELL concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">of</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-8\">. United Services Automobile Association [hereinafter USAA].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-9\">. Although the body shop owner pressured the appellant to join in this subsequent scheme to damage the appellant\u2019s neighbors\u2019 cars, the military judge properly ensured that the coercion did not amount to a defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b827-6\">. Likewise, we acknowledge and disclose that each of us assigned to this case is a policyholder of USAA, as are all the judges of our court. Rule for Courts Martial 902 governs our disqualifications in proceedings, just as it does for trial judges. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 902(c)(1) (\" 'Proceeding' includes pretrial, trial, post-trial, <em>appellate review, </em>and other stages of litigation.\u201d [emphasis added)); <em>see also 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) (explicitly governing \"[a]ny <em>justice, </em>judge, or magistrate\u201d (emphasis added)). Rule for Court Martial 902(a) was patterned after 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). We further acknowledge that, as a general matter, we have an interest in procuring adequate and responsive insurance coverage at reasonable rates. USAA's overall loss experience on automobile policies inevitably impacts future rate structures. Additionally, we disclose that USAA annually decides whether to return a portion of excess company reserves and paid automobile premiums to policyholders-and, if so, how much. First, each policyholder has a \"subscriber savings account,\u201d and USAA distributed 16%, 7%, and 3% of individual subscriber savings account holdings in 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. Second, each automobile policyholder with no \u201cat fault\u201d claims may receive an automobile insurance dividend. Dividend distributions were made at rates of 12%, 5%, and 0% of premiums in 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. Considering the number of policyholders and the amount of the insurance fraud in this case, the financial impact to us cannot be more than a very small fraction of a penny. Therefore, we conclude that we have no financial interest \u201cthat could be <em>substantially </em>affected by the outcome of the [appellant\u2019s] proceeding.\u201d R.C.M. 902(b)(5)(B) (emphasis added). We categorically state that our association with USAA has not and will not compromise our impartiality. Likewise, we are satisfied that the impact of the appellant\u2019s misconduct on the net cost of our insurance is so attenuated and miniscule that our impartiality could not reasonably be questioned by informed observers. R.C.M. 902(a). It occurred to us to make this disclosure after reading the record and briefs and reflecting on the unusual issues presented by this case. The appellate defense counsel, who may themselves be members of USAA, have neither asked if any member of our panel is a member of USAA nor requested us to recuse ourselves if we were. Our sua sponte disclosure reflects, we think, the reality of the military judge\u2019s thought process at the appellant\u2019s trial-that his status would have absolutely no impact on his ability to decide the case fairly and with complete impartiality; therefore, the issue of disclosure did not enter his mind until the testimony of Mr. Mueller brought the issue into focus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\">. Specifically, the provisions of R.C.M. 902(a) are substantively similar to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), and R.C.M. 902(b)(5) parallels 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b828-10\">. <em>But see Nobel, </em>696 F.2d at 235-36 (\"We adopt the view that a judge who owns a <em>substantial </em>interest in the victim of a crime must disqualify himself or herself in the subsequent criminal proceeding because the strict overarching standard imposed by section 455(a) requires that the appearance of impartiality be maintained.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b829-4\">. <em>See </em>https://www.usaa.com/cp \u2014 aboutusaa.asp.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b829-5\">. In his brief, the appellant asserts that the military judge did not make full disclosure of his financial interest in USAA, and as a result of his failure \"there is no way for this Court to determine if the trial judge had sufficient financial or other interest requiring disqualification.\u201d While we agree that the military judge did not disclose the dividend distributions described above, we find this oversight insignificant and disagree that it affected the court\u2019s ability to analyze the mili-taiy judge\u2019s potential disqualification under R.C.M. 902.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b829-12\">. By declining to challenge the military judge for cause after his disclosure of his policyholder status, the trial defense counsel may have waived the issue of the military judge\u2019s disqualification under R.C.M. 902(a). However, we are reluctant to apply waiver without addressing the underlying substantive challenge to the military judge\u2019s impartiality.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
