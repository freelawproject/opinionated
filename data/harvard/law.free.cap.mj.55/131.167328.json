Appellant was acquitted of raping J, a female less than 16 years of age. While reducing the forfeitures, the convening authority approved the sentence of a dishonorable discharge, 7 years\u2019 confinement, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence. 52 MJ 601 (1999). We granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-14\">I.

STATEMENT OF THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">Appellant is a 38-year-old, divorced Master Sergeant with almost 19)6 years of active service. At the time of the offense, he was assigned to Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE) in Belgium. He became a friend of Army Specialist S, who was also assigned to Forces command at SHAPE. Eventually, they began seeing each other and developed an intimate relationship. Specialist S had a 10-year-old daughter, A. Appellant, Specialist S, and A frequently did things together. On one occasion in September or October 1995, Specialist S and A spent the night at appellant\u2019s resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>dence. A slept in the bedroom where appellant\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage slept when she came to visit him. Sometime during the night, appellant went into the bedroom in which A was sleeping. He placed his hands under her shirt and fondled her breasts. He took her hands and placed them on his penis and moved them up and down. Several months later, A told her mother what appellant had done. Specialist S reported the assault to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">While the OSI was investigating the sexual assault upon A, it received information that appellant may have assaulted a babysitter, J, nearly 10 years earlier, during the time he lived in Midwest City, Oklahoma. J stated that she had a sexual relationship with appellant, consisting of heavy petting and oral sex. She also claimed that appellant placed her hand on his penis and masturbated him. When informed by the OSI that these indecent acts could not be prosecuted because of the statute of limitations, J stated that appellant also engaged in sexual intercourse with her sometime between February 1 and April 30, 1988. She was 15 at the time. As a result, appellant was charged with raping J.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">At trial, the prosecution also called Army Specialist C. Specialist C was one of appellant\u2019s neighbors in Midwest City. She testified that appellant sexually assaulted her on two occasions. Once while he was working in his garage, he pulled his penis out of his shorts and put her hand on it and made her masturbate him. On another occasion, she went to appellant\u2019s home to borrow a cup of sugar. He took her into the bathroom and made her masturbate him, and rubbed her vagina with his hands. These incidents were also barred from prosecution by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">A. WHETHER APPELLANT WAS DENIED EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL GUARANTEED BY THE 6TH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">To establish a claim of ineffectiveness, \u201cthe defendant must show that counsel\u2019s perfor-manee was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>see also Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 390, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). In satisfying this burden, the \u201cdefendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Appellant must establish that the acts identified by him \u201cwere outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Burger v. Kemp, </em>483 U.S. 776, 795, 107 S.Ct. 3114, 97 L.Ed.2d 638 (1987), quoting <em>Strickland, supra </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. That is, counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonable \u201cunder prevailing professional norms ... considering all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Strickland, supra </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">\u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201c[Cjounsel is strongly presumed\u201d to have given \u201cadequate assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The <em>Strickland </em>Court warned: \u201cIt is all too tempting ... to second-guess\u201d a lawyer\u2019s performance, and appellate courts should try to \u201celiminate the distorting effects of hindsight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Acts or omissions that fall within a broad range of reasonable approaches do not constitute a deficiency. The Court in <em>Strickland </em>held that \u201cstrategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">The defendant must also demonstrate that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. The prejudice prong \u201crequires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">In his first asserted issue, appellant claims that defense counsel failed to attack the credibility of the government witnesses. Appellant suggests that his counsel did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>vigorously attack the victim, A, regarding a story she previously made up about a kidnapping, nor did defense counsel press A on a false statement to a friend that appellant threatened to kill her. To the contrary, the record of trial shows that defense counsel did question A about these items, and her responses showed that she was impressionable, and that maybe some of her stories were at least partially fabricated. Further claims by appellant as to the advanced sexual knowledge or curiosity on the part of A are unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Appellant also claims that A\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony could have been contradicted. However, the only person that was in a position to challenge the mother\u2019s statement that she and appellant had only been intimate on one occasion was appellant himself. Neither at trial nor during the clemency process did he contradict A\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">As for Specialist C\u2019s testimony, defense counsel argued that her statements were inconsistent and amounted to uncharged, prejudicial misconduct. The military judge disagreed and allowed Specialist C to testify, but limited her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The court below ordered defense counsel to submit affidavits answering a few questions, including why there was not a more rigorous cross-examination of A. Civilian defense counsel (CDC) responded that he was concerned that a clumsy or vicious cross-examination of A would be devastating to his client, based on her videotaped deposition, as well as CDC\u2019s many years in criminal defense work.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">As to all of the Government\u2019s witnesses, including A, CDC\u2019s affidavit explains that despite the defense\u2019s investigation, no evidence surfaced that would create even an inference that the witnesses were lying or had any motivation to lie. The record clearly shows that the defense acted to minimize damaging testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Appellant further contends that his defense counsel did not do enough to limit the spillover effects of the rape testimony of J. However, the spillover instruction given by the military judge was adequate and, presumably, was followed by the members. <em>See United States v. Holt, </em>33 MJ 400, 408 (CMA 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Appellant also claims that defense counsel did not inform the members about the precise consequences of a punitive discharge. Yet the record establishes that defense counsel informed the members a punitive discharge would \u201cdeprive him of everything that he has worked for and everything that he has contributed; everything that he is or thought he was.\u201d Based on the nature of appellant\u2019s felony conviction, the evidence presented during sentencing, the military judge\u2019s instructions, and argument of counsel, we are convinced that the officer members had sufficient information to understand the ramifications associated with awarding appellant a punitive discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">Appellant argues that defense counsel failed to present a case on his behalf during findings by not allowing him to testify and by refusing to put forth a \u201cgood soldier\u201d defense. Appellant avers that he discussed the matter of testifying with his attorney, and that they planned to make the final decision after seeing how the case progressed. However, according to appellant, his attorney rested the defense case immediately after the Government rested without further discussion with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Defense counsel stated in his affidavit that his client was fully informed of his right to testify and chose to accept his counsel\u2019s strong recommendation that he should not take the stand. This was reiterated in military defense counsel\u2019s (MDC) affidavit. MDC stated that appellant was advised he had the final decision on testifying, and he agreed that he would not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">Appellant argues that his counsel failed to present a \u201cgood soldier\u201d defense during the case-in-chief. Appellant had over 19 years of active service and worked at SHAPE Headquarters. Upon motion, he presented affidavits to the court below from Colonel Clark P. Wigley, Lieutenant Colonel Leonard F. Benson, and Master Sergeant (Ret) George L. Davis. All three of the affiants worked with appellant at SHAPE, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>and all three vouched for his competence, professionalism, and integrity. Both officers indicated that they would have gladly testified for appellant at his trial. However, CDC did not believe that a \u201cgood soldier\u201d defense would be very persuasive in this type of case. CDC was also concerned that character witnesses would open the door for uncharged misconduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defense counsel had the benefit and knowledge of the pretrial investigation, including OSI reports, medical reports, and other discoverable material. He stated that appellant understood his analysis and accepted it. Deciding to forgo live witnesses in order to avoid potentially damaging evidence being brought in under cross-examination does not amount to incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We need not order a hearing pursuant to <em>United States v. Ginn, </em>47 MJ 236, 248 (1997), since these matters may be resolved based on the \u201cappellate filings and the record.\u201d 47 MJ at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">All parties agree that appellant\u2019s counsel advised him against testifying. CDC states that appellant wanted to testify, and that it was only after a heated discussion that appellant agreed to remain silent. He states that when the prosecution rested, he leaned over to appellant and appellant \u201conce again, confirmed that he would be taking our advice and that he would be remaining silent.\u201d MDC states that after the Government rested its case, the defense \u201ctook a moment to concur one last time that we were not putting on any further evidence.\u201d Appellant asserts that CDC stood up immediately after the Government rested and announced that the defense also rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The record does not indicate whether a brief pause and conference took place among appellant and his two counsel before the defense rested. The record does reflect, however, that there was a 2-hour break after both sides rested, followed by a session under Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 839(a), on instructions, during which there was ample opportunity for appellant to express his desire to testify. While appellant may have continued to entertain the idea of testifying in spite of his counsel\u2019s advice, there is no indication that he told his counsel he rejected their advice. Appellant made no complaint about his defense counsel in his post-trial submission to the convening authority; Appellant\u2019s failure to speak up at or after trial belies his assertion that his desire to testify was improperly cut off by his counsel. We conclude that \u201cthe appellate filings and the record as a whole \u2018compellingly demonstrate\u2019 the improbability\u201d of appellant\u2019s assertions. <em>See Ginn, </em>47 MJ at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">As to the abridgement of appellant\u2019s right to testify, we agree with the court below. \u201c[T]his barebones assertion by a defendant, albeit made under oath, is insufficient to require a hearing____ Some greater particularity is necessary \u2014 and also we think some substantiation is necessary, <em>such as an affidavit from the lawyer who allegedly forbade his client to testify </em>\u2014 to give the claim sufficient credibility to warrant a further investment of judicial resources in determining the truth of the claim.... \u201d 52 MJ at 614, quoting <em>Underwood v. Clark, </em>939 F.2d 473, 475-76 (7th Cir.1991); <em>see also United States v. Boyd, </em>86 F.3d 719, 722-23 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">Appellant claims similar error during the sentencing portion of the trial. Yet, CDC indicated that he discussed the sentencing strategy with appellant, and this seems probable from the record, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-16\">CIV DC: Yes, Your Honor, we have discussed [with] Master Sergeant Dewrell his rights to present evidence and to make a sworn or unsworn statement through counsel. And, in doing so, we have reviewed the Defense Exhibits that we have marked as Defense Exhibit D for identification, which we will be offering to the military judge. We have explained that the prosecution, of course, will be offering the enlisted personnel records of the accused, reflecting his entire service career. And, we have determined that for tactical reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>we will not be presenting any other evidence beyond that, to include the accused exercising his right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">We hold that CDC\u2019s and MDC\u2019s tactics were well within their discretion. \u201cWe do not look at the success of a criminal defense attorney\u2019s trial theory, but rather whether counsel made an objectively reasonable choice in strategy from the alternatives available at the time.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>48 MJ 700, 718 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.1998), citing <em>United States v. Ingham, </em>42 MJ 218 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Appellant has not met his burden of showing error on the part of defense counsel. As the first prong of <em>Strickland </em>was not met, we hold that the court below correctly determined that appellant was not denied effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. We also hold that it did so in compliance with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ginn.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">B. WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ABUSED HIS DISCRETION BY REFUSING TO ALLOW ANY DEFENSE <em>VOIR DIRE </em>QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE MEMBERS\u2019 PRIOR INVOLVEMENT IN ANY CHILD ABUSE CASES AND POSSIBLE PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS REGARDING USE OF FORCE AND FABRICATION WHEN ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT INVOLVE TEEN AND PRETEEN AGE GIRLS</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The standard of review on this issue is an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Belflower, </em>50 MJ 306, 309 (1999); <em>United States v. Jefferson, </em>44 MJ 312, 317 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The military judge in this case did not allow either counsel to conduct group <em>voir dire. </em>Appellant argues that the military judge abused his discretion by refusing to allow any defense <em>voir dire </em>questions concerning the members\u2019 prior involvement in any child abuse cases and possible preconceived notions regarding use of force and fabrication when allegations of sexual misconduct involve teen and preteen age girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Prior to trial, the military judge sent a letter to counsel advising them to submit <em>voir dire </em>questions to him at least 7 days prior to trial since he would question the members. While both the defense and the Government submitted questions pursuant to the military judge\u2019s instructions, both sides stated their objection to this procedure and their desire to question the members personally. However, the military judge denied both requests. Neither the UCMJ nor the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.), gives the defense the right to individually question the members. <em>Jefferson, supra </em>at 317-19; RCM 912(d), Manual, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\"><em>\u25a0 </em>After the military judge questioned the members, defense counsel specifically asked the military judge to ask them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">4. Is there any member of the panel who has a close friend, neighbor or relative, (to include spouse), who works in the field of law enforcement, teaching, medicine, psychology, psychiatry, or social work services?;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-15\">8. Is there any member of the panel who believes that teenage girls, solely because of their age, are not mentally capable of manifesting lack of consent to sexual advances?;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-16\">9. Is there any member of the panel who believes that teenage girls, because of their age, believe that they are required to acquiesce to sexual advances of an adult because that person is an adult?; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-17\">10. Is there any member of the panel who believes that preteen age girls would not fabricate allegations of sexual misconduct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-18\">Trial defense counsel stated that question four was designed to determine \u201cwhether or not any member of the panel is close enough with someone who would be necessarily involved in child abuse cases and who might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>have knowledge that would come to bear during the course of the discussions in the jury room,\u201d thereby affecting his/her deliberation in the case. Defense counsel stated he would use this information to \u201cintelligently exercise our peremptory challenge.\u201d Defense counsel commented that the purpose of questions eight and nine was to determine whether any member believed that a teenager is not capable of manifesting a lack of consent to sexual approaches. He noted that in some cases, court members believed this. Defense counsel urged the military judge to ask question ten because \u201cthere are many jury members out there who believe that a pre-teenage girl would never fabricate an allegation of sexual misconduct.\u201d The military judge did not address defense counsel\u2019s concern but simply stated, \u201cI believe I have adequately covered these areas in my questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The military judge\u2019s questions properly tested for a fair and impartial panel and allowed counsel to intelligently exercise challenges. He asked about members\u2019 family and close friends; he asked whether any member served as a \u201cfamily advocacy team member or who works on some type of committee such as that\u201d; he asked whether \u201canyone on the panel ... believes that any particular person, whether they are an adult or a minor, simply because of their status, would automatically be telling the truth or not telling the truth\u201d; and he asked whether any member had any experience in legal or law enforcement matters. We hold that the questions asked by the military judge were clearly adequate to cover the statutory qualification of the members. Thus, there was no abuse of discretion by the military judge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ao-dedup-0\">C. WHETHER THE AIR FORCE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED TO THE SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT IN UPHOLDING THE MILITARY JUDGE\u2019S ERRONEOUS ADMISSION OF UNCHARGED OTHER SEXUAL MISCONDUCT UNDER MIL.R.EVID. 404(b), 413, AND 414.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Lastly, appellant contends that the court below erred in upholding the military judge\u2019s admission of uncharged other sexual misconduct under Mil.R.Evid. 404(b), 413, and 414, Manual, supra,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review the military judge\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Acton, </em>38 MJ 330, 332 (CMA 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">At the beginning of the trial, defense counsel made a motion in limine to preclude the testimony of Specialist C as impermissible under Mil.R.Evid. 404(b). Although appellant was not charged with any offenses relating to Specialist C, the prosecution wanted her to testify that appellant had her masturbate him on a couple of occasions between 1987 and 1989 when she was between 10 and 12 years of age. The military judge ruled that the portion of her testimony relating to the masturbation was admissible. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">I find that the acts of having young girls, between the ages of 10 and 15 \u2014 grabbing their hands, putting their hands on his penis, and masturbating him \u2014 that evidence is of such similar nature that I believe it is admissible under both 404(b) and Military Rule of Evidence 414. Now, in my balancing test under Military Rule of Evidence 403,1 decided that the full scope of the testimony of Specialist [C] will not be admitted. In other words, the statements concerning trapping her in the bathroom and the other acts don\u2019t go to the acts that we are talking about, especially with regard to [A]. Again, part of my reasoning here is that the prejudicial effect of that type of evidence would outweigh the probative value \u2014 substantially outweigh the probative value. However, on the masturbating, I think that is very probative and by limiting it I don\u2019t think the prejudicial effect substantially outweighs the probative value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">Although the military judge\u2019s determination in this case was made prior to our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>decision in <em>United States v. Wright, </em>53 MJ 476 (2000), we note that the list of factors in <em>Wright </em>is neither exclusive nor exhaustive. The military judge\u2019s careful and reasoned analysis on the record satisfied the constitutional requirement that evidence offered under- Rule 413 be subjected to a thorough balancing test pursuant to Mil.R.Evid. 403. <em>United States v. Enjady, </em>134 F.3d 1427, 1433 (10th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Guardia, </em>135 F.3d 1326, 1331 (10th Cir.l998)(AIthough the trial court is not required to make detailed findings of fact under Rule 403, it is important that the court \u201cfully evaluate the proffered Rule 413 evidence and make a clear record of the reasoning behind its findings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Following our decision in <em>Wright, </em>we hold that the military judge properly admitted the contested testimony. The threshold findings were met under Rule 413(a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, the evidence was found to be relevant to the immediate charges under Mil.R.Evid. 401 and 402, and the military judge clearly found that the probative value of specific portions of the testimony outweighed any prejudicial effect, as required under Mil.R.Evid. 403. We review a military judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. However, when the judge does not articulate the balancing analysis on the record, we give the evidentiary ruling less deference than we do where, as in this case, the balancing analysis is fully articulated on the record. <em>United States v. Manns, </em>54 MJ 164, 166 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Additionally, the military judge instructed the members as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">Each offense must stand on its own and you must keep the evidence of each offense separate. The burden is on the prosecution to prove each and every element of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt. As a general rule, proof of one offense carries with it no inference that the accused is guilty of any other offense. However, <em>you may consider any similarities in the testimony of Ms. [P, A,] a,nd Specialist [C] concerning masturbation with regard to the Specification of Charge II </em>[rape].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">(Emphasis added.) As the members acquitted appellant of the rape charge, this Court finds no reason to doubt that the members followed the instructions given them.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">III. DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\">. <em>Right to Counsel: En Banc Eleventh Circuit Denies Habeas to Federal Prisoner Sentenced to Death, </em>67 BNA CRIM.

Wright, </em>53 MJ 476, 480 n. 4 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\">. As Rules 413 and 414 are essentially the same in substance, the analysis for proper admission of evidence under either should be the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
