In September 2016, the General Assembly amended the drug-possession statute, R.C. 2925.11, to generally grant immunity to a \"qualified individual\" who otherwise could be charged with a misdemeanor- or fifth-degree felony drug-possession offense. For immunity to attach, the individual must satisfy the statutory requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On January 25, 2017, appellee filed a motion to dismiss the indictment and\n   alleged that he is a qualified individual who is immune from prosecution under R.C. 2925.11(B)(2). In particular, appellee asserted that on (1) March 15, 2016, he required medical assistance due to a drug overdose; (2) law enforcement officers obtained cocaine from his person as a result of appellee receiving that medical assistance; (3) after emergency personnel revived him with Narcan, appellee consented to a search of his person; (4) during the search, law enforcement officers discovered a bag that contained a white powdery substance that later testing revealed to be cocaine; and (5) within thirty days of needing medical assistance for his drug-overdose, he sought and obtained a screening and received a treatment-referral. Appellee alleged that on March 29, 2016, he entered a drug-treatment program through Pike County Recovery Council (PCRC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellee thus contended that he fulfilled the R.C. 2925.11(B)(2) requirements: (1) law enforcement officers obtained cocaine as a result of appellee experiencing an overdose and needing medical assistance; and (2) within thirty days of receiving medical assistance for his overdose, he sought and obtained a screening and received a treatment-referral. Appellee asserted that he is, therefore, immune under R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In support of his motion, appellee attached a document from SelfRefind that states that on August 29, 2016, appellee entered a drug-addiction treatment program and that he continues to participate in the program. Appellee also included a document from PCRC that lists appellee's dates of service. Appellee's first date of service was December 15, 2015, but the document reflects no other services provided to appellee until March 29, 2016. The document contains codes for the activities and procedures provided to appellee, but it does not reveal what the codes mean.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On March 1, 2017, the trial court held a hearing to consider appellee's motion to dismiss. At the hearing, the parties stipulated that on December 15, 2015, appellee received an assessment from PCRC, and that when he returned on March 29, 2016, he received treatment. The parties further stipulated that in August 2016, appellee obtained an assessment through SelfRefind and he has been in treatment since that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trial court asked the parties whether R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) applies when an individual overdoses before the effective date of the statute, as appellee did. The prosecutor responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   i. I think that it does in this particular case because when you look at (B)(2)(b) of 2925.11, it says that a qualified individual shall not be arrested, charged, prosecuted, or convicted or penalized. So I think at least those last two or the last three sections apply to him being convicted or penalized, even though the act itself had occurred prior to the effective date of the [statute].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The prosecutor asserted, however, that appellee did not satisfy the conditions listed in the statute to be entitled to immunity. The prosecutor agreed that appellee met the first condition, i.e., that the cocaine was obtained as a result of receiving medical assistance. However, the prosecutor did not agree that appellee met the second condition, i.e., that he sought and obtained a screening and received a treatment-referral within thirty days of receiving medical assistance. The prosecutor asserted that appellee received \"an assessment\" three months before his overdose and then \"appeared for treatment\" two weeks after his overdose. The prosecutor contended that receiving an assessment three months\n   before an overdose and entering a treatment program within thirty days after the overdose does not satisfy the second condition listed in the statute. The prosecutor asserted that the statute instead requires the individual to receive an assessment within thirty days after seeking or obtaining medical assistance, and that the statute does not include conduct that occurred before the individual seeks or obtains medical assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellee argued that he \"went above and beyond what was required of him by the statute.\" He has undergone treatment, and he has followed-up with that treatment. Appellee recognized that PCRC completed an assessment three months before his overdose. He further asserted, however, that two weeks after his overdose, he returned to PCRC, \"sign[ed] up, [obtained] a treatment plan and [went] to treatment.\" Appellee contended that he \"clearly had some type of plan formed once he re-establishe[d his] relationship\" with PCRC. Appellee alleged that his re-entry three months after his initial assessment sufficiently illustrates that PCRC screened him and that his subsequent treatment shows that PCRC referred him for treatment. Appellee also claimed that even though he completed an assessment three months before his overdose, he returned to PCRC within thirty days of his overdose and that his return to treatment shows that he sought and obtained a screening and received a treatment-referral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court noted that the statute does not define the type of screening or assessment an individual must undergo. The court believed, however, that an individual \"receives an assessment every time he goes for counseling, because they assess where he is in his addiction and they assess what they need to do at that hearing or at that meeting, and what's going to happen to him down the road.\" The court further believed that it would be \"absurd\" to read the statute so as to give immunity to an individual who seeks and obtains a screening and treatment-referral and who does not actually engage in a treatment program, but to deny immunity to an individual who obtained a screening and treatment-referral before the overdose that resulted in medical assistance and then actually engages in treatment after the overdose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court thus granted appellee's motion to dismiss the indictment. The court noted that, even though appellee did not undergo an evaluation within thirty days, he had received one earlier. The court further found \"that as part of ongoing treatment being received an assessment would be completed within the specified time.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant's three assignments of error all challenge the trial court's decision to grant appellee's motion to dismiss the indictment.

Accordingly, an appellate court does not defer to a trial court's decision, but instead independently\n   determines whether the trial court's decision is legally correct.\n   <em>\n    Wheatley\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In its first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by granting appellee's motion to dismiss the indictment. Specifically, appellant contends that the trial court erred by determining that R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) applies retroactively so as to render appellee immune from prosecution for a minor drug-possession offense. Appellant claims that the General Assembly did not expressly indicate that the statute applies retroactively, and thus, the statute applies prospectively only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellee points out, however, that during the trial court proceedings, appellant expressly agreed that R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) applies retroactively. Appellee thus contends that appellant forfeited the right to argue that R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) applies prospectively only, or alternatively, that appellant invited any error that the trial court may have committed by applying the statute to appellee's situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 15} We agree with appellee that appellant invited any error that the trial court may have committed by applying R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b). Our review of the record reveals that during the hearing, the court specifically questioned the parties whether the statute applied to appellee, who had overdosed and entered treatment before the effective date of the statute. Appellant asserted that the statute indeed applies to appellee and did not give any indication that it believed the statute could apply prospectively only. Under these circumstances, we believe that appellant invited any error that may have occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Kline v.

The invited-error doctrine is not, however, rendered inapplicable when a party claims plain error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   i. While invocation of the plain error doctrine is often justified in order to promote public confidence in the judicial process, \"[it is doubtful that] the public's confidence in the jury system is undermined by requiring parties to live with the results of errors that they invited, even if the errors go to 'crucial matters.' In fact, the idea that parties must bear the cost of their own mistakes at trial is a central presupposition of our adversarial system of justice.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Goldfuss v.

For ease of discussion, we consider the two assignments of error together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In its second assignment of error, appellant contends that appellee did not present any evidence that he obtained a screening and received a treatment-referral within thirty days of receiving medical attention for his overdose. Instead, appellant asserts that the evidence shows that appellee received a screening and treatment-referral more than three months before his overdose. Appellant thus claims that appellee's pre-overdose screening and treatment-referral do not satisfy the plain language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellant recognizes that appellee entered treatment within thirty days of his overdose. Appellant further charges, however, that obtaining treatment within thirty days of the overdose without also presenting evidence that the individual received a screening and treatment-referral within that same time period does not satisfy the plain language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellee asserts that the documents he presented permitted the trial court to \"reasonably infer[ ]\" that appellant received a screening and treatment-referral. Appellee further contends that the trial court interpreted the \"screening\" requirement so as to avoid an \"absurd\" result: an individual who actually engages in treatment following an overdose would not be entitled to immunity under R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b), but an individual who seeks and obtains a screening and treatment-referral without engaging in treatment would be entitled to immunity. Appellee argues that the trial court had \"discretion to interpret the 'screening' and 'referral for treatment' condition broadly so that evidence of a more onerous task-actual participation in treatment-satisfied it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In its third assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by concluding that appellee satisfied R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b)(iii). Appellant asserts that appellee did not present documentation to verify that he obtained a screening or treatment-referral within thirty days of his overdose. Instead, appellant argues, appellee submitted a document that shows he obtained a treatment-referral three months before his overdose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellee contends that appellant's failure to request that he produce written documentation to show that he sought and obtained a screening and received a treatment-referral means that the trial court could make reasonable inferences from the evidence appellee presented with his motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 24} After appellee's indictment, the General Assembly amended R.C. 2925.11. The amendment added R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b), which grants immunity to \"a qualified individual.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(f) (describing R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) as granting immunity). More specifically, the statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 25} [A] qualified individual shall not be arrested, charged, prosecuted, convicted, or penalized pursuant to this chapter for a minor drug possession offense if all of the following apply:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (I) The evidence of the obtaining, possession, or use of the controlled substance or controlled substance analog that would be the basis of the offense was obtained as a result of the qualified individual seeking the medical assistance or experiencing an overdose\n   and needing medical assistance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   ii.

(iii) Subject to division (B)(2)(g) of this section, the qualified individual who obtains a screening and receives a referral for treatment under division (B)(2)(b)(ii) of this section, upon the request of any prosecuting attorney, submits documentation to the prosecuting attorney that verifies that the qualified individual satisfied the requirements of that division. The documentation shall be limited to the date and time of the screening obtained and referral received.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 26} A \" '[q]ualified individual' means a person who is not on community control or post-release control and is * * * a person who experiences a drug overdose and who seeks medical assistance for that overdose.\" R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(a)(viii).

The term \"screen\" includes \"a system for examining and separating into different groups.\" https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/screens. Reading these definitions together suggests that \"screening,\" as used in R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b)(ii), could mean the act or process of examining and separating into different groups. We do not believe, however, that this definition fully explains the meaning of \"screening\" as used in R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b)(ii). Instead, we believe that the word \"screening,\" in addition to the phrase \"referral to treatment,\" is a term of art commonly used in the field of substance abuse treatment services.

The screening process does not exactly identify what kind of problem a person might have or how serious it might be; screening simply determines whether a problem exists or whether further assessment is needed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Systems-Level Implementation of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment, Technical Assistance Publication (TAP) Series 33, HHS Publication No. (SMA) 13-4741, Rockville, MD: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (2013), 8 (\"TAP 33\"), available at https://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//SMA13-4741/TAP33.pdf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 35} While screening aims to identify individuals with possible substance abuse issues,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [t]he primary goals of referral to treatment (RT) are to identify an appropriate treatment program and to facilitate engagement of the patient in treatment. RT can be a complex process involving coordination across different types of services. It requires a proactive and collaborative effort between SBIRT [Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment] providers and those providing specialty treatment to ensure\n   that a patient, once referred, has access to and engages in the appropriate level of care. To facilitate patient engagement, SBIRT providers may use motivational enhancement techniques to help patients with any ambivalence toward treatment, provide transportation to intake appointments, follow up with patients after an appointment, and maintain contact with the specialty treatment provider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 36} In the case at bar, the parties also appear to have used the term \"assessment\" synonymously with \"screening.\" \"Assessment\" generally means\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [a] process for defining the nature of a problem and developing specific treatment recommendations for addressing the problem. A basic assessment consists of gathering key information and engaging in a process with the client that enables the counselor to understand the client's readiness for change, problem areas, any diagnosis(es), disabilities, and strengths. The assessment process typically requires trained professionals to administer and interpret results, based on their experience and training.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Center for Substance Abuse Treatment.

Screening is a process for evaluating the possible presence of a particular problem. The outcome is normally a simple yes or no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   ii. Assessment is a process for defining the nature of that problem, determining a diagnosis, and developing specific treatment recommendations for addressing the problem or diagnosis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   of Women, Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) Series, No. 51 Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (2009), 58 (\"TIP 51\"), available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83252/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK83252.pdf/.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Furthermore, \"[s]creening and assessment are not single events but continuous processes that can be repeated by a variety of professionals in a variety of settings.\" TIP 44 at 14. Thus, \"[s]creening can be repeated at intervals, as needed.\" TAP 33 at 10. Likewise, \"[a]ssessment should be a fluid process throughout treatment. It is not a once-and-done event. Considering the complexity of withdrawal and the potential influence of alcohol and drugs on physical and psychological functioning, it is very important to reevaluate as the client engages into recovery.\" TIP 51 at 75. \"Another key reason for conducting multiple screenings and assessments over time is that previous information obtained may become outdated and may not include recent events that are relevant to treatment, such as relapse episodes, undetected mental disorders, or domestic violence.\" TIP 44 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 39} After considering the foregoing definitions, we believe that the term \"screening\" as used in R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) means the \"process of identifying patients with possible substance misuse or abuse problems and determining the appropriate course of future action for these individuals.\" The phrase \"referral to treatment\" means the process that identifies an appropriate treatment\n   program and facilitates patient engagement. Therefore, we believe that the plain language of the statute requires a qualified individual to seek and undergo, within thirty days of seeking medical assistance for a drug overdose, a \"process\" to identify possible substance misuse or abuse problems and to determine the appropriate course of future action. In addition, the individual must receive a treatment-referral, which involves identifying an appropriate treatment program and facilitating patient engagement. Although the parties appear to use the terms \"screening\" and \"assessment\" interchangeably, we point out that the published literature indicates that the terms are not synonymous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Having defined the terms used in R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b)(ii), we now can determine whether the trial court correctly concluded that appellant sought and obtained a screening and treatment-referral within the thirty-day window. The evidence appellee submitted shows that he received services at PCRC on December 15, 2015, and that his next service did not occur until March 29, 2016. The documentary evidence does not reveal what type of services appellee received during his visits to PCRC. The parties stipulated, however, that appellee received an \"assessment\" on December 15, 2015, and that he began a treatment program on March 29, 2016. The trial court found it logical to conclude that when appellee began the treatment program on March 29, 2016, PCRC would have administered a screening and would have referred appellee to treatment; otherwise, PCRC would not have admitted appellee into a treatment program. The trial court believed that given the three-month interval between appellee's December 2015 \"assessment\" and his March 2016 treatment, PCRC likely re-screened and re-referred appellee to treatment, assuming that is what PCRC had, in fact, done in December 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The technical meanings of \"screening\" and \"referral to treatment\" appear to support the trial court's conclusions. The literature indicates that a person may undergo more than one screening to account for lapses in time, relapses, overdoses, etc. This is precisely what happened to appellee. He visited PCRC in December 2015. Three months elapsed without any evidence that appellee engaged in treatment. He then overdosed. Two weeks later, he returned to PCRC. Given this set of circumstances, we do not find the trial court's conclusion that appellee satisfied the screening and treatment-referral requirements to be unreasonable or contrary to the plain language of the statute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   especially when appellant never requested appellee to submit written documentation to verify the screening and treatment-referral requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 42} With respect to appellant's assertion that the trial court improperly concluded that appellee complied with R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b)(iii)'s requirement to submit documentation verifying the screening and treatment-referral requirements, the statute plainly requires the prosecuting attorney to make a request for verification. In the case sub judice, the trial court specifically found that appellant never made any request. Thus, according to the plain meaning of the statute, appellee did not have a duty to submit documentation verifying the requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Finally, we find it appropriate to note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   i.
