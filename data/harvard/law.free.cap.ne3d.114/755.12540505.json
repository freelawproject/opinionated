The petition alleges that he is being imprisoned and restrained of his liberty at the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center (NEOCC), operated by Core Civic, located at 2240 Hubbard Road in Youngstown, Mahoning County, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The writ of habeas corpus is an extraordinary writ and will only be issued in certain circumstances of unlawful restraint of a person's liberty where there is no adequate legal remedy of law.\n   <em>\n    In re Pianowski\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist. No. 03 MA 16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003-Ohio-3881\">\n    2003-Ohio-3881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2021689326\">\n    2003 WL 21689326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The burden is on the Petitioner to establish a right to release.\n   <em>\n    Halleck v. Koloski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6697635\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/4/76/\">\n    4 Ohio St.2d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=212%20N.E.2d%20601\">\n    212 N.E.2d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1965).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The habeas petition is deficient on several grounds. First, the petition does not allege an unlawful restraint. R.C. 2725.01 provides: \"Whoever is\n   <em>\n    unlawfully\n   </em>\n   restrained of his liberty, or entitled to the custody of another, of which custody such person is unlawfully deprived, may prosecute a writ of habeas corpus * * *.\" (Emphasis added.) The petition states that he is \"imprisoned and restrained of his liberty.\" Petitioner does not claim that he is being restrained unlawfully, and therefore, he has failed to allege the first and primary element of a habeas action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Second, Petitioner did not attach his commitment papers to the petition. R.C. 2725.04 requires the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Application for the writ of habeas corpus shall be by petition, signed and verified either by the party for whose relief it is intended, or by some person for him, and shall specify:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (D) A copy of the commitment or cause of detention of such person shall be exhibited, if it can be procured without impairing the efficiency of the remedy; or, if the imprisonment or detention is without legal authority, such fact must appear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Ohio Supreme Court has explained, \"[t]hese commitment papers are necessary for a complete understanding of the petition. Without them, the petition is fatally defective. When a petition is presented to a court that does not comply with R.C. 2725.04(D), there is no showing of how the commitment was procured and there is nothing before the court on which to make a determined judgment except, of course, the bare allegations of petitioner's application.\"\n   <em>\n    Bloss v. Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8819248\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/65/145/#p146\">\n    65 Ohio St.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 146,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=602%20N.E.2d%20602\">\n    602 N.E.2d 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). The papers must be included with the petition and failure to file them cannot be cured by filing them at some later point in the habeas proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Boyd v. Money\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1323184\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/82/388/#p389\">\n    82 Ohio St.3d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=696%20N.E.2d%20568\">\n    696 N.E.2d 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) ;\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

When an inmate files a civil action against a governmental entity or employee, R.C. 2969.25(A) requires the petitioner to file an affidavit with the petition describing all civil actions and appeals that petitioner has filed in state or federal court within the past five years. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that the \"requirements of R.C. 2969.25 are mandatory and failure to comply with them requires dismissal of an inmate's complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Petitioner alleges he is being restrained at NEOCC by Core Civic. This Court has recognized and takes judicial notice of the fact that NEOCC is a facility housing, at least in part, federal inmates awaiting action in federal court.\n   <em>\n    Perotti v.
