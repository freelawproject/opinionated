Elsner, appeals the trial court's denial of his motion for a new trial and raises one assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court erred in denying the Plaintiff's Motion for a New Trial based on juror misconduct and the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Finding no merit to his assignment of error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In December 2014, Elsner visited Birchall and Associates, L.L.C., and underwent the Priapus procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Curtis L. Birchall performed the procedure, and Elsner was discharged the same day. Over the course of the next month, Elsner developed a fever and other symptoms. He eventually went to the emergency room at the Cleveland Clinic, where he was diagnosed with scrotal gangrene and underwent \"an extensive scrotal debridement under general anesthesia.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 7, 2016, Elsner filed a complaint against Dr. Birchall, Birchall and Associates, L.L.C. (d.b.a. The Fountain Clinic), and Katina Walker, setting forth claims for medical malpractice and fraud due to performance of an unauthorized medical procedure outside of the standard of care for treatment of male impotence, with misrepresentation and lack of scientific substantiation of promised results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Walker moved to dismiss the claims against her under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), which Elsner did not oppose and the court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The parties engaged in lengthy pretrial motion practice and discovery. The case was eventually reassigned from the original trial judge to a visiting judge based on a scheduling conflict. The case proceeded to a trial by jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants and was polled in open court and on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Three days later, Elsner filed a motion for a new trial as well as two motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Elsner's motion for a new trial argued that a member of the jury engaged in misconduct and that the weight of the evidence did not support the judgment. The defendants filed a brief in opposition to those motions. The trial court ordered the transcript of the voir dire portion of the trial. The original trial judge, who did not preside over the trial, denied Elsner's motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as well as his motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} It is from the trial court's denial of his motion for a new trial that Elsner now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In his sole assignment of error, Elsner argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a new trial. In support of his assignment of error, Elsner argues that the court should have granted him a new trial because (1) juror\n   No. 2 failed to disclose that she was previously represented by the same law firm representing Birchall, (2) juror No. 2 worked on word puzzles during the trial and bullied other jury members into finding for Birchall, (3) the judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence, and (4) the judge who presided over the trial, not the original trial judge, should have ruled on his motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Under Civ.R. 59(A), a court may grant a new trial based on \"[m]isconduct of the jury.\" A court may also grant a new trial within its \"sound discretion * * * for good cause shown.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, \"motions for new trial are not to be granted lightly.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Failure to Disclose\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In support of his assignment of error, Elsner first argues that juror No. 2 engaged in misconduct when she failed to disclose that she was previously represented by the Reminger law firm in a medical malpractice case after Birchall's counsel revealed that he worked for Reminger. In his brief, he cites to\n   <em>\n    Burton v. Unifirst Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-2330\">\n    2013-Ohio-2330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=993%20N.E.2d%20440\">\n    993 N.E.2d 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    State v.

The record showed that one of the jurors, who was a medical doctor, failed to \"reveal that he had been previously sued several times, which could have caused him to be biased in favor of the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. We found that the juror \"did not merely fail to disclose the fact that he was sued in the past, he affirmatively made a misrepresentation by boasting that 'I'm proud to say in 33 years of practice I've never been sued for malpractice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. As a result, we found that it was \"not a case where the juror merely forgot to disclose a material fact[, but was] a case where a juror answered a voir dire question dishonestly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In\n   <em>\n    Mack\n   </em>\n   , the defendant moved for a new trial after a jury convicted him of rape and kidnapping. Immediately after the jury read its verdict, the court held a hearing concerning alleged juror misconduct, specifically concerning a conversation that a jury member had with the defendant's wife about the defendant's character and her belief that her husband was innocent. The trial court questioned both the\n   juror and the defendant's wife, but ultimately denied the defendant's motion, finding that while the juror engaged in misconduct, that misconduct was harmless and not prejudicial to the defendant. On appeal, we reversed the trial court's ruling because it deprived the defendant of \"an opportunity to meet his burden of establishing prejudice due to Juror Number 12's misconduct[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. We stated that the trial court, after finding that the jury member engaged in misconduct, \"should have then allowed [the defendant] to present evidence of prejudice[,]\" including the opportunity to question the defendant's wife and members of the jury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33 and 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In this case, during voir dire, the court introduced both parties, Birchall and Elsner, as well as the parties' attorneys, and asked the jurors if they knew or recognized any of them. None of the jurors indicated that they did. During those introductions, the court did not identify the law firms where the attorneys worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Later, the court asked whether any of the jurors had been involved in a medical malpractice case, to which juror No. 2 indicated she had. Juror No. 2, who was an adult nurse practitioner at the Cleveland V.A. Medical Center, explained, \"I have been deposed numerous times in cases as part of hospital staff. I was not named in them. I was named along with the physician in private practice. It was a malpractice suit for a patient in a nursing home. The family brought suit. We were dismissed from the case.\" Despite this, juror No. 2 informed the trial court that she could be fair and impartial to both sides. Although not precluded from doing so, neither Elsner's nor Birchall's counsel further questioned juror No. 2 as to those lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} During trial, Birchall's counsel, who was from the Reminger law firm, called Dr. Keith Armitage to the stand and asked the doctor if he had reviewed cases for Reminger in the past. The doctor responded that he had and explained that \"Reminger is a big firm with lots of offices over Ohio\" and that during his 22 years of practicing medicine, he was \"sure\" that he reviewed some of Reminger's cases. Elsner did not object or move for a mistrial at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} After review, we find that both of Elsner's cases are distinguishable from the instant case. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Burton\n   </em>\n   , there is no proof in the record that juror No. 2 answered any of the voir dire questions asked by the trial court or by counsel dishonestly.\n   <em>\n    Burton\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-2330\">\n    2013-Ohio-2330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=993%20N.E.2d%20440\">\n    993 N.E.2d 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We noted that \"[t]he record * * * only contains the affidavit of one juror, made after the jury had been discharged, that she had changed her mind.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Besides one jury member's testimony that she was pressured into finding the defendant guilty, \"[n]o independent proof of the alleged misconduct was made available to the trial court[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, we found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 28} We reach a similar conclusion in this case. Here, Elsner supports his argument with affidavits from two jurors. The first is from a member of the jury who alleged that juror No. 2 pressured other jury members to find that Birchall was not liable, ignored the court's instructions concerning pertinent legal definitions, explained that she was previously represented by the Reminger law firm and complimented their legal services, discussed information concerning medical procedures that was not presented at trial, and played word puzzles during trial. The second affidavit is from Shaun Crum, who \"was responsible for displaying all of exhibits for the Plaintiff[.]\" According to his affidavit, Crum observed juror No. 2 taking extensive notes and told Elsner's attorney that \"she might become the foreperson.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Like\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , Elsner has not provided \"independent proof of the alleged misconduct.\" The first affidavit is from a member of the jury, which is not a competent source upon which to impeach a verdict according to the\n   <em>\n    aliunde\n   </em>\n   rule. While it is not clear, it appears that Elsner offered the second affidavit to constitute independent proof of misconduct; however, that affidavit states nothing more than an observation that juror No. 2 took extensive notes, which is permitted. Therefore, after review, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Elsner's motion for a new trial based on the attached affidavits alleging misconduct on the part of juror No. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Elsner also argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on the manifest weight of the evidence. Elsner finds error with the trial court's failure to address his motion for a new trial based on the manifest weight of the evidence and blames the trial judge for failing to order and review the trial transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 31} A party's failure to provide a transcript to the trial court defeats that party's motion for a new trial and argument\n   that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thornton v.
