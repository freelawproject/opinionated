Harris (\"Harris\"), appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, granting the Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss of defendants-appellees, Ohio Department of Veterans Services (\"ODVS\") and the Ohio Veterans' Homes (\"OVH\") (collectively \"ODVS/OVH\"). For reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In July 1999, Harris began working as a pharmacy supervisor, a classified civil service position, at OVH. In 2008, the legislature created ODVS, legislating that OVH would become part of and administratively governed by the new ODVS. On August 1, 2010, in organizing the new department, ODVS and OVH appointed Harris to an unclassified civil service position, pharmacy operations manager. Harris worked in this position until February 10, 2014. On February 10, 2014, OVH terminated Harris for cause by a written notice of removal for \"incompetency, inefficiency, dishonest, drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment of the public, neglect of duty, violation of any policy or work rule of the officer's or employee's appointing authority, violation of this chapter or the rules of the director of administrative services or the commission, any other failure of good behavior, or any other acts of misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance in office.\" (Mar. 29, 2016 Compl. at \u00b6 15.) Harris asserted his fall-back\n   rights to his previous classified position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On March 3, 2014, Harris appealed his removal to the State Personnel Board of Review (\"SPBR\") and on the same date filed a letter/appeal with SPBR alleging retaliation under R.C. 124.341. On April 23, 2015, SPBR issued stays of both cases that later expired when Harris subsequently withdrew his SPBR appeals on February 2, 2017, and SPBR closed the cases on May 19, 2017. On March 29, 2016, Harris filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus and for declaratory relief in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and amended his complaint twice. ODVS/OVH filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on July 7, 2016. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss on November 30, 2016 and Harris filed a notice of appeal on December 29, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First and Second Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} At the outset, we note that Harris has sought relief under both mandamus and declaratory judgment. Declaratory judgment is provided for under R.C. 2721.12 et seq., and, as such, it is a legal remedy. While Ohio statute does contain provisions for a remedy in mandamus, that law, R.C. 2731.05, plainly provides the adequacy of a legal remedy (such as declaratory judgment) is a bar to the writ of mandamus. R.C. 2731.05 (\"The writ of mandamus must not be issued when there is plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} However, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that there cannot be a per se finding that the two actions are incompatible.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

R.C. 2731.16 sets forth the explicit power of the court in issuing a writ of mandamus \"to carry its order and judgment into execution, or to punish any officer named therein for contempt or disobedience of its orders or writs\" and that other sections of the mandamus statute do not limit these powers. We also note that pursuant to R.C. 2731.11, Harris may recover damages against the State in a mandamus action, but the State has waived immunity from such damages only through statutory enactment of the Ohio Court of Claims, which has no original jurisdiction in mandamus.

The upshot of this is that if Harris were to prove he is entitled to mandamus and damages for the circumstances that led him to bring the action, his financial recourse is against the State, and he would\n   be required to seek his damages in a separate action in the Court of Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} But Harris must begin by proving two elements of mandamus as asserted in his first two assignments of error-that is, whether he had a clear legal right and whether the State had a clear legal duty. Harris argues first that the trial court erred when it held he had no clear legal right to his previously held classified civil service position of pharmacy supervisor. In his second assignment of error, Harris argues that the trial court erred because it held ODVS/OVH had no clear legal duty to provide him with his fall-back rights pursuant to R.C. 124.11.

They argue that as a result he cannot demonstrate a clear legal right to his previously held classified position. ODVS/OVH similarly argue they had no clear legal duty to place him in the classified civil service, and, therefore, mandamus was properly denied by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The trial court applied R.C. 124.11 and held that Harris's situation was governed by this law. Under R.C. 124.11, an unclassified employee whose employment is revoked has the right to fall back to a previously held classified position when (1) the previously held classified position was within the same agency that revoked the employee's unclassified employment, (2) the employee has not transferred\n   to another agency since the time he last worked in the classified position, and (3) the appointing authority never indicated that the revocation was for \"just cause.\" The trial court found, since Harris's employment was revoked for \"just cause,\" he did not have a clear legal right to demand that his employer return him to his previously held classified position, and the employer did not have a clear legal duty to place Harris in that position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Whether Harris has a clear legal right to fall back to his classified position rests on whether he was revoked for just cause.

In this case, Harris was removed for the following reasons: \"incompetency, inefficiency, dishonest, drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment of the public, neglect of duty, violation of any policy or work rule of the officer's or employee's appointing authority, violation of this chapter or the rules of the director of administrative services or the commission, any other failure of good behavior, or any other acts of misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance in office.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 20} \"It is fundamental that where rights are created by statutes such rights can vest only when all the statutory conditions have been met.

In the longstanding case of\n   <em>\n    Heasley\n   </em>\n   , the trial court granted a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss the plaintiff-insurance company's action for a declaration that it owed no uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage to Heasley, because no actual, justiciable controversy existed between the parties. We affirmed. Noting a conflict between appellate districts on the appropriate standard of appellate review from a trial court's dismissal of a declaratory judgment action, the Supreme Court rejected the insurance company's argument for de novo review and \"reaffirm[ed] that declaratory judgment actions are to be reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Heasley\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Accordingly, we review the trial court's dismissal of Harris's claim for declaratory relief based on whether we find the trial court abused its discretion in reaching its decision.

A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Given Harris's narrative in support of his SPBR appeal, there can be no doubt that Harris's appeal from OVH's removal order invokes SPBR jurisdiction under R.C. 124.341. Pursuant to R.C. 124.341, Harris's SPBR appeal is the sole and exclusive remedy available to an unclassified employee, notwithstanding any other provision of law. Accordingly, Harris's whistleblower appeal to SPBR represents Harris's sole and exclusive remedy at law, notwithstanding Harris's fall-back rights under R.C. 124.11(D). In my view, Harris's complaint in this case fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted due to the availability of a whistleblower claim under R.C. 124.341.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 41} R.C. 124.341 authorizes SPBR to hear and determine whistleblower claims filed by unclassified employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   R.C. 124.341(D) permits SPBR to \"affirm or disaffirm the action of the appointing authority or may issue any other order as is appropriate.\" Because SPBR has yet to consider the merits of Harris's R.C. 124.341 appeal, there has been no determination regarding Harris's available remedies under the statute, if any. Ohio law requires Harris to exhaust his available administrative remedies before commencing a mandamus action, and Harris's complaint conclusively demonstrates that he did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 42} The complaint alleges Harris moved SPBR to hear and determine his fall-back rights but that SPBR \"issued a stay until a judicial determination as to whether he was entitled to * * * fall-back * * * rights to his former classified civil service position.\" (Second Am. Compl. at \u00b6 19.) In his complaint, Harris claims SPBR \"has now adopted the position that it does not have authority or jurisdiction under R.C. Chapter 124 to determine the question of whether [he] has displacement rights under R.C. Sec. 124.11(D).\" (Second Am. Compl. at \u00b6 27.) Accordingly, Harris concludes he had \"exhausted his administrative remedies, and has no other recourse.\" (Second Am. Compl. at \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 43} In\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Rennell v. Indus. Comm.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

The state employer responded a replacement was already being selected, and the employee could not rescind the retirement agreement. The employee filed an appeal with the SPBR seeking reinstatement to his position in the classified civil service, which was dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction under R.C. 124.03(A). The employee did not appeal from that decision. The employee subsequently filed a mandamus action in this court seeking reinstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 44} In support of his mandamus action, the employee argued an R.C. Chapter 119 administrative appeal from SPBR's dismissal order was not an adequate remedy because SPBR lacked jurisdiction of his claim. This court determined relator's contention regarding SPBR's authority was irrelevant because \"[t]he relevant issue is whether an adequate remedy at law existed because [the relator] could have appealed the SPBR's [dismissal] to the court of common pleas.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. This court concluded because \" R.C. 119.12 permitted relator to appeal the SPBR's order to the common pleas court; * * * an adequate remedy existed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   We reasoned the availability of an R.C. 119.12 appeal from SPBR's dismissal order was dispositive of the issue whether an adequate remedy existed at law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 45} In my view, the facts alleged in Harris's complaint require this court to apply the rule of law in\n   <em>\n    Rennell\n   </em>\n   as a complete bar to Harris's mandamus claim. Harris timely appealed to SPBR from OVH's removal order pursuant to R.C. 124.341. In the context of that appeal, Harris also sought fall-back rights. R.C. 124.341(D) permits SPBR to \"affirm or disaffirm the action of the appointing authority or may issue\n   <em>\n    any other order as is appropriate\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) R.C. 124.341(D) provides that any SPBR decision in an employee's whistleblower appeal is \"appealable in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code.\" Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rennell\n   </em>\n   , the availability of an R.C. Chapter 119 appeal provides an adequate remedy at law, even though SPBR has taken the position it does not have jurisdiction to determine Harris's fall-back rights. As previously noted, because SPBR has yet to consider the merits of Harris's R.C. 124.341 appeal, there has been no determination\n   regarding Harris's available remedies under the statute, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Under the \"well-established\" law in Ohio, Harris's failure to exhaust his administrative remedy bars mandamus relief.\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.\n   <em>\n    See also Johnson\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Basic Distrib. Corp.\n   </em>\n   The fact Harris has apparently chosen to abandon his SPBR appeal during the stay does not alter the fact that Harris had not exhausted his available administrative remedies prior to initiating his mandamus action. Harris's failure to do so bars his mandamus action.\n   <em>\n    Rennell.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 47} To date, no Ohio court has addressed the question whether an unclassified employee seeking to enforce fall-back rights may challenge the employer's decision to remove the employee for cause by filing a mandamus action in the common pleas court. Because R.C. 124.341 vests SPBR with jurisdiction to determine Harris's whistleblower appeal, which is Harris's sole and exclusive legal remedy under the facts alleged in the complaint, and because R.C. 124.341 provides Harris with an R.C. 119.12 appeal from any subsequent decision by SPBR, I see no justifiable reason to address the question in this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 48} For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the trial court decision denying the writ of mandamus, albeit for a different reason than the trial court.
