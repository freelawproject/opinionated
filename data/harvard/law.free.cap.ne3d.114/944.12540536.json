We affirm.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-8\">\n     This matter concerns a criminal case in the Superior Court against Michael Lamonte Degree, who is the father of the plaintiff's children. The plaintiff's papers both in this court and in the county court are difficult to follow, but as best we can discern she is seeking orders compelling various public officials to \"void\" or \"reverse\" Degree's criminal convictions, to release him from confinement, and to return or impound the documents, property, and evidence connected to his prosecution. The single justice dismissed the complaint, concluding that the plaintiff lacks standing to seek this type of relief associated with the criminal case against Degree. There was no error in denying relief. The claims asserted by the plaintiff belong to Degree, not to the plaintiff or the children.
