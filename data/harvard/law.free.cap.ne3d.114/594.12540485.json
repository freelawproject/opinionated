She asserts the trial court's finding was not supported by sufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The state based the underlying speeding offense on a state trooper's testimony that he visually observed Z.E.N. operating a motor vehicle well over the posted speed limit, which he then confirmed by using an LTI 20-20 laser device. However, the trial court committed plain error by relying on the trooper's testimony about the laser device readout. The state failed to introduce evidence to demonstrate the device's scientific reliability, and the trial\n   court failed to take judicial notice of this fact. Moreover, R.C. 4511.091(C)(1) precluded the trial court from relying on the trooper's unaided visual estimation of Z.E.N.'s vehicle's speed to convict her of speeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Because the trial court's finding that Z.E.N. is a juvenile traffic offender based on her speeding was not supported by sufficient evidence, we sustain her assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The state filed a traffic ticket in the Scioto County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, charging Z.E.N. with speeding by traveling 70 mph in a 50 mph zone, in violation of R.C. 4511.21, and alleging that she is a juvenile traffic offender, as defined in R.C. 2151.02(N). Although the ticket did not state which subsection of R.C. 4511.21 she allegedly violated, by stating she operated a motor vehicle by traveling 70 mph in a 50 mph zone, it alleged a violation of R.C. 4511.21(D)(5), which provides that \"[n]o person shall operate a motor vehicle * * * upon a street or highway * * * [a]t a speed exceeding the posted speed limit upon a highway, expressway, or freeway * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} At the adjudicatory hearing Ohio Highway Patrol Trooper Bradley A. Johnson testified he was outside his patrol car and using an LTI 20-20 laser unit on U.S. 52 in Scioto County where the posted speed limit was 50 mph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} According to Trooper Johnson the LTI 20-20 laser unit was properly calibrated and he was trained and qualified in its use. He observed Z.E.N., who he later learned was 16 years old, driving around a curve on U.S. 52 and who \"appeared to be well over the posted speed limit of fifty miles an hour down through there.\" He then \"checked the speed with the laser and checked it at seventy miles an hour in a fifty zone.\" Trooper Johnson testified that he couldn't have aimed the laser device at the wrong car even though Z.E.N.'s car was next to another vehicle. That was because he aimed the laser at Z.E.N.'s car by using the scope and placing the red dot on that. Z.E.N. did not object to the trooper's testimony, despite the fact the state did not offer any testimony establishing concerning the scientific reliability of the LTI 20-20 laser device. Nor did the trial court take judicial notice of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Z.E.N. testified that she was not going 70 mph on the date in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In closing argument, Z.E.N.'s attorney stated that because the state failed to produce evidence of the scientific reliability of the laser device, there was insufficient evidence to prove that she had been speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Additionally, no testimony was provided as to the scientific reliability of the laser and no judicial notice was asked for with regard to it. And so, therefore, because it's a laser reading, insufficient evidence was provided * * *. Insufficient evidence with regard to the laser and the mechanics of the particular machine was provided to the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court found that the state had proved Z.E.N. to be a juvenile traffic offender by speeding, without commenting on the scientific reliability of the laser device:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   * * * I do believe, after sitting in here, that the prosecutor has carried his burden of proving that she was doing that, that speed, that rate of speed. Calibration was talked about. The line of sight with the scope, that it's a red dot scope. I believe that he said that it was, they can check the alignment and it was checked. Talked about that there were two vehicles. So, I believe, that the burden has been carried and that she has\n   been proven to be a juvenile traffic offender. So, I will so find, young lady, that you are a juvenile traffic offender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court entered a judgment adjudicating Z.E.N. to be a juvenile traffic offender and ordering her to pay costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.

A juvenile traffic offender \"means any child who violates any traffic law * * * of this state * * *.\" R.C. 2152.02(N). The trial court's finding that Z.E.N. is a juvenile traffic offender is based on her speeding above the posted speed limit in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D), a state traffic law. As noted previously, R.C. 4511.21(D)(5) prevents any person from operating a motor vehicle upon a street or highway \"[a]t a speed exceeding the posted speed limit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The state based the speeding violation on the trooper's testimony that the LTI 20-20 laser device registered her as traveling 70 mph in a 50 mph zone.

This division does not do any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (a) Preclude the use by a peace officer of a stopwatch, radar, laser, or other electrical, mechanical, or digital device to determine the speed of a motor vehicle;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (b) Apply regarding any violation other than a violation of divisions (B) to (O) of section 4511.21 or section 4511.211 of the Revised Code or a substantially similar municipal ordinance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (c) Preclude a peace officer from testifying that the speed of operation of a motor vehicle, trackless trolley, or streetcar was at a speed greater or less than a speed described in division (A) of section 4511.21 of the Revised Code, the admission into evidence of such testimony, or preclude a conviction of a violation of that division based in whole or in part on such testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   R.C. 4511.091(C)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Because this case was based upon speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D)(5), amended R.C. 4511.091(C)(1) precluded the trial court from relying solely on the trooper's estimate of speed for the conviction.\n   <em>\n    Helke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-4402\">\n    2015-Ohio-4402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20N.E.3d%20188\">\n    46 N.E.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17 ;\n   <em>\n    Greater Cleveland Metroparks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-5570\">\n    2017-Ohio-5570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17. The state's citation of the exception in R.C. 4511.091(C)(1)(c) does not help its position because that exception applies only in R.C. 4511.21(A) speeding cases, in which it is alleged that a person operated a motor vehicle \"at a speed greater or less than is reasonable or proper, having due regard to the traffic, surface, and width of the street or highway and any other conditions, and no person shall drive any motor vehicle * * * upon any street or highway at a greater speed than will permit the person to bring it to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead.\" The trooper's ticket did not charge Z.E.N. with a violation of R.C. 4511.21(A). We reject the state's claim of harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Consequently, the state did not introduce sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that she is a juvenile traffic offender based on the traffic offense of speeding.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand with instructions to discharge Z.E.N.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   JUDGMENT REVERSED AND CAUSE REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Abele, J.,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 31} I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 32} During the trial to the court, the arresting officer testified that the LTI 20-20 laser unit had been properly calibrated, that the officer had been properly trained and qualified to use the device, and that the juvenile traffic offender operated her vehicle at 70 miles per hour in a 50 mile per hour zone. The prosecution elicited the foregoing testimony, and the trial court received the foregoing evidence, without objection. Consequently, I believe that the lack of any objection waived any error associated with the admission of evidence regarding the speed of the vehicle. I further note that the use of the LTI 20-20 laser device has been accepted in courts throughout Ohio. Thus, the prosecution did not produce evidence from an unknown or unreliable speed detection device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Hoover, P.J.: Concurs in Judgment and Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Abele, J.: Dissents with dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The Second District Court of Appeals has held that the LTI 20-20 laser is scientifically reliable based on the expert testimony introduced in a prior case in their territorial jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
