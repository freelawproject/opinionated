(hereinafter \"Bob Bay\") and Julia Bay, appeal the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment in favor of Appellee, Circle Investment Corp., as well as the trial court's denial of their competing motions for summary judgment. On appeal, Appellants contend that 1) the trial court erred when it granted partial summary judgment to Appellee and denied their summary judgment motions on the issue of whether Appellee had a common law landlord distress lien extending to Bob Bay's personal property; 2) the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to Appellee and denied their motions for summary judgment because common law landlord distress liens have been abolished in Ohio; 3) the trial court erred when it failed to find that Appellant Julia Bay has a perfected security interest as to Appellant Bob Bay's personal property and sale proceeds thereof; and 4) the trial court erred when it found that Appellee's alleged common law landlord distress lien had priority over Appellant Julia Bay's perfected security interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Because we have found that 1) common law landlord distress liens have been abolished in Ohio; 2) Appellee did not possess a statutory landlord's lien; 3) Appellee did not have a landlord's lien that arose by operation of law; and 4) Appellee did not have a consensual landlord's lien as the lease agreement between Appellant Bob Bay and Circle Investment Corporation expressly provided that the personal property and fixtures should remain the property of the tenants; and 5) Appellee did not enter into a separate security agreement with Appellant Bob Bay regarding its personal property, Appellants' first and second assignments of error have\n   merit and are sustained. However, because we find that Appellants' third and fourth assignments of error are not ripe for review, in light of the fact that it appears from the record before us that the trial court failed to determine whether or not Appellant Julia Bay had a valid and perfected security interest in Appellant Bob Bay's personal property, and whether she was, in fact, next in line in terms of priority. Thus, we must remand this matter for further proceedings. Accordingly, the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment in favor of Appellee as to the issue of whether it had a perfected common law landlord's distress lien and denial of summary judgment as to Appellants on the same issue are reversed, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The following facts are taken from the affidavits of the parties attached in support of each party's motion for summary judgment, as well as the trial court's decision and entry granting summary judgment in favor of Appellee and denying Appellants' competing motions for summary judgment. The parties herein are in agreement as to the facts of this case and simply disagree on a question of law. Appellant, Bob Bay, operated a grocery store, doing business under the name Carnival Market, located at 120 Morris Road in Circleville, Ohio. Appellee, Circle Investment Corporation, was the owner of the premises and leased the premises to Appellant, Bob Bay. The original lease of this premises was between Appellee and Big Bear and originated on March 17, 1987. On December 21, 2003, Penn Traffic Company, which operated Big Bear, assigned its interest in the lease to Appellant, Bob Bay, pursuant to an assignment and assumption of lease agreement. Appellant, Bob Bay, at that point became the lessee of the premises subject to the terms of the original lease. The pertinent provisions of the lease will be discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On December 31, 2014, Appellant, Bob Bay, entered into a security agreement with Appellant, Julia Bay, which granted a security interest in all corporate assets of the business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On that same date, Bob Bay signed a revolving credit promissory note agreeing to pay Julia Bay the amount of $1,194,405.00 pursuant to loans made by Julia Bay to the corporation. Julia Bay thereafter filed a financing statement with the Ohio Secretary of State on March 30, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In November of 2016, Bob Bay informed Appellee during a telephone conversation that the premises would be vacated between December 15, 2016 and December 30, 2016, as the grocery store had become unprofitable and ceased its day to day operations. It also appears that the rent was current up until November 1, 2016, but was not paid for the month of November. Appellee thereafter changed locks on the building, which led Appellant, Bob Bay, to file a lawsuit against Appellee alleging breach of lease, interference with its contractual relationship with the liquidation company, seeking a permanent injunction to prevent obstruction of the sale of its personal property and equipment it\n   intended to liquidate, and for punitive damages. Then, on December 1, 2016, Appellee signed a notice of distress lien as to Bob Bay's removable personal property, claiming it had a perfected distress lien for all unpaid rents upon the chattels owned by Bob Bay, and upon the proceeds, if sold. On that same day Appellee filed a counterclaim for breach of lease, seeking to recover rental payments and real estate taxes due and to foreclose upon its distress lien, as well as a third party complaint against Appellant, Julia Bay, who claimed to hold a perfected security interest over the personal property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court held a hearing on December 6, 2016, and then issued a decision granting Appellee a distress lien upon Appellant Bob Bay's chattels and proceeds of the sale thereof. In that decision, the trial court found that Appellee likely had a perfected distress lien, that the priority of sale proceeds was in dispute, and noted that Appellee had agreed to allow the scheduled liquidation sale to occur and that Appellant, Bob Bay, agreed to deposit the net proceeds of the sale to be held in escrow by the Clerk of Courts until the issue was decided. Appellants subsequently filed a motion to vacate the decision finding Appellee had a distress lien, arguing that distress liens of personal property were no longer recognized in Ohio and had been abolished. It was further argued that liens upon personal property were now governed by R.C. Chapter 1309, which consists of Ohio's adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code. Appellee filed a memorandum contra Appellants' motion to vacate arguing R.C. Chapter 1309 did not apply to landlord's liens. After additional motion practice, the trial court issued a decision and entry on January 19, 2017, denying Appellants' motion to vacate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Thereafter, all parties filed motions for summary judgment. Appellee's motion for summary judgment requested judgment in its favor in the amount of $2,141,913.28 for breach of the lease and for a declaration that it had a valid commercial rent distress lien and first priority against the proceeds of the liquidation sale in the amount of $55,922.32. Appellant, Bob Bay, filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a determination that distress liens have been abolished in Ohio. Finally, on July 17, 2017, Appellant, Julia Bay, filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking an order that she had a perfected security interest in the proceeds of the sale of the personal property, that Appellee did not possess a distress lien, and that her perfected security interest had priority over the alleged distress lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court issued a decision on August 4, 2017, granting Appellee's motion for summary judgment, in part, on the issue of the distress lien, finding that common law landlord distress liens had not been abolished in Ohio. The trial court stated it would not award damages for lost rents and Appellee must file another action if it sought such an award. The trial court further denied Appellants' competing motions for summary judgment and dismissed any other remaining claims. It is from this decision and entry that Appellants now bring their timely appeal, setting forth four assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.

To satisfy its burden, the moving party must refer to \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action,\" that affirmatively demonstrate that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party's claims.

After the movant supports the motion with appropriate evidentiary materials, the nonmoving party \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the party's pleadings, but the party's response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Civ.R. 56(E). \"If the party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202152000\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In the case sub judice, the materials the trial court considered consisted of the pleadings, affidavits by the parties, and copies of the original lease agreement and assignment and assumption of lease agreement regarding the subject property. Also appearing in the record are copies of the security agreement signed between \"Bob Bay and Son Co.\" and Julia Kathy Bay, a revolving credit promissory note between \"Bob Bay and Son, Inc.\" and Kathy Bay, a revolving line of credit agreement between \"Bob Bay and Son, Inc.\" and Kathy Bay,\n   and an initial filing statement filed by Julia Kathy Bay as to \"Bob Bay and Son Co.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR I AND II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} We address Appellants' first and second assignments of error together as they both challenge the trial court's rulings on the competing motions for summary judgment filed below. Appellants contend under these assignments of error that the trial court erred when it granted partial summary judgment to Appellee and denied the summary judgment motions of Appellants on the issue of whether Appellee had a common law landlord distress lien, because common law landlord distress liens have been abolished in Ohio. Appellants further contend that the type of interest Appellee seeks to secure in Appellant Bob Bay's personal property is governed by R.C. Chapter 1309, which controls secured transactions and adopts the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Appellee contends that common law landlord distress liens have not been abolished, but instead are alive and well in Ohio, and that R.C. Chapter 1309 does not apply to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Both parties are in agreement as to facts of the present case, but disagree on the law relative to this issue. The legal question presented here is whether the remedy of common law landlord distress, which allows the landlord to re-possess the real property at issue and also take any and all personal property found on the premises of the tenant, is still permissible; or whether Ohio's adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code as set forth in R.C. Chapter 1309 now governs such interests in a tenant's personal property. Based upon the following, we agree with Appellants' argument that common law landlord distress liens are no longer recognized in Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Common law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellee is correct that the common law, at one time, provided for landlord distress liens and the State of Ohio appears to have recognized them at some point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"At common law, distress\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a remedy for the collection of rent and the right to this remedy was incident to rent. Broadly defined, common-law distress allows the landlord to go upon the demised premises and seize anything that he or she might find there, as security for rent in arrears, and to hold it without sale until the rent is paid.\" 65 Ohio Jur. 3d Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 317 ; citing\n   <em>\n    Sutliff v. Atwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"524602\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/15/186/\">\n    15 Ohio St. 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1864%20WL%2024\">\n    1864 WL 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1864) and Am Jur. 2d, Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 813 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Similarly, in \u00a7 6:14 Distress for rent, Oh. Landlord Tenant L. (2017-2018 Ed.) it is explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Distress for rent\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a common-law remedy that allowed the landlord to go onto the leased premises, seize anything he could find there, and use it as security for rent held in arrears, such holding to be without sale and only until the rent was paid. The right to the remedy of distress at common law was incident to the rent.

Atwood, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 193-194, stated as far back as 1864, that \"[d]istress\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a remedy, it is true, incident to rent, at common law, for its collection; but, the abolition of this remedy did not destroy the other legal qualities of rent.\" (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    Sutliff\n   </em>\n   involved the commercial lease of a dairy farm along with its cows, and the cows, it appears, were the personal property of the lessor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 192.

Aside from this statement in\n   <em>\n    Sutliff\n   </em>\n   , this Court has been unable to locate a single case, going back over one hundred years, which even mentions common law landlord distress liens, with the exception of the case of\n   <em>\n    Stephenson v.

The court held that \"a lien for the rent always exists where the lease provides for a right of\n   <em>\n    re-entry\n   </em>\n   -- that is, the right, upon non-payment of rent, to avoid the lease and repossess the premises demised.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 486. Noting that the instrument at issue was not a lease but rather \"a deed of conveyance in fee, subject to a condition of defeasance[,]\" the court reasoned that lessor had a two-fold lien; the equitable lien for the purchase money, and\n   the lien by virtue of the reservation in the deed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The court ultimately affirmed the lower court's determination that the lessor's lien upon the premises was superior to the lien of the mortgagees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 487. Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Stephenson\n   </em>\n   court recognized that a lessor's, or landlord's, lien has priority over a competing mortgagee where the instrument of conveyance provides for the lessor's or landlord's right of re-entry upon non-payment of rent.\n   <em>\n    Stephenson\n   </em>\n   , however, did not address the issue of whether a right-of-re-entry provision in a lease gives a lessor a lien on a lessee's personal property found on the demised premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Although our research failed to yield examples of courts acknowledging and affirming common law landlord distress liens that extend beyond real property to the reach of the personal property of tenants, it did yield several examples of courts determining landlords had valid liens on the personal property of tenants where the lease contained a right-of-re-entry provision that expressly covered personal property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shoenberger v.

We believe such finding is bolstered by more recent cases which discuss modern landlord liens as being either consensual, statutory or arising by operation of law, and falling within the gambit of R.C.

Although agricultural leases are dealt with separately in R.C. Chapter 1309, we find the reasoning regarding landlord's liens in general in\n   <em>\n    Walcher\n   </em>\n   is still applicable and instructive. The\n   <em>\n    Walcher\n   </em>\n   court explained that \"[t]here are three types of landlord's liens: statutory landlord's liens, other landlord's liens arising by operation of law, and consensual landlord's liens.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1987%20WL%208015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the court stated that statutory landlord's liens and other landlord's liens arising by operation of law do not fall within the scope of the U.C.C. Article 9 coverage, as adopted in Chapter 1309 of the Ohio Revised Code, it determined that \" Section 1309.01 to 1309.50 of the Revised Code [did] apply to consensual landlord's liens.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1987%20WL%208015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In\n   <em>\n    Walcher\n   </em>\n   , the court ultimately held that \"[a] landlord's lien of a tenant's crops does not arise by operation of law where the landlord-tenant agreement provides for cash-rent only.\"\n   <em>\n    Walcher\n   </em>\n   explained that \"[c]onsensual landlord's lien arise where, for instance, a lease of the premises gives the landlord a lien to secure rent payments on goods owned by the tenant on the premises.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1987%20WL%208015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Walcher\n   </em>\n   court found that 1) no landlord's lien of any kind existed between the parties at issue as there is no statutory lien in Ohio governing a landlord's interest in his tenant's crops where the lease provides for cash-rent only; 2) no landlord's lien had arisen by operation of law; and 3) and no consensual landlord's lien had been created because \"the landlord did not reserve any rights to or interest in the crops upon non-payment of rent[,]\" and had not created a security interest pursuant to Chapter 1309.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Like\n   <em>\n    Walcher\n   </em>\n   , the lease at issue herein provides for cash-rent only by granting the lessor the right to re-enter and repossess the demised premises, to re-lease it to a third party, and to bring an action if necessary, to recoup the rent owed by lessee, Bob Bay. Thus, we cannot find that a landlord's lien arises by operation of law here. Further, this Court has been unable to confirm the existence of a statutory landlord's lien in Ohio despite exhaustive research. Thus, we conclude that there is no statutory landlord's lien at\n   play here. Additionally, a review of the pertinent lease language indicates that there was never a consensual landlord's lien granted over Appellant Bob Bay's personal property in favor of Appellee according to the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Here, both parties contend that Article 24 of the lease is pertinent to our analysis. Article 24 of the lease is entitled \"LESSEE'S DEFAULT\" and it provides as follows in the event lessee defaults on payment of the rent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"* * * Lessor may, at any time after such default, re-enter and take possession of the Demised Primises [sic] without such re-entry working a forfeiture of the rents to be paid and the covenants, agreements, and conditions to be kept and performed by Lessee for the full term of this Lease and, in such event, Lessor shall have the right to relet the same for such periods of time and at such rentals and for such use and upon such covenants and conditions as Lessor may elect, applying the net rentals from such letting first to the payment of Lessor's expenses incurred in re-entering and re-letting said premises and the balance, if any, shall be applied by Lessor on account of the payments due or payable by Lessee hereunder, with the right reserved to Lessor to bring such action or proceeding for the recovery of any deficits remaining unpaid * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Appellee contends that the express right-of-re-entry contained in the lease that allows it to take possession of the demised premises extends to the tenant's personal property. Appellants contend that it does not. We agree with Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 26} We conclude, according to the plain language of the lease and in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Stephenson v. Haines\n   </em>\n   , as discussed above, that the right-of-re-entry absolutely gave Appellee the right to enter and take possession of the real property. We further conclude that the plain language of the lease limits Appellee's remedy, upon default in the payment of rent, to re-leasing the property to a third party and applying those proceeds to the amount due from the lessee, along with the right to file an action for the deficit that remained unpaid, much like in\n   <em>\n    Walcher\n   </em>\n   . Unlike the cases cited above, there is no express provision in this lease granting Appellee an interest in Appellant Bob Bay's personal property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Further, other sections of the lease expressly state that the personal property and fixtures of Bob Bay, as the lessee, shall remain the property of the lessee. For instance, Article 12 of the lease entitled \"Fixtures and Personal Property\" provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"Any trade fixtures, equipment, and other property installed in or attached to the Demised Premises by and at the expense of the Lessee (including signs) shall remain the property of the Lessee, and Lessee shall have the right\n   <em>\n    at any time\n   </em>\n   , and from time to time, to remove any and all such property. Any material damage to the building caused by removal shall be promptly repaired by the Lessee so that the premises will be left in good order and repair.\" (emphasis added)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Additionally, Article 14 of the lease entitled \"Assigning and Subletting and Vacancy\" provides that lessee has the right \"to leave the Demised Premises vacant or unoccupied\" and that if such event occurs lessor shall have the right to cancel or terminate the lease. Notice of Bob Bay's intent to vacate the premises was actually the event that triggered Appellee's subsequent conduct of changing the locks, etc. Article 14 further provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"Upon any such cancellation Lessee shall remove its trade fixtures and\n   equipment, furniture, merchandise and other personal property from the Demised Premises not later than thirty (30) days after Lessor's notice of cancellation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Thus, contrary to Appellee's suggestion that the right-of-re-entry provision in the lease grants Appellee the right to repossess not only the real property but also the personal property of Appellant, the express language in the lease provides that all personal property and fixtures shall at all times remain the property of the lessee, who has the right to remove them at any time, even if lessor cancels the lease due to lessee's notice that it intends to vacate. This is the exact scenario that occurred in the present case. Clearly, according to the plain language of the lease at issue, no consensual landlord's lien was created here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The parties disagree on the issue of whether R.C. 1309.109 applies to landlord's liens, in general. Appellants argue that it does while Appellee argues that it does not. As discussed above, the\n   <em>\n    Walcher\n   </em>\n   court held that consensual landlord's liens fell within the parameters of R.C. 1309.109 to the extent they purport to claim an interest in a lessee or tenant's personal property, as opposed to real property (which does not fall within the coverage of the UCC). In reaching its decision the\n   <em>\n    Walcher\n   </em>\n   court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"Chapter 1309 of the Revised Code governs the creation and perfection of security interest in goods. U.C.C. Article 9 as adopted and codified in Chapter 1309 applies to consensual security interests as well as to certain sales. See R.C. 1309.02. However, the uniform model version, U.C.C. \u00a7 9-104(b) and most state adaptations, specifically provide that Article 9 does not apply to a landlord's lien. The Ohio legislature, however, has chosen to omit 'landlord's lien' from the exclusions listed in Ohio's version of U.C.C. 9-104. In other words, landlord's liens are not explicitly excluded from Article 9 coverage in Ohio.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Based upon this glaring omission, it would appear as if all landlord's liens must comply with Chapter 1309. This is not the case. Instead, the omission apparently was made out of a belief that to exclude landlord's liens would merely reiterate the limitations on coverage already made explicit in R.C. 1309.02 ( U.C.C.9-102 ). See R.C. 1309.04, Comment 2. Specifically, statutory landlord's liens and other landlord's liens arising by operation of law are already excluded from Chapter 1309 coverage since they are not transactions intended to create a security interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, no special provision exists in Chapter 1309 for statutory landlord's liens or other landlord's liens arising by operation of law (compare: Mechanic's liens). See 8 Anderson, U.C.C., (1985) 540, Landlord's Lien, Section 9-104 : 17. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that although Ohio has omitted 'landlord's lien,' from the exclusions listed in R.C. 1309.04, statutory landlord's liens and other landlord's liens arising by operation of law do not fall within the scope of U.C.C. Article 9 coverage as adopted in Chapter 1309 of the Revised Code. Accordingly, priorities between statutory landlord's liens/landlord's liens arising by operation of law and security interests perfected under Chapter 1309 are to be determined by pre-U.C.C. law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Conversely, consensual landlord's liens are not excluded from Chapter 1309 coverage. R.C. 1309.02(C) specifically provides:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   'The application of sections 1309.01 to 1309.50 of the Revised Code to a security interest in a secured obligation is not affected by the fact that the obligation is itself secured by a transaction or interest to which sections 1309.01 to 1309.50 of the Revised Code do not apply.' See Comment 4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   In other words, when a landlord's lien is created by agreement, Chapter 1309 applies to the security interest created even though it does not apply to the subject of the security interest. Therefore, section 1309.01 to 1309.50 of the Revised Code apply to consensual landlord's liens. Consensual landlord's liens must be perfected pursuant to Chapter 1309 which in turn governs any priority dispute between consensual landlord's liens and other security interests.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The\n   <em>\n    Walcher\n   </em>\n   decision was issued in 1987 and landlord's liens were not excluded from the operation of Chapter 13 of the Revised Code at that time. However, based upon our research, it appears that R.C. 1309.109 was amended to exclude landlord's liens in 2001. For instance, R.C. 1309.109 now provides in section (D) that the chapter does not apply to \"[a] landlord's lien, other than an agricultural lien[.]\" Importantly, however, the language in R.C. 1309.109 relied upon by the\n   <em>\n    Walcher\n   </em>\n   court which led it conclude that consensual landlord's liens, as opposed to other types of landlord's liens, fell within the parameters of Chapter 1309 still exists in the current version of the statute. More specifically, R.C. 1309.109 currently provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"(B) The application of this chapter to a security interest in a secured obligation is not affected by the fact that the obligation is itself secured by a transaction or interest to which this chapter does not apply.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   R.C. 1309.109 (D)(11) further currently provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"(D) This chapter does not apply to the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (11) The creation or transfer of an interest in or lien on real property, including a lease or rents under a lease,\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   to the extent that provision is made for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (b) Fixtures in section 1309.334 of the Revised Code ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (d) Security agreements covering personal and real property in section 1309.604 of the Revised Code.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" (emphasis added)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 31} We interpret these provisions to mean that even though a lease agreement primarily covers obligations and interests in real property, which are excluded from Chapter 1309, to the extent a lease also purports to grant a lien or security interest in personal property, it is governed by Chapter 1309. Thus, it appears that even though landlord's liens are now excluded from Chapter 1309, there seems to be an exception to that exclusion to the extent a lease grants a consensual landlord's lien in personal property in addition to an interest in real property. Such a consensual lien would, in effect, create a security interest that is governed by Chapter 1309. Because the lease at issue here contains no language that could be construed to create a security interest in Bob Bay's personal property, and because it does not appear that the parties entered into any type of security agreement to evidence Appellee's\n   interest in its lessee's personal property, we find Appellees have no valid lien or secured interest in said personal property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 32} We have determined that common law landlord distress liens no longer exist in Ohio. We have further determined that 1) Appellee did not have a statutory landlord's lien; 2) Appellee did not have a landlord's lien that arose by operation of law; and 3) Appellee did not enter into any type of security agreement with Appellant Bob Bay, as provided for in R.C. Chapter 1309, with regard to its personal property. These findings combined with the lease provisions which expressly state, in more than one section, that the personal property of Bob Bay, as tenant, shall remain its property and may be removed at any time, leads us to the conclusion that Appellee has no lien or perfected security interest in the personal property at issue, nor the proceeds of the sale thereof. Therefore, we find that the trial court erred in granting partial summary judgment to Appellee on this issue, and in denying summary judgment to Appellants on this issue. Accordingly, Appellants' first and second assignments of error are sustained and the trial court's judgment granting partial summary judgment in favor of Appellees and denying summary judgment in favor of Appellants on this issue is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR III AND IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In their third and fourth assignments of error, Appellants contend that the trial court erred when it failed to find that Julia Bay had a perfected security interest in Bob Bay's personal property and the sale proceeds thereof, and that it also erred in finding Appellee's alleged common law landlord distress lien had priority over Julia Bay's perfected security interest. After a thorough review of the record and the trial court's decisions and judgments issued in this case, it does not appear that the trial court ever actually analyzed Appellant Julia Bay's claim that she had a valid security interest that had been properly perfected. Throughout the proceedings, the trial court acknowledged her competing claim, but it never actually determined that her claimed security interest was valid or that it had been properly perfected. The trial court further failed to make a determination that Julia Bay stood next in line to Appellee in terms of priority. Instead, it appears that once the trial court determined Appellee had a valid common law landlord distress lien it, summarily dismissed Appellants' competing motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 34} To the extent Appellants are asking this Court to make a finding that Julia Bay's claimed security interest was valid and properly perfected, and that she is thus entitled to the proceeds of the sale of Bob Bay's personal property, we must refrain. Such an initial determination must be made by the trial court. This Court does not decide questions and issues that were not first determined by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Kearns v.
