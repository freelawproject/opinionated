Howard Hanna Smythe Cramer (\"HHSC\"), appeals from the trial court's granting plaintiffs Rita Noall, Cindy Miller, Patrick Cantlin, and Elizabeth Hong's (\"Plaintiffs\") motion for class certification in this fraud and unjust enrichment case and assigns the following error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   I. The trial court abused its discretion by certifying two new proposed classes in a December 18, 2017 order, because a rigorous analysis of the record, which was supplemented following this Court's May 26, 2016 reversal of a previously-proposed class, shows serious obstacles to predominance, identifiability, and typicality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Having reviewed the record and pertinent law, we affirm the trial court's judgment. The apposite facts follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} This lawsuit is a proposed class action, the heart of which concerns a $225 fee (\"the Fee\"), which HHSC charged putative class members allegedly as compensation for services performed in real estate transactions. The gist of Plaintiffs' argument is that the Fee is essentially unearned,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   because HHSC offered no services in exchange for the Fee, other than the services already offered to its customers prior to charging the Fee. As the trial court aptly stated, \"[t]he plaintiffs claim to have evidence demonstrating that [HHSC] devised a scheme to assess the fee as a disguised raise in its sales commission to avoid the customer backlash that might have come with an overt increase in the\n   percentage commission.\" The three real estate transactions involving the named Plaintiffs in this case are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On May 21, 2009, Noall entered into an agreement with HHSC to buy real estate. Noall signed an HHSC form entitled \"Offer to Purchase Real Estate and Acceptance.\" In section K of this form, Noall agreed to pay \"an administrative fee of $225 to [HHSC] * * *.\" This section of Noall's document also states that if the seller is represented by HHSC, the seller agrees to pay \"an administrative fee of $225\" to HHSC. Furthermore, Noall's HUD settlement statement lists on line item 705 that she paid an \"Admin Fee\" of $225 to HHSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On June 23, 2009, Cantlin and Hong entered into an agreement with HHSC to buy real estate. Cantlin and Hong signed an HHSC form entitled \"Purchase Agreement Offer, Receipt and Acceptance,\" line item 106 of which obligates them to pay \"a fee of $225.00 to Howard Hanna for brokerage services rendered to the BUYER.\" Line 301 of this same document states that the sellers agree to pay HHSC \"a brokerage commission of seven percent (7%) of the sales price and $225.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cantlin and Hong's HUD settlement statement indicates on line item 704 that they paid an \"Administrative Fee\" of $225 to HHSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On July 27, 2009, Miller entered into an agreement with HHSC to sell real estate. Miller signed an HHSC form entitled \"Exclusive Right to Sell Agreement,\" section D of which states that \"Seller also agrees to pay an Administrative Fee of $225 to Howard Hanna * * *.\" Miller also signed a Purchase Agreement Offer, Receipt and Acceptance which states on line item 97 that, if the seller is represented by HHSC, the seller shall pay \"an Administrative Fee of $225\" to HHSC. This document further states that the buyer shall also pay \"an Administrative Fee of $225\" to HHSC. Miller's HUD settlement statement lists on line item 105 that she paid HHSC a $225 \"Broker Service Fee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On September 6, 2012, Plaintiffs filed this action alleging fraud, unjust enrichment, and fraudulent inducement and moved for class certification using the following definition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   All individuals: (1) in the state of Ohio; (2) from September 18, 2005 to the present; (3) who paid to Defendant a fee entitled \"administrative fee,\" \"broker service fee,\" \"brokerage fee,\" or other similar title, which fee is usually listed on line 704 or 705 of the HUD-1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court granted class certification on July 10, 2015. HHSC appealed, and this court reversed the trial court's decision, finding that \"\n   <em>\n    as the class is currently defined\n   </em>\n   , this action does not satisfy the predominance requirement of Civ.R. 23(B)(3)\" to certify a class action.

In finding that this class definition did not pass muster under Civ.R. 23(B)(3), this court held as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In this case, there is no dispute that the HUD-1 is a standardized form. In addition, the HUD-1 clearly indicates whether a prospective class member has or has not paid the challenged \"administrative fee.\" However, we find the HUD-1, standing alone, does not constitute generalized evidence that proves or disproves\n   the elements of fraud, fraud in the inducement, and unjust enrichment on a \"simultaneous, class-wide basis.\" In other words, the fact that an individual's HUD-1 shows that he or she paid an \"administrative fee\" is not evidence that will determine whether the class members' fraud claims \"will prevail or fail in unison.\" In our view, the circumstances presented in this case require us to consider the HUD-1 in conjunction with the HHSC purchase agreements signed by each prospective class member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Upon remand, Plaintiffs filed a new motion for class certification and redefined the class into two groups:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Administrative Fee Class:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   All individuals in the state of Ohio, both buyers and sellers, who, on or after September 18, 2005, paid Defendant an \"administrative fee\" or \"administrative services fee\" pursuant to the Exclusive Right to Sell Agreement; Exclusive Buyer Representation Agreement; Offer to Purchase Agreement; or Purchase Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Brokerage Services Fee Class:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   All buyers of real estate in Ohio who, during or after March 2009, paid the Defendant a \"brokerage services\" fee pursuant to the Purchase Agreement; or Offer to Purchase Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court granted class certification on December 19, 2017, finding that the redefined class met the Civ.R. 23 threshold, including subsection (B)(3)'s predominance requirement, \"[b]ecause all the elements of fraud and unjust enrichment can be proved or disproved by common proof [and] the questions of law and fact on both causes of action which are common to the class members predominate over questions which might affect only individual members.\" It is from this order that HHSC appeals, arguing that Plaintiffs fail to meet the Civ.R. 23(B) requirements of identifiability, typicality, and predominance in the redefined subclasses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Class Certification Requirements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Civ.R. 23 provides seven requirements for maintaining a class action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) an identifiable class must exist and the definition of the class must be unambiguous; (2) the named representatives must be members of the class; (3) the class must be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (4) there must be questions of law or fact common to the class; (5) the claims or defenses of the representative parties must be typical of the claims or defenses of the class; (6) the representative parties must fairly and accurately protect the interests of the class; and (7) one of the three Civ.R. 23(B) requirements must be met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Cullen v.

While individualized fact-finding may defeat class certification, this is true only when the cause of the problem is plaintiff's overly broad class definition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maestle v.

(\"In our view, the overly broad nature of appellant's current class would require the lower court to conduct an individualized inquiry with respect to each individual's account in order to determine whether that individual was in fact injured and, therefore, a proper member of the class\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 20} HHSC's arguments under this factor of the class certification analysis are not well taken. In finding that the class members in the instant case are identifiable, the trial court stated that HHSC can reasonable identify its transactions for buyers and sellers using the noted form documents containing the Fee. Specifically, the court concluded that \"it is essentially a clerical task to weed out those who did not actually pay the fee or paid a negotiated amount.\" The court also stated that class members \"should be able to identify themselves by looking at lines 704 and 705 of their HUD-1 settlement statements to see if a fee was paid to [HHSC].\" The court further found that the new class definitions excluded sellers who paid the \"hybrid fee\" mentioned in\n   <em>\n    Cantlin I\n   </em>\n   . Upon review, we find that the class definitions are narrowly tailored to include those people who paid an \"administrative fee\" or \"brokerage services fee\" as specified in HHSC's forms. HHSC's argument that its own forms are so convoluted and varied that it is an unreasonable task to identify who paid what is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Ohio courts have favored class certification when fraud is alleged concerning a defendant's form contracts. \"[C]laims involving interpretations of form contracts present the classic case for treatment as a class action * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Carder Buick-Olds Co. v.

On this score it is noted that the rule permits a trial court considerable flexibility in deciding classes and in determining which issues may be brought or maintained in a class action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 129,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20N.E.2d%20625\">\n    463 N.E.2d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 45} HHSC additionally argues that the trial court failed to consider \"varying oral explanations by real estate sales agents\" and \"independent non-parties,\" various versions of the HUD-1, and other HHSC documents such as a buyer's guide regarding the Fee. This is not an accurate depiction of the trial court's analysis. Just because the trial court did not rule in HHSC's favor does not mean the trial court failed to consider HHSC's evidence and contentions. The trial court wrote a detailed decision analyzing both sides' arguments. In fact, the trial court stated in its decision that the alleged misrepresentation is evidenced in the HHSC forms, notwithstanding other explanations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   That is true even for plaintiffs who discussed the fee with a representative of Howard Hanna and still paid it. If one plaintiff can prove that Howard Hanna charged $225 for doing nothing that it hadn't otherwise charged and been compensated for, then even plaintiffs who were given oral assurances that the fee was in exchange for valuable services and then paid the fee should still recover since even though they may not have relied on the misrepresentation in the documents, they relied on the defendant's spoken lies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 46} In other words, if the trier of fact concludes that the Fee was fraudulent, all class members may recover. If, on the other hand, the trier of fact concludes that no fraud occurred, the class action fails. As the trial court noted, \"[p]ermitting a fraud because it was so successful that people didn't know they were being cheated only rewards the cheater's ingenuity and is hardly consistent with justice.\" We are mindful that the ultimate question of whether the Fee was fraudulent goes to the merits of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 47} HHSC further argues that individual issues predominate over class-wide issues because of the multitude of forms that HHSC uses. \"The record demonstrates that older HHSC forms are sometimes used by agents even after new versions of those forms - with different language - are rolled out.\" However, HHSC cannot avoid being sued in a class action in the instant case because they use too many different forms. The subclass definitions that the court certified include four forms with specific language. If a Plaintiff can show that he or she signed one of these forms and paid the Fee, they can participate in the class action. This is the predominant issue of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 48} HHSC also argues that the case at hand is \"directly in line with cases rejecting class treatment for lack of predominance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   To support this argument, HHSC cites\n   <em>\n    Young v. FirstMerit Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94913,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-614\">\n    2011-Ohio-614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20494893\">\n    2011 WL 494893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 49}\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   involved a proposed class of over 700 investors who purchased promissory notes from Joanne Schneider, who was later convicted of running a $60.5 million Ponzi scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. The trial court certified the class, and this court reversed, finding that the Plaintiffs failed to meet the predominance requirement of Civ.R. 23(B)(3). In\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , unlike in the case at hand, the fraud alleged was not contained in the standard promissory notes that the defendant used. Rather, the\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs alleged that the fraud occurred in how Schneider sold these notes. \"These elements are specific to each individual investor, i.e., amount invested, number of investments, return on the investment, external inducements, and representations made by Schneider.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. The\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   court further found that \"[e]ach plaintiff stated different reasons for investing their funds with Schneider.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. The court concluded that \"reliance cannot be presumed when the alleged misrepresentations are so varied. * * * Each fraud perpetrated by Schneider varied in its misrepresentations, reliance, inducement, and injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 50} The instant case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   in that the alleged fraud can be found in four HHSC standard forms. Plaintiffs allege that the misrepresentation or concealment regarding the Fee is specific, in writing, and the same for all class members. In\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , the entire investment scheme was alleged to be fraudulent, and the material misrepresentations were different for each plaintiff. For example, \"some of the initial investors did in fact see high returns on their investments * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. In the case at hand, every putative class member was charged the Fee as part of a real estate transaction, and the Fee is alleged to be fraudulent for all who paid it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Upon review, we find that common issues predominate over questions affecting individual plaintiffs. Under Civ.R. 23(B)(3)(a), \"the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions\" do not outweigh the class members' common issues. Under Civ.R. 23(B)(3)(b), evidence in the record shows that Plaintiffs previously filed a similar suit in federal court, but that case was dismissed. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \"the\n   <em>\n    lack\n   </em>\n   of parallel lawsuits tends to weigh in\n   <em>\n    favor\n   </em>\n   of certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v. Ohio Sav. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1323438\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/82/67/#p71\">\n    82 Ohio St.3d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 81,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=694%20N.E.2d%20442\">\n    694 N.E.2d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) (Emphasis sic). Under Civ.R. 23(B)(3)(c), concentrating this litigation as a single case in state court appears to be efficient, because common issues predominate, the real estate transactions at issue took place in Ohio, and violations of Ohio law are alleged. Finally, under Civ.R. 23(B)(3)(d), the trial court found that \"managing these claims as a class action - especially where the hypothetical alternative is thousands of individual lawsuits - does not present any special difficulties which make individual cases a superior means of accomplishing a just result.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Accordingly, we find that the trial court acted within its discretion by certifying this redefined class action, and HHSC's sole assigned error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   TIM McCORMACK, P.J., and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   SEAN C.
