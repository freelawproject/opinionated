CANNON, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Madison K. Cozzone, appeals from the October 17, 2017 order of the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas. Appellant raises issues pertaining to her sentence. For the following reasons, the trial court's judgment is affirmed in\n   part and reversed in part, and the matter is remanded for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant was previously employed as a pharmacy technician in a supermarket pharmacy. After the pharmacy received complaints from customers indicating their prescriptions for various strengths of Oxycodone/APAP did not contain the full amount of prescribed medication, the pharmacy surveillance footage was reviewed. The footage showed appellant tampering with customer prescriptions on September 27, October 8, and October 17, 2012. Appellant was questioned regarding the incidents and admitted to stealing Oxycodone/APAP and Xanax from customer prescriptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On December 7, 2012, appellant was indicted on three counts of Theft of Drugs, fourth-degree felonies in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(6), and one count of Aggravated Possession of Drugs, a fifth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A) and (C)(1)(a). Appellant entered a plea of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 28, 2013, appellant filed a motion requesting intervention in lieu of conviction. A hearing was held, and the court found appellant met the eligibility requirements and granted her motion pursuant to R.C. 2951.041. The court accepted appellant's guilty plea, found her guilty, and stayed all criminal proceedings against her. Appellant was ordered to serve three years of rehabilitation pursuant to her intervention plan and to comply with the conditions outlined by the court. The court notified appellant that she could be sentenced for a violation of intervention to 18 months in prison on each of Count 1, Count 2, and Count 3 and 12 months in prison on Count 4. The trial court stated Count 3 and Count 4 would merge for purposes of sentencing and also notified appellant regarding post-release control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On January 9, 2015, the Adult Probation Department filed a petition alleging appellant had violated the conditions of her intervention. Appellant had failed to report to her Supervising Officer on December 10, December 17, and December 31, 2014; failed to verify her chemical dependency treatment; and tested positive for opiates on December 19 and December 24, 2014. At a hearing on the petition, appellant admitted to the violations. The trial court ordered a presentence investigation report (\"PSI\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On July 10, 2015, the trial court sentenced appellant to a total of three years of community control sanctions. Appellant was ordered to serve six months of residential sanctions in the Geauga County Safety Center and up to six months in the NorthEast Ohio Community Alternative Program (\"NEOCAP\") with the balance of community control to be served as nonresidential sanctions. Appellant was further ordered to pay a fine and costs. The trial court notified appellant she faced a potential prison term of 66 months for a violation of community control sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After a review hearing, appellant was released from NEOCAP on January 14, 2016, and the trial court suspended her remaining period of incarceration in the Geauga County Safety Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On July 26, 2016, the Adult Probation Department filed a petition alleging appellant had violated the conditions of her community control. Appellant had overdosed on heroin on July 22, 2016. Appellant admitted to the violation at a hearing on the petition. Appellant was ordered to remain in the Geauga County Safety Center. The hearing was continued for appellant to be interviewed by a physician and later resumed on October 3, 2016. The trial court modified and extended appellant's community control for a total period of five years under the same conditions imposed\n   in its July 10, 2015 entry with the added condition that appellant would participate in the Lake-Geauga Recovery Centers' alcohol and drug program and follow all recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On May 16, 2017, the Adult Probation Department filed another petition alleging appellant had violated the conditions of community control. Appellant had overdosed on heroin on May 12, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On October 5, 2017, appellant filed a mitigation packet, including opioid treatment progress reports, medical records, an employment letter, and personal letters from appellant's family and friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} A hearing on the Adult Probation Department's petition was held on October 6, 2017. Appellant admitted to the community control violation. After finding appellant had violated her community control sanctions, the trial court merged Count 4 with Count 3 and sentenced appellant to a prison term of 18 months on each of Count 1, Count 2, and Count 3 to be served consecutively for a total prison term of 54 months with 380 days of jail-time credit. Regarding the imposition of consecutive sentences, the trial court stated the following at the hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I do find that consecutive service is necessary to protect the public from future crime on the part of this defendant and to punish this defendant. I also find that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the defendant's conduct and to the danger she poses to the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   And people may want to say, well, she's not hurting the public. Yes, she is. At the very least, again, she is stealing medication belonging to somebody else.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   And each call on an overdose where the emergency squads get to come and treat her is another time that that squad's unavailable to somebody who has a medical need that this defendant has chosen, albeit unwittingly because of addiction, to utilize those services for herself. So the public does need protection from her conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   And certainly her history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Appellant was notified of post-release control and the consequences for violating post-release control. The trial court further invited the parties to submit, after the sentence was journalized, written arguments addressing whether the amendments to R.C. 2929.15 were applicable to appellant's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The trial court's sentencing entry was filed October 17, 2017. The sentencing entry states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Pursuant to R.C. \u00a7 2929.14(C)(4), the Court finds that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime and to punish the offender and that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public, and that pursuant to \u00a7 R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(a), the offender committed one or more of the multiple offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or R.C. 2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under post-release control for a prior offense, and pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(c), the offender's history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We note the finding under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(a) included in the sentencing entry was not made at the sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On October 24, 2017, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of her sentence in response to the trial court's invitation to brief the issue of the applicability of R.C. 2929.15. Appellant maintained that under newly enacted R.C. 2929.15(B)(1)(c), the maximum prison term that could be imposed for a \"technical\" community control violation on a theft-related fourth-degree felony was 180 days per case. The state filed a response, arguing appellant's violation of community control was not \"technical\" in nature. On November 16, 2017, the trial court overruled appellant's motion, noting Ohio law does not provide for the filing of motions for reconsideration of sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant noticed a timely appeal from the trial court's October 17, 2017 sentencing entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant asserts three assignments of error on appeal. They state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [1.] The sentence imposed was not supported by the record and was contrary to law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [2.] The imposition of maximum consecutive sentences was not supported by the record and it is contrary to law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [3.] The trial court erred by not following the mandates of R.C. 2929.15.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Under appellant's first assignment of error, she argues her sentence is not supported by the record and is contrary to law because the trial court failed to consider the purposes and principles of felony sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11 and the sentencing factors in R.C. 2929.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"The court hearing an appeal [of a felony sentence] shall review the record, including the findings underlying the sentence or modification given by the sentencing court.\" R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). \"The appellate court may increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a sentence that is appealed under this section or may vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing * * * if it clearly and convincingly finds * * * (a) [t]hat the record does not support the sentencing court's findings under division * * * (C)(4) of section 2929.14, or * * * (b) [t]hat the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\" R.C. 2953.08(G)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 18} \" 'A sentence is contrary to law if (1) the sentence falls outside the statutory range for the particular degree of offense, or (2) the trial court failed to consider the purposes and principles of felony sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11 and the sentencing factors in R.C. 2929.12.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, after merging Count 4 with Count 3, the trial court's imposition of a prison term of 18 months on each of Count 1, Count 2, and Count 3 is within the statutory range. The trial court did not explicitly state it considered R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12 when it imposed appellant's sentence; however, we presume a trial court considered R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12 from a silent record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court also heard from a representative of the Lake-Geauga Recovery Centers. The trial court heard from the prosecutor, who stated: \"Your, Honor, in reviewing the history of supervision that was provided to the state * * * I'm at a loss I suppose for what else I can recommend to this Court other than a period of incarceration, more specifically prison.\" Finally, the trial court reviewed appellant's history of violating community control in the present case. The trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [I]n imposing sentence I have to take into account her conduct. And, again, the overdoses are how she got caught.

The trial court's invitation to brief the potential applicability of R.C. 2929.15 to this case does not change the fact that it had already imposed a final judgment of sentence. Accordingly, we will not consider appellant's third assignment of error as it pertains to her motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 35} We consider appellant's third assignment of error only to the extent she argues her sentence was not imposed in accordance with R.C. 2929.15(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Appellant argues her community control violation was \"technical\" in nature and that, therefore, under newly enacted R.C. 2929.15(B), the maximum prison term that could be imposed for the violation was 180 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 37} R.C. 2929.15(B) provides the penalties a trial court may impose upon an offender for a violation of community control sanctions.

R.C. 2929.15 states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (B)(1) If the conditions of a community control sanction are violated or if the offender violates a law or leaves the state without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (c) A prison term on the offender pursuant to section 2929.14 of the Revised Code and division (B)(3) of this section, provided that a prison term imposed under this division is subject to the following limitations, as applicable:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (ii) If the prison term is imposed for any technical violation of the conditions of a community control sanction imposed for a felony of the fourth degree that is not an offense of violence and is not a sexually oriented offense or for any violation of law committed while under a community control sanction imposed for such a felony that consists of a new criminal offense and that is not a felony, the prison term shall not exceed one hundred eighty days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 38} The General Assembly has not defined \"technical\" under R.C. 2929.15.
