Santanello counterclaimed, alleging that MAG's failure to properly supervise and manage the construction breached the parties' agreement and violated R.C. 1345.01 et seq., the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (\"OCSPA\"). After a bench trial, the trial court found that both parties had breached the agreement and dismissed the OCSPA claim. The trial court concluded that Santanello owed MAG $224,270.68 and offset that amount by $160,000 that MAG owed to Santanello, resulting in a net award of $64,270.68 due to MAG. The parties cross-appealed. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On January 22, 2004, MAG and Santanello entered into a written contract governing the architectural design and construction of a 5,800 square foot home, as well as a \"stable with riding arena, sitework, pond, tennis court and outdoor pool,\" for an estimated total cost of $1.6 million. Patrick Manley, MAG's owner and architect, sent the agreement to Santanello, along with a cover letter that explained the cost saving option of having MAG operate as the \"construction manager\" instead of hiring a general contractor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The enclosed information is representative of our residential proposals, and includes all the services normally required to properly complete the project. As we discussed, a typical architectural and engineering fee for a luxury home seems to fall in the range of 10-15% of the cost of construction. This is for a full set of services and would include managing the bidding and site visits during construction. My quotation for your home is well under that amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Regarding the construction management portion, we would work directly for you bidding out to the subcontractors and suppliers on your behalf, and managing the entire construction process. The advantage to this is we can typically save you approximately 10% to 12% over the cost of a general contractor. Added benefits are we have more involvement in the details from start to finish, you have access to all of the subcontractor bids and we can make sure the construction is performed properly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Several provisions of the contract detailed the option of having MAG operate as the construction manager. The architect's \"scope of services\" included the following two provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Bidding Phase\n   </strong>\n   (Not required under Construction Management contract)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Provide Owner with a list of bidders who perform this type of work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Meet with prospective bidders to explain design.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Answer questions from bidders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Distribute drawings and other related information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Construction Administration Phase\n   </strong>\n   (Not required under Construction Management contract)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Phone support for owner and contractor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Assist in resolving on-site problems, conflicts and unknown conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   As-needed site visits during construction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Review shop drawings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Review contractor's payment requests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The architect's maximum fee was capped at 8.0 percent to 9.5 percent of the total construction cost. The \"bidding phase\" and \"construction administration phase\" services were included, and were not to exceed 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent of the total construction cost, respectively. However, if the \"construction management\" option were chosen, those services were deleted from the architect's fee, reducing it to a maximum of 6.0 percent to 7.5 percent of the total construction fee. Instead, 10 percent of the total construction cost was imposed for construction management:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Construction Management Fee\n   </strong>\n   : 10% of Construction Cost*\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   *Typical mark-up on material, equipment and labor, by custom remodeling homebuilders acting as General Contractor, normally runs between 20% to 25% of construction cost. Net savings on project, using construction management approach should save 10%-15% overall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The agreement also contained a provision governing payment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Progress payments shall be made to the architect at the completion of each phase, or for services rendered at the end of each month, whichever occurs first. * * * In the unlikely event either party shall breach this agreement, the party at fault shall be responsible for all attorney's fees and expenses of the other party. Invoices shall be due and payable 30 days from the date of the invoice. Finance charges after the due date shall be 1\u00bd% per month (18% per annum).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Mar. 1, 2016 Mot. of Def. for Partial Summ. Jgmt.; Aff. of Steven A. Santanello, Ex. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 6} During construction, problems arose with the barn roof leaking and the water height in the pond, and Santanello stopped paying invoices submitted by MAG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 7} A number of years after construction was finished, MAG sued Santanello for the unpaid fees. The first complaint that MAG filed stated causes of action for breach of contract, quantum meruit and unjust enrichment, but the latter two claims were time barred and omitted from an amended complaint. (May 28, 2015 Compl.; June 24, 2015 Am. Compl.) Santanello filed counterclaims for breach of contract, alleging that MAG had breached its obligation to properly oversee the construction of the pond and barn. (July 13, 2015 Answer.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The matter proceeded to a bench trial held on August 22-25, 2016, after which the trial court issued a decision stating\n   findings of fact and conclusions of law. In its decision, the trial court stated that the term \"construction management\" in the parties' agreement was ambiguous because \"the [parties'] exact expectations\" regarding its scope were \"only loosely defined.\" (Nov. 18, 2016 Decision at 2.) Thus, the trial court considered both the contents of the cover letter and the language of the parties' agreement to interpret the term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The trial court emphasized MAG's statement in the cover letter that, as construction manager, it would be able to \"make sure the construction is performed properly.\" (Decision at 3.) After reviewing several cases construing the term, the trial court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Considering all the evidence, including the credibility of the witnesses, this court finds that the construction management role these parties mutually agreed upon did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   make Manley Architecture Group an insurer of the work of trade contractors such as the contractor who erected the barn and leaking roof. Manley Architecture Group did not obligate itself to, in essence, warrant or guarantee that all work by others would be \"performed properly.\" Fairly read, the written contract documents made that clear to Dr. Santanello. Moreover, privity of contract ran between Dr. Santanello and individual contractors, even though Mr. Manley made some of the contracts as \"agent\" for Dr. Santanello. Because each contractor hired by Dr. Santanello remained responsible for their own performance, and any deficiencies in the work, ultimate responsibility for enforcing that work rested on the owner not Manley Architecture Group.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Nevertheless, because Manley Architecture Group assumed the overarching role of \"construction manager,\" the parties plainly did contemplate that Manley would actively monitor ongoing work. * * * When problems arose, these parties agreed that Manley Architecture Group would alert Dr. Santanello in a timely manner. Practically speaking, if a contractor was not performing work as called for in the plans and specifications properly, Dr. Santanello had a right to expect notice from Manley so that the doctor could pursue appropriate remedial action with the contractor in question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Emphasis sic.) (Decision at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After setting forth this interpretation, the trial court made the following rulings on the parties' claims. First, the trial court addressed MAG's claims for unpaid services under the parties' agreement. The trial court noted that the parties had stipulated that MAG had paid $55,577.68 to vendors for which it had not been reimbursed. The trial court found that an additional $27,179 in \"architect design fees\" for a racquetball court, a gazebo, and \"construction management fees\" were unpaid. (Decision at 5.) This amounted to \"$82,756.68 for unpaid but earned professional fees and unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred\" by MAG.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After calculating the interest rate for finance charges stated in the parties' agreement, the trial court concluded that MAG was owed a $141,514, for a total of $224,270.68. (Decision at 5 &amp; 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Second, the trial court found that MAG did not breach its obligation when building the pond because it \"was never mutually intended by the parties to be leak-proof, or to always maintain an essentially static water level as Dr. Santanello now desires.\" (Decision at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Third, the trial court ruled on Santanello's counterclaim concerning the construction of the barn roof. After receiving an estimate to construct the barn and its roof for $265,000, Santanello hired Bill Williams to perform the construction without\n   a written contract. The trial court found that MAG's architectural plans for the barn and roof were adequate. Williams used a proprietary manufactured barn roof system when constructing the barn. After installation, the roof immediately began to leak through a long valley in the roof and into an apartment in the upper level of the barn. In addition, flashing was installed incorrectly and vents specified in the drawings were missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The trial court noted that Andy Raile, an expert witness who had examined the roof, testified that it was \"not repairable and cannot be made fully watertight without complete removal and replacement.\" (Decision at 7-8.) The trial court made the following findings and rulings concerning Manley's performance and MAG's liability for the roof:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Initial installation of the barn roof occurred in August-September 2004. Mr. Manley testified that this roof was installed very, very quickly. Mr. Manley further acknowledged that getting up on a high roof like this one was not one of his favorite things to do. Perhaps due to the speed of initial installation, or the fact that getting up on a high roof made Mr. Manley uncomfortable, Manley Architecture Group did not closely inspect and monitor barn roof installation. Only after leaks began to appear did Manley closely examine the roof work, which is now conceded to have been deficiently done by Williams' crew.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Although Dr. Santanello was his own general contractor, and although Manley Architecture Group had recommended against even hiring Williams for the work because they thought his proposed contract price was too low, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Manley Architecture Group itself fell short of its construction management responsibilities in monitoring installation of the barn roof. Mr. Manley did not perform (or have performed by some other person more comfortable working at height) any contemporaneous close-hand inspection as the roof was installed. Once the roof was completed and closed up, even Mr. Manley conceded that it was exceedingly difficult to go back and figure out why there were leaks, or precisely identify where they were located. More attention ought to have been given to these practicalities by Manley Architecture Group as the roof work was still being performed, because serious discrepancies in the roof would have been readily apparent to a trained observer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The preponderance of evidence established that, in 2006 dollars, complete replacement of the barn roof would have cost roughly $120,000. With inflation, that figure is roughly $160,000 in 2016 prices. Recognizing Manley Architecture Group was not a guarantor of work by Williams, it nevertheless had construction management obligations that were not met. The lack of thorough, timely inspection by Manley allowed Williams' substandard work to escape detection when, had work been checked, correction of deficient work would have been much easier and less costly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"To recover upon a breach of contract claim, a plaintiff must prove 'the existence of a contract, performance by the plaintiff, breach by the defendant, and damage or loss to the plaintiff.' \"\n   <em>\n    Jarupan v.

After offsetting that amount against the damages award to MAG on its breach of contract claim, the trial court concluded that a net of $64,270.68 was due to MAG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Fourth, the trial court dismissed Santanello's claim under the OCSPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The parties filed cross-appeals concerning the trial court's award of damages to MAG under the agreement and the damages awarded for the barn roof. The rulings concerning the pond and MAG's OCSPA claim were not appealed. Santanello asserts the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   I. The trial court incorrectly applied the set off in 2016 as the damages giving rise to the set off occurred when the roof was installed in 2004. The court erred in not concluding that the set off should occur on the first date that Appellant [Santanello] suffered damage (2004) when the barn roof first began to leak.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   II. The trial court erred in its finding that defendant owed plaintiff $55,557.68 for reimbursement of monies advanced by plaintiff/appellee because defendant/appellant was not contractually obligated to pay such sums under the contract between appellant and appellee and the court indicated that it was not making the damage award based upon [claims of] quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 16} MAG asserts the following cross-assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A. The court erred when it allowed a set-off for the barn roof; any deficiency in the installation should have been borne by the roofing subcontractor and the general contractor, Defendant Santanello, not Mr. Manley.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   B. The court erred when it calculated the barn roof set-off at $160,000. There was testimony that the amount of the set off should have been significantly less because the entire roof did not need to be replaced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   C. The court erred when it determined that the amount of the set-off was $160,000 because Defendant Santanello failed to mitigate his damages and seek redress with the barn roof contractor; instead he used the barn roof for ten years without making any repairs and only raised the issue of a complete barn roof replacement when Mr. Manley brought claims for breach of contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   D. The court erred when it did not allow a reduction in the amount of the set-off for the use and enjoyment of the roof by Dr. Santanello.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   E. The court erred when it found that there should be a set-off because the evidence showed that Defendant Santanello breached the contract first, thereby relieving Plaintiff of any contractual obligation whatsoever.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 17} For the reasons discussed below, we sustain Santanello's second assignment of error and MAG's first cross-assignment of error.

Assn.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Here, the parties' agreement contemplated two potential roles for MAG and Manley. Under the first option, the project would use a general contractor, and Manley would perform \"construction administration\" duties and oversee bidding. Under the other option, which Santanello opted for, Manley was the project's \"construction manager.\" With this option, Santanello operated as his own general contractor and enjoyed a reduction in certain expenses. This option deleted the \"bidding\" and \"construction administration\" fees and purported to save the homeowner 10 to 15 percent over the typical cost of construction managed by a third party general contractor. With Santanello in that role,\n   MAG charged a flat 10 percent fee for Manley to perform \"construction management\" services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 23} As the trial court noted, both MAG's breach of contract claim and Santanello's counterclaim concern the scope of the \"construction management\" services under the agreement. The first question is whether this role authorized MAG to advance fees to subcontractors after Santanello refused to pay them and then hold Santanello liable for those advances. It is undisputed that Santanello operated as his own general contractor. As the trial court stated, \"privity of contract ran between Dr. Santanello and individual contractors,\" as he was the one who actually hired them. (Nov. 18, 2016 Decision at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 24} However, our de novo review of the contract reveals no provision that obligated Santanello to pay MAG for fees advanced to subcontractors that Santanello had refused to pay. The trial court simply stated that it found \"by a preponderance of the evidence that [Manley] was not paid the full amount due under the parties' contract,\" with no mention of what provision of the contract Santanello breached by failing to reimburse Manley for the $55,577 in advances to trade contractors. (Decision at 5.) The trial court simply referred to \"unpaid but earned professional fees and unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses\" as the basis for the award.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=667%20N.E.2d%20949\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The agreement's description of \"reimbursable expenses,\" which includes \"[b]lueprints, mileage, faxes, etc. estimated at: $2,000.00\" cannot be read to reflect an intent to include advances to subcontractors for building fees totaling tens of thousands of dollars.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Aff. of Steven A. Santanello, Ex.

(Nov. 18, 2016 Decision at 2.) It is acceptable, of course, to consult extrinsic evidence to determine the meaning of an ambiguous contract term or provision. \"A court will resort to extrinsic evidence in its effort to give effect to the parties' intentions only where the language is unclear or ambiguous, or where the circumstances surrounding the agreement invest the language of the contract with a special meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Kelly v.

However, in this case, the cover letter contains no language suggesting that the parties intended to authorize MAG to advance fees that Santanello had refused to pay:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Regarding the construction management portion, we would work directly for you bidding out to the subcontractors and suppliers on your behalf, and managing the entire construction process. The advantage to this is we can typically save you approximately 10% to 12% over the cost of a general contractor. Added benefits are we have more involvement in the details from start to finish, you have access to all of the subcontractor bids and we can make sure the construction is performed properly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In addition to the agreement itself not providing a basis for authorizing such advances, Manley himself testified that when making the advances, he was not operating under the agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   But I, in turn, in order to keep the project moving and to finish the project, you know, even though I had no obligation to do so, I paid a lot of these contractors and suppliers because I felt that it was unfair to them to hold money back like this on people who had done such a good job and really didn't have much more to finish. That they needed to get paid because I was really afraid we were going to lose these contractors and the project was just going to come to a grinding halt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   (Aug. 22, 2016 Tr. Vol. I at 150.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Manley also testified that Santanello \"didn't want to pay certain things because certain contractors weren't done. And I thought it was withholding too much money.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 151.) Manley felt that \"ultimately, [Santanello's withholding] went on so long and there were a couple of liens that were filed against the property.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 151-52.) Manley testified that because there were \"contractors that didn't want to cooperate because they weren't getting paid,\" he \"made the decision on [his] own to start to pay some of these people just to get them back to finish the work.\" (Tr. Vol. I at 152.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Manley's testimony demonstrates that he wanted the project to be completed and was concerned about his working relationship with the subcontractors. However, by creating an agreement that allowed a homeowner with no experience in construction to function as his own general contractor, he ran the risk that Santanello might decide to withhold payment to subcontractors on the project. In return, MAG was able to offer a contract with a reduced rate as a selling point. \"It is not the responsibility or function of this court to rewrite the parties' contract in order to provide for a more equitable result.\"\n   <em>\n    Hope Academy Broadway Campus\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. \"A contract 'does not become ambiguous by reason of the fact that in its operation it will work a hardship upon one of the parties thereto.' \"\n   <em>\n    Foster Wheeler Enviresponse v.

Although Manley appears to have operated with the best of intentions, the agreement between him and Santanello did not give him the authority to unilaterally decide that Santanello had withheld \"too much money\" from subcontractors, pay them, and then sue Santanello for those advances. As the existence of the liens shows, a remedy existed for the dispute between Santanello and the subcontractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 29} For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred when it construed the agreement to allow Manley or MAG the authority to advance monies to the subcontractors and subsequently recover those advances from Santanello. Accordingly, Santanello's first assignment of error is sustained, and the amount of damages awarded to MAG is reduced to $27,179 for the fees for \"architect design\" and \"contract management,\" plus prejudgment interest of 18 percent, as the contract contemplated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 30} We now turn to MAG's first cross-assignment of error, which asserts that the trial court erred by allowing a set-off in the amount of damages for the amount of a new barn roof, based on its determination that MAG breached its\n   \"construction management\" responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 31} As an initial matter, we agree with the trial court's interpretation of the scope of those responsibilities. The trial court emphasized MAG's assurance in the cover letter accompanying the agreement that it would \"make sure the construction is performed properly.\" (Nov. 18, 2016 Decision at 3.) The trial court did not construe this statement as a warranty or \"guarantee\" covering the work of the subcontractors. (Decision at 4.) MAG was not \"an insurer of the work of trade contracts such as the contractor who erected the barn and leaking roof.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=864%20N.E.2d%2068\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, \"each contractor hired by Dr. Santanello remained responsible for their own performance, and any deficiencies in the work, ultimate responsibility for enforcing that work rested on the owner, not Manley Architecture Group.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=864%20N.E.2d%2068\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 32} We also agree with the trial court's observation that when the parties agreed that MAG would perform \"the overarching role of 'construction manager,' the parties plainly did contemplate that Manley would actively monitor ongoing work.\" (Decision at 4.) Thus, it was MAG's responsibility to \"alert Dr. Santanello in a timely manner\" when problems arose during construction, \"so that the doctor could pursue appropriate remedial action with the contractor in question.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=864%20N.E.2d%2068\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Nevertheless, the trial court's reasonable definition of MAG's construction management responsibilities cannot be reconciled with its ultimate determination that MAG breached them. The trial court ruled that MAG breached \"its construction management responsibilities in monitoring installation of the barn roof\" and did not \"monitor [the] barn roof installation.\" (Decision at 8.) Santanello testified that he knew about the leaking roof \"soon after it was essentially completed,\" at which time Manley \"worked hard at trying to figure out what the problem was.\" (Aug. 22, 2016 Tr. Vol. III at 36-37.) At that point, Williams was still working on building the barn, and Manley \"tried an attempt at once\" to have Williams fix the roof. (Tr. Vol. III at 37.) Santanello testified that Manley then hired a different roofing company \"to look at it\" and make non-structural repairs to the roof. (Tr. Vol. III at 37-38.) Santanello's own testimony demonstrates that Manley performed the \"construction management\" responsibilities as the parties had intended under the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 34} By ruling that MAG was liable to Santanello for the entire cost of replacing the roof, the trial court essentially made MAG a guarantor of the roof installer, in spite of the fact that its definition of construction management expressly stated that MAG was not a guarantor for the work of the subcontractors. This ruling imposed a more stringent set of responsibilities on MAG than the trial court's own definition required. Accordingly, we sustain MAG's first cross-assignment of error, reverse the trial court's ruling in favor of Santanello on the counterclaim for breach of contract arising from the barn roof, and vacate the $160,000 in damages awarded to Santanello.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Under our de novo review of the parties' agreement, the scope of MAG's \"construction management\" role did not authorize MAG to recover for advances to subcontractors, nor did it make MAG the guarantor of each subcontractor's work. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part. The judgment is affirmed as to the $27,179 in unpaid architectural fees and prejudgment interest that Santanello has not appealed, but is reversed regarding the $55,577.68\n   advanced by MAG to subcontractors and the $160,000 for the replacement of the barn roof. Thus, we sustain Santanello's second assignment of error and MAG's first cross-assignment of error, and render all other assignments of error as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   BROWN, P.J. and LUPER SCHUSTER, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The unpaid amount of $27,179 earned architectural fees for the racquetball court and the gazebo are not in dispute on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
