Weaver appeals the judgment entered by the Muskingum County Common Pleas Court dismissing her petition for postconviction relief without a hearing. Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} During the spring of 2015, Appellant was a student at Muskingum University, residing in a campus sorority house on Lakeside Drive in New Concord. She denied and covered up the fact she was pregnant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On April 22, 2015, Appellant went into a bathroom in the sorority house and, without assistance, delivered a daughter, Addison Grace Weaver. The baby was delivered into the toilet. While bleeding profusely, Appellant delivered the placenta, cut the umbilical cord, and pulled the baby out of the toilet. She then placed the placenta and the baby in a small pail that was in the bathroom. She thereupon left the bathroom and rested on a couch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At some point, Appellant returned to the bathroom with a garbage bag and placed the baby, the placenta, paper towels, and some of her clothing inside the bag. She carried the bag to the side door of the sorority house and placed it outside, next to a garbage can. After this, she went back inside the house to lie down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Later that day, two sorority members found the bag lying next to the house. They tore a hole in the bag, saw the baby, and called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} After first responders came to the scene, paramedics asked Appellant if she was the mother of the baby found outside. Appellant responded she was not the baby's mother. Appellant was also interviewed the same night by Detective Todd Mahle of the Muskingum County Sheriff's Office. The interview took place from 10:26 p.m. until 3:46 a.m. in a break room at the Muskingum University Police building. Appellant eventually detailed to the detective the events which had occurred earlier in the day, although she presented different versions as to whether Addison was born alive. Detective Mahle did not utilize any recording equipment during the interview. At Mahle's request, Appellant returned the next day at about noon to provide a recorded statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} An autopsy was subsequently performed on Addison. The results showed she had been born alive, but had died of asphyxiation. Tr. at 347, 350, 382.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On July 22, 2015, Appellant was indicted by the Muskingum County Grand Jury on one count of aggravated murder, one count of gross abuse of a corpse, and two counts of tampering with evidence. The case proceeded to a jury trial commencing on May 10, 2016. Appellant was found guilty on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} At sentencing, the trial court merged the two tampering-with-evidence counts and imposed a one-year prison sentence on said offense. The trial court further imposed a three-year prison sentence for gross abuse of a corpse. It ordered these sentences to run consecutively to each other and to the sentence for aggravated murder. Finally, the trial court imposed life in prison without parole for the offense of aggravated murder. In support of its sentencing decision, the trial court concluded appellant was not remorseful, she had committed \"the worst form of the offense,\" and she had caused emotional hardship to her sorority sisters. Sentencing Tr. at 10-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant filed an appeal to this Court raising four assignments of error: the trial court erred in imposing a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, the sentence is disproportionate to her conduct, the court erred in imposing consecutive sentences, and the conviction of gross abuse of a corpse was not supported by sufficient evidence. We found we were without statutory authority to review the sentence for aggravated murder, and therefore overruled Appellant's first two assignments of error on the basis of lack of appellate jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    State v. Weaver\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Muskingum,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12550076\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/93/178/\">\n    2017-Ohio-4374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12550076\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/93/178/\">\n    93 N.E.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We overruled her remaining assignments of error on the merits and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant filed a postconviction petition on August 25, 2017, an amended petition on September 5, 2017, and a second-amended petition on September 6, 2017. The State filed its response on September 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In her petition, Appellant alleged counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence concerning neonaticide in mitigation of sentence. She attached to her petition an affidavit of Dr. Clara Lewis, and an article by Michelle Oberman discussing neonaticide, including sentencing data. In her affidavit, Dr. Lewis, who is a professor at Stanford University, stated she read the transcript and docket from Appellant's trial. She also reviewed news media coverage of the case and social media posts available from Appellant and her friends. In addition, she conducted a personal interview with Appellant on August 23, 2017. The affidavit stated in her expert opinion, Appellant's case is a typical example of contemporary neonaticide, her sentence is disproportionately harsh when compared to sentences given to others convicted of the crime, and the defense failed to introduce relevant information about the social and cultural causes of neonaticide, which would have provided context for understanding the crime and established mitigation. In her affidavit and her attached report, Dr. Lewis explained how immaturity, social isolation, the insistence of her ex-boyfriend on secrecy during the pregnancy and the actions of her sorority sisters reinforcing her denial of the pregnancy caused Appellant to shut down and become deeply fearful. Dr. Lewis also noted in her affidavit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Birth takes hours. It is a painful and noisy process. Doing it alone, in silence, in a shared bathroom speaks to Emile's abject terror, as well as to her belief that she had no one she could trust. Anyone might have averted this outcome by offering to help. Instead, she was left alone. Lewis affidavit, \u00b6 15.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In the report attached to her affidavit, Lewis further explained while many find it impossible to understand how and why a woman can commit the act of infanticide, psychiatrists explain there's a profile: \"Women who commit neonaticide tend to be immature, isolated, worried about the judgment of others on issues ranging from sex to abortion to unwed motherhood.\" Research reveals women who commit neonaticide, including Appellant, receive no prenatal care, suffer from pregnancy denial, make no plans for their labor or delivery, and labor alone on toilets without medical care. When the baby arrives denial shatters and panic ensues. The crimes are not carefully planned, but rather are \"poorly concealed acts of desperation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Dr. Lewis expressed the loss of the newborn's life is a tragedy for which Appellant deserved to be punished, but in her expert opinion, had the existing body of research on neonaticide been brought to bear on Appellant's sentence, it would have demonstrated substantial grounds to mitigate her individual culpability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The trial court dismissed the petition without a hearing. The court found Appellant's argument of ineffective assistance was barred by res judicata, as it could have been raised on direct appeal. The court further noted prior to trial Appellant was found competent to stand trial, and sane at the time she committed the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} It is from the September 28, 2017 judgment dismissing her petition for postconviction relief Appellant prosecutes her appeal, assigning as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED EMILE WEAVER'S POSTCONVICTION PETITION WITHOUT A HEARING.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} When a defendant files a postconviction petition pursuant to R.C. 2953.21, the trial court must grant an evidentiary hearing unless it determines the files and records of the case show the petitioner is not entitled to relief. R.C. 2953.21(F). A trial court may also dismiss a petition for postconviction relief without holding a hearing when the doctrine of res judicata bars the claims raised in the petition.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because decisions denying such petitions involve both factual and legal questions, we apply a mixed question of law and fact standard of review to determine whether the petition states substantive grounds for relief. See\n   <em>\n    Harrington, supra\n   </em>\n   . Thus, we review the trial court's decision on factual issues using a manifest weight standard of review, and we review the trial court's decision on legal issues on a de novo basis. See\n   <em>\n    Hoffner, supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19}\n   <em>\n    In re B.C.S.\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist.

This is a question of law, and therefore we review the decision de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 21} \"Generally, the introduction in an R.C. 2953.21 petition of evidence\n   <em>\n    dehors\n   </em>\n   the record of ineffective assistance of counsel is sufficient, if not to mandate a hearing, at least to avoid dismissal on the basis of res judicata.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, we find the affidavit of Dr. Lewis and her attached report do constitute evidence outside the record. Dr. Lewis reviewed the case and conducted a personal interview with Appellant. Her affidavit and report are not simply a critique of the sentence, but rather explain neonaticide in general and as applied to Appellant. She further elaborates on the effect of the failure of counsel to present evidence concerning current research on neonaticide in mitigation of Appellant's sentence. Appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relies on evidence outside the record, and therefore could not have been presented on direct appeal. The court erred in finding the claim barred by res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We also find the court erred in suggesting the claim is barred by res judicata because Appellant was found competent to stand trial, and found to be sane at the time of the offense. Evidence of neonaticide presented in mitigation of sentencing is not governed by the same legal standard required to demonstrate a person is incompetent to stand trial or not responsible for their actions due to insanity at the time of the offense. In fact, Dr. Lewis specifically stated Appellant should be punished for her crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Finally, while the court also notes the same mitigation argument was made on direct appeal, we held on direct appeal we lacked jurisdiction to consider either the propriety or the proportionality of the sentence pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(D)(3).\n   <em>\n    State v.

Tr. 15-16.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The affidavit and report of Dr. Clara Lewis submitted with Appellant's petition for postconviction relief explained the psychiatric and cultural issues surrounding neonaticide far beyond counsel's casual mention at the sentencing hearing, and provided information to contextualize the same actions which the court used to support the sentence of life without possibility of parole. The evidence is directly in contravention of the arguments of the State accepted by the judge in imposing the harshest sentence available for the offense. We find the evidence submitted with Appellant's petition meets the threshold level of cogency to defeat a claim of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 32} We conclude the court erred as a matter of law in dismissing the petition without a hearing on the basis of res judicata. The assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The judgment of the Muskingum County Common Pleas is reversed. This case is remanded to that court with instructions to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Appellant's petition for postconviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Wise, John, P.J. and Baldwin, J. concur\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
