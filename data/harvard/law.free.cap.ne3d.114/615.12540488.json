GRENDELL, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Petitioner-appellant, Antoinette Tredanary, appeals an award of attorney fees from the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division. The issue before this court is whether a court may avoid holding a hearing on a motion for sanctions pursuant to R.C. 2323.51 and Civil Rule 11 where the court determines such a hearing would be burdensome for the parties. For the following reasons, we reverse the decision of the court below and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On July 19, 2017, Tredanary filed a Petition for Domestic Violence Civil Protection Order ( R.C. 3113.31 ) alleging that the respondent-appellee, Daniel Fritz, had committed acts of domestic violence against their son.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Civil Protection Order was issued ex parte allocating to Tredanary \"temporary possession of the protected child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On August 17, 2017, following the full hearing on the Petition mandated by Civil Rule 65.1, a Magistrate's Order issued, dismissing the Petition and terminating the ex parte Order as Tredanary failed to meet her burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On August 29, 2017, Tredanary filed Objections to the Magistrate's Decision with a Request for Leave to Supplement these Objections once the Transcript of the Hearing is Prepared. The domestic relations court granted Tredanary until September 29, 2017, to file the transcript and supplemental objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 15, 2017, Fritz filed a Motion for Attorney Fees and Expenses pursuant to R.C. 2323.51 and a Motion for Sanctions pursuant to Civil Rule 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 25, 2017, a Magistrate's Order issued, ruling that \"the respondent's motions shall be set for hearing, once the petitioner's objections have been decided.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 23, 2017, the domestic relations court adopted the August 17 Magistrate's Order and overruled Tredanary's Objections. The court noted that Tredanary failed to file a transcript of supplementary objections and, inasmuch as \"the Petitioner's objection is fact based, said objection cannot be considered without a transcript.\" With respect to Fritz' Motions for Attorney Fees and Sanctions, the court ruled: \"Counsel for the Respondent is ordered to file by November 9, 2017, her affidavit of fees and companion billing invoice detailing the legal services provided in the instant case for the Court's consideration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On November 3, 2017, counsel for Fritz submitted an Affidavit of Reasonable\n   Attorney Fees and Costs in the amount of $3,690.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On November 27, 2017, the domestic relations court awarded Fritz attorney fees in the amount of $3,690. The court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court finds a hearing on the Respondent's August 29, 2017 Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs will only increase the attorney fees incurred by both parties. Such a hearing would be burdensome for both parties and inequitable as to the Respondent. The Petitioner has had over 21 days to file a response to the Respondent's fee affidavit and chose not to do so. The Court finds the fee affidavit of Respondent's counsel as to the fees incurred herein reasonable and equitable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On December 27, 2017, Tredanary filed a Notice of Appeal. On appeal, she raises the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"[1.] The trial court committed error in awarding attorney fees without a hearing after specifically ordering that a hearing would be held on that issue, the motion for fees not timely filed to begin with.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} It has generally been held that a trial court is required to hold a hearing when sanctions are imposed under R.C. 2323.51 or Civil Rule 11.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Although Tredanary did not respond to Fritz' Affidavit of Reasonable Attorney Fees and Costs, the expectation that the matter would be set for an evidentiary hearing was reasonable in light of the statutory mandate, case law interpreting the Rule, and the magistrate's statement that the matter would be set for hearing \"once the petitioner's objections have been decided.\" Furthermore, we are aware of no case law holding that the hearing on sanctions may be dispensed with to avoid burdening the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} We must also address Tredanary's argument that Fritz' Motion violated Lake County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, Local Rule 17 which provides that \"[p]arties must file a motion for attorney fees or expenses no later than seven days before the hearing on the issue that gives rise to the request for the fees,\" and that the failure to do so \"shall result in the Court's denial of the motion for attorney fees or expenses.\" Local Rules 17.01(A) and 17.02. Tredanary notes that Fritz' September 15, 2017 Motion was filed 49 days after the July 28, 2017 hearing on the Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Tredanary's argument is meritless. As Fritz notes, this court has often recognized that \"the enforcement of local rules is a matter within the discretion of the court promulgating the rules, and a violation of a local rule is generally insufficient support for a reversal.\"\n   <em>\n    Iacampo v.
