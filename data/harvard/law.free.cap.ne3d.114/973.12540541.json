The doctrine of present execution authorizes appellate review of <em>interlocutory</em> orders of the trial court in certain narrowly limited circumstances, see, e.g., <em>Patel</em> v. <em>Martin</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12538193\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/111/1082/#p32\">481 Mass. 29</extracted-citation>, 32, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12538193\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/111/1082/#p32\">111 N.E.3d 1082</extracted-citation> (2018), and has no applicability to an appeal from a final judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion type=\"majority\"><p id=\"p-7\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"1030\" href=\"#p1030\" id=\"p1030\">**1030</a>Kyl V. Myrick appeals from a judgment of the county court denying, without a hearing, his petition for relief in the nature of mandamus. In his petition, Myrick sought an order directing the Appeals Court to recall the rescript that it issued after affirming, in an unpublished decision, a final judgment of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Myrick</em> v. <em>Harvard Univ</em>., <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201109\">91 Mass.

Contrary to Myrick's suggestion, the fact that he had a separate appeal pending here in no way barred him from pursuing the ordinary process by applying for further appellate review.</p><p id=\"p-9\">In sum, Myrick has not demonstrated any entitlement to relief in the nature of mandamus.
