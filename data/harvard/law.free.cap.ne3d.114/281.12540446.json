Alysha asserts that the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code mandate an award of attorney fees here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Based on the plain language of R.C. 5321.15(C), as well as a consideration of persuasive case law interpreting it, we agree that an award was mandatory upon the court's finding that the landlords wrongfully evicted her under R.C. 5321.15(A). We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the cause for a determination of the amount of reasonable attorney fees due her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In November 2015, Alysha filed a complaint alleging claims of constructive eviction/breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, assault and battery, conversion, trespass, and civil conspiracy to commit trespass against her landlords. Alysha alleged that Rose Conner owned a mobile home located on Leonard Conner's land. In April 2014, she began living at the home with Rose Conner's consent after subsequently reaching an agreement that Alysha would pay the trailer's finance payment. She claimed that the landlords forced her to move from the home after they had utilities shut off. Alysha requested compensatory and punitive damages, as well as an award of attorney fees. The landlords filed an answer denying Alysha's allegations and set forth a counterclaim for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After a bench trial the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the landlords constructively evicted Alysha from the leased premises on or about August 2, 2014, about two weeks before she was supposed to move out. The court concluded that the landlords were jointly and severally liable to Alysha for damages on her first claim for relief and ordered it be submitted initially to mediation. The court also found in favor of the landlords on Alysha's remaining claims and for Alysha on the landlords' counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After mediation failed to resolve the case, the parties submitted post-trial briefs on the issue of damages. The trial court entered a judgment awarding Alysha \"nominal inferred damages\" of $100 for the constructive eviction, and special damages of $1,000, plus post-judgment interest. The court did not award Alysha any attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Alysha assigns the following error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO AWARD TO THE APPELLANT HER REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES INCURRED TO SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE AND [sic] ACTION PURSUANT TO R.C. 5321.15.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The dispositive issue is whether R.C. 5321.15(C) requires an award of reasonable attorney fees once a landlord is found under subdivision (A) to have wrongfully excluded a tenant from residential premises. The interpretation of this statute presents a question of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart v.

Chapter 5321 authorizes the award of attorney fees to a tenant for a landlord's retaliatory conduct ( R.C. 5321.02(B) ), unlawful entry ( R.C. 5321.04(B) ), wrongful eviction ( R.C. 5321.15(C) ), or wrongful retention of a security deposit ( R.C. 5321.16(C) ). It also authorizes the award of attorney fees to a landlord for a tenant's breach of a statutory obligation ( R.C. 5321.05(C)(1) ) or abuse of rent withholding ( R.C. 5321.09(D) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Alysha claims entitlement to an award of reasonable attorney fees in her successful civil action against the landlords based on R.C. 5321.15, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (A)\n   <em>\n    No landlord of residential premises shall initiate any act, including\n   </em>\n   termination of utilities or services,\n   <em>\n    exclusion from the premises\n   </em>\n   , or threat of any unlawful act,\n   <em>\n    against a tenant\n   </em>\n   , or a tenant whose right to possession has terminated,\n   <em>\n    for the purpose of recovering possession of residential premises, other than as provided in Chapters 1923., 5303., and 5321. of the Revised Code.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (C)\n   <em>\n    A landlord who violates this section is liable in a civil action for all damages caused to a tenant\n   </em>\n   , or to a tenant whose right to possession has terminated,\n   <em>\n    together with reasonable attorneys fees.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} It is uncontroverted that the landlords violated R.C. 5321.15(A) by constructively evicting Alysha from the residential premises. At issue is whether Alysha was then automatically entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees under R.C. 5321.15(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The language of R.C. 5321.15(C) is plain and unambiguous-a landlord who violates R.C. 5321.15(A) and/or (B)\"is liable\n   in a civil action for all damages caused to a tenant * * * together with reasonable attorneys fees.\" Therefore, after the trial court concluded that the landlords had violated R.C. 5321.15(A) by constructively evicting her, she was entitled to an award of \"all damages caused,\" as well as an award of \"reasonable attorneys fees.\" Nothing in this language commits the award of attorney fees to the discretion of the trial court; it is a mandatory award, although the amount of \"reasonable\" attorney fees is within the court's discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} This conclusion is consistent with the view of other appellate courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaitwae v.

But a transcript of the bench trial is unnecessary here, where the record establishes that the trial court found that the landlords violated R.C. 5321.15(A) by constructively evicting Alysha but did not award her attorney fees under R.C. 5321.15(C).
