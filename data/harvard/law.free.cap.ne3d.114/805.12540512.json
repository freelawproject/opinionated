Ordinance No. 167 enacted,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a new Chapter 313 to the Cincinnati Municipal Code through which the CITY OF CINCINNATI \"levied an excise tax on the privilege of installing, placing, and maintaining\" outdoor advertising signs,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , billboards, in the City of Cincinnati.\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 313-3(a)\n   </em>\n   . The amount of the billboard tax is the greater of: (i) seven percent of the gross receipts generated by or attributable to any billboard located in the City of Cincinnati; or (ii) an annual minimum tax which varies based upon the type of billboard (electronic versus non-electronic) and the location of the billboard (in close proximity to an interstate or primary highway versus all other locations).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 313-3(b)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Generally speaking, the billboard tax is imposed against all signs in the City of Cincinnati greater than 36 square feet in total face area, regardless of whether the sign is advocating a commercial message\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   and whether any commercial message is directed to the premises where the sign is located\n   <em>\n    vel non. See Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 313-5(a)(iii); Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 313-1-O\n   </em>\n   . The only other exceptions to the imposition of the billboard tax are for: (i) signs \"owned, controlled, leased, licensed, or otherwise used by the United States, the State of Ohio, or the city of Cincinnati\"; and (ii) signs otherwise declared exempt from regulation pursuant to Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 895-2 and Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 1427-07.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 313-5(a)(i) &amp; 313-5(a)(ii)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   All persons owning or controlling any billboard within the City of Cincinnati are required to register all billboards subject to the billboard tax.\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 313-9\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And those persons are also\n   mandated to file quarterly and annual tax returns, with the latter requiring disclosure of the gross receipts for each billboard.\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 313-11(b) &amp; 313-11(c)\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, without the issuance of a warrant or the opportunity for pre-compliance review before a neutral decision maker, those subject to the billboard tax (or even suspected of being subject to it) are mandated to afford the city treasurer or his designee \"access to all records and evidence at all reasonable times\" as well as to provide them \"the means, facilities and opportunity to conduct any examination or investigation upon reasonable notice\".\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 313-11(e)(i) &amp; 313-11(e)(i)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While the owners of billboards may pass the cost of the billboard tax onto an advertiser who leases a billboard,\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 313-7(c)(i)\n   </em>\n   , the owners may not, by express prohibition, \"state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by an advertiser, or that it will be added to the rent or other charge.\"\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 313-7(b)\n   </em>\n   . Also, the billboard tax may not \"be stated or charged separately from the rent or other consideration paid by an advertiser...or shown separately on any record thereof, or otherwise reflected upon any bill, statement or charge made for the sign's use....\"\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 313-7(a)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In passing Ordinance No. 167 as an emergency ordinance, the Cincinnati City Council invoked the talismanic language that it was \"necessary for the preservation of the public peace, healthy [sic], safety, and general welfare.\"\n   <em>\n    Ordinance No. 167-2018, sec. 7\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, the City Council indicated the immediate implementation of the billboard tax was necessary so that city officials and departments could establish the necessary regulations and procedures, put in place the appropriate staffing, and reach out to owners of billboards so that the City could begin to collect the tax no later than October 15, 2018, when the first quarterly tax returns and associated payments would be due.\n   <em>\n    Ordinance No. 167-2018, sec. 5 &amp; 7\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the same day it passed Ordinance No. 167,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , on June 27, 2018, the Cincinnati City Council passed, also as an emergency measure, Ordinance No. 163-2018. Part of the budget proposal originally presented by the Mayor of Cincinnati, Ordinance No. 163 amended,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , certain provisions of Chapter 895 of the Cincinnati Municipal Code so as to significantly increase certain permit fees associated with billboards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before constructing any billboard in the City of Cincinnati, a person must obtain an outdoor advertising construction permit in addition to any required building permit or\n   other permit or license.\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 895-13\n   </em>\n   . Pursuant to Ordinance No. 163, the cost for the outdoor advertising construction permit increased from $70 to $280.\n   <em>\n    Ordinance No. 167-2018, sec. 5\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, the City's director of buildings and inspections \"has the duty to inspect the construction of outdoor advertising signs\" to ensure \"the construction has been completed in accordance with all applicable codes.\"\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 895-13\n   </em>\n   . Thereupon, the director issues a permit number for the individual billboard which must be displayed, together with the owner's name, on the billboard or accompanying structure so that it is visible from the public right-of-way.\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 895-13\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ordinance No. 163 also increased the frequency by which owners of billboards must renew an outdoor advertising permit, as well as increasing the fees associated with each renewal application. While owners of billboards previously renewed such permits on a biennial basis, Ordinance No. 163 now mandates annual renewals. And in terms of the fee structure for a renewal permit if the owner of a billboard filed a verified certification that each billboard was being displayed and maintained in accordance with Chapter 895 of the Cincinnati Municipal Code, the fee increased, pursuant to Ordinance No. 163, from $20 to $160 for each billboard face,\n   <em>\n    see Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 895-19(a)\n   </em>\n   ; if the owner simply applied to the City's director of building and inspections for the City to conduct inspection of a billboard to ensure compliance with the requirements of Chapter 895, the fee increased, pursuant to Ordinance No. 163, from $40 to $160 for each billboard face,\n   <em>\n    see Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 895-19(b)\n   </em>\n   ; but if an owner failed to undertake either of the two foregoing options, then the City still inspected the billboard but, in such a scenario, the fee for the renewal permit increased, pursuant to Ordinance No. 163, from $50 to $400 for each billboard face,\n   <em>\n    see Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 895-19(c)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   LAMAR and NORTON are long-established owners of billboards within the City of Cincinnati. With approximately 450 and 415 billboards within the City, respectively, LAMAR and NORTON own the bulk of the billboards within the City. In previous years, LAMAR and NORTON would undertake the biennial process of renewing the permits for their billboards through the self-certification process pursuant to Cincinnati Municipal Code \u00a7 895-19(b) and paying the $20 fee for each billboard face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following enactment of Ordinance Nos, 167 &amp; 163, LAMAR and NORTON commenced separate lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the provisions related to the newly-enacted billboard tax and the increase in the costs and frequency of new construction or renewal permits for billboards. Following extensive oral argument by counsel for all parties on July 30, 2018, and with an adequate showing having been made, the Court issued a\n   <em>\n    Temporary Restraining Order\n   </em>\n   precluding the CITY OF CINCINNATI and various City officials from undertaking actions to implement or otherwise enforce either of the Ordinances as they relate to billboards. Pursuant to agreement of all parties, the\n   <em>\n    Temporary Restraining Order\n   </em>\n   remained in place and in effect beyond the 14-day limit provided for in Ohio R. Civ. P. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A hearing on the\n   <em>\n    Motions for Preliminary Injunction\n   </em>\n   commenced on September 7, 2018, and continued in progress to subsequent days during the ensuing month. The parties tendered testimonial and documentary evidence addressing, generally speaking, the communicative nature of billboards, the impact of the billboard\n   tax and the impact which increased fees will have on LAMAR and NORTON (as well as on billboard advertising in general), and the actions taken or anticipated to be taken by the City under the newly enacted provisions. Following closing arguments, the matter is now before the Court for consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Motions for Preliminary Injunction\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After commencement of this action and submission of the\n   <em>\n    Motions for Preliminary Injunction\n   </em>\n   , the Cincinnati City Council passed Ordinance 323-2018 as an emergency measure without any discussion or debate.\n   <em>\n    See Notice of Additional Authority\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Declaring that passage was necessary \"to restore fees for certain outdoor advertising sign permits and renewals to pre-existing levels to ensure fees assessed and charged by the City of Cincinnati are reasonably related to the costs impacts of the services giving rise to liability for those fees\",\n   <em>\n    Ordinance 2018-323, sec. 5\n   </em>\n   , Ordinance No. 323 returned the fee for the outdoor advertising construction permit to that which it was prior to adoption of Ordinance No. 163,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as doing the same for the fees for a renewal permit and restoring the biennial renewal period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the\n   <em>\n    status quo\n   </em>\n   of the parties pending final adjudication of the case upon the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Yudin v.

However, during this time, the CITY OF CINCINNATI undertook no action whatsoever with respect to renewal permits obtained through the self-certification process; instead, the CITY OF CINCINNATI simply accepted the biennial payments from LAMAR and NORTON for every billboard they owned, and then deposited the money into the fisc.

But, as noted above, following the commencement of this action and while the\n   <em>\n    Motions\n   </em>\n   were pending, the Cincinnati City Council passed Ordinance No. 323 whereby it effectively reinstated the\n   <em>\n    status quo ante\n   </em>\n   passage of Ordinance No. 163 as it related to both the fees associated with billboard permits and the renewal period for such permits.
