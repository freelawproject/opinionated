His conviction is based on the recovery of less than one-tenth of a gram of a loose substance containing cocaine base or crack cocaine found in the bottom of a waste can during the execution of a search warrant at a residence on the south side of Youngstown, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and that his conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant further contends that the state failed to establish within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the substance in question was cocaine. Finally, he asserts that an erroneous jury instruction affected the outcome of the trial. For the following reasons, Appellant's conviction is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} R.C. 2925.11(A) provides that \"[n]o person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance.\" Possession of a controlled substance may be actual or constructive.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Five Youngstown Police Department officers and a forensic scientist from the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation offered testimony at trial. Each officer testified to his closely-circumscribed role in the execution of the warrant at 833 Mercer Street, leaving the jury and the record on appeal with a somewhat incomplete narrative of the evening's events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Officer Francis Bigowsky testified that he was a scout, and that he surveilled various properties in the city for the purpose of detecting unlawful drug activity. His interest in the Mercer Street address was based on complaints about alleged drug sales at the residence and information from a confidential informant regarding the sale of crack cocaine. (Trial Tr., pp. 111-112.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Although Officer Bigowsky was not a member of the entry team, he did participate in the search as a \"float,\" that is, an officer who is not assigned to search a specific part of the residence. In the living room, Officer Bigowsky recovered a Time Warner cable bill addressed to Appellant at the 833 Mercer Street address. (Trial Tr., p. 116.) He also recovered three digital scales, two in a drawer in the kitchen, and one in a cereal box on the top of the refrigerator, (Trial Tr., pp. 114, 127), as well as a loose substance at the bottom of a waste can in the kitchen, which field tested positive for cocaine. (Trial Tr., pp. 114, 118.) But for this substance, the waste can was empty. (Trial Tr., p. 115.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On cross-examination, Officer Bigowsky conceded that another man, Darrell Watkins, was present at the residence with Appellant when the search warrant was executed. (Trial Tr., p. 131.) He also conceded that neither the waste can nor the scales were dusted for fingerprints or tested for DNA. (Trial Tr., p. 128.) He estimated that the search warrant team numbered anywhere between ten to fifteen men. (Trial Tr., p. 125.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Officer Richard Geraci testified that there were \"a few males\" in the residence when the officers gained entry. He explained that the officers knocked and announced their presence, but when no one answered, they used force to open the door. (Trial Tr., p. 136.) Officer Geraci testified that, in his experience, occupants who do not answer the door are trying to get rid of evidence inside the house. (Trial Tr., p. 137.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Officers secured the occupants on the ground and handcuffed them before executing the search warrant. (Trial Tr., p.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   138.) Officer Geraci was in charge of creating a written inventory of all of the items recovered during the search. (Trial Tr., p. 139.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Officer Robert Patton testified the he was responsible for recovering identification from the occupants and searching their persons. When he frisked Appellant, Officer Patton found four packets of Suboxone strips, $371.00 in cash, and a driver's license in his wallet. Appellant's driver's license listed his residence as 913 Orange Street. (Trial Tr., pp. 130, 145.) Officer Patton testified that Suboxone strips were prescribed for patients attempting to overcome heroin addiction, but that there is a \"black market\" for individuals who abused the product as well. (Trial Tr., pp. 145-146.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Officer John S. Aeppli testified that he was assigned to search the living room and the dining room. He recovered a small bag of marijuana from an end table. (Trial Tr., p. 150.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Officer Jose Morales testified that he was assigned to the bedrooms, which were located on the second floor of the residence. Officer Morales recovered a bag of marijuana in a pair of jeans lying on top of the dresser and a debit card bearing Appellant's name, which was also found on top of the dresser, but was not in the jeans. (Trial Tr., pp. 154-156.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On cross-examination, Officer Morales conceded that he did not seize or photograph the jeans, and that the bedroom contained other men's clothes. Despite testifying that he was assigned to search the bedrooms, Officer Morales conceded that he did not search the second bedroom. (Trial Tr., p. 158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Officer Michael Brindisi testified that he was responsible for photographing all of the items confiscated during the search. (Trial Tr., p. 163.) Officer Brindisi conceded that the debit card and marijuana were depicted in a single photograph, both being held by an officer, despite the fact that the debit card was found lying on the dresser and the marijuana was found in a pair of jeans lying separately on the dresser. (Trial Tr., p. 170.) There also was no photograph of the substance found in the waste can after it had been collected and put in an evidence bag. (Trial Tr., p. 168.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Martin Lewis, a BCI criminologist with over fifteen years of experience and who had testified in nearly 200 trials, tested the substance found in the waste can. (Trial Tr., p. 175.) His testimony was based on his written report, which was kept in the regular course of business at BCI. According to the report, the substance weighed less than .10 grams and was found to contain cocaine base or crack cocaine. (Trial Tr., p. 177.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On March 24, 2016, Appellant was indicted on one count of drug possession in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), (C)(4)(a), a felony of the fifth degree, with a forfeiture specification (which related to the cocaine); one count of drug possession in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), (C)(2)(a), a first degree misdemeanor (Suboxone ); and one count of illegal use of or possession with the intent to use drug paraphernalia in violation of R.C. 2925.14(C)(1), (F), a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. The state did not prosecute the charges lodged in counts two and three, instead relying on the presence of the Suboxone in Appellant's wallet and the marijuana and drug paraphernalia found in the residence to prosecute the possession charge in count one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19} A jury found Appellant guilty of violating R.C. 2925.11(A), (C)(4)(a), which criminalizes the possession of cocaine or a compound, mixture, preparation, or substance containing cocaine. Possession of\n   less than five grams of cocaine is a felony of the fifth degree. Appellant forfeited the $371.00 in cash confiscated during the search without objection, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twelve months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellant's first and second assignments of error challenge the evidence adduced at trial and will be addressed together, but out of order, for the purpose of clarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE JURY'S VERDICT IS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUSTAIN A CONVICTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} \"When a court reviews a record for sufficiency, '[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, there was no testimony or other evidence offered at trial to establish that Appellant's aunt, or any other individual, resided at 833 Mercer Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In his closing argument, defense counsel advanced the theory that the officers cherry-picked the evidence, choosing to forego the search of the second bedroom after finding Appellant's debit card on the dresser in the first bedroom. Defense counsel argued that there may have been other evidence ignored by the officers, including DNA and fingerprint evidence, that may have implicated another individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Defense counsel also attempted to diffuse the notion that Appellant was attempting to secrete the substance by discarding it in the kitchen waste can when\n   the police knocked and announced. Defense counsel argued that Appellant would not leave a bag of marijuana on the end table, or discard cocaine in an empty waste can, when he could have discarded all of it in the kitchen sink. In fact, there was no testimony offered to establish Appellant's whereabouts in the home when the door was breached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In this appeal, Appellant asks us to focus on evidence that is not in the record, rather than considering the evidence offered at trial. While it is clear from the record that the search of the residence was abbreviated due to the discovery of evidence implicating Appellant, the evidence offered at trial was nevertheless sufficient to support Appellant's conviction. Despite the fact that Appellant's driver's license listed a different address, the record establishes that he was more than an occupant at 833 Mercer Street. The cable bill found in the living room was in his name and his debit card was found in one of the bedrooms. The evidence establishes that he had access to and control of both floors of the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Of equal import, the presence of items commonly associated with the illegal sale of drugs found throughout the residence belies any argument that he was unaware of the presence of the cocaine. Marijuana was found in the living room and bedroom. Not one, but three scales were found in various parts of the kitchen. Suboxone was found in his wallet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The evidence establishes at least that Appellant spent a sufficient amount of time at 833 Mercer Street to finance the cable television service. Circumstantial evidence supports the conclusion that he maintained 833 Mercer Street either for personal or business purposes. Accordingly, we find that the presence of drugs and drug paraphernalia, coupled with indicia that Appellant was more than a simple occupant at 833 Mercer Street on the day the search was conducted, was sufficient to sustain his conviction for possession of cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Likewise, we find that the jury did not lose its way in convicting Appellant for drug possession. Despite defense counsel's argument, no evidence was offered to establish that Appellant's aunt, or any other individual, resided at 833 Mercer Street. Consequently, no fact-based explanation was provided for Appellant's name on the cable bill. The evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that Appellant paid for a utility at the house, an entertainment service, and the presence of his debit card in the upstairs bedroom established that Appellant had access to and used both floors of the residence.
