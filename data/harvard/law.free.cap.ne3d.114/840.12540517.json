Because Q.D.-A. classified these drivers as independent contractors, it did not pay unemployment taxes for them under the Indiana Unemployment Compensation Act. The Act presumes a worker is an employee unless the employer can show three things: (A) the worker is free from the employer's control and direction, (B) the\n   worker performs a service outside the usual course of the employer's business, and (C) the worker receives a commission or operates an independently established trade, occupation, or profession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After a driver for Q.D.-A. filed for unemployment benefits under the Act, the Department of Workforce Development told the company that it had misclassified him as an independent contractor. But because Q.D.-A. proved the Act's three-part test, we hold that he was an independent contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Q.D.-A. is a business that connects drivers with customers who need too-large-to-tow vehicles driven to them. Consistent with its typical practice, Q.D.-A. contracted with a Driver to pair him with customers needing this drive-away service. Under this contract-which explicitly called him an independent contractor-Driver could choose his own hours and the routes he believed were safest and most direct, contract with Q.D.-A.'s competitors, decline any work offered by Q.D.-A., negotiate his pay for each trip, and hire other drivers to complete his deliveries if they were qualified under federal regulations. Because Q.D.-A. believed these terms made Driver an independent contractor instead of an employee, it did not pay unemployment taxes for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After parting ways with Q.D.-A., Driver filed for unemployment benefits with the Department of Workforce Development. Because Q.D.-A. did not pay unemployment taxes for Driver, the Department investigated to determine whether Q.D.-A. should have classified Driver as an employee. After examining their contract and speaking with Driver and representatives from Q.D.-A., the Department analyzed their relationship under the statutory \"ABC Test.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To prevail under this test, Q.D.-A. needed to show that (A) Driver was free from its control and direction, (B) Driver performed his work outside the company's usual course of business, and (C) Driver was customarily engaged in an independently established trade or business of the work performed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-4-8-1\">\n    Ind.

According to the Department, Driver was an employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Q.D.-A. protested. At a hearing before a Liability Administrative Law Judge (or LALJ), the Department's sole witness, the investigator who classified Driver as an employee, acknowledged that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 She knew nothing about Q.D.-A.'s two-day orientation or internal policies,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 She believed Q.D.-A. showed control over Driver when it required him to follow state and federal regulations,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Driver's unilateral ability to choose how to do his job could be considered the \"opposite\" of control,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 It would be \"very odd\" for an employer to allow an employee to hire someone else to do his job, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Q.D.-A. acted as a \"middleman\" between drivers and customers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Tr. Vol. 2, pp. 19, 22-23, 29, 31, 32, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On the other hand, Q.D.-A.'s director of administration and dispatch supervisor both testified that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Q.D.-A. provided neither direction to Driver on how he should perform his job nor evaluation of his performance,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Q.D.-A. permitted Driver to outsource his work to other drivers,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Driver could negotiate his pay for each trip and could work for more than one drive-away company,\n   \u2022 Driver paid for all incidental expenses (like lodging, meals, tolls, and fuel) and provided all equipment (like any vehicle he towed to drive back home, hitch equipment, tow bars, light connectors, safety triangles, and fire extinguishers),\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Driver could refuse any jobs offered to him with no repercussions and could call in at his convenience to see if any jobs were available,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 The primary purpose of the orientation and internal policies is \"to go over the regulations brought on by the federal government,\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Q.D.-A. only employs individuals to \"pair the customer with the contractor,\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Although Q.D.-A. registered as a motor carrier with the federal government and has a Department of Transportation (DOT) number, it is \"very common\" in the industry for \"contractors [to] contract with a motor carrier or the middle man who has the DOT number,\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 All drive-away companies must comply with federal regulations, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Driver was personally liable to follow federal regulations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Tr. Vol. 2, pp. 42-53, 66-67, 70, 74, 76, 80, 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After the hearing, the LALJ affirmed the Department's classification, concluding that even though Q.D.-A. had established that Driver ran an independently established business, it had failed to prove the two other prongs. First, the LALJ reasoned, Q.D.-A. controlled Driver because it provided \"a two-day orientation to its independent contractors,\" trained them on federal regulations and employer policies, and required them to perform a driving test. Ex. Vol. 4, p.102. And second, the LALJ opined, Driver performed work within Q.D.-A.'s usual course of business because Q.D.-A. \"is a provider of one-way transportation of commodities\" and \"[t]he independent contractors provide those services to the clients on behalf of the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-4-8-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Q.D.-A. appealed, and a divided panel of our Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Q.D.-A. satisfied the ABC Test.\n   <em>\n    Q.

Since we agree that \"[t]he Court of Appeals has entered a decision in conflict with another decision of the Court of Appeals on the same important issue,\" Ind. Appellate Rule 57(H)(1), we grant the Department's petition to transfer.

Under this standard, we review an LALJ's (1) findings of basic fact to ensure \"substantial evidence\" supports those findings, (2) conclusions of law for correctness, and (3) inferences or conclusions from basic facts, often called \"mixed questions of law and fact,\" for reasonableness.\n   <em>\n    McClain v.

I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 22-4-10-1(a), -4-2, -8-1. The Act's ABC Test-so called because of its former statutory placement-presumes a worker is an employee unless an employer can establish three prongs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (1) The individual has been and will continue to be free from control and direction in connection with the performance of such service, both under the individual's contract of service and in fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (2) The service is performed outside the usual course of the business for which the service is performed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (3) The individual:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (A) is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (B) is a sales agent who receives remuneration solely upon a commission basis and who is the master of the individual's own time and effort.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   I.C. \u00a7 22-4-8-1(b).

Driver was not under Q.D.-A.'s control or direction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, to show that Driver was an independent contractor, Q.D.-A. must demonstrate it lacked control and direction over Driver, both under contract and in fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 22-4-8-1(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Under contract, Q.D.-A. and Driver \"expressly understood and agreed\" that Driver was an independent contractor.

In other words, if a company regularly or continually performs an activity, no matter the scale, it is part of the company's usual course of business. And if a company regularly or continually performs activities showing it is \"engaged in various separate and independent kinds of businesses or occupations,\" it may have more than one course of business.\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

There, the company did not regularly or continually deliver shopping guides. Instead, that task was left exclusively to the carriers. And in\n   <em>\n    Bloomington Area Arts Council\n   </em>\n   , the instruction of art classes was within an art education center's usual course of business when it \"regularly offer[ed] the art classes as part of its mission to provide access to the arts in the community.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9025385\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/821/843/#p850\">\n    821 N.E.2d at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike the publishing company and newspaper carriers in\n   <em>\n    Twin States\n   </em>\n   , both the art education center and the teachers regularly or continually performed the same activity-providing art classes to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Here, the parties agree that Driver provided drive-away services. So, to determine whether he performed a service within Q.D.-A.'s usual course of business, we need only decide if Q.D.-A. also provided drive-away services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   First, the Department argues that the way Q.D.-A. markets itself should factor into whether it provided drive-away services. But this marketing plays little, if any, direct role in analyzing the\n   <em>\n    activities\n   </em>\n   Q.D.-A. performs on a regular or continual basis. To be sure, advertising can reflect\n   services a company offers to its customers. But we cannot uncritically rely on that advertising to fully reflect the activities a company regularly or continually performs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, the Department argues that Q.D.-A.'s registration with the DOT shows it provided drive-away services. But federal law compels this registration for any \"broker\" who arranges motor carrier transportation between parties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013904\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2012).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (2008) (defining \"broker\" as \"a person, other than a motor carrier or an employee or agent of a motor carrier, that as a principal or agent sells, offers for sale, negotiates for, or holds itself out by solicitation, advertisement, or otherwise as selling, providing, or arranging for, transportation by motor carrier for compensation\"). As the Department's witness agreed, independent contractors across the United States often operate under the DOT registration of general contractors. In line with this national practice, Driver operated under Q.D.-A.'s DOT broker registration as an independent contractor. Altogether, no evidence shows Q.D.-A. regularly or continually provided drive-away services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This conclusion, while consistent with\n   <em>\n    Twin States\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bloomington Area Arts Council\n   </em>\n   , directly conflicts with\n   <em>\n    Company\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Company\n   </em>\n   , a panel of our Court of Appeals held that transporting and delivering RVs was within the usual course of business of a company like Q.D.-A.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325420\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/86/204/#p209\">\n    86 N.E.3d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Company\n   </em>\n   panel-citing the company's DOT registration, the word \"transport\" in its corporate name, and its competition with companies offering the same services using employees-\"seriously doubt[ed]\" that customers contacted the company to act as a \"middle man.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325420\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/86/204/#p209\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325420\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/86/204/#p209\">\n    at 208-209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, according to the panel's \"common-sense standpoint,\" these customers would call the company to transport the RVs without caring how the company accomplished the task.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325420\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/86/204/#p209\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325420\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/86/204/#p209\">\n    at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the panel supported its conclusion with speculative customer belief and facts not relevant to activities the company regularly or continually performed. By leaving the company's activities unexamined,\n   <em>\n    Company\n   </em>\n   's reasoning did not answer the statutory question of whether its usual course of business included delivering RVs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because Q.D.-A. did not regularly or continually provide drive-away services, the LALJ unreasonably concluded that Driver performed a service within Q.D.-A.'s usual course of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Driver ran an independently established business.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Third and finally, neither party disputes the LALJ's finding that Q.D.-A. \"provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that [Driver] was customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business of transporting commodities.\" Ex. Vol. 4, p.102.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 22-4-8-1(b)(3). So we assume Q.D.-A. meets this prong of the ABC Test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The LALJ unreasonably concluded that Driver was Q.D.-A.'s employee under the Unemployment Compensation Act when Driver (1) was not under Q.D.-A.'s control or direction, (2) performed a service outside Q.D.-A.'s usual course of business, and (3) ran an independently established business. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Rush, C.J., and David and Goff, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Slaughter, J., concurs in result.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
