Houston appeals the decision of the Noble County Court finding him guilty of failure to control in violation of R.C. 4511.202. Appellant contests the sufficiency and the weight of the evidence. He also contends the trial court erred in finding a deer running into the road is foreseeable and thus cannot constitute a sudden emergency for purposes of an affirmative defense. This court concludes a deer may constitute a sudden emergency; therefore, the trial court erred in ruling, as a matter of law, that a deer in the road cannot be a sudden emergency. As such, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant was issued a citation for failure to control in violation of R.C. 4511.202. A bench trial was conducted by the Noble County Court on September 5, 2017. The trooper testified he was called to the scene of a single-vehicle accident on May 21, 2017 at 4:25 a.m. on Interstate 77 North in Noble County. He observed a large, yellow, Penske-rental, box truck leaning sideways in the grass median. (Tr. 4-5, 21). He concluded the truck drove off the left side of the freeway and into the grass median where it turned sideways, overturned, rolled, and landed upright with a twisted frame. (Tr. 4-5, 10-11, 21). The road was dry. The trooper observed minor cuts on the passenger and on Appellant, who identified himself as the driver. (Tr. 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The trooper found no skid marks on the pavement where the truck left the roadway. (Tr. 6, 20). He saw tire tracks with tread marks in the grass at the point the truck left the berm, which demonstrated to him that the truck's tires were still freely rolling, as opposed to skidding, when the truck entered the grass. (Tr. 6). He concluded the driver did not brake while on the road or when first leaving it. (Tr. 12, 17). Photographs were admitted showing what the officer concluded were the truck's tire tracks in the grass after the truck started travelling sideways. (Tr. 7, 14, 17). A photograph showed the truck with a crushed cab roof, a broken windshield, and the metal sheared off the top and passenger side of the box compartment. Household belongings from inside the truck's box compartment were scattered in the median. The back end of the truck was protruding into the roadway on the other side of the freeway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The trooper testified he found no blood or fur on the front of the truck when checking to see if it made contact with an animal. (Tr. 8). When asked on cross-examination if he checked under the vehicle or the side of the vehicle for evidence of a deer, he said he did not because Appellant did not think he struck the deer. (Tr. 19). He acknowledged there are many deer-car collisions in this rural area and agreed a deer strike could cause death to someone inside a vehicle. (Tr. 18-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant testified in his own defense. He explained he rented the 26-foot box truck to move from North Carolina to northern Ohio. He planned to make multiple trips in a short period of time and left North Carolina at 8:00 p.m. (Tr. 26). Appellant testified he was driving north in the left lane when he saw a deer enter the road at a run from the right side of the roadway. (Tr. 27). He swerved off the road to the left, and the truck went into a slide. He said, \"as soon as I hit the grass, that was it.\" (Tr. 28,31). He could not remember if he applied the brakes. (Tr. 28). He confirmed the truck rolled over and landed on its tires. (Tr. 27). He believed he was traveling at a speed between 60 and 70 miles per hour, stating the truck had a governor limiting the maximum speed to 70 mph, which he said was the speed limit. (Tr. 28, 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} When his attorney asked why he did not just go forward and hit the deer, he said his friend had a deer go through the car and maim him and \"So I decided, that uh, natural instinct would be to swerve and miss instead of hitting him. That was just a natural instinct.\" (Tr. 28). When asked if he could have done anything differently, Appellant answered in the negative and explained, \"something runs out in front of you, you're natural instinct is to swerve and to avoid it.\" (Tr. 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Defense counsel renewed a motion for acquittal, which the court overruled, explaining reasonable minds could find Appellant guilty when the evidence was viewed in the light most favorable to the state. Closing arguments were presented. Defense counsel outlined the sudden emergency defense. The court then discussed the defense and concluded a wild animal crossing the road in a rural area of Ohio was foreseeable and therefore would not constitute a sudden emergency, finding the defense of sudden emergency does not exist for an animal in the roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The court found Appellant guilty as charged and imposed a fine of $50 plus $89 in court costs. (Tr. 35-36; J.E. 9/5/17). Appellant paid $139 that same day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant filed an untimely notice of\n   appeal from the September 5, 2017 judgment entry on Friday, October 6, 2017, which was one day late. This court granted leave for a delayed appeal under App.R. 5(A). (J.E. 12/6/17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR ONE: SUFFICIENCY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant sets forth three assignments of error, the first of which alleges:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING THE APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL UNDER CRIMINAL RULE 29 UPON THE COMPLETION OF APPELLANT'S CASE.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Initially, the state responds by asserting a motion for acquittal has no application in a bench trial. Pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A) : \"The court on motion of a defendant or on its own motion, after the evidence on either side is closed, shall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses charged in the indictment, information, or complaint, if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\" Crim.R. 29(A). We note the holding: \"The purpose of a motion for judgment of acquittal is to test the sufficiency of the evidence and, where the evidence is insufficient, to take the case from the jury. In the non-jury trial, however, the defendant's plea of not guilty serves as a motion for judgment of acquittal, and obviates the necessity of renewing a Crim.R. 29 motion at the close of all the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Dayton v.

Still, the law does not prohibit a defendant from asking the court at the close of the state's case for an acquittal to be entered prior to the defense calling witnesses in a bench trial. A renewed motion at the close of all evidence is not required, and the renewed motion in a bench trial is akin to a closing argument to emphasize the defendant's position. The defendant can argue insufficiency of the evidence to a trial court at a bench trial regardless of the form the argument takes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In any event, the review of a denial of a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal\n   involves the application of the standards for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Crim.R. 29(A) (referring to insufficient evidence);\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, when a defendant challenges a court's denial of a motion for acquittal, he is challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a conviction is a question of law evaluating the adequacy of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The large truck had a twisted frame and was sitting sideways in the grass median with the back end protruding into one side of the freeway. The tire tracks showed it came from the other side of the freeway without braking as it left the road and then turned sideways. The trooper could ascertain the truck rolled after turning sideways. The top and side of the box truck were sheared away, exposing the contents which were strewn in the median.

Appellant urges the statements on the record suggest the judge believed his testimony that a deer ran into the road.

The court then asked if \"anybody that drives on the roads in a rural part of the State of Ohio is gonna find that it's unforeseeable that a wild animal could cross the road?\" (Tr. 33-34). Defense counsel replied, \"No. That, that is entirely foreseeable. However, - - -.\" At that point, the court opined, \"So consequently, the defense of [a] sudden emergency is really not available, under those circumstances.\" The court noted it had never read a case saying a wild animal crossing a road is a sudden emergency and asked if defense counsel knew of a case on the subject. Counsel said he was unable \"to find one where it was - - -\" at which point the court suggested it considered the issue in the past. Some \"inaudible\" comments were made by defense counsel and the court. The court then concluded: \"No. Living in the rural area we do. Uh, but consequently, I've never been able to find one either. And so, consequently, uh, I don't find that the defense exists.\" (Tr. 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In the Second District's\n   <em>\n    Mc Caw\n   </em>\n   case, the defendant testified his failure to control the vehicle was the result of a blackout and said his doctor's office failed to warn him of this possibility. The trial court made a comment: \"Is it your understanding or do you believe that because you blacked out and they failed to properly advise you that that excuses you from the accident?\" On appeal, the defendant argued the trial court erred by indicating a blackout was not a legal excuse. The Second District held the defendant was entitled to offer evidence to prove his affirmative\n   defense that his failure to control was due to fainting or a momentary loss of consciousness and any rejection of this theory as an affirmative defense would have constituted a legal error. The court pointed out: \"If the trial court disbelieved McCaw's bare assertions it was not required to credit his defense, notwithstanding the fact that the State had offered no evidence contradicting McCaw's claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Mc Caw\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.

The court affirmed the conviction finding the state did not put on evidence that a deer actually jumped in front of appellant's vehicle. Rather, the trooper merely mentioned the driver's claim at the scene. The court ruled this evidence could be viewed as a bare, self-serving assertion which the trial court was not required to believe.\n   <em>\n    State v. Cecil\n   </em>\n   , 12th Dist.

There is no indication the court issued an alternative ruling based on an evaluation of the weight of the facts and circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Alternatively, the state relies on the Fifth District's language on unforeseeability in discussing the defense. For instance, the Fifth District has stated: \"An operator of a motor vehicle is excused from complying with a safety statute if without fault on his part, and because of circumstances over which he had no control, he was confronted by a sudden unfor[e]seeable emergency which made compliance with the statute impossible.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, as in the Twelfth District's\n   <em>\n    Cecil\n   </em>\n   case, the court concluded the defendant failed to put on a persuasive defense as there was no evidence a deer was actually in the roadway besides the trooper's mention of the defendant's excuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 18.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cecil\n   </em>\n   , 12th Dist.

It was error for the trial court to conclude as a matter of law that an animal entering the roadway can never be a sudden emergency. The mere fact that it is foreseeable a deer may cross a freeway at some point in time in rural Ohio does not mean a deer running across the road at a certain time or place is foreseeable and can never be a sudden emergency. (By comparison, the deer at that place and time may be no more foreseeable than a vehicle exiting a driveway into a defendant's path.) In other words, the bare fact a deer runs into a driver's path is not a \"self-created emergency\" and may qualify as a situation \"over which [the driver] has no control.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oechsle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1788806\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/12/29/#p31\">\n    12 Ohio St.2d at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=231%20N.E.2d%20306\">\n    231 N.E.2d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 37} A defendant may fail to prove his defense if, for instance, part of the situation involving a deer arises from the driver's own conduct or from circumstances under his control, such as where there is evidence of speeding, driving too fast for the conditions, driving while being distracted (such as using a device or eating food), driving in the dark without headlights, and driving without prescribed eyeglasses.
