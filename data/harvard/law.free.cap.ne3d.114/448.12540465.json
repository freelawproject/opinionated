For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On December 12, 2012, appellant gave birth to L.C.C. The identity of the biological father is unknown. On January 3, 2013, Franklin County Children Services (\"FCCS\") was informed that appellant had tested positive for oxycodone on seven occasions during her pregnancy and twice for marijuana and that she continued to use illegal drugs while breastfeeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On February 25, 2013, FCCS filed a neglect and dependency complaint, pursuant to R.C. 2151.03(A)(2) and 2151.04(C), in the Franklin County Juvenile Court. Due to appellant's indigence, counsel was appointed to represent appellant in the juvenile court proceedings. In April 2013, FCCS removed L.C.C. from appellant's care and placed him with appellant's mother. Three weeks later, on May 3, 2013, FCCS removed L.C.C. from appellant's mother and placed him with appellee and appellee's husband. Appellee is appellant's maternal aunt. The stated reason FCCS removed L.C.C. from appellant's mother was a \"failure to thrive.\" (Feb. 9, 2017 Tr. at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On May 9, 2013, the Franklin County Juvenile Court determined that L.C.C. was a \"dependent minor pursuant to section 2151 of the Ohio Revised Code\" and awarded temporary custody of L.C.C. to FCCS. (Oct. 5, 2017 Juvenile Court Decision and Entry.) L.C.C. was approximately four and one-half months old when appellee obtained custody. L.C.C. has remained in appellee's care since that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In late 2013 or early 2014, appellant traveled to Florida to enter a drug treatment program. She returned briefly in February 2014 for a hearing in the juvenile court case. On October 7, 2014, the juvenile court issued an order, pursuant to R.C. 2151.42(B), awarding legal custody of L.C.C. to appellee and appellee's husband. Appellant did not object to the court's ruling, and she went back to Florida. Appellant has admitted that she did not complete the Florida drug treatment program and continued to use illegal drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In December 2015, a Franklin County Grand Jury indicted appellant for heroin possession, a felony of the third degree. On July 27, 2016, appellee filed her petition for adoption, pursuant to R.C. 3107.05, in the Franklin County Probate Court. Appellant received notice of the petition while at the Franklin County jail. On October 14, 2016, appellee filed an amended petition. Appellant filed her pro se objection to the amended petition on November 10, 2016. On receipt of appellant's objection, the probate court sent appellant a letter advising her to speak with an attorney regarding her parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On February 9, 2017, a magistrate conducted a hearing, pursuant to R.C. 3107.07(A), to determine whether appellant's consent to the adoption was required. Appellant attended the hearing via telephone from the Franklin County Sheriff's Office, without the benefit of legal counsel. On February 21, 2017, the magistrate issued a decision wherein the magistrate found, by clear and convincing evidence, that appellant failed without justifiable cause to provide more than de minimis maintenance and support to L.C.C. for a period of one year immediately preceding the filing of the adoption petition. Accordingly, the magistrate recommended the court conclude that appellant's consent to the adoption was not required and proceed to a determination whether granting the adoption petition would be in the best interest of L.C.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellant did not file an objection to the magistrate's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On May 18, 2017, the magistrate held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether, pursuant to R.C. 3107.161, granting the adoption petition would be in the best interest of L.C.C. Appellant appeared at the hearing pro se. As a result of the hearing, the magistrate issued a decision on May 25, 2017 recommending the court deny the petition for adoption. The magistrate found appellant proved, by clear and convincing evidence, adoption by appellee was not in L.C.C.'s best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellee filed objections to the magistrate's decision accompanied by a transcript of the proceedings before the magistrate. Appellant filed a response and her own supplemental objections on August 15, 2017. On October 11, 2017, the court held a hearing on the objections. At the start of the proceeding, the trial court addressed appellant regarding her legal representation, whereon the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: And I understand that you represented yourself in the underlying hearing with the magistrate?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE COURT: Have you made any attempts to try and find legal counsel - (INAUDIBLE)?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [APPELLANT]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: This is a big - this is a big decision. It's something that's a big - I'm sure probably one of the biggest decisions, if not the most, for your situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [APPELLANT]: I know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: Have you tried to seek legal counsel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [APPELLANT]: I have. I've been to the legal association. I've called the bar association, OSU, Capital, and tried to get a court-appointed attorney, all of which I was denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: Basically because if it's not a criminal proceeding, you'd be -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [APPELLANT]: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: If you're indigent, you could get the services of the public defender, but since it's a civil proceeding, they - and no one at Capital Law - did you say Capital Law?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [APPELLANT]: Capital. They don't have a course right now that is working in probate so they can't do anything to help me. Same with OSU and the legal association and the bar association.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Oct. 11, 2017 Tr. at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 10} As a result of the hearing, the court continued the matter for 60 days to allow appellant additional time to obtain legal counsel and to prepare. Following an unsuccessful mediation, the court held an evidentiary hearing on February 6, 2018 to determine whether adoption was in the best interest of L.C.C. At the hearing, the court heard additional testimony from the parties and from the Guardian ad Litem (\"GAL\"), Stacey L. Beck, who testified by way of deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Prior to hearing testimony, the court made the following comments regarding appellant's pro se status:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   I will say one thing. It's - I hate to see a situation where we have litigants without attorneys. It complicates things a little bit. So what I'm going to do is - is I'm going to - I'm going to afford - this is a best-interest hearing, and so as long as it's relevant, I'm going to afford her a pretty wide latitude. If it's something that she's - that's permissible for her to ask, you, as a good lawyer, are probably going to object if it's not phrased the right way. The fact that she doesn't have an attorney, I'll probably afford her a pretty wide latitude in being able to ask\n   questions. I don't think that it's going to affect our proceedings and so just to move it along.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Feb. 6, 2018 Tr. at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On March 6, 2018, the trial court issued a decision sustaining appellee's objections to the magistrate's decision and granting the petition for adoption. In making its findings, the trial court considered the evidence admitted at the hearing before the magistrate and the additional evidence submitted at the February 6, 2018 evidentiary hearing. In reaching its conclusions, the trial court independently analyzed the relevant factors set forth in R.C. 3107.161(B) in making the best-interest determination. The trial court concluded that appellee \"has proven by clear and convincing evidence that the child's adoption to [appellee] would be in the child's best interests.\" (Mar. 6, 2018 Decision at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant timely appealed to this court from the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant assigns the following as trial court error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [1.] [Appellant's] constitutional equal protection rights required that the trial court provide her with the assistance of counsel during the adoption proceedings in which her parental rights were terminated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [2.] [Appellant's] constitutional due process rights required that the trial court provide her with the assistance of counsel during the adoption proceedings in which her parental rights were terminated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [3.] The trial court committed structural error by denying [appellant] her constitutional right to counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [4.] The trial court committed plain error by finding that [appellant's] consent was not required in the proceedings for L.C.C.'s adoption.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [5.] The trial court abused its discretion by concluding that it was in L.C.C.'s best interest for [appellee] to adopt him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellate courts \"generally review a trial court's adoption, denial or modification of a magistrate's decision for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Brunetto v.

However, where the appeal from the trial court's action on a magistrate's decision presents only a question of law, the standard of review is de novo.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201225580\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    A. First Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In her first assignment of error, appellant argues the trial court violated her rights to equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 2 of the Ohio Constitution in failing to appoint legal counsel to represent appellant in the adoption proceedings. Appellee maintains that an indigent biological parent facing the loss of parental rights in a contested private adoption in the probate court is in the same position as an indigent biological parent facing the loss of parental rights in an abuse, neglect, and dependency case initiated by the state in juvenile court under R.C. 2151.353. Appellant argues because R.C. 2151.353(C) requires appointment of legal counsel to indigent parents \"pursuant to Chapter 120. of the Revised Code\" in proceedings arising out of abuse, neglect, and dependency cases initiated by the state, the Equal Protection Clause requires appointment of legal counsel, at the state's expense, to indigent parents\n   in private adoption proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant claims that in cases involving the fundamental right to parent a child brought pursuant to R.C. Chapter 3107, disparate treatment of similarly situated indigent parents violates the Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Ordinarily, this court would review a properly preserved assignment of error challenging a statutory law on equal protection grounds under the de novo standard of review.\n   <em>\n    In re D.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-114\">\n    2017-Ohio-114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20N.E.3d%201040\">\n    75 N.E.3d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14 (10th Dist.). Before undertaking an equal protection analysis of Ohio's adoption laws in this case, however, we must examine the record to determine whether appellant preserved the constitutional claim she now raises on appeal. For the foregoing reasons, we find that appellant waived the equal protection argument she now raises in her first assignment of error by failing to raise it in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 18} This court has repeatedly stated that \" '[a] constitutional issue not raised at trial \"need not be heard for the first time on appeal.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

A threshold issue for the Court of Appeals was the appropriate standard of review. In concluding the plain error standard applied, a majority of the court reasoned that \"because appellant did not specifically request the trial court to consider the equal-protection implications of his request for appointed counsel, we must review appellant's equal-protection argument for plain error.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 21} We note that the dissenting judge in\n   <em>\n    In re J.R.F.\n   </em>\n   argued the plain error standard should not apply because the equal protection argument specifically raised by appellant on appeal was implicit in the generalized constitutional claim formally made by appellant in his motion for appointment of counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44-45, citing\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of P.L.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280889\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/554/\">\n    151 Ohio St.3d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280889\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/554/\">\n    2017-Ohio-5824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20N.E.3d%20698\">\n    91 N.E.3d 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22.

Even under the more forgiving approach to waiver adopted by the dissent in\n   <em>\n    In re J.R.F.\n   </em>\n   , the record in this case clearly establishes that appellant failed to preserve her equal protection argument in the trial court and waived the argument for purposes of appeal.

Appellant's fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Fifth Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 56} In appellant's fifth assignment of error, appellant alleges the trial court abused its discretion by concluding it was in L.C.C.'s best interest for appellee to adopt him. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 57} The evidence admitted at the best-interest hearing before the magistrate included the testimony of appellee and appellant. Appellant admitted that she has a drug problem and that she is addicted to heroin, but she claims that she has been sober since her incarceration, a period of 14 and one-half months. Appellant acknowledged that she agreed the grant of temporary custody of L.C.C. to appellee in May 2013 was in L.C.C.'s best interest. She also claimed she was sober at that time but that she subsequently relapsed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Appellant testified that she last saw L.C.C. in December 2015 and that she was arrested on March 29, 2016 on charges of heroin possession, a third-degree felony. Appellant pleaded guilty to the charge and received a three-year sentence. Pursuant to her plea agreement, appellant became eligible for a transfer to a community based correctional facility (\"CBCF\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 59} At the time of the magistrate's hearing, appellant had been housed at a CBCF for 74 days where she received several forms of drug treatment and life counseling. Appellant testified that a CBCF typically lasts up to 180 days but that she could be eligible to enter the Amethyst program after completing as few as 100 days of a CBCF. Appellant stated that the Amethyst program is a two-to-five-year program where she can live independently on the Amethyst campus while receiving counseling. Appellant maintained that L.C.C. could live with her while she was in the program and that she could eventually move off campus. Appellant admitted that she will be required to serve the remaining 30 months of her prison term if she does not successfully complete the CBCF program and that she must also serve a term of community control. Appellant admitted that appellee \"loves [L.C.C.] 100 percent\" and that appellee \"does provide a good home, a caring home.\" (May 18, 2017 Tr. at 28-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 60} At the best-interest hearing before the magistrate, appellee testified she was 56 years old and in good health. She owns her own home in Hilliard, Ohio, and she owns a company involved with web site design and increasing the internet presence of her clients. According to appellee, following the death of her husband in 2015, she began receiving government assisted healthcare for L.C.C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellee testified that L.C.C. has friends at day care and in the neighborhood. She testified that L.C.C. initially referred to her as \"TT,\" then \"TT mom,\" and now he just calls her \"mom.\" (May 18, 2017 Tr. at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Appellee testified she has a 20-year-old daughter, K., who stays with appellant when she is home from college. L.C.C. refers to K. as his sister. Appellee's other three adult children live on their own and do not have much contact with L.C.C. Appellee stated that she maintained an open door policy with regard to appellant's visitation with L.C.C. after she received temporary custody in May 2013. According to appellee, appellant visited with L.C.C. a total of 16 times between the time appellee obtained temporary custody of L.C.C. and his first birthday. Appellee testified that the visits took place at her home and that they were short, no more than two hours. According to appellee, she made arrangements for appellant to enter the Amethyst drug treatment program in 2013 and that she changed her work schedule so she\n   could drive appellant to her required appointments. Appellee stated that appellant failed to follow through with the program requirements. Appellee testified that appellant decided, over her objection, to seek drug treatment in Florida rather than Columbus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 62} According to appellee, appellant returned to Columbus in February 2014 and that she visited with L.C.C. on six occasions before returning to Florida. Appellee stated that she heard nothing from appellant from July to October 2014. Though appellant was back in Columbus in 2015, appellee testified that appellant saw L.C.C. just once in April. Appellee did not hear from appellant again until December 2015. According to appellee, appellant did not see L.C.C. at all in 2016, and she estimated that appellant visited L.C.C. only 20 or 25 times in four years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 63} At the hearing before the trial court on appellee's objections, the trial court elected to hear additional evidence from the parties. Appellee provided essentially the same testimony she had given at the prior hearing. Appellee also told the trial court the reason she filed for adoption:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Because at this point he's - this is his life. This is what he's doing. His mom was in jail. She's struggling with drug - with drug addiction. He doesn't know any of that. He has - this is his life. This is his family. This is all he knows, and there was nothing - no reason to think that it would change. We love him. He looks to us as his family. He has his friends. He has his activities. He - this is just all he knows.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   (Feb. 6, 2018 Tr. at 29-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 64} When asked what L.C.C. would say if he was shown a photograph of his mother, appellee responded \"[h]e would ask me who it was.\" (Feb. 6, 2018 Tr. at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 65} In addition to her own testimony, appellee presented the deposition of the GAL, Beck, who submitted several reports in this case. Beck first became GAL for L.C.C. in 2013, in connection with the neglect and dependency proceedings initiated by FCCS. Beck, however, did not meet L.C.C. or either of the parties prior to her re-appointment in 2017 after appellee filed the petition to adopt. According to Beck, she visited appellee's home on September 14, 2017, and in her September 14, 2017 report, she recommended that appellee maintain legal custody of L.C.C. Beck stated that if the court were to order a change of custody, she recommended a gradual reunification with appellant in the presence of a third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Following an October 17, 2017 interview with appellant, Beck recommended that legal custody remain with appellee and that appellant have no parenting time prior to the next scheduled hearing in the adoption case on December 22, 2017. According to Beck, L.C.C. was nearly five years of age, and he had no conception of who appellant was and no bond with appellant. Beck testified in her deposition that L.C.C. recognized appellee as the maternal figure in his life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 67} According to Beck, appellant was in no position to be awarded custody of L.C.C. in October 2014, when the juvenile court awarded permanent custody to appellee, and that appellant's own choices since that time have prevented her from having contact with L.C.C. Beck acknowledged on cross-examination that she did not investigate appellant's drug rehabilitation efforts, but she stated that appellant could have provided her with that information at the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Appellant did not testify at the February 6, 2018 hearing but she did give a closing statement, under oath, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   I've never denied having a drug problem. I have fought my demons for a long time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   I'm not trying to uproot my child from the only thing he knows. That's why, in juvenile court, I went for supervised visits because I don't want to take him from the home he knows. I want to reestablish, reconnect, and regrow with him over a period of time so that eventually I can bring him home, but that's going to be a long road and I understand that. The last thing I want to do is anything to hurt him. That's why he was placed with her to begin with because I couldn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Everything is based upon the assumption if I fail. I'm doing everything I can to continue and ensure - to ensure that I don't fail, that I don't fall. I'm still in aftercare. I could have been discharged. I asked not to be because I don't think that's a good idea, especially with everything going on with the courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   (Feb. 6, 2018 Tr. at 47-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 69} When a court makes a determination in a contested adoption concerning the best interest of a child, R.C. 3107.161(B) dictates that the court shall consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   (1) The least detrimental available alternative for safeguarding the child's growth and development;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   (2) The age and health of the child at the time the best interest determination is made and, if applicable, at the time the child was removed from the home;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   (3) The wishes of the child in any case in which the child's age and maturity makes this feasible;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   (4) The duration of the separation of the child from a parent;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   (5) Whether the child will be able to enter into a more stable and permanent family relationship, taking into account the conditions of the child's current placement, the likelihood of future placements, and the results of prior placements;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   (6) The likelihood of safe reunification with a parent within a reasonable period of time;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   (7) The importance of providing permanency, stability, and continuity of relationships for the child;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   (8) The child's interaction and interrelationship with the child's parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interest;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   (9) The child's adjustment to the child's current home, school, and community;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   (10) The mental and physical health of all persons involved in the situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Under R.C. 3107.161(C), \"[a] person who contests an adoption has the burden of providing the court material evidence needed to determine what is in the best interest of the child and must establish that the child's current placement is not the least detrimental available alternative.\" The trial court analyzed the evidence presented both at the hearing before the magistrate and the additional evidence presented to the trial court on February 6, 2018, in light of the factors set forth in R.C. 3107.161(B). The trial court found that \"[e]very factor for consideration contained in R.C. 3107.161(B) weighs in favor of the adoption being in the child's best interests.\" (Mar. 6, 2018 Decision at 22.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our evaluation of the statutory factors in light of the evidence before the trial court convinces us that the trial court did not\n   abuse its discretion when it refused to adopt the magistrate's conclusions of law and instead concluded that the adoption by appellee was in L.C.C.'s best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Appellant acknowledged that appellee has provided L.C.C. with a \"very nurturing, caring home\" and that she is not currently in a position to do so. (May 18, 2017 Tr. at 24.) Though appellant testified in detail about her current rehabilitation efforts while serving time in the CBCF and possible scenarios where she could resume care of L.C.C. at some future date and time, the evidence shows that L.C.C. has been in the custody and care of appellee virtually his entire life. The evidence establishes that appellee is the sole maternal figure in his life and that L.C.C. has no bond with appellant. We agree with the trial court that due to the time that has elapsed since L.C.C.'s initial placement with appellee and appellant's ongoing issues with drug addiction and incarceration, there is no longer a likelihood of successful reunification with appellant within a reasonable period of time. The evidence in the record leaves little doubt that adoption by appellee is the least detrimental available alternative for safeguarding L.C.C.'s growth and development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Moreover, our review of the magistrate's decision reveals that the magistrate placed a great deal of emphasis on appellee's progress with her court-ordered counseling and treatment programs and endeavored to reach an outcome that would maintain the status quo and permit appellant to retain her parental rights. The trial court, however, placed the emphasis on the best interest of L.C.C., as is required by statutory law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   {\u00b6 73} This court will reverse a probate court's best-interest determination only if we find an abuse of discretion, which means that the court's decision is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    In re B.M.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695581\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/192/394/\">\n    192 Ohio App.3d 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-714\">\n    2011-Ohio-714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20N.E.2d%20111\">\n    949 N.E.2d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14 (10th Dist.), citing\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of Ridenour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1708743\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/319/#p320\">\n    61 Ohio St.3d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 320,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=574%20N.E.2d%201055\">\n    574 N.E.2d 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991).
