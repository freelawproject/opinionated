Trooper Golias initiated the traffic stop due to appellant's truck not displaying a front-end license plate. Appellant was operating a Dodge Ram pickup truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Upon approaching appellant's vehicle, Trooper Golias noticed that the truck's steering column had been \"peeled,\" meaning that the plastic around the ignition had been pulled away from the steering column to access the ignition mechanisms. He was then under the suspicion that the truck appellant was operating may have been stolen or tampered with. Upon noticing the peeled steering column, he removed appellant from the truck, conducted a consensual pat-down, and placed appellant in his police cruiser. Trooper Golias then attempted to identify the public vehicle identification number (VIN), which is located on the dashboard, but was unable to do so because there was black spray paint on the windshield which covered the VIN. Trooper Golias also discovered a secondary VIN on the truck inside the door frame that was also covered with black spray paint. Eventually, Trooper Golias was able to scrape away enough of the spray paint on the windshield to ascertain the public VIN. The public VIN indicated that the truck belonged to appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} There were several other factors that lead to Trooper Golias' suspicion that the truck appellant was operating was stolen, which lead to a continued search. These factors included: a cracked dashboard, missing screws from the dashboard, appellant's apparent level of nervousness, appellant's overtalkative nature, and appellant's explanation that he changed out the dashboard but the newly installed dashboard was damaged. Appellant attempted to explain that he purchased the truck inexpensively and had replaced many components including the interior and the windshield. Trooper Golias contacted Trooper Skaggs, who was a specialist in stolen vehicles, to assist with the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Upon Trooper Skaggs' arrival at the scene, he began to investigate the truck. First, he noted that an anonymous tip was reported stating that there was a Dodge Ram pickup truck matching the description of the truck appellant was operating that was possibly a retagged vehicle. Trooper Skaggs also noted that: the door markings identified the truck as a Dodge 1500 series but the chassis was a Dodge 2500 series; the dashboard itself was a different color than the rest of the interior of the truck; and the truck's engine was missing its body tag. Furthermore, Trooper Skaggs noticed that the truck's VIN indicated that the truck contained a 5.9 liter gas engine but the truck had a 5.9 liter turbo Cummins intercooled diesel engine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} At the conclusion of Trooper Skaggs' inspection, Troopers Golias and Skaggs impounded appellant's truck in order to perform a more thorough investigation. But they decided not to arrest appellant at that time. They gave appellant the option of transporting the truck to the highway patrol post himself or having the troopers call for a tow truck. Appellant opted to drive the truck to the highway patrol post himself. Appellant was then free to leave after he left the truck in the troopers' possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The next day, Trooper Skaggs continued his investigation of the vehicle. He located the secondary concealed VIN\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   on the truck. The secondary VIN did not match the public VIN located on the dashboard. When he ran the secondary VIN through the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) and the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) databases, he discovered that the secondary VIN was for a Dodge 2500 series truck reported as stolen from Cornerstone Motors (Cornerstone) in Columbiana, Ohio. Trooper Skaggs also followed up with the public VIN on the dashboard and discovered the original owner, Amanda Varney. Varney told him that she had sold appellant a maroon Dodge Ram 1500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Trooper Skaggs also noted that the truck registered as stolen indicated it had approximately 141,000 miles on it. Appellant's odometer at the time he was stopped by Trooper Golias read 145,213 miles. But the title of the vehicle when Varney sold the truck to appellant indicated that the truck she sold had almost 250,000 miles on it. Trooper Skaggs then concluded that the VIN of the vehicle appellant purchased from Varney was placed on the stolen vehicle from Cornerstone in order to conceal the fact that it was stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant was then charged and indicted with one count of receiving stolen property in the form of a vehicle, a fourth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2913.51(A), and one count of tampering with vehicle identifying numbers, a fifth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 4549.62(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant filed a motion to suppress seeking to exclude virtually all evidence police obtained in this case. In his supporting memorandum, appellant argued that all evidence should be suppressed due to: a lack of reasonable suspicion to conduct a traffic stop, a lack of reasonable suspicion to continue appellant's detention and the investigation of the truck, and any and all statements made by appellant were obtained prior to appellant being read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. At the suppression hearing, Trooper Golias testified that a video tape of appellant's stop and detention existed. But the video had not been produced because it was erased by the Ohio State Highway Patrol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} After the suppression hearing, the trial court gave appellant leave to file a motion addressing the missing tape. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that the erased video tape contained potentially exculpatory evidence and should have been preserved and disclosed by the prosecution. Appellant requested a hearing with the trial court on his motion to dismiss. The trial court overruled both appellant's motion to suppress and motion to dismiss without further hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The matter proceeded to a jury trial. Troopers Golias and Skaggs were the only witnesses. The jury returned guilty verdicts on both counts. The trial court subsequently sentenced appellant to five years of community control, which included six months of incarceration on each count to be served consecutively for a total jail sentence of one year. The court also ordered appellant to pay restitution of $1,000 to Cornerstone and $10,713.38 to Auto Owner's Insurance, Cornerstone's insurance company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant timely filed this appeal on July 15, 2016. He now raises ten assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant's first assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO SUPPRESS ALL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS, FROM THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL STOP, SEIZURE, AND SEARCH OF APPELLANT AND HIS VEHICLE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant makes several arguments concerning this assignment of error. First, appellant argues that he was arrested as a result of his original traffic stop and such arrest and subsequent search of the truck was not supported by probable cause. Next, appellant argues that he was unconstitutionally seized when Troopers Golias and Skaggs prolonged his traffic stop. Finally, appellant argues that the seizure of the truck was unconstitutional because it was done so without a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} A motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate witness credibility.\n   <em>\n    State v. Burnside\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1190316\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/100/152/\">\n    100 Ohio St. 3d 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003-Ohio-5372\">\n    2003-Ohio-5372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=797%20N.E.2d%2071\">\n    797 N.E.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8. The appellate court must accept the trial court's findings of fact if they are supported by competent and credible evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=797%20N.E.2d%2071\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accepting these facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=797%20N.E.2d%2071\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The only witness who testified at the suppression hearing was Trooper Golias. He testified that he initiated the traffic stop for failure to display a front license plate on an Ohio-registered motor vehicle. (Supp. Tr. 14-15, 33, Exhibit 1). This testimony was not contradicted throughout the suppression hearing. As operating a motor vehicle without a front license plate is a violation of R.C. 4503.21, sufficient reasonable suspicion existed for Trooper Golias to stop appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Next, appellant argues that he was arrested without probable cause when Trooper Golias immediately removed him from the truck and placed him in the police cruiser. An arrest involves four elements: (1) an intent to arrest; (2) under a real or pretended authority; (3) an actual or constructive seizure or detention of a person; and (4) the intent is understood by the person arrested.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This would include Trooper Golias requesting another officer's presence who specializes in the investigation of stolen vehicles. Ultimately, appellant's prolonged detention was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Finally, appellant argues that Troopers Golias and Skaggs did not have a warrant to seize his car and there was no valid warrant exception.

The fact that appellant was not arrested when Troopers Golias and Skaggs seized the truck does not negate the fact that there was sufficient probable cause for the troopers to seize the truck. Ultimately, because the contraband at issue was the truck and sufficient probable cause to believe it was stolen existed, the troopers' seizure of the truck was not a violation of appellant's Fourth Amendment right to be free from an unreasonable seizure as it was pursuant to the automobile exception of the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Accordingly, appellant's first assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Appellant's second assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING HEARSAY TESTIMONY\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   AND DOCUMENTS, AS WELL AS OPINION TESTIMONY BY AN OFFICER, FOR WHICH NO EXCEPTION EXISTED UNDER THE RULES OF EVIDENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellant argues that the opinions and evidence that led the troopers to conclude that the truck was stolen constituted hearsay and should have been excluded at trial.

(Trial Tr. 309-310, 316). Trooper Skaggs testified that the truck was maroon when Varney sold it to appellant. (Trial Tr. 309). He further testified that the VIN on the truck indicated that it should have had a different engine than the engine that was actually in the truck. (Trial Tr. 310). And he testified that a photograph of the truck provided by Varney showed that the truck did not have a gap between the headlights and the bumper at the time of the sale. (Trial Tr. 316). Appellant objected to the trooper's testimony as to what Varney told him on the basis of hearsay. (Trial Tr. 309, 310, 316).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Evid.R. 801(C). Generally, hearsay is inadmissible. Evid.R. 802.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Varney told Trooper Skaggs about the physical description of the truck when she sold it to appellant. This physical description of the truck when Varney sold it to appellant was used to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In other words, it was used to prove that the truck at the time of the sale was maroon, had a different engine, and did not have gap between the headlights and the bumper. Moreover, the state then used this hearsay to show that Varney's truck's identity was placed on the Cornerstone truck in order to conceal the fact that the Cornerstone truck was stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Trooper Skaggs' testimony about the physical characteristics of the truck when Varney sold the truck to appellant was hearsay. Importantly, the state used this hearsay to establish a significant aspect of its case. Without evidence of what the truck registered to the public VIN was supposed to look like, the jury would not be able to ascertain whether the truck appellant was driving belonged to him or not. Thus, we conclude that the trial court erred in admitting this testimony over appellant's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Second, appellant argues that any reference regarding information Trooper Skaggs recovered from the NICB and the NCIC databases was inadmissible hearsay. Appellant did not object to these references to the two databases. (Trial Tr. 294-295, 300). Failure to\n   object to trial testimony waives all but plain error review.\n   <em>\n    State v.

No. CA2004-11-015,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-4194\">\n    2005-Ohio-4194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201939768\">\n    2005 WL 1939768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21-22. Trooper Skaggs testified that he ran the VINs through the databases as he was describing the steps he took in his investigation. (Trial Tr. 294-295, 300). The trooper's testimony regarding his investigation as a whole, including results from the NICB and the NCIC, was meant to show the continuing course of the investigation into the truck. Ultimately, the trial court did not commit plain error by allowing the testimony concerning these two databases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Third, appellant challenges Trooper Skaggs' testimony as to the contents of a Columbiana Police Report dated March 10, 2014. (Trial Tr. 304; State's Ex. 22). Trooper Skaggs testified that the police report concerned a vehicle stolen from Cornerstone and that the VIN number of the stolen vehicle matched the VIN number from the truck at issue. (Trial Tr. 304-305). Appellant did not object. The state withdrew Exhibit 22 during the introduction of exhibits noting that \"it was not drafted by one of the witnesses.\" (Trial Tr. 364).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Trooper Skaggs' testimony as to the information contained in the Columbiana Police Report was inadmissible hearsay. The Columbiana Police Report was drafted by an officer who did not testify at appellant's trial and the statements in the report were used to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Officer Skaggs' testimony regarding the contents of the report was offered to prove that the VIN located on appellant's truck matched a VIN for a truck reported stolen from Cornerstone. It was plain error for the trial court to allow Trooper Skaggs to testify as to the contents of this report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Fourth, appellant challenges Trooper Skaggs' testimony concerning statements made by Chad Zwingler from Cornerstone to him. Specifically, appellant challenges the following testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    Q\n   </strong>\n   Were you able to ascertain any information regarding the tires on this vehicle after speaking with Cornerstone?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n   The information that the Cornerstone Chad Zwingler provided to me - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Joltin:\n   </strong>\n   Objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    The Court:\n   </strong>\n   Sustained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    Q\n   </strong>\n   Give me a minute. After following up on your investigation with Cornerstone, pursuant to your investigation, were you able to determine the type of tires that this vehicle had?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n   Yes. And the tires were consistent with what the vehicle had on it at the time that they were stolen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   (Trial Tr. 306).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 43} This testimony is also hearsay as it is based on statements from Cornerstone's representative. Trooper Skaggs never testified that he personally investigated or saw the truck stolen from Cornerstone. Any information regarding the type of tires on that truck was gained from statements conveyed to him by Zwingler, who did not testify. These statements were used to show that the tires on appellant's truck were consistent with the tires on the truck stolen from Cornerstone. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing\n   Trooper Skaggs' testimony as to what he learned from Cornerstone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Fifth, appellant challenges Trooper Skaggs' testimony that an anonymous tip was called in regarding a \"black semi-gloss primer Dodge Ram pickup truck which frequented the Mineral Ridge, Austintown area that was possibly a retagged vehicle specifically involving Bryan Dotson.\" (Trial Tr. 290). This statement is not hearsay as it was offered to show the effect on the listener. Responding to the very next question, Trooper Skaggs testified that he relayed that information to Trooper Golias so Trooper Golias could keep an eye out for a vehicle matching that description. (Trial Tr. 290).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Finally, appellant argues that it was improper to allow Troopers Skaggs and Golias to testify regarding their opinions about whether appellant was guilty of a crime. Appellant cites two specific instances where he claims this happened. The first instance occurred during Trooper Golias' testimony where the trooper testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   The Federal Identification decal looks like this. You probably will all recognize them after you look at your car. It has the full VIN number that's on it. When it's - - you cannot alter, tamper or destroy that because just like a public VIN number, it identifies that vehicle. It cannot be removed. It can't be covered. When it's covered like this we've got to make sure we have the true identity of the vehicle. This is the picture of it with the black spray paint over it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   (Trial Tr. 257-258). The second instance was during Trooper Skaggs' testimony when asked what he noticed during his initial investigation. The trooper stated, \"I opened the door to look at the Federal Identification decal, and it had been partially painted over, in violation of the Ohio Revised Code. The dashboard VIN, public VIN.\" (Trial Tr. 292).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 46} \"If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

As both of these pieces of testimony from Troopers Skaggs and Golias identify the fact that a VIN in the truck was concealed and this was a violation of the Ohio Revised Code, which ultimately led to the investigation of the truck at issue being stolen, the elements of Evid.R. 701 are satisfied and it was not an abuse of discretion to permit this testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Given the substantial amount of inadmissible hearsay that the trial court admitted, appellant was denied his right to fair a trial. While the state did introduce other admissible evidence that may have proved the elements of receiving stolen property, we cannot overlook the potential effect the significant amount of inadmissible hearsay likely had on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 48} We note, however, the inadmissible hearsay evidence did not impact appellant's tampering with vehicle identification numbers conviction. The inadmissible hearsay evidence was offered to prove the elements of receiving stolen property. Thus, our resolution of this assignment of error only affects appellant's receiving stolen property conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Accordingly, appellant's second assignment of error has merit in part and is sustained in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Appellant's third assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT VIOLATED APPELLANT'S RIGHTS UNDER THE CONFRONTATION CLAUSE BY ALLOWING PREJUDICIAL HEARSAY STATEMENTS TO OVERWHELM APPELLANT'S TRIAL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 51} In addition to the arguments raised in his second assignment of error, appellant argues Trooper Skaggs' testimony as to what others told him regarding the truck and as to the Columbiana Police Report violated his right to confront the witnesses against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The Confrontation Clause prohibits the introduction of testimonial statements by a non-testifying witness (unless that witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross examination).\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, in conducting our sufficiency review, we must consider all of the evidence offered by the state in this case, including the inadmissible hearsay evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 65} The evidence at trial showed that appellant was operating a truck with two VINs concealed with black spray paint (Trial Tr. 270), appellant was the one who spray painted the truck black (Trial Tr. 252), and the public VIN was different from the secondary VIN (Trial Tr. 299-300). Moreover, the evidence indicated that the truck Varney sold to appellant was a different color than the truck he was driving (Trial Tr. 309), did not have a gap between the headlights and bumper (Trial Tr. 316), and had a different engine than it did (Trial Tr. 310). And the evidence demonstrated that a police report was filed regarding a stolen vehicle with the same VIN that was located on the truck appellant was driving. (Trial Tr. 304-305). When construing this evidence in the light most favorable to the state, as we are required to do, sufficient evidence existed to prove receiving stolen property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 66} The tampering with vehicle identifying numbers statute provides: \"No person, with purpose to conceal or destroy the identity of a vehicle part, shall remove, deface, cover, alter, or destroy any vehicle identification number or derivative of a vehicle identification number on a vehicle or vehicle part.\" R.C. 4549.62(A).

Additionally, two of the items appellant takes issue with in this appeal that he asserts his counsel should have objected to (the reference to the national databases and the troopers' opinions), we have found to be admissible statements. Thus, no objection was warranted. The only item counsel failed to object to that this court found to be inadmissible hearsay was Trooper Skaggs' testimony regarding the contents of the Columbiana Police Report.

As such, it is incumbent on appellant to show that the tape's unavailability was the result of bad faith on the part of the state. See\n   <em>\n    Tarleton\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Appellant's argument is that because the trial court denied appellant's motion without a hearing, appellant was unable to ascertain necessary facts to determine if the tape was destroyed in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   {\u00b6 88} On August 5, 2015, appellant filed a motion for discovery and to examine exculpatory and mitigatory material with the trial court. This motion requested, among other things, \"[a]ll statements of any kind within the possession of the State, made by the Defendant and/or any co-Defendants.\" On the same day, appellant filed a motion to disclose and made specific requests for exculpatory evidence. The first time appellant or his trial counsel\n   learned of the existence of a videotape was on January 28, 2016, the date of appellant's suppression hearing. At that hearing, Trooper Golias testified on cross-examination that there was in fact an audiotape or videotape of appellant's traffic stop. (Supp. Tr. 43). Said tape was not provided to the prosecutor's office. (Supp. Tr. 43-44). After a brief recess, it was concluded that any recording of appellant's traffic stop was overwritten pursuant to the Ohio State Highway Patrol's standard retention policy. (Supp. Tr. 45). According to the state, this was done because \"it was not requested by any party to be retained.\" (Supp. Tr. 45). The court then granted appellant two weeks to prepare a motion regarding the deleted recording. (Supp. Tr. 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 89} Appellant's original traffic stop occurred on May 22, 2014. (Supp. Tr. state's exhibit 1). Appellant was indicted on July 9, 2015, over 13 months after his traffic stop. Appellant filed his discovery requests almost one month after that on August 5, 2015. While a hearing on appellant's motion to dismiss may have provided more evidence relevant to the tape, it was appellant's burden to show a reasonable probability that the information on the tape would to undermine the confidence of the outcome or that the tape was erased due to bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   {\u00b6 90} Appellant's motion to dismiss alleged no specific facts about what was allegedly on the tape that was exculpatory in nature. Appellant's brief in this appeal is also silent on what the tape may have contained that was potentially exculpatory. The only thing known for certain from the record is that a tape existed and was erased pursuant to the Ohio State Highway Patrol's retention policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   {\u00b6 91} Nevertheless, appellant cites two cases where other districts have held that when the state breaches its duty to respond in good faith to a defense request to preserve evidence, the appropriate remedy is to shift the burden of proof to the state as to the exculpatory value of the evidence.

But this Court has held that\n   <em>\n    Forest\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Benton\n   </em>\n   do not apply when the defendant does not file a specific and immediate request, where there was no indication that the state acted in bad faith, and the value of the tape was only questionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tarleton\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. Moreover, this Court held that the burden shifting approach set forth in\n   <em>\n    Forest\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Benton\n   </em>\n   only applied when the state fails to respond in good faith to a defendant's request to preserve evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ultimately, because appellant makes no arguments concerning the contents of the tape and there is no evidence that the state acted in bad faith when it erased the tape, appellant failed to meet his burden that the tape would have had a reasonable probability to affect the outcome of his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   {\u00b6 92} Accordingly, appellant's seventh assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   {\u00b6 93} Appellant's eighth assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   THE STATE COMMITTED PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT BY DELIBERATELY ADMITTING INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY EVIDENCE TO THE JURY ONLY TO WITHDRAW THAT EVIDENCE ONCE INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY TESTIMONY HAD BEEN ELICITED REGARDING THE SAME.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   {\u00b6 94} Appellant argues that, in two instances, the state committed prosecutorial misconduct by eliciting testimony concerning\n   two proposed exhibits only to later withdraw those proposed exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   {\u00b6 95} Given our resolution of appellant's second and third assignments of error, appellant's eighth assignment of error is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   {\u00b6 96} Appellant's ninth assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ACTED CONTRARY TO LAW IN SENTENCING APPELLANT TO CONSECUTIVE JAIL TERMS AS PART OF A COMMUNITY CONTROL SANCTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   {\u00b6 97} Appellant argues that his sentence was contrary to law in that the trial court ordered him to serve two six month jail terms consecutively as part of a community control sanction. Furthermore, appellant argues that a jail term of 12 months is contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   {\u00b6 98} The trial court sentenced appellant to five years of community control with the Adult Parole Authority. As a condition of community control, the court ordered appellant to serve the first six months of each count in jail and for those two jail terms to run consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   {\u00b6 99} Because we are reversing appellant's conviction for receiving stolen property, his sentence on that count is necessarily vacated.
