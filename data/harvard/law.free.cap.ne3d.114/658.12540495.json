For the following reasons, this Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Mother and Father were not married when Mother gave birth to J.L.M (d.o.b. 2/19/13) and R.J. (d.o.b. 4/4/14). Based on concerns regarding neglect, physical abuse, and drug use in the parents' home, Summit County Children Services Board (\"CSB\") instituted a safety plan shortly after R.J.'s birth, whereby the children were placed with Great Grandparents. At the same time, Mother and Father had supervised visitation and agreed to participate in drug treatment services. When Mother and Father failed to follow through with drug treatment, thereby leaving the children at risk and preventing reunification, CSB filed complaints on October 16, 2014, alleging that J.L.M. was a dependent and neglected child, and that R.J. was a dependent and abused child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} At the later adjudicatory and dispositional hearings, Mother and Father both agreed that J.L.M. was dependent and neglected, that R.J. was dependent and abused, and that the children would be placed in the temporary custody of Great Grandparents, while CSB would retain an order of protective supervision. The agency subsequently filed a motion for legal custody to Great Grandparents. After a hearing, the juvenile court granted CSB's motion, awarding legal custody to Great Grandparents and terminating the order of protective supervision. Mother and Father were both awarded visitation with the children as the parties might agree, but in no event fewer than three hours of supervised visitation per week. The juvenile court docketed the case as closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Approximately six months later, Grandmother filed a motion for visitation solely with the older child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Legal Custodians filed a response captioned as and in the style of an answer to a complaint. Although the magistrate found that Grandmother had not properly served all the parties, he nevertheless ordered that she be allowed weekly visitation at a paid visitation center in the interim. The magistrate further appointed a guardian ad litem. Legal Custodians filed a motion to dismiss Grandmother's motion, to show cause, and to stay the visitation order. The magistrate stayed the visitation order and scheduled a show cause hearing, where Grandmother would be required to show cause why she had not paid the deposit for\n   the guardian's fee. At a status hearing two weeks later, the magistrate learned that Mother had died that morning. The magistrate vacated his order staying Grandmother's visitation and reinstated her weekly supervised visitation. Legal Custodians immediately moved to set aside the magistrate's order, arguing inter alia that Grandmother was not a party and had not moved to intervene in the case, and that she had no standing to intervene after final disposition had been ordered. Legal Custodians also filed a motion to stay Grandmother's visitation, arguing that Grandmother lacked standing to move for visitation, that there was no statutory authority to grant Grandmother visitation, and that visitation was not in the best interest of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The juvenile court concluded that there was statutory authority to allow a grandparent to move for visitation, but it agreed that Grandmother was not a party and had not moved to intervene so that the court could consider her motion. The juvenile court stayed the order granting Grandmother visitation pending a hearing to determine her standing to intervene. In the meantime, Legal Custodians supplemented their motion to dismiss Grandmother's motion for visitation. The magistrate granted Legal Custodians' motion to dismiss, because Grandmother had not moved to intervene in the case. The juvenile court adopted the decision the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Three months later, Grandmother filed a motion to intervene and a motion for visitation with both children based on Mother's death. Legal Custodians renewed their motion to dismiss Grandmother's request for visitation. They raised multiple grounds, including the lack of juvenile court jurisdiction to consider third-party visitation after legal custody has been granted, the lack of statutory authority to allow Grandmother to intervene or obtain visitation rights, and res judicata. Grandmother responded in opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After a two-day hearing, the magistrate issued a decision granting Grandmother leave to intervene and ordering that she be allowed to visit with the children for two hours each month at a private visitation center at her expense. Legal Custodians filed timely objections. After its independent review, the juvenile court overruled Legal Custodians' objections and ordered that Grandmother be permitted to intervene in the action and, further, that she be allowed to have supervised visitation with the children. Legal Custodians filed a timely appeal in which they raise four assignments of error for review. Grandmother filed a brief in response, while CSB filed a notice that the agency would not be participating in the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT FAILED TO PROPERLY STATE A BASIS FOR ITS SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION TO HEAR A THIRD PARTY INTERVENTION AND REQUEST FOR VISITATION SUBSEQUENT TO THE GRANT OF LEGAL CUSTODY[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Great Grandparents argue that the juvenile court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider Grandmother's motions to intervene and for visitation with the children. Specifically, Great Grandparents argue that the juvenile court lost jurisdiction to consider such motions, because its original exclusive jurisdiction had terminated as soon as CSB was awarded temporary custody of the children. Great Grandparents' argument is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The juvenile court's determination regarding its subject matter jurisdiction implicates a question of law\n   which this Court reviews de novo.\n   <em>\n    Lorain Cty.

Exercising its continuing jurisdiction over the children, the court awarded legal custody to Great Grandparents and closed the case on its docket, \"subject to [the juvenile] court's continuing jurisdiction over the Children pursuant to R.C. 2151.353(F)(1).\" Admittedly, the juvenile court has no jurisdiction to consider a grandparent's complaint solely for visitation brought pursuant to Revised Code Section 2151.23(A)(2), which grants it exclusive original jurisdiction \"to determine custody of any child not a ward of another court of this state[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1708728\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/168/#p172\">\n    61 Ohio St.3d at 171-173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20N.E.2d%201074\">\n    573 N.E.2d 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The juvenile court, however, was exercising its continuing jurisdiction pursuant to Revised Code Section 2151.23(A)(1). As a parent of a child placed in the legal custody\n   of another person may move to modify his or her visitation with the child pursuant to the juvenile court's continuing jurisdiction, it is axiomatic that any other person who would otherwise have the right to pursue visitation with the child could also seek to do so pursuant to the court's continuing jurisdiction. Accordingly, as long as Grandmother had a right to seek visitation with the children, the juvenile court had the jurisdiction to consider her request through the exercise of its continuing jurisdiction over these children for whom it previously issued an order of disposition pursuant to Revised Code Section 2151.353(A), arising out of its exclusive original jurisdiction pursuant to Revised Code Section 2151.23(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Revised Code Sections 3109.11 and 3109.12(A) respectively give any relative, including grandparents, standing to seek visitation with a child whose parent is deceased or whose mother was unmarried at the time of the child's birth. Here, Mother is deceased. Moreover, Mother gave birth to both children while she was unmarried. There is no dispute that Grandmother is the mother, i.e., a relative, of Mother. Because Grandmother has a statutory right to seek visitation with the children, and the juvenile court retains continuing jurisdiction to issue orders regarding them, the juvenile court did not err by determining that it had jurisdiction to consider Grandmother's motions to intervene and for visitation. Great Grandparents' first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN PERMITTING [GRANDMOTHER] TO INTERVENE AND PROCEED ON HER MOTION FOR VISITATION[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Great Grandparents argue that the juvenile court erred when it permitted Grandmother to intervene for the purpose of prosecuting her motion for visitation.

As the evidence demonstrated that Grandmother had a colorable claim of a right to visitation pursuant to statute, the juvenile court did not err by granting Grandmother's motion to intervene in order to prosecute her motion for visitation with the children.

In fact, Grandmother premised her request on statutory grounds primarily pursuant to Revised Code Section 3109.11 that Mother, her daughter, was deceased. Grandmother could not have raised that claim during the pendency of the dependency, neglect, abuse case prior to the court's award of legal custody to Great Grandparents, because Mother had not yet passed away at that time. Under the circumstances, Grandmother's request for visitation with the children was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata, and the juvenile court did not err by failing to dismiss her motion.

In addition, except for one citation to a finding (which they challenge) by the juvenile court in its judgment, Great Grandparents have failed to cite to the record in support of their argument, as required by Appellate Rule 16(A)(7). Instead, they construe Mother's and Father's visitation orders arising out of the legal custody judgment as a restriction on Grandmother's ability to see the children; they pose unanswered questions for this Court requiring our speculation; and they note their ongoing \"concern for the children based on their personal knowledge and experience of [Grandmother's] past behavior[.]\" Under these circumstances, and bearing in mind the presumption in favor of the finder of fact, Great Grandparents have failed to demonstrate that the juvenile court clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the judgment must be reversed and a new hearing ordered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eastley\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 26} To the extent that the juvenile court acknowledged any concerns regarding Grandmother's ability to influence the children or their exposure to her, those concerns were outweighed by the benefit of having a relationship with their deceased mother's family in a strictly limited and controlled environment. The juvenile court limited Grandmother's visitation with the children to one two-hour supervised visit each month in a structured, commercial visitation center, for which Grandmother must bear the cost. Because the visitation supervisor would have the authority to deny Grandmother the ability to visit with the children on the center's premises if she appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or if she violated the juvenile court's restrictions on certain topics of conversation with the children, any grave concerns for the safety and well-being of the children are alleviated. Accordingly, the juvenile court's highly restricted visitation award for Grandmother was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.
