(collectively referred to as \"CBCC\") for a conditional-use zoning certificate to operate a sand and gravel quarry in Harrison Township, CBCC appealed the decision to the Pickaway County Court of Common Pleas under R.C. Chapter 2506.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The common pleas court denied CBCC's appeal and affirmed the board's decision denying its application for a conditional-use zoning certificate because: (1) the board properly considered Section 9.03 of the Harrison Township Zoning Resolution, as allowed by R.C. 519.141, in denying CBCC's application; and (2) substantial, reliable, and probative evidence was introduced at the board's proceedings to support the board's findings that some sections of Section 9.03 of the zoning resolution were not met. The court also granted CBCC's motion to strike a binder containing evidence and argument submitted by Berger Health System (\"Berger Health\") in the board proceedings because it was not considered by the board in its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On appeal, CBCC asserts that the common pleas court erred by failing to limit its review of its request for a conditional-use zoning certificate for sand and gravel mining to criteria that are \"only in the interest of public health or safety\" and \"matters that are [not] regulated by any federal, state, or local agency\" as required by R.C. 519.02 and 519.141(A). We conclude that the court, the board, and Berger Health properly relied on a reading of R.C. 519.141(A) that comports with its plain language: that the board \"may require as a\n   <em>\n    condition of the approval of a conditional zoning certificate\n   </em>\n   for such an activity\n   <em>\n    compliance with any general standards contained in the zoning resolution that apply to all conditional uses that are provided for in the zoning resolution\n   </em>\n   * * *.\" That is, the board of zoning appeals is authorized to treat compliance with general standards in a zoning resolution as a condition precedent to the approval of a conditional zoning certificate. Therefore, Sections 9.03(B), (E), and (F) of the township zoning resolution could be considered by the board to deny CBCC's application for a conditional zoning certificate for sand and gravel mining on its property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} CBCC next claims that the common pleas court's decision is not supported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative admissible evidence as a matter of law. We reject this claim because our review of the record establishes that the common pleas court's decision was supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. We overrule CBCC's first and second assignments of error and affirm the judgment affirming the board's decision denying CBCC's application for a conditional-use zoning certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On cross-appeal, Berger Health contends that if the court reverses the common pleas court's judgment, we should consider its claim that the common pleas court erred by granting CBCC's motion to strike its binder of evidence and argument from the administrative record. Because our affirmance of the court's judgment on the merits renders the cross-appeal moot, we need not address it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Columbus Bituminous Concrete Corporation owns 178.9 acres of land in Harrison Township, Pickaway County, Ohio that Shelly Materials, Inc. wants to mine for sand and gravel. The property is zoned General Business District and Flood Plain Overlay District, and the township zoning resolution permits quarrying and mining as conditional uses in the General Business District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} CBCC applied for a conditional zoning certificate to use the property for sand and gravel surface mining at a quarry on Weigand Road in Harrison Township. The property is bordered on the north by property owned by the city of Columbus that is vacant and zoned Agricultural District, on the east by property owned by Davon, Inc., that is zoned Agricultural District and Flood Plain District and contains a concrete batch plant, on the south by property owned by Berger Health that is zoned and used as an Agricultural District, and on the west by U.S. 23 and beyond the highway by property that is zoned Agricultural District. The Pickaway County Engineer approved CBCC's proposed ingress and egress to the mining site and concluded that the road improvements should be sufficient to accommodate the additional truck traffic related to the quarry and also vastly improve the safety of the nearby intersection of Weigand Road and U.S. 23. The Pickaway County Commissioners adopted the engineer's approval of the proposed ingress/egress improvements to the quarry site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The board conducted a hearing on CBCC's application. CBCC presented the testimony of several individuals, who testified that: (1) the mining operation will include mounds that will act as sound, sight, and safety barriers from adjoining property; (2) spill-protection plans for the project will be monitored by the Ohio EPA; (3) roughly 180 truck trips a day are estimated for the project; (4) the project will adhere to all federal, state, and local regulations; (5) the dust from the operation will be regulated by the Ohio EPA and mitigated by using water; (6) the project will not have any effect on the level or quality of nearby residential wells; (7) the project will not cause a rise in the 100-year floodplain; (8) the project, with its included mounds, would not increase the noise level of the surrounding area; and (9) the project complies with all applicable standards of the township zoning resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} A Berger Health representative testified that the plan conflicted with the North Gate Alliance Strategic Land Use Plan and was at odds with its own plans for the future development of land they owned to the south of the CBCC property. An engineer testified that he believed that another hydraulic and hydrologic study was required to test the impact of the proposed mining upstream. And an economic development director testified that the proposed mining would violate the North Gate plan by disrupting planned north-south access roads that would run parallel to U.S. 23 and exit onto Weigand Road and not limiting gravel quarrying to the west side of U.S. 23. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board denied CBCC's application without stating any findings. In a written decision mailed almost two weeks later, the board of zoning appeals stated that \"[a]fter considering all of the evidence submitted to the [board], the [board] determined that applicant was unable to affirmatively prove all the requirements of Section 9.03 of the Harrison Township Zoning [Resolution].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} CBCC timely appealed the denial of its application for a conditional zoning certificate to the Pickaway County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506. It named the board of zoning appeals, the township zoning inspector, Harrison Township, Berger Health, and two individuals as appellees. After the parties submitted briefs and CBCC moved to strike a binder submitted by Berger Health at the final board hearing, the court issued a decision granting the motion to strike and affirming the decision of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The trial court concluded that under R.C. 519.141(A), the board of zoning\n   appeals was permitted to require compliance with all of its general standards that apply to all conditional uses as well as any specified measure listed in the statute. It further concluded that the administrative record contained substantial, reliable, and probative evidence that divisions (B), (E), and (F) of Section 9.03 of the Harrison Township Zoning Resolution were not met because: (1) the proposed use was not harmonious and appropriate to the existing or intended character of the general vicinity and would change its essential character by increasing vehicle traffic and not providing a sight and sound barrier to the south of the property; (2) the proposed use was potentially detrimental to the general welfare because of potential complications from water overflow and increased particulate matter and fugitive dust; and (3) the proposed use would not be consistent with the North Gate plan because of traffic on U.S. 23, disruption of new access roads parallel to U.S. 23, and the plan contemplates future gravel quarry activity only on the west side of U.S. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} CBCC appeals the common pleas court's affirmance of the board's denial of its application for a conditional zoning certificate, and Berger Health cross-appeals the court's grant of CBCC's motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In its appeal, CBCC assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1.

Berger Health and the board agree with this interpretation, while CBCC asserts in its first assignment of error that it is erroneous. The second sentence reads in pertinent part: \"However, the board may require\n   <em>\n    as a condition of the approval of a conditional zoning certificate for such an activity\n   </em>\n   compliance with any general standards contained in the zoning resolution that apply to all conditional uses that are provided for in the zoning resolution and, except as provided in division (C) of this section, may require any specified measure, including, but not limited to, one or more of the following [listed items, i.e., inspection of nearby water wells, compliance with reasonable noise and dust-abatement procedures, and the establishments of setbacks, berms, and buffers for the proposed activity].\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The common pleas court and the appellees construe the foregoing language of R.C. 519.141(A) to permit a board of zoning appeals to consider an applicant's compliance with the general standards of the zoning resolution in determining whether to grant the conditional zoning certificate, even if these general standards are not limited to \"public health or safety\" as required by R.C. 519.02(A) or involve matters regulated by other federal, state, and local agencies as precluded by the first sentence in R.C. 519.141(A). This is a construction that requires us to read the statutory language as a condition precedent to the approval of the conditional zoning certificate, or as Berger Health phrases it in its appellate brief, \" R.C. 519.141(A) expressly permits township zoning regulations that\n   <em>\n    require compliance with general standards as a condition to approving such an operation\n   </em>\n   \" or \"The common pleas court correctly recognized the authority granted to townships in R.C. 519.141(A) to\n   <em>\n    require compliance with general standards as a condition to approving a sand and gravel mining operation\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) (Berger App Response Brief, p. 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The statutory language is that \"the board may require as a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     condition of\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     the approval of a conditional zoning certificate for such an activity\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" compliance with general standards. (Emphasis added.) Applying the normal rules of grammar and common usage to the \"of\" in the phrase \"condition of the approval of a conditional zoning certificate,\" the first \"of\" is synonymous with \"to\" because the \"approval of the conditional zoning certificate\" for the proposed sand and gravel mining may be conditioned on the applicant's compliance with general standards in the zoning resolution that apply to all conditional zoning uses, i.e., the board of zoning appeals may require that a\n   <em>\n    source\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    reason\n   </em>\n   for the approval of the conditional zoning certificate be the applicant's compliance with the general standards specified in the zoning resolution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary\n   </em>\n   at 1343, defining \"of\" to include \"used to indicate derivation, origin, or source,\" \"used to indicate cause, motive, occasion, or reason,\" and \"used to indicate the objective relation, the object of the action noted by the preceding noun or the application of a verb or adjective.\" Therefore, the plain language of the statute supports the common pleas court's and the board's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 28} This construction is also supported by the context of the second sentence in which the phrase appears.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D.A.B.E., Inc. v.

Although the first sentence notes the general principle that \"the board shall not consider or base its determination on matters that are regulated by any federal, state, or local agency,\" the second sentence starts with \"[h]owever,\" establishing that the second sentence is an exception to the general principle. The pertinent part of the second sentence then authorizes the board to condition the approval of the zoning certificate on the applicant's compliance with the general standards contained in the zoning resolution notwithstanding the foregoing general principle. The second sentence finally provides that \"except as provided in division (C) of this section, may require any specified measure, including, but not limited to, one or more of the following [listed items].\" Division C of R.C. 519.141 provides that \"[w]hen granting a conditional zoning certificate, a township board of zoning appeals shall not require the identification of specific roads\" for certain situations. The import of the final part of the second sentence is that the board may also specify measures contained in an\n   <em>\n    approved\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    granted\n   </em>\n   conditional zoning certificate. So construed, the General Assembly has balanced the competing interests and authorized the board of zoning appeals to limit surface mining activities if they do not comply with the general standards in the zoning resolution. In the alternative or in conjunction with that authority, the board can also attach the stated requirements to an approved conditional-use zoning certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 29} This construction of R.C. 519.141(A) also comports with the longstanding general principle that \"[t]he power of townships to enact zoning resolutions to regulate surface mining, pursuant to R.C.

Highlanders is a mining company regulated under R.C. 1514; therefore, the BZA could regulate only in the interest of public health and safety issues. Accordingly, BZA's denial of the conditional use application citing the increase in traffic, dust and noise, and a decrease in property values does not meet the statutory criteria. The record is void of evidence demonstrating the adverse affect [sic] of the use on public health and safety. The surface mining for which Highlanders sought the conditional use permit is governed by both the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Shamrock Materials, Inc. v.

Chapter 302:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The common pleas court held that \"[u]nder R.C. 303.02(A), the BZA was permitted to consider only the interests of public health and safety. Based on the transcript of the hearing and the written conclusions, the BZA considered the health, safety, and welfare of the neighboring residents, thus exceeding the scope authorized by the Ohio Revised Code.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   However, the common pleas court further determined that \"[a]lthough the BZA scope of review was broader than the permitted health and safety, the inclusion of 'welfare' does not render BZA's decision illegal. Even if the welfare concerns are stricken from the BZA findings, the remaining safety reasons are valid and sufficient reasons to deny Shamrock's application. * * * In its conclusions the BZA explicitly denied Shamrock's application because of a concern for the safety of children and implicitly denied it out of safety concerns due to the limited ingress-egress to the residences located on Radabaugh Road.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   We disagree with the common pleas court's decision. The lower court correctly found that the Revised Code limits a county to only consider interests of public health and safety when regulating mining operations. Further, the common pleas court properly found that the BZA exceeded its statutory authority by considering welfare.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 32} But neither\n   <em>\n    Highlanders Ent.\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Shamrock Materials\n   </em>\n   considered or applied the language of the second sentence of\n   R.C. 519.141(A), which is at issue here. Consequently, their holdings are inapplicable to the case sub judice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Therefore, after construing the pertinent plain language of R.C. 519.141(A), including in the context of the entire statute, as well as the general principle that the power of townships to enact zoning resolutions to regulate surface mining, pursuant to R.C. Chapter 519, has not been preempted by enactment of R.C. Chapter 1514, we hold that the common pleas court did not err in interpreting R.C. 519.141(A) to permit the board of zoning appeals to deny CBCC's application for a conditional zoning certificate to use its property for surface sand and gravel mining based on general standards in the township zoning resolution that apply to all conditional uses.

Insofar as CBCC repeats these meritless contentions, they fail under this assignment of error as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Moreover, our review of the record supports the common pleas court's determination. The court determined that CBCC failed to comply with Sections 9.03(B), (E), and (F) of the Harrison Township Zoning Resolution, which provide the following general standards applicable to all conditional uses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   B. The use will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the essential character of the same area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   E. The use will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare or odors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   F. The use will be consistent with the objectives of this Zoning Resolution and\n   any adopted comprehensive plan for the area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 37} As detailed by the common pleas court, CBCC's own testimony and exhibits supported a finding that CBCC's proposed use did not comply with Section 9.03(B) because of significant changes to the vehicular traffic and visual character of the area: CBCC expected traffic of at least 180 truck trips per day and traffic could exceed that estimate, and while CBCC planned mounds for certain areas of the sand and gravel quarry that would act as sound, site, and safety barriers, they did not plan one for the south side, which faced the Berger Health property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 38} There was also evidentiary support for the conclusion that CBCC's proposed use violated Section 9.03(E), again in part because of the increased heavy truck traffic. And although a CBCC witness testified that fugitive dust would be watered on an as-needed basis to prevent its proliferation to nearby residences, its zoning application noted that this procedure would be available only during normal business hours. In addition, an engineer testified that another hydraulic and hydrological study was required to determine whether the quarry operation would change the upstream condition or affect the flood plain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Finally, the economic development director testified that CBCC's proposed mining would violate the North Gate development plan by disrupting traffic patterns on U.S. 23 and planned access roads that would run parallel to that road and by allowing sand and gravel mining in an area that the plan reserves for future agricultural and low-density residential use. This evidence supported the court's finding that the proposed use violated Section 9.03(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 40} We acknowledge that CBCC presented competing evidence that, if credited, could have established compliance with at least some of these general standards. But given our limited standard of review, which does not include the same extensive authority to weigh the evidence as the common pleas court, we are not persuaded that the common pleas court abused its discretion or that its decision is not supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. We overrule CBCC's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Berger Health's Cross-Appeal is Moot\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 41} In Berger Health's cross-appeal, it argues that the common pleas court erred by granting CBCC's motion to strike the notebook submitted by Berger Health containing evidence and argument from the administrative record on appeal. It \"requests that if this Court reverses the common pleas court's judgment on the merits, the Court also remand with instructions that the Berger Binder be included in the record.\" Because our affirmance of the court's judgment on the merits renders Berger Health's cross-appeal moot, we need not address it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Contest of Election Held on Stark Cty.
