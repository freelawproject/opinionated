Trial judges are granted the discretion to make such a determination because they stand in an unmatched position to determine whether an appeal of a final order dealing with [multiple-claim or multiple-party actions] is most efficiently heard prior to trial on the merits. The trial court can best determine how the court's and the parties' resources may most effectively be utilized. The trial court is most capable of ascertaining whether not granting a final order might result in the case being tried twice.

And while the budgetary process in the City of Cincinnati brought about the passage of both ordinances, the factual and legal issues involved between the two are separate and distinct. Furthermore, legal issues dominate with respect to Ordinance No. 167,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the target of the forthcoming permanent injunction. And finally, the interest of justice militates in minimizing the period\n   that implementation of Ordinance No. 167 is enjoined by this Court should appellate review ultimately uphold its constitutionality.

Nonetheless, the analysis by that court has not altered the conclusion of this Court on the merits. In affirming the decision of the Maryland Tax Court, the Baltimore City Circuit Court summarily accepted and proceeded from the proposition that \"the tax [upon billboards imposed by Baltimore] is directed at a means of expression rather than the expression itself\" and that \"[t]he First Amendment only affords protection to regulation of actual or symbolic speech, and expressive conduct.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6.

In so doing, though, the Court initially focused upon the issue of whether the challenged tax deviated from an already-existing tax scheme. Relying upon the fact that the tax at issue in\n    <em>\n     Minneapolis Star\n    </em>\n    was a \"special use tax\" that deviated from an already-existing unitary sales tax scheme, the Baltimore City Circuit Court declared\n    <em>\n     Minneapolis Star\n    </em>\n    to be \"immaterial\" because \"there [was] no preexisting general [tax] scheme [in Baltimore] that the City deviate[d] from to single out billboard operators for special treatment.\"\n    <em>\n     Clear Channel Outdoor,\n    </em>\n    Case No. 24-C-18-001778, at 8. Such a proposition is spacious. Even if the deviation\n    <em>\n     vel non\n    </em>\n    from an existing tax scheme is pertinent, the absence of a particular type of tax is an existing tax scheme; and the City of Baltimore clearly deviated from that already-existing tax scheme when it isolated and targeted billboard operators for the imposition of an entirely new tax. The same is true with respect to the billboard tax imposed by the City of Cincinnati.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Additionally, the Baltimore City Circuit Court attempted to distinguish\n    <em>\n     Minneapolis Star\n    </em>\n    on the premise that the latter involved constitutional rights for the press and that because \"billboards are primarily for advertising... [they] simply [are] not in the same category as the fourth estate.\"\n    <em>\n     Clear Channel Outdoor\n    </em>\n    , Case No. 24-C-18-001778, at 9. But \"[t]he Supreme Court has made clear that courts should eschew creating a hierarchy among First Amendment rights.\"\n    <em>\n     Rutherford v. Katonah-Lewisboro School Dist\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820837\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/670/230/#p245\">\n     670 F.Supp.2d 230\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 245 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). Yet that is precisely what the Baltimore City Circuit Court has done (and, in so doing, contradicting its earlier assessment that the means of expression are not entitled to protection).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    And in a final effort to distinguish\n    <em>\n     Minneapolis Star\n    </em>\n    , the Baltimore City Circuit Court relied upon the difference in the \"type of tax\" involved,\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    a use tax versus an excise tax.\n    <em>\n     Clear Channel Outdoor,\n    </em>\n    Case No. 24-C-18-001778, at 9. But the type of tax involved is not the issue; regardless of the appellation that may be given to any particular the tax, the focus is whether, in the exercise of its taxing powers, the government has singled out and directed or targeted a tax solely at the exercise of First Amendment rights or at the means or instruments utilized in exercising First Amendment rights or whether a tax has targeted a small narrow group to bear the burden of the tax. That is precisely what the CITY OF CINCINNATI has done in the case\n    <em>\n     sub\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     judice\n    </em>\n    and, in so doing, the CITY OF CINCINNATI has clearly run afoul of the First Amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
