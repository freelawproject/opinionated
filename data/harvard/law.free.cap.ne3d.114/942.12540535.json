There was no error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal arises out of the efforts of the defendant, LSREF3/AH Chicago Tenant, LLC, to recover possession of and rent for certain real property occupied by the plaintiff. After judgment entered for the defendant in a summary process proceeding, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the county court generally alleging error in connection with that proceeding and seeking relief from the judgment that entered. The single justice concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 5, because she failed to pursue other available remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Skandha\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Clerk of the Superior Court for Civil Business in Suffolk County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362353\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/1017/#p1018\">\n    472 Mass. 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1018,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20N.E.3d%201095\">\n    37 N.E.3d 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (single justice properly denies extraordinary relief where litigant failed to pursue available alternative remedies).

Rule 2:21, as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20Mass.%201301\">\n    434 Mass. 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). The rule only applies where a single justice has denied relief from an\n   <em>\n    interlocutory\n   </em>\n   ruling in the trial court. It does not apply to this appeal because, at the time the plaintiff filed her complaint, judgment had already entered in the summary process proceeding. Regardless, it is clear on the record before us that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief because she could have obtained review of the summary process judgment (and any other claims of error concerning those proceedings) through the ordinary appellate process.

As the single justice recognized, relief in the nature of mandamus is not available where the ordinary appellate process would suffice.

The single justice's judgment entered on July 24, 2018, and he denied the plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment on August 6, 2018. The plaintiff's notice of appeal was filed more than thirty days later, on September 24, 2018. This is another reason not to disturb the judgment.
