We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Facts and Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2001, Williamson was convicted of 12 counts of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02 and was sentenced to 12 consecutive life terms. This court affirmed his convictions in\n   <em>\n    State v. Williamson\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 80982,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002-Ohio-6503\">\n    2002-Ohio-6503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%2031667650\">\n    2002 WL 31667650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On November 23, 2016, Williamson filed an application for DNA testing pursuant to R.C. 2953.71 through 2953.81. On December 9, 2016 the trial court denied Williamson's motion as \"untimely filed.\" Williamson appealed and this court reversed, finding that the trial court's denial of Williamson's DNA testing application as \"untimely\" constituted an insufficient order.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williamson\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

We remanded the case for the trial court to comply with R.C. 2953.71 through 2953.81 and make a ruling on his application for DNA testing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On October 12, 2017, the trial court issued an opinion and order denying Williamson's application. The trial court\n   noted that Williamson was requesting testing of a \"cup and flooring\" related to the victim's testimony that she spit his semen on both items. The court found, however, that no physical evidence was presented at his trial that could be tested for DNA; the court stated that the only physical evidence collected and tested by the state was the victim's bedding, which tested negative for semen and blood. The court found that Williamson's application could be denied per R.C. 2953.74(C)(1). The court further found that results from the DNA testing would not be outcome determinative because the presence of another person's DNA would not have exonerated Williamson. The victim alleged that Williamson raped her over 40 times; he was convicted of 12 of those incidents, and the cup and flooring only related to one incident. Thus, DNA exoneration for the alleged evidence on the cup and flooring would not exonerate him on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Williamson filed a timely pro se notice of appeal and has assigned six assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I. The dispositive opinion factual finding that \"the physical cup itself and samples from the floor are unavailable for DNA testing at this point\" was not made in accordance with statutory requirements and therefore fails.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   II. The dispositive trial court legal conclusion that \"the trial of (Neiswonger's\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   or) another person's DNA (in or on the cup or immediate flooring) would have * * * not * * * completely * * * exonerated (the) appellant (with an) exclusion result,\" established a standard for the requirement (as to DNA application rejection) or 2953.74(B)(4) contrary to Ohio law and thus fails.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   III. The dispositive opinion mixed finding of fact and conclusion of law that \"the cup and floor relate to only one incident (out of the victim's allegations that the appellant raped her in forty-plus incidents) thus (even if some other person's, and not the appellant's DNA, was found in or on the cup or in the immediate flooring, that) \"evidence would not exonerate Williamson for all 12 counts with an exclusion result and thus the requirements of 2953.71(C)(4) as defined by 2953.71(L) were not met\" misstates the law as to 2953.74(C)(4) and thus fails.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   IV. The opinion and order erroneously ignores Williamson's application made pursuant to R.C. 2953.74(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   V. The opinion and order erroneously fails to analyze the requirements of the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions impacted in R.C. 2953.71 - 2953.81, mandating the DNA testing requested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   VI. The R.C. 2953.71 - 2953.81 statutory scheme is unconstitutional under the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment; and under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. Law and Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Assignments of error one through five will be combined for review because they discuss the same issue: Williamson claims that the trial court erred in denying his application for DNA testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Postconviction DNA testing for eligible inmates is addressed in R.C. 2953.71 through 2953.81. Detailed grounds for accepting or rejecting applications can be found in R.C. 2953.74.\n   <em>\n    State v. Widmer\n   </em>\n   , 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2012-02-008,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-62\">\n    2013-Ohio-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20142041\">\n    2013 WL 142041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 114. R.C. 2953.74(A) provides that a trial court \"has the discretion, on a case-by-case basis\" to accept or reject an eligible inmate's\n   application for DNA testing. Thus, we review the trial court's decision to deny Williamson's application for an abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of law or judgment, but instead connotes that the trial court's decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    Blakemore v.

When applying the abuse of discretion standard, an appellate court may not merely substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Berk v.

The physical evidence consisted of the victim's clothing, her bedding and blankets, a towel, and a doll's jacket. The state also reviewed relevant lab reports, police reports, and trial testimony. The police did not take a cup or flooring into evidence in April 2001 or anything thereafter; thus, the state was unable to locate a cup or flooring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Therefore, no parent sample existed on which a DNA test could be performed and the court denied Williamson's application on that finding, pursuant to R.C. 2953.74(C)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Further, the results of the requested DNA material would not be \"outcome determinative.\" R.C. 2953.74(C)(4) provides that a trial court may only accept the application if the exclusion result will be \"outcome determinative.\" As the trial court found, even if DNA from another person was found, Williamson would not be completely exonerated because the victim testified he raped her over 40 times. Williamson's identity was not at issue; he denied raping the victim and was convicted of 12 counts of rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court found that an \"exclusion result\" from the DNA testing the appellant requested would not be \"outcome determinative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 13} As mentioned, in the present case, the victim testified that Williamson, a family member, raped her more than 40 times over an extended period of time. The cup and the flooring that Williamson desires to be tested only relate to a single incident. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Madden\n   </em>\n   , an \"exclusion result\" from the DNA testing on these items, even if they could be located, would not be outcome determinative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Williamson's application for DNA testing. The first through fifth assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In the sixth assignment of error, Williamson claims that R.C. 2953.71 through 2953.81 are unconstitutional.

DNA-testing results are \"exclusive\" if they scientifically preclude or foreclose the subject offender as a contributor of biological material recovered from the crime scene or victim.\n   <em>\n    Waire\n   </em>\n   at\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202248924\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , citing former R.C. 2953.71(G). \"Exclusive\" results are \"outcome determinative\" if, had the results been presented at the offender's trial and been found relevant and admissible, no reasonable factfinder would have found the offender guilty of that offense.\n   <em>\n    Waire\n   </em>\n   at\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202248924\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , citing former R.C. 2953.71(L).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Thus, in reading the terms \"exclusion,\" \"exclusion result,\" and \"outcome determinative,\" we find that the statute contains ascertainable standards, provides sufficient notice of what the terms apply to, and contains sufficient guidelines to avoid arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In light of the above, the terms \"exclusion\" and \"exclusion result\" in relation to the term \"outcome determinative\" are not unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Williamson also claims that the trial court's application of R.C. 2953.71 et seq. violates his equal protection rights. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, \"No State shall * * * deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Ohio's Equal Protection Clause, Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, states, \"All political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal protection and benefit * * *.\" These constitutional guarantees do not forbid classifications. \"[They] simply keep[ ] governmental decision makers from treating differently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.\"\n   <em>\n    Burnett v.

We fail to see how Williamson, as an offender who seeks to compare physical items that are not, and were likely never, in the state's custody or control, is similarly situated to the offenders listed in R.C. 2953.71 et seq., so as to violate the guarantees of equal protection. Simply put, Williamson seeks to have the DNA tested on two physical items, a cup and a piece of flooring, that were never collected as part of the criminal investigation but, according to Williamson, may be available 17 years after the crimes were committed. His request is far different from offenders who seek to compare their own DNA with physical items that remain in the state's possession and may otherwise qualify under R.C. 2953.74(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The Equal Protection Clause \"does not require things which are different in fact * * * to be treated in law as though they were the same.\"\n   <em>\n    GTE N., Inc. v.
