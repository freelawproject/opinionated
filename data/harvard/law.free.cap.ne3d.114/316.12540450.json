GALLAGHER, A.J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant Tonja Hall, pro se, appeals her conviction for criminal simulation on sufficiency of the evidence and manifest weight grounds. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court's judgment and vacate her conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 16, 2017, a complaint was filed in the East Cleveland Municipal Court charging Hall with one count of criminal simulation in violation of section 545.13 of the Codified Ordinances of East Cleveland, General Offenses Code (\"E.C.C.O.\") arising out of her attempt to cash a fraudulent check. The preceding day, Hall had gone to PLS Financial Services (\"PLS\"), a checking cashing business in East Cleveland, and presented a check in the amount of $30,787.50 for cashing. The check was dated May 8, 2017. Designer Hardware &amp; Plumbing L.L.C. d.b.a. Designer Hardware by Faye (\"Designer Hardware &amp; Plumbing\") in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma was the drawer of the check. The purported payee was \"[a]ttention: Tonja Maria Hall\" with an address on Cedar Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio. The complaint alleged that, on or about May 15, 2017, Hall \"with purpose to defraud, uttered or possessed with the purpose to utter, a check in the amount of $30,787.50, knowing it to have been simulated when presented to PLS Check Cashiers * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A bench trial was held on July 13, 2017. The city presented testimony from Ebony Sims, the assistant manager of PLS, who received the check Hall presented for cashing and Officer Westfield, the arresting officer. The city also introduced the allegedly altered check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Sims testified that when Hall presented the check, she immediately suspected that the check was fraudulent. Sims testified that she had seen similar altered checks in the past and that, in this case, she could see on the face of the check \"where the name part had been erased and also the amount and the date\" and then \"type[d] over * * * with a typewriter of some sort.\" Sims testified that, as was her practice when she was presented with a check she believed could be fraudulent, she \"called the company to verify.\" She testified that, after speaking with someone in the accounting department at Designer Hardware &amp; Plumbing, she learned that the check had been issued in April 2017 to a different company \"for like $130-something.\" Sims stated that she informed Hall that the check was fraudulent and that she could not return the check to her and then called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Officer Westfield was the responding officer. He testified that when he arrived at the business, Sims informed him that Hall had attempted to cash a fraudulent check and she showed him said check. Officer Westfield examined the check and testified that, based on his experience, the amount, address and name on the check appeared to have been altered. He testified that he asked Hall about the check but that she refused to talk to him, so he called his supervisor. Officer Westfield testified that his supervisor directed him to arrest Hall and that he did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Hall, who appeared pro se, was the sole witness to testify in her defense. Hall claimed that she was an independent contractor for Kunlun Energy Co. Ltd. (\"Kunlun Energy\") based in Hong Kong and that she had received the check on its behalf. Hall testified that, pursuant to the terms of her contract with Kunlun Energy, she was to receive a monthly salary of $4,900 plus a 6.5% commission for receiving and processing payments from Kunlun Energy's debtors in the United States and Canada. She testified that all of the communications related to her work for Kunlun Energy were conducted by email and telephone and that she did not know anyone from Designer Hardware &amp; Plumbing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Hall introduced a copy of the contract and portions of email communications\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   involving Hall, Sun Patrick (identified as the \"executive director\" of Kunlun Energy) and Donald Tendani (an unidentified third party) allegedly relating to the check at issue. The contract between the parties was dated April 3, 2017, and was for a term of six months, subject to termination upon seven days written notice. Hall testified that the check at issue was from \"one of the debtors\" of Kunlun Energy or \"the debtor of one of the clients\" of Kunlun Energy, that she had received the check on behalf Kunlun Energy and that under the terms of the contract, she was to \"process\" the check, keep 6.5% of the funds she received as commission and then remit the balance of the funds to Kunlun Energy. Hall stated that she had her own bank account into which she could have deposited the check but she did not explain why she failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After considering the evidence and arguments of the parties, the trial court found Hall guilty of criminal simulation in violation of E.C.C.O. 545.13, sentenced her to 180 days in jail and imposed a $500 fine. The trial court stayed the sentence pending Hall's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Hall appealed her conviction, raising the following assignment of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR: Did the trial court commit error convicting defendant of [c]riminal simulation, R.C. statute 2913.32(A)(4) [sic] and applying plaintiff's manifest weight of the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In her sole assignment of error, Hall argues that her conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence and was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} A challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction requires a determination of whether the state met its burden of production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Primous\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was charged with one count of passing a bad check in violation of R.C. 2913.11 and one count of criminal simulation in violation of R.C. 2913.32 based on a personal check the defendant had presented to a retail store.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1. The defendant pled guilty to the passing bad check charge and\n   no contest to the criminal simulation charge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. On appeal, the defendant argued that he was not properly convicted of criminal simulation because \"passing a bad check does not fit under the ambit of criminal simulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. The Second District agreed. The Second District held that the Committee Comment to R.C. 2913.32\"makes it quite clear that the section applies to forging objects and not a writing, such as forging antiques or phonograph records.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 24} This case is, in certain respects, factually distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Primous\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Primous\n   </em>\n   , the conduct at issue was \"passing a bad check.\" Passing a bad check is different from what occurred here. Passing a bad check occurs when a check is drawn on a nonexistent account or on an account with insufficient funds to honor the check when presented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2913.11. In this case, the check at issue was from an existing account. There was no evidence that there were insufficient funds in the account to honor the check. Rather, the original payee and the amount of the check had had been erased and replaced to make it appear as if the check was a check payable to Hall in the amount of $30,787.50 when it was actually a check payable to an unidentified company \"for like $130-something.\" Nevertheless, we find the reasoning of the court in\n   <em>\n    Primous\n   </em>\n   persuasive.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, no issue was raised regarding whether the counterfeit bills constituted \"objects\" that had been \"made\" or \"alter[ed]\" so that they \"appear[ed] to have value because of antiquity, rarity, curiosity, source, or authorship, which [they did] not in fact possess.\" The issue in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   was whether there was sufficient evidence that the defendant had the requisite knowledge or intent to support his conviction under R.C. 2913.12 based on the fact that he possessed counterfeit bills.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14-18. This court affirmed his conviction, reasoning that given that the defendant had no legitimate currency to pay for any goods or services he would acquire that night as a patron of the club, but only counterfeit bills, a reasonable person could infer that he had tendered or intended to tender the counterfeit bills in exchange for goods and services and, therefore, had intent to defraud or acted knowingly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Furthermore, cases involving counterfeit currency are distinguishable in that they involve a tangible object, i.e., currency, that appears to have value specifically because of its purported \"source,\" i.e., because it appears to be legal currency issued by the United States government rather than the counterfeit \"paper money\" it actually is.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
