On September 2, 2011, Defendant Village of Whitehouse (hereinafter Village), through Defendant Daughtery (hereinafter Daughtery) mailed a letter to Plaintiff offering him the position of Police Officer for the Village of Whitehouse. (See copy of September 2, 2011 letter attached as Plaintiff's Exhibit one (1). Plaintiff accepted this position and was required to pass a Village of Whitehouse physical examination, psychological examination, alcohol and drug tests as well as a background check.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   5. Plaintiff successfully passed these examinations and the background check and was hired by the Village of Whitehouse as a full time police officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   6. As part of the employment agreement among the parties, Plaintiff was provided a detailed personnel policy procedure handbook, that explained the rights and obligations of the parties, including all disciplinary procedures. (See Plaintiff's Exhibit two (2)[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   7. As a result of the Defendants providing this detailed policy procedure handbook to Plaintiff, the employment \"at-will\" agreement among the parties was an implied contract among the parties. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Based on these stated facts and review of the attached documents, we cannot say appellant failed to show that an employment agreement existed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

He is not required to plead any theory or classification of the cause of action set forth.\"). In viewing reasonable inferences favorably toward appellant, we find it is reasonable to infer that based on facts pled a contract existed in which appellant received compensation for being a police officer. Our determination is despite the legal theory not being expressly stated in the amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20N.E.2d%20776\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Nevertheless, even accepting there was an employment agreement among the parties, we cannot say facts show appellees breached that agreement. This is because appellant was susceptible\n   to being terminated as an at-will employee, and nothing stated in the amended complaint changes that status or the resulting outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The policy manual explicitly details appellant's at-will status. Attached as the fifth page of \"Exhibit 2\" is a document which is signed by appellant and which is entitled \"Employee Agreement and Handbook Acknowledgement.\" It reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   This Personnel Policy Manual highlights the Village of Whitehouse's policies, procedures, and benefits. In all instances the official benefit plan texts, trust agreements and master contracts are the governing documents. Your Personnel Policy is not to be interpreted as a legal document or an employment contract. Employment with the Village of Whitehouse is at the sole discretion of the Village of Whitehouse and may be terminated with or without cause at any time and for any reason. Nothing in the Personnel Policy Manual constitutes as express or implied contract or assurance of continued employment or implies that just cause is required for termination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Consequently, our de novo review reveals appellant was subject to being terminated with or without cause. Nothing in the policy manual provides otherwise, and thus appellant fails to state a cause of action for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Charter of the village of Whitehouse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Section 4.08(C), entitled \"Executive Powers,\" of the charter of the village of Whitehouse, Ohio states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Except as otherwise provided by this Charter, the Mayor shall have the power to appoint, promote, transfer, suspend, reduce or remove any officer or employee of the Municipality except those required by this Charter to be elected or appointed; provided, however that such appointment, promotion, reduction or removal of officers provided for by this Charter and the heads of departments of divisions established pursuant thereto shall not take effect without the concurrence of a majority of the members of Council.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Here, appellant asserts that an exception to the general rule governing termination of at-will employees exists where an at-will employee is terminated in contravention of a procedure set out in the charter of the village of Whitehouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Nevertheless, we note that this procedure is not imposed by the Ohio or U.S. Constitution, federal or state statutes, administrative rules and regulations, or Ohio common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beckloff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12550096\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/93/329/\">\n    2017-Ohio-4467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12550096\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/93/329/\">\n    93 N.E.3d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 35. Further, appellant has not pointed to persuasive legal authority to support that such local law provides exception to the general rule that termination of an at-will employee does not give rise to an action for damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Giannini-Baur v.
