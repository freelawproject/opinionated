As Gordon states in his appellate brief, \"There is no dispute that Ricardo Nieves died on August 25, 201[6] from a gunshot wound to the head. The issue in this case is who did it.\" Gordon assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   I. Appellant's convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and the\n   trial court erred by denying his motion for acquittal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   II. The convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   III. The trial court erred by admitting a jail call that was not properly authenticated and violated Evid.R. 401, 402 and 403 and deprived appellant of his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   IV. The trial court erred by admitting a Facebook photograph that was not properly authenticated and violated Evid.R. 401, 402 and 403 and deprived appellant of his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   V. The trial court erred by giving a flight instruction over appellant's objection and that was not supported by the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   VI. The trial court erred and violated appellant's due process right to a fair trial by allowing Joe Butler to testify, over the defense's objection, that appellant carries a revolver and had been seen with it days before the shooting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Having reviewed the record and pertinent law, we affirm the decision of the trial court. The apposite facts follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Introduction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On August 25, 2016, Robert Holsey (\"Holsey\") agreed to purchase marijuana from Gordon. Holsey and Gordon knew each other from playing basketball at Trent Park. Nieves drove Holsey to the marijuana-purchase- meeting place on W. 38th Street in Cleveland. As Nieves and Holsey drove toward the meeting place, they saw Gordon, became suspicious, and started to drive away. Through the side mirror of the car, Holsey saw Gordon raise his arm with an object in his hand, then Holsey heard shots fired. Gordon ran away. Holsey realized Nieves had been shot. Holsey, who was in the passenger seat of the vehicle, ducked to avoid further gunfire and pressed the gas pedal with his hand. Holsey stopped the car at the next intersection, put Nieves in the back seat, and drove toward MetroHealth. Holsey got into an accident near the hospital, and called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} When the police arrived, Holsey told them that Nieves was shot by a man named \"Neeko\" who stays at a house on W. 41st Street. The police went to this house and found Gordon there. Holsey identified Gordon as the person who shot Nieves. Nieves later died from a gunshot wound to the neck and head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 2, 2016, a grand jury indicted Gordon for aggravated murder, murder, attempted murder, three counts of felonious assault, discharging a firearm in a prohibited area, tampering with evidence, and having a weapon while under disability. On June 20, 2017, a jury acquitted Gordon of the aggravated murder and attempted murder charges and convicted him of all other counts. On June 29, 2017, the court sentenced Gordon to an aggregate prison term of 28 years to life. It is from these convictions that Gordon appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Trial Testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Eyewitness Robert Holsey\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Holsey testified that he and Nieves ran into Gordon at a convenient store on Fulton Road on August 25, 2016. Holsey knew Gordon because they had played basketball together in the neighborhood. Video surveillance footage from the convenient store was introduced into evidence. It showed Holsey, Nieves, and Gordon in the store and in the parking lot on the day in question. Gordon was wearing an orange shirt in the video, and he had a dark-colored shirt or towel slung over his shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Holsey arranged to buy marijuana from Gordon. Gordon said the marijuana was \"stashed,\" and they were to meet nearby on W. 38th Street. Nieves drove his white Toyota Corolla, with Holsey in the passenger seat, to the meeting place. As they were driving north on W. 38th Street toward Robert Avenue, they saw Gordon waving at them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} According to Holsey, \"something odd came about.\" Holsey continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   As we was coming closer, he kept going back toward the fence. * * * That's cool. But what didn't make sense is what the neighbors - he's an African American man and * * * there's Caucasian white people right there and they're just staring at him. And he's waving us towards the gate. That didn't make no sense. That was hot. As I mean hot that was too - that was too noisy policewise. The neighbors look like why is he there? That didn't make sense to us. So as we drove off, Neeko Gordon was come here, right here. I got it right here. It didn't make no sense at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   As soon as we went * * * he fired two, three shots as he was running towards the car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   What I could see was him waving us towards the - trying to get us to exit the vehicle towards the car. We said no. There was people out there that was staring at him out the window like why is he right there and there was another guy on his porch looking him [sic] weird. We wasn't going to get out of the [sic] and do a drug deal and somebody call the police right there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   It was pure daylight. He was the only African American man by that fence and by that area and the rest were just two white guys and somebody staring out the window.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Asked what Gordon was wearing that day, Holsey replied, \"Neeko Gordon was wearing an orange shirt. He had on like something on top of his shirt like he was holding like a towel because it was hot or a T-shirt because it was real hot.\" Holsey further testified that Gordon was wearing \"black or bluish\" sweatpants. Holsey testified that, from his \"vantage point,\" he did not see Gordon with a gun. Asked how he knew that Gordon fired the shot, Holsey testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Because as I heard the first gunshot I looked back instantly and I could see through that side window right him going like this, his arm extended like this, orange T-shirt something still above his thing but there definitely was an object in his hand there should be no reason his arm was up pointed towards as soon as I looked through that side window right there and after the last shot I could see him run down.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   He ran towards the main street. He seemed like he was just running. I'm sorry. It was a quick glance. It was fast because I wanted to duck from the bullet. But as soon as I looked through that side window was Neeko that guy right there with his arm up pointed forward just like that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   And I grabbed [Nieves] and I grabbed his head down so he wouldn't get hit but he was already dead. It was him. It was him. It was him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Holsey testified that after he heard the first gunshot and noticed that Nieves was dead, he grabbed Nieves and \"went down. I hit the gas pedal with my hand while grabbing [Nieves] and I'm steering and I just flew down the street. * * * I know I had to hit two or three cars but that's what I had to do. It was gunshots going.\" Holsey made it to the next\n   street and \"threw\" Nieves in the back seat of the car. Holsey drove toward MetroHealth, but he rear-ended another car at the corner of W. 25th and Meyer Avenue. Holsey called 911. Holsey testified that Nieves was bleeding \"uncontrollably\" and ultimately Nieves was taken by ambulance to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Holsey told the police that he knew where the person who shot Nieves was. \"I know what house he at.\" Holsey testified that when he played basketball with Gordon, Gordon was \"always in front of that house on 41st.\" Holsey told the police the shooter's name was \"Neeko\" and described his appearance, including \"a tattoo that says 'Heaven' right here on his chest.\" The police drove Holsey to the house he identified at 3252 W. 41st Street. Gordon was there and the police brought him outside. Gordon had changed his pants and had no shirt on, but Holsey identified him as the person who shot Nieves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On cross-examination, Holsey testified that he saw Gordon in the driver's side-view mirror \"running towards the car with his arm extended,\" although Holsey did not see Gordon with a gun. Defense counsel asked Holsey the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q: Well, what did Neeko have in his hand every minute of this video that you just watched? What did he have in his hand the whole time he talked to you by that car? What did he have in his hand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A: A phone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Officer Noel Hernandez\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Cleveland police patrol officer Noel \"Bo\" Hernandez testified that on August 25, 2016, he responded to an emergency call of \"a male shot * * * in the area of W. 38th and Clark.\" Officer Hernandez was rerouted to W. 25th Street and Meyer Avenue, where the shooting victim and the driver were involved in a motor vehicle accident. When officer Hernandez arrived at the scene, he saw a white car and Holsey \"outside screaming for help. Screaming for my help and screaming for police help and yelling at us that his brother has been shot.\" According to Officer Hernandez, Holsey was \"hysterical.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Holsey indicated that he knew who the shooter was, and he believed he knew where the shooter went - to a house on \"41st and Storer.\" Officer Hernandez called his Lieutenant and got permission to bring Holsey to the house in question. Police officers knocked, and three black males opened the front door. All three males were shirtless. All three denied being in the area of the shooting. The police told the men they were \"investigating a shooting that happened not too long ago.\" One officer also stated, \"and this might be related to a possible homicide.\" Gordon responded, \"So he died?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The officers took Gordon outside for a cold stand. Officer Hernandez \"heard [Holsey] scream that's him. That's the shooter. That's the guy who killed [Nieves].\" The police arrested Gordon at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Detective Walter Emerick\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Cleveland police detective Walter Emerick testified that he works for the crime scene investigation unit, and he performed a gunshot residue test on Gordon's hands while Gordon was outside on W. 41st Street, just over two hours after the shooting took place. Detective Emerick also recovered an \"[o]range T-shirt out of the hamper within one of the bedrooms,\" a black cell phone, and \".22 live rimfired rounds,\" which are unfired bullets. On cross-examination, Det. Emerick testified that he did not \"bag\" Gordon's hands nor were Gordon's hands bagged at anytime that he was aware of.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Detective David Borden\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Cleveland police homicide Det. David Borden testified that he responded \"to the intersection of W. 38th and Robert [Avenue] and we started to canvass the area for witnesses and other evidence that might be useful in this homicide investigation.\" Det. Borden spoke with Anthony Sobczyk, who lives one or two houses from where the shots were fired. Sobczyk gave the following description of the suspect: \"black male, five-ten, five-eleven, medium build, wearing a red shirt and blue jeans and short hair.\" According to Det. Borden, Sobczyk informed him that the suspect used a revolver in the shooting and fired two shots. Det. Borden testified that the police did not find any shell casings on the scene. According to Det. Borden, \"[r]evolvers do not eject casings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Det. Borden testified that he interviewed Farmer Baker, who lives on the corner of W. 38th and Robert Avenue and saw \"an individual running west on Roberts\" wearing a red shirt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    Forensic Scientist Lisa Przepyszny\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Lisa Przepyszny testified that she is a forensic scientist in the trace evidence department of the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office. Przepyszny analyzed the gunshot residue test taken from Gordon's hands on August 25, 2016. She found \"particles that were characteristic of * * * gunshot primer residue and that would indicate that either the individual fired a gun, was in close proximity to a fired gun, or handled an object that had gunshot residue on it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. Todd Barr\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Dr. Todd Barr testified that he is a forensic pathologist who is serving as a deputy medical examiner in the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office. Dr. Barr performed Nieves's autopsy on August 26, 2016, and concluded that Nieves died from \"a gunshot wound to the head and neck.\" In Dr. Barr's opinion, Nieves' wound\"is most consistent with a distant gunshot wound [of] [g]reater than four feet.\" According to Dr. Barr, \"the path of the projectile, it entered in the * * * left side in the back of the neck, back of the head, and basically went through the skin soft tissue muscles. * * * And then it travels through and fractures one of his neck bones, one of his vertebrae. * * * And then it comes out through the back of his mouth * * *.\" Dr. Barr determined that the manner of death was homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Eyewitness Anthony Sobczyk\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Anthony Sobczyk testified that he lives at 3278 W. 38th Street in Cleveland, and on August 25, 2016, at about 4:30 p.m., he witnessed a shooting on his street. He was getting pizzas out of the passenger side of his car, which was parked on the street, when he saw a \"[b]lack male, about 18, short, short hair, medium build\" walking \"suspiciously\" down the street. Sobczyk testified that the person was wearing \"I believe jeans and I think a bright shirt.\" According to Sobczyk, this person was suspicious because \"in a matter of seconds he disappeared. * * * He crouched behind the fence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Sobczyk's testimony continued: \"Then I seen a white car coming down the street slowly. It wasn't racing or nothing. Stopped at the stop sign. Next thing I know the guy jumped up, went in the street, fired the shot, car took off, he took off, that was it.\" Sobczyk testified that he did not see anybody else on the street, and he only heard one shot. According to Sobczyk, the man was about 15 feet from the car when he fired the shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    Officer Jonathan Holub\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Cleveland police officer Jonathan Holub testified that he is Officer Hernandez's partner, and he was driving their\n   zone car on August 25, 2016, when they responded to the shooting in question. The officers first went to W. 38th and Clark, near where the shooting occurred, then went to W. 25th and Meyer, where Holsey and Nieves got into the car accident. Next, Officer Holub drove Officer Hernandez and Holsey, who was in the backseat, to \"the area of W. 41st [and] the house where the suspect was.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 24} After Gordon's arrest, Gordon is captured on Officer Holub's body camera talking to a relative through the police car window. This family member came outside from the house where the police found Gordon. After reviewing the video from his body camera, Officer Holub testified that Gordon said, \"it's not enough. [T]hey don't got shit on me.\" Officer Holub further testified that Gordon \"said he was alone\" at the time of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    Eyewitness Letha Sanchez\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Letha Sanchez testified that she was sitting on the front porch of a home located at W. 38th Street and Robert Avenue on August 25, 2016, when she heard gunshots. Sanchez hurried off the porch and saw \"somebody go by with a red shirt and black pants on. And it looks like he was putting a gun in his pocket as he was running. * * * I just hurried up and * * * got in my car and left.\" Sanchez testified that she \"was in a panic\" and her observation \"was real brief.\" Sanchez recalled that the person was \"a black male,\" but other than his clothing, she could not identify him. Sanchez did not recall seeing anybody else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    Detective Thomas Lynch\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Cleveland police Det. Thomas Lynch testified that he interviewed Gordon, who had been taken into custody at 3252 W. 41st Street. Gordon was in the back seat of a zone car and agreed to speak with Det. Lynch about \"what was going on that day.\" Det. Lynch testified that Gordon said he was at his girlfriend's house, then he took the bus to W. 25th Street and Clark, \"then made his way to the convenience store on Fulton, Fulton Beverage * * *.\" Gordon ran into Holsey, who \"he knew from the neighborhood, I believe he said it was from playing basketball * * *.\" Gordon told Det. Lynch that he was wearing a white T-shirt when he saw Holsey. Gordon said he took the white T-shirt off at his aunt's house on W. 41st Street, \"before the police arrived.\" Det. Lynch asked Gordon if he had a cell phone, and Gordon told him that he did not, because he smashed it after a fight with his girlfriend and threw it in a dumpster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Det. Lynch testified that the police obtained permission from the owner of the house on W. 41st Street to \"take a look around\" for a gun. The police recovered Gordon's cell phone and \"some bullets\" from the owner of the house's bedroom. Additionally, they \"recovered an orange shirt with a stain on the front of it\" from a clothes hamper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Det. Lynch interviewed Gordon again at the police station the next day. Gordon now told police that he had two cell phones, the one he smashed and the one found in the house on W. 41st Street. Additionally, when the police told Gordon that surveillance video from the day of the shooting showed him wearing an orange shirt - and not a white one, which is what he previously told the police - Gordon admitted that he had been wearing an orange shirt the day before. Gordon then gave the police \"three basic stories as to what had occurred.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [T]he first time we asked him about what had happened he said that he was walking on West 38th Street when the car that he had talked to at the convenient store drove by him and he told us\n   as the car drove by him, someone from behind him had shot at the car. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   The second story that he told was that as he got to the corner after leaving the store and walking across the street as he was at the corner, the car passed by him and he saw the male that he had talked to at the store like had his hand in the air like he was saying what's up and he - so he responded like what's up like this, raising his hand up in the air.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   But he could not explain how Ricardo Nieves got shot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   And then the third way he explained what had happened - basically about three-quarters of the way into the interview he's like I'm going to tell you the truth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   And he * * * stated that as he was walking down West 38th Street the vehicle that he had encountered and spoke with Robert Holsey in at the convenience store came down the street and as this vehicle approached him, Robert Holsey was holding his hand in the air like he had a gun and that Neeko held his hand up in the air * * * like to scare him like he had a gun pointed in his direction and then Neeko heard a gunshot. And I asked him where did the gunshot come from and he couldn't explain where the gunshot came from.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 29} According to Det. Lynch, in all three versions of his story, Gordon claimed that he was by himself and that he ran away from the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 30} On cross-examination, Det. Lynch stated that he did not interview the two other black males who were in the house on W. 41st Street at the time Gordon was arrested. He also stated that \"one or two\" of the eyewitnesses to the shooting that were interviewed stated that the shooter was wearing a red, rather than an orange, shirt. However, Det. Lynch testified that \"[r]ed and orange is not a big discrepancy in my opinion.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [I]f someone was saying the shooter had a white shirt on, then we'd have a problem. Or if the shooter had a yellow shirt on, we have a problem. Red and orange can be easily mistaken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   People see colors differently. I can see something as one color and someone else sees it as a different shade of blue or something along those lines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Red and orange in my opinion and Det. Sandoval's opinion was not a huge discrepancy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Det. Lynch testified that video surveillance footage taken from a nearby neighborhood camera shows Gordon \"running down the alley\" wearing an orange shirt at 4:41 p.m. on August 25, 2016, which is immediately after the shots were fired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Det. Lynch testified that the orange shirt that was recovered from the clothes hamper was not the same orange shirt that Gordon was wearing in the video footage captured just prior to and after the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Det. Lynch also established that nobody saw Gordon with a gun on day of the shooting, and nobody saw more than one person running from the scene. The neighborhood eyewitnesses, who do not know Gordon, heard gunshots and saw a black male in a \"bright\" or red T-shirt run away from the scene, heading west on Robert. Holsey, who knows Gordon, heard gunshots and saw Gordon, through the side-view mirror of the car, approaching the car with his arm pointed out and then running from the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    Toni Roberson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Toni Roberson testified that on August 25, 2016, she was living at 3252 W. 41st Street, and Gordon, who she has known \"since he was about three,\" was\n   staying with her. Gordon was friends with her son Joe Butler. On that day, Gordon called Roberson looking for Butler. Roberson was at the store at the time. According to Roberson, there was nothing out of the ordinary about the call or the way Gordon sounded. When she went home, Gordon, Butler, another friend, and the police were there. Roberson gave the police permission to search her home. The police recovered bullets but did not recover a gun from her house. Roberson testified that the bullets the police found belonged to her, although she did not own a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    Joseph Butler\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Joseph Butler testified that, on August 25, 2016, he was living at 3252 W. 41st Street with his mother. He and Gordon grew up together. That afternoon, Butler was at a store on W. 38th and Newark when Gordon called him and said, \"I just did a drill.\" Butler testified that a \"drill\" meant that Gordon \"just shot or killed somebody.\" According to Butler, Gordon was \"real hyped like, you know, just hyped, like real hyped, anxious and stuff. [H]e was asking where I was at, come home now, come home now.\" Butler went home and Gordon \"was waiting for me at the screen door. And that's when he went inside. He took his shirt off, like a peach shirt, he took it off, and then that's when the cops * * *, everybody came and stuff.\" Butler testified that Gordon put his shirt \"right on his dirty clothes, his clothes bag.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Butler let the police in his house and he, Gordon, and another friend were asked questions. Although Gordon had told Butler that he just shot somebody, Butler made no mention of this to the police. Asked why, Butler testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   A: Cuz I didn't want to be involved around this. I didn't want to be doing this * * * what I'm doing now. I don't want to be around the police, court, none of that, so I don't want nothing to do with this.

The video shows that on August 25, 2016, at 4:38 p.m., Nieves's white Corolla traveled through the intersection of W. 38th Street and Robert Avenue. Gordon, who is wearing the same orange T-shirt with a dark colored shirt or towel over his shoulder that he was wearing in the Fulton Beverage video from earlier that day, is seen \"running from where that car came from.

Gordon allegedly identified himself at the beginning of the call. \"[T]hey have the greeting and part of the greeting is they advise you this call is from - and they fill it in with their name, which was Neeko, and then it continued to advise you about it being monitored and recorded.\" The prosecutor then asked Det.

Sandoval next testified about a picture that he found posted on a Facebook\n   page belonging to \"Yonko Boolin.\" According to Det. Sandoval, Yonko was Gordon's nickname. Det. Sandoval testified that there \"appears to be a shotgun in his right hand and he's standing next to a male in a yellow shirt that appears to have a firearm stuck in his waistband like towards the front.\" On cross-examination, Det. Sandoval testified that he does not know when this picture was taken, he does not know if the gun is real, and he does not know who the man in the photo is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Det.

Nobody saw him with a gun and no gun was recovered. Three eyewitnesses described a man wearing a red shirt and black pants who was running away from the scene.

Of the witnesses who testified about the shooting, Holsey was the only one to identify Gordon as the shooter. Additionally, Butler testified that Gordon told him he \"just did a drill\" shortly after Nieves was shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Upon review, we find that\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the case at hand. First, there is forensic evidence that implicates Gordon in Nieves's shooting in that Gordon's hands tested positive for gunshot residue. Second, Holsey immediately identified Gordon as the shooter, and Holsey was never implicated in this crime. Third, other neutral eyewitnesses heard gunshots and saw a man dressed similar to Gordon at the scene and running away after the shots were fired. Fourth, Gordon is caught on video running away from the scene immediately after the shooting. Fifth, Gordon is caught on video talking to Holsey and Nieves immediately prior to the shooting, which corroborates Holsey's testimony that he had arranged to buy marijuana from Gordon. Sixth, Nieves's autopsy report concludes that he died from one bullet that entered the back of his neck on the left side and exited through his head and face. The autopsy also confirmed that the gun was fired more than four feet from Nieves. This is consistent with Holsey's and Sobczyk's testimony that the shooter was firing as Nieves was driving away, which was the position Gordon was in when the shooting occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   {\u00b6 57} We cannot say that the jury lost its way in convicting Gordon of murder, felonious assault, discharging a firearm in a prohibited area, and having a weapon while under disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Additionally, the evidence shows that no gun was ever found. Furthermore, when police questioned Gordon at the house on W. 41st Street not long after the shooting, Gordon was not wearing the orange shirt that he had on when he was running from the scene. That shirt was never recovered. Accordingly, we cannot say that the jury lost its way in convicting Gordon of tampering with evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Gordon's second assigned error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Admissibility of Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   {\u00b6 60} \"The admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

According to the record, this is the only time Det. Sandoval heard Gordon speak. Furthermore, although Det.

The picture, which is undated and contains no text or writing, shows two black males, one with a gun in the waistband of his jeans and the other holding what appears to be a shotgun in front of his face.

There is no evidence about who retrieved this photo or when it was retrieved. There is no evidence that Gordon is one of the men in the photograph.

The state did not\n   suggest that one of the guns in the photograph was the murder weapon in the instant case. The photograph tends to show that Gordon is the type of person who has a gun, and therefore, it is probable to conclude that he acted in conformity therewith concerning the shooting of Nieves on the night in question.

Furthermore, the court gave the jury a limiting instruction as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   You are instructed that the fact that the defendant fled the scene does not raise a presumption of guilt but it may tend to indicate the defendant's consciousness of guilt. * * * [I]f you find that some other motive prompted the defendant's conduct, or if you are unable to decide what the defendant's motivation was, then you should not consider the evidence for any purpose; however, if you find that the facts support the defendant engaged in such conduct and if you decide that defendant was motivated by a consciousness of guilt, you may but are not required to consider that * * * evidence in deciding whether the defendant is guilty of the crimes charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   {\u00b6 83} Upon review, we that the evidence does not weigh in favor of Gordon merely running away from gunfire, because all of the witnesses testified that there was only one black male crouching by the fence and coming toward the white car with his arm pointed when the shots were fired. Furthermore, there was only one black male running from the scene after the shots were fired. Accordingly, we find that the court did not abuse its discretion\n   by instructing the jury regarding flight. Gordon's fifth assigned error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   {\u00b6 84} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   MARY EILEEN KILBANE, J., CONCURS;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   EILEEN A. GALLAGHER, A.J., CONCURS WITH ATTACHED OPINION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   EILEEN A. GALLAGHER, A.J., CONCURRING WITH SEPARATE OPINION:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   {\u00b6 85} I concur with the judgment of my learned colleagues but write separately to address the admissibility of testimony related to the phone calls that emanated from the Cuyahoga County jail in this matter and that have been attributed to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   {\u00b6 86} In this case, the state elicited testimony from a Cleveland Police Department homicide Det. Joselito Sandoval, as to the Cuyahoga County jail telephone call system. Det. Sandoval is not an employee of the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department that has control of the jail operations. He provided testimony as to the telephone monitoring system utilized in the Cuyahoga County jail along with testimony regarding a call made by a person who identified himself as \"Neeko.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   {\u00b6 87} It is my opinion that an employee of the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department should have provided testimony as to the telephone system utilized in the county jail. It certainly would not have been onerous to have a representative of the sheriff's department testify as to the process and then the content of that phone call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   {\u00b6 88} The state frequently uses law enforcement officers from municipalities to provide testimony as to Cuyahoga County jail operations, and I find it to be troubling. In this case, the error is harmless but in the future, it may not be.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    It is unclear from the record who \"him\" is. Butler previously testified that he knew Gordon to carry a gun sometime in August 2016.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
