We dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The Janossys executed a promissory note in the amount of $96,224 in order to purchase a residential property. The property was encumbered by a recorded mortgage. Both the note and mortgage were assigned to various entities, ending with U.S. Bank Trust National Association (\"U.S. Bank\"). Sometime in 2015, the Janossys defaulted on the note; but before U.S. Bank initiated foreclosure proceedings, Agnes filed a breach of contract and quiet title action, claiming that U.S. Bank breached the terms of the promissory note and title to the property should be in the Janossys' name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only Agnes, acting pro se, signed the complaint in that civil action, despite also naming Ferenc as a pro se plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} U.S. Bank initiated the foreclosure proceeding, and the two cases were consolidated. The magistrate in the civil action granted U.S. Bank's motion to dismiss several months before the trial court entered a decision in the foreclosure proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In the foreclosure proceeding, the trial court granted judgment on the note and mortgage in favor of U.S. Bank upon an unopposed motion filed under Civ.R. 56. Although the Janossys were granted a stay of execution from the decree of foreclosure, which was certified as final under Civ.R. 54(B) for the purposes of this appeal, no bond was posted in order to obtain the stay. The sale of the property proceeded, and the $48,000 purchase price was confirmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Janossys did not appeal the confirmation of the sale, the second of two judgments appealable in foreclosure actions-the first being the order of foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    Blisswood Village Home Owners Assn. v.

The proceeds of the sale were distributed following the confirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In the appellate briefing, the Janossys claim the trial court erred with respect to granting the decree of foreclosure on their property, which was used as indemnification to partially satisfy the judgment entered upon the note,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and by dismissing the civil action. The Janossys, however, did not include the civil action, or\n   the related dispositive order, in their notice of appeal.

Thus, the situation in which the proceeds of sale have not been distributed at the time of the foreclosure appeal (\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   ), is no different from the situation in which the debtor obtains a stay to prevent the distribution (\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Blisswood Village\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    )\n   </em>\n   . In both cases, the mootness doctrine would not apply because there was no voluntary satisfaction of the judgment debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In this case, the distribution of the proceeds has occurred, and therefore, the limited exception from\n   <em>\n    McCurry\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable. Further, the Janossys have not challenged U.S. Bank's contention that the appeal is moot, nor have they provided any analysis for us to conclude otherwise.
