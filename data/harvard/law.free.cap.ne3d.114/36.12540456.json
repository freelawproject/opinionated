The matter is currently before the Court on the Department's\n   \"Motion for Sanctions and Contempt\" (\"Motion\"). The Court, being duly advised in the premises, grants the Department's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Sahara Mart owned and operated two grocery stores in Bloomington, Indiana during the years at issue. (Pet'r Original Tax Appeal Pet. (\"Pet.\") \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4; Jt. Stip. Facts \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.) In May of 2016, after completing an audit, the Department determined that Sahara Mart had underreported its taxable sales during the years at issue and failed to remit the proper amount of sales tax to the State. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. \u00b6 7.) The Department subsequently issued Proposed Assessments against Sahara Mart, including penalties and interest, totaling approximately $6.8 million. (Pet. \u00b6 8, Ex. B.) The Proposed Assessments were based on gross annual sales figures the Department extrapolated from Sahara Mart's 2007 federal income tax return. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. \u00b6 7.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Pet., Ex. C at 2 (indicating that the Department requested actual business records and receipts from Sahara Mart during the audit to no avail).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sahara Mart protested the Proposed Assessments and provided the Department with copies of a federal audit report that documented its gross sales for the 2008 through 2011 tax years. (Pet. \u00b6 9.) On January 13, 2017, the Department issued a Letter of Findings directing a supplemental audit in light of the federal report. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet., Ex. C at 4.) After the supplemental audit was completed, the Department issued revised Proposed Assessments reducing Sahara Mart's total sales tax liabilities for the years at issue to approximately $1.5 million. (Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, Ex. F.) Believing the revised Proposed Assessments were still incorrect, Sahara Mart filed an original tax appeal on September 25, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 29, 2018, while the case was pending, the Department deposed Sahara Mart's majority owner, Mr. Javad Noorihoseini. During the deposition, Noorihoseini testified that Sahara Mart was generally operated by unpaid family members, friends, and other volunteers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition of Javad Noorihoseini (\"Noorihoseini Dep.\") at 17:7-22:16, 23:15-19, 69:20-70:4, 78:11-78:23.) Noorihoseini further testified that while Sahara Mart occasionally paid for the services of independent contractors and consultants, it had no employees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Noorihoseini Dep. at 18:11-21:9 (stating unequivocally that Sahara Mart does not have, nor did it have during the years at issue, \"any employees\"), 27:16-29:5 (testifying that \"sometimes we have to hire some people to consult with [our suppliers] on some levels if need be[ a]nd sometimes we contract people to do things for a period of time\" like moving or preparing things), 187:4-10.) In addition, Noorihoseini testified that approximately 40% of the beer and alcohol Sahara Mart purchased annually for resale was never sold because it went bad and had to be destroyed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Noorihoseini Dep. at 203:9-205:6, 208:10-209:17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Questioning the veracity of Noorihoseini's deposition testimony, the Department launched an \"independent\" investigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp't Corrected Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions and Contempt (\"Dep't Br.\") at 6, 9 (stating that \"it seemed highly unlikely a company could run two grocery stores each open seventy-six hours a week without any employees or that it would destroy huge amounts of alcohol on an annual basis rather than reducing its orders or otherwise adapting as a business\").) During the course of its investigation, the Department secured affidavits from four individuals who averred that during the years at issue, they had been employed by Sahara Mart and were paid, mostly in cash, for each\n   hour worked, and that they knew of other individuals who were, like them, Sahara Mart employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Dep't Br. at 10-13 (citations omitted).) The affiants also stated that they never witnessed any destruction of alcohol by Sahara Mart. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Dep't Br. at 14 (citations omitted).) Finally, several of the affiants stated that, after his deposition, Noorihoseini contacted them and attempted to secure their \"cooperation\" in the event they were contacted by the Department. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Dep't Br. at 16-20 (citations omitted).) One affiant averred that Noorihoseini offered to pay her $1,000 \"to cooperate.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep't Br., Ex. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 22, 2018, the Department filed its Motion, asserting that Sahara Mart and Noorihoseini were \"engaged in a fraudulent scheme to avoid paying taxes\" and had committed perjury and witness tampering. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Resp't Proposed Findings and Conclusions (\"Dep't Findings\") \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.) Consequently, the Department requested the Court find them in contempt and sanction them - pursuant to both the Court's inherent power and the power granted to it under Trial Rule 37 - by dismissing the case with prejudice and awarding the Department its attorney fees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep't Br. at 20-26.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Dep't Findings \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.) As support for its Motion, the Department submitted Noorihoseini's deposition, the affidavits of the four individuals who claimed they were Sahara Mart employees, and the affidavit of one of the Department's attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court conducted a show cause hearing on the Department's Motion on July 12, 2018. On August 6, 2018, the parties filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Additional facts will be supplied as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Contempt\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Contempt involves a disobedience that undermines a court's authority, justice, and dignity.\n   <em>\n    Witt v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Hr'g Tr. at 20-21 (citing Dep't Br. at 3, 17).)

Without a T.R. 30(E)(4) certificate, the Depo may not be used \"with the same force and effect as though the original had been signed by the witness.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Sahara Mart's Findings \u00b6 34(2)(a)-(c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Indiana Trial Rule 30(E) requires that a deponent be permitted to read and sign her deposition and, if desired, change any answer given in the deposition. Ind. Trial Rule 30(E)(1)-(2). If, however, the deponent fails to either sign the deposition or return it entirely, the transcribing reporter must: 1) execute a certificate as to those facts; and then 2) deliver the certificate to the party who took the deposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T.R. 30(E)(3)-(4). The deposition may then be used by any party \"with the same force and effect as though it had been signed\" by the deponent. T.R. 30(E)(3)-(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Sahara Mart's complaint that the copy of Noorihoseini's deposition submitted to the Court does not contain a certificate from the transcribing reporter, however, is of no moment here. Indeed,\n   Indiana Trial Rule 32(D)(4), titled \"Effect of errors and irregularities ... As to completion and return of deposition[,]\" provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Errors and irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, sealed, indorsed, transmitted, filed, or otherwise dealt with by the officer under [Trial] Rules 30 and 31 are waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after such defect is, or with due diligence might have been ascertained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ind. Trial Rule 32(D)(4). Accordingly, it was up to Sahara Mart to demonstrate during the show cause hearing that it had, with reasonable promptness, moved to suppress Noorihoseini's deposition, alleging a defect.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    S.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Hr'g Tr. at 5-7; Resp't Notice Submission (\"Dep't Notice\") (filed Aug. 14, 2018), Ex. A.) Neither he nor Sahara Mart, however, moved to suppress the deposition or any part thereof before the show cause hearing held nearly three months later. This lack of promptness is further compounded by the fact that neither Sahara Mart nor Noorihoseini has ever presented an argument that there were inaccuracies in the substance of Noorihoseini's deposition testimony as transcribed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Hr'g Tr.; Sahara Mart's Findings.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dotson v.

Ct. App. 2018) (finding that the deponent's failure to sign a deposition was not fatal when there were no claimed inaccuracies in the substance of the deponent's testimony). Accordingly, the Court may properly consider Noorihoseini's deposition and denies Sahara Mart's objection to its use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   3. The Affidavits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, Sahara Mart argues that all five affidavits submitted by the Department should be stricken because each suffers from one or more infirmities that render it inadmissible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Hr'g Tr. at 24.) Specifically, Sahara Mart explains that each of the affidavits should be stricken because they either: a) constitute hearsay; b) contain speculation and legal conclusions; c) were submitted with inadmissible attachments; or d) contain irrelevant information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sahara Mart's Findings \u00b6 (1)(a)-(h).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   a) Hearsay\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Sahara Mart has raised what it refers to as a \"double hearsay\" objection with respect to two of the affidavits. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Hr'g Tr. at 24, 47-48; Sahara Mart's Findings \u00b6 34(1)(g).) Sahara Mart related its objection to specific statements made as proof of a fact within each of the affidavits and provided its reasons why these statements constituted inadmissible hearsay. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Hr'g Tr. at 24, 47-48\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Ind. Evidence Rule 801(a)-(c).) Accordingly, Sahara Mart's objection is sustained, and the Court strikes paragraphs 4 and 9 of the Stahl affidavit (Dep't Br., Ex. 5) and paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of the Bartel affidavit (Dep't Br., Ex. 7). The striking of the specific portions of these affidavits does not, however, have an impact on the outcome of the Court's disposition of the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Sahara Mart has further posited a broad and overarching hearsay objection to all the affidavits. Its\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   argument supporting this general objection is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Each of the affidavits is a statement that: \"(1) is not made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing; and (2) is offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Evid. R. 801(c). The Affidavits, therefore, constitute inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies.\n   <em>\n    Holmes v. Nat'l Collegiate Student Loan Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12551156\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/94/722/#p725\">\n    94 N.E.3d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 725 (Ind. Ct. App. 2018) (\"Inadmissible hearsay contained in an affidavit may not be considered ....\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (Sahara Mart's Findings \u00b6 34(1)(a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Sahara Mart did not provide the Court with anything more than the quoted definition of hearsay,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Evid. R. 801(a)-(c), and a case citation in the apparent belief that the Court would develop legal arguments on its own and relate them to specific statements within each affidavit. The Court is not an advocate and will not do Sahara Mart's work for it. Accordingly, the Court denies all of Sahara Mart's remaining hearsay objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   b) Speculation and Legal Conclusions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The four affiants stated that during the years at issue, they were paid for their work at Sahara Mart, they were employees of Sahara Mart, and described when they worked at Sahara Mart, what their responsibilities were while they were working there, how they were paid, and how much they were paid. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Dep't Br., Exs. 2-5.) Sahara Mart contends that the affidavits must be stricken because the \" 'question of whether an individual is an employee ... is a legal conclusion' \" and \"a lay witness cannot provide a legal conclusion.\" (Show Cause Hr'g Tr. at 46-47; Sahara Mart's Findings \u00b6 34(1)(c) (citation omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Indiana Rule of Evidence 704 states that witnesses (in this case, the affiants) may not testify to legal conclusions. Ind. Evidence Rule 704(b). Nonetheless, the\n   <em>\n    Court's\n   </em>\n   legal conclusion whether an individual is an employee derives from the existence of certain facts, including whether one believes herself to be an employee.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mortg. Consultants, Inc. v. Mahaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10932117\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/655/493/#p495\">\n    655 N.E.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 495-96 (Ind. 1995) ;\n   <em>\n    Bauermeister v. Churchman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193962\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/59/969/#p974\">\n    59 N.E.3d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 974-76 (Ind. Ct. App. 2016) (citation omitted). Thus, the attestations of the affiants that Sahara Mart paid them for services rendered as employees is evidence that is properly considered by the Court. The Court therefore denies Sahara Mart's motion to strike the affidavits on the basis they contain inadmissible speculation and legal conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   c) Affidavit Attachments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Department attached to one of the affidavits at issue a copy of a text message conversation between Noorihoseini and that affiant. In this text message conversation, Noorihoseini asked the affiant to contact another alleged Sahara Mart employee because she would not respond to him, and he needed her \"to cooperate.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep't Br., Ex. 4 \u00b6 25, Ex. A.) The Department attached to another affidavit both a Facebook \"screenshot\" of a comment by another alleged employee that stated Sahara Mart did \"not treat [its] employees well\" together with an additional text message conversation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep't Br., Ex. 7 \u00b6 4, Exs. 1, 2.) During the show cause hearing, Sahara Mart moved to strike all three attachments because they were \"incomplete.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Hr'g Tr. at 24, 49.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Sahara Mart's Findings \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Pursuant to Indiana Evidence Rule 106, Sahara Mart should have, during the show cause hearing, followed up its objection by requiring \"the introduction ... of any other\n   part - or any other writing or recorded statement - that in fairness ought to be considered\" with the submitted attachments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ind. Evidence Rule 106. It did not do so, and despite having a subsequent opportunity to provide that information in its findings of fact and conclusions of law, it failed to identify the additional information that would have made the evidence complete. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Hr'g Tr.; Sahara Mart's Findings.) Consequently, the Court denies Sahara Mart's objection to strike the affidavits on the basis that their attachments were incomplete.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   d) Relevance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, Sahara Mart has objected to the admissibility of the affidavits on the grounds that they are \"full of\" irrelevant information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Hr'g Tr. at 23-25 (complaining about statements in the affidavits that Sahara Mart sold alcohol on Sundays, that its \"z-tapes\" were inaccurate, that Noorihoseini skimmed cash from the company, and that he authorized the creation of fake invoices), 49-50 (complaining about statements in the affidavits that Sahara Mart paid individuals in cash); Sahara Mart's Findings \u00b6 34(1)(f).) Sahara Mart argues that these statements have nothing to do with whether or not Sahara Mart had employees or destroyed alcohol and are thus used for the sole purpose of \"inflaming\" the Court. (Show Cause Hr'g Tr. at 23, 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Evidence is considered relevant if \"(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.\" Ind. Evidence Rule 401. Here, the Court must make a factual determination whether Sahara Mart through Noorihoseini 1) lied about not paying its workers and having no employees, 2) lied about destroying alcohol, and 3) attempted to influence a witness to give, or abstain from giving, testimony in the case. The affiants' challenged statements are relevant to the Court's factual determination because they will affect the probability of two consequential facts: whether Sahara Mart operated using volunteers not employees and whether it destroyed rather than sold certain alcohol. Accordingly, the Court denies Sahara Mart's objection to strike the affidavits on the basis that their content is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   4. Perjury and Witness Tampering\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Department has presented several pieces of evidence to support its allegations that Sahara Mart and Noorihoseini committed perjury and witness tampering\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and are therefore in contempt of court. Rather than refute the facts presented in that evidence that underlies the Department's contempt charge, Sahara Mart chose to challenge the admissibility of the Department's evidence. Those admissibility challenges, however, have proven unsuccessful. After considering the admissible evidence, the Court holds that Sahara Mart - through Noorihoseini - has committed both perjury and witness tampering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   One commits perjury by making \"a false, material statement under oath or\n   affirmation, knowing the statement to be false or not believing it to be true[.]\" IND. CODE \u00a7 35-44-2-1 (2018). To support a finding of perjury, the evidence must show that the false statement attested to is material to the outcome of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pollard v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1687582\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ind/218/56/\">\n    218 Ind. 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20N.E.2d%20956\">\n    29 N.E.2d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 958 (1940) ;\n   <em>\n    Paschall v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11575009\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/717/1273/#p1276\">\n    717 N.E.2d 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1276 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Here, Noorihoseini testified that one of the affiants, Brooke Henry, was never paid for her services, but she testified that she was paid by Sahara Mart for her services as a full-time nutritional adviser and alcohol purchaser at Sahara Mart for approximately 17 years. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Noorihoseini Dep. at 20:3-11\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dep't Br., Ex. 3.) Moreover, all the affiants swore they were paid during the relevant time periods. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep't Br., Exs. 2-5.) Neither Noorihoseini nor Sahara Mart rebutted this evidence. Consequently, as finder of fact, the Court finds that Noorihoseini made false statements under oath that Sahara Mart workers were generally unpaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Noorihoseini's false statements are material to the outcome of the underlying case. For purposes of perjury, a material fact is one that is reasonably calculated to mislead an investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daniels v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10901151\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/658/121/#p123\">\n    658 N.E.2d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123 (Ind. Ct. App. 1995) (citations omitted). Noorihoseini's false statements about Sahara Mart operating with unpaid volunteers rather than employees was reasonably calculated to lead the Department to believe the so-called volunteers would not have evidence material to this matter. Sahara Mart's business practices and the manner and accuracy by which it kept its books and records - including its payment practices - are central to the claims and defenses in this matter. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 16-19 (alleging that because Sahara Mart had federal records to support its gross sales during the year at issue, it was unnecessary for the Department to do its own best information assessment).) Accordingly, the Court holds that Sahara Mart and Noorihoseini committed perjury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The evidence also shows that Sahara Mart and Noorihoseini engaged in witness tampering.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the Department submitted two affidavits into evidence demonstrating that Noorihoseini attempted to influence potential witnesses into saying something that was not true and even offered to pay for such false statements. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Noorihoseini Dep. at 20:3-11\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dep't Br., Ex. 3 \u00b6 18, Ex. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 19-26.) Again, Sahara Mart and Noorihoseini did not attempt to rebut the substance of this evidence. The Court therefore finds that Sahara Mart - through Noorihoseini - was also engaged in witness tampering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   5. Sanctions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Having found that Sahara Mart and Noorihoseini committed perjury and witness tampering, the Court finds them in contempt and that sanctions are appropriate. Sanctions must be \"just\" in light of the particular circumstances of the case.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , T.R. 37(B)(2);\n   <em>\n    Prime Mortg.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8245669\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/885/628/#p650\">\n    885 N.E.2d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" 'The only limitation on [a] court in determining an appropriate sanction is that the sanction must be just' \" (citation omitted) ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

To that end, many other courts have explained that \"[a]s a fraud on the court, perjury may warrant the sanction of dismissal[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Montano v.

Dismissal is a severe sanction given its finality, but the Court finds that the contempt detailed in this opinion is so egregious that it warrants just such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   During his deposition, Noorihoseini abused the discovery process by attempting to hide from the Department the identity of individuals who were paid for regular and continuous services to Sahara Mart and thus had knowledge about Sahara Mart's business practices. This deception not only impeded overall trial preparation, but also prejudiced the Department, which had to expend time and money gathering and presenting evidence of the perjury at the show cause hearing. Upon learning that the Department discovered and interviewed several of these individuals, Noorihoseini abused the judicial process further by asking several of the individuals to provide - or conceal - certain information, even offering money in exchange for their \"cooperation.\" The Court will not tolerate Sahara Mart's blatant attempts to deceive both its opponent and this Court. Accordingly, the Court exercises its authority under both Trial Rule 37 and the Court's inherent power by imposing the just sanction of dismissal of this case with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   b) Attorney's Fees\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Once a party has been found in contempt of court, reasonable attorney fees may be awarded to the opposing party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 34-47-3-6(c) ; T.R. 37(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crowl v.

Ct. App. 1997) (stating it is within a court's inherent power to award attorney's fees for civil contempt). Accordingly, the Department seeks attorney's fees \"incurred in defending this action, taking [Noorihoseini's] Deposition, investigating the false claims made therein, calling and interviewing non-disclosed, non-party witnesses and bringing this Motion before the Court.\" (Show Cause Hr'g Tr. at 19, 57; Dept's Findings \u00b6 37.) In support of that request, the Department submitted the affidavit of its attorney, Hamish S. Cohen, to show that it incurred $65,270.70 in expenses between December 20, 2017 (the date the Department filed its appearance in the case) and July 12, 2018 (the date of the show cause hearing). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aff. Hamish S. Cohen, Ex. A (filed July 16, 2018).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In response, Sahara Mart contends the Department's request is unreasonable. Specifically, it states\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [t]hey're not entitled to fees from Day 1.... [Instead,] it would be solely related to the month of May of 2018, perhaps into June[.] ...

Accordingly, the Court finds that the appropriate reimbursement period in this case began on March 30, 2018, the day\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Department took Noorihoseini's deposition in which he lied, through July 12, 2018, the day of the show cause hearing. Indeed, it was during this time period that the Department had to adjust its entire approach in handling the case to account for the newly-discovered deceptive efforts of Sahara Mart and Noorihoseini. Upon review of the Department's evidence as to this time period, the Court finds the Department's expenses of $45,000.00 to be reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   At the outset of the show cause hearing, Sahara Mart informed the Court that it took the charges against it seriously and that it \"d[idn't] come to th[e] courtroom throwing whatever [it] c[ould] at the wall to see what st[uck.]\" (Show Cause Hr'g Tr. at 13-14, 20, 50-51.) But as described throughout this opinion, that is exactly what Sahara Mart did: it came to Court and attempted to avoid the charges of perjury and witness tampering merely by making a series of poorly-developed - and ultimately unsuccessful - evidentiary objections. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the Department's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court hereby ORDERS this cause DISMISSED with prejudice. The Court also ORDERS Sahara Mart to pay the Department's reasonable attorney's fees in the amount of $45,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   SO ORDERED this 26\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of October, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The Department produced an affidavit by Amanda Christophel, who also claimed to be a Sahara Mart employee, but she did not sign her affidavit. While the Department contends the affidavit was signed electronically, it did not submit a copy of the affidavit that comports with the electronic signature provisions contained in Indiana Trial Rules.
