Preamble: A lawyer's responsibilities (\"As advocate, a lawyer asserts the client's position under the rules of the adversary system.\"). Particularly troublesome is that counsel then posits potential assignments of error while arguing why the potential errors are frivolous, a role properly assigned to appellee. Such a schizophrenic approach not only confuses the client and leads to distrust of the justice system, but also could result in a miscarriage of justice because in reality it invites perfunctory review by the court.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mosley v.

In this case, for instance, appellant's counsel filed an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief pointing to no potential assignment of error; despite our finding otherwise. Perhaps counsel should focus diligently on locating meritorious issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    What is Frivolous?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} What constitutes a frivolous assignment of error? This requires referencing Prof.Cond.R. 3.1,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . This rule and its three comments address an Ohio lawyer's obligations with respect to \"meritorious claims and contentions.\" The ethical\n   guidelines therein, with respect to criminal defense, can be summarized as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 23} A criminal defense attorney must proceed with a basis in law (procedural and substantive) and fact. Whether the attorney believes the client has a meritorious defense or not is irrelevant, because the attorney must use the legal process for her client's benefit and, at a minimum, may defend as to require every element of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. So long as no abuse of the process occurs, all that is required is a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of law, and this is in light of the fact that the law is often ambiguous, in need of change, and never static.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Prof.Cond.R. 3.1, comment 3, further adds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [3] The lawyer's obligations under this rule are subordinate to federal or state constitutional law that entitles a defendant in a criminal matter to the assistance of counsel in presenting a claim or contention that otherwise would be prohibited by this rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mosley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7246474\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/908/599/#p608\">\n    908 N.E.2d at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (using similarly worded \" Ind. Professional Conduct Rule 3.1 cmt.\" and the Indiana oath of attorneys to support the prohibition of\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   briefs in criminal appeals).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 25} We find this rule, and in particular comment 3, eliminates any ethical concerns counsel may have when advocating as a defense attorney and asserting the client's position under the rules of the adversary system. Even without comment 3's protective language added to the rule, we find a lawyer has substantial room to argue in defense of her client. This is especially on appeal where the entire record is available to be scrutinized for error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Initially, and because an attorney may require proof of the elements of a crime, we find there may be legal sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence arguments to be made on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prof.Cond.R. 3.1 (\"A lawyer for the defendant in a criminal proceeding * * * may nevertheless so defend the proceeding as to require that every element of the case be established.\");\n   <em>\n    State v.
