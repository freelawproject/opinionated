L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and denied relief without a hearing.\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      We affirm.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-8\">\n      The Commonwealth filed a petition in the Superior Court seeking civil commitment of Crittenden as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to G. L. c. 123A. He was temporarily committed to the Massachusetts Treatment Center, and a probable cause hearing was scheduled. Meanwhile, Crittenden was evaluated and a report was prepared pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 18 (\n      <em>\n       a\n      </em>\n      ).\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n      Before the hearing, an assistant district attorney provided a copy of the \u00a7 18 (\n      <em>\n       a\n      </em>\n      ) report to Crittenden's counsel. Asserting that the district attorney was not properly in\n     possession of the \u00a7 18 (\n      <em>\n       a\n      </em>\n      ) report, Crittenden moved, among other things, for an order preventing future dissemination of the report by the district attorney for purposes of the G. L. c. 123A proceeding, or for any other purpose. The judge denied the motion.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      Crittenden filed a petition in the county court seeking review of that interlocutory order. He argues that records of evaluations under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 18, are protected from disclosure to third parties except by court order, pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 36A. He also argues that dissemination of the \u00a7 18 (\n      <em>\n       a\n      </em>\n      ) report, including material that he contends are privileged, will result in irremediable violation of his rights. The single justice denied relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and Crittenden appeals.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      The case is now before us pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 2:21, as amended,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20Mass.%201301\">\n       434 Mass. 1301\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2001), which requires a petitioner to \"set forth the reasons why review of the trial court decision cannot adequately be obtained on appeal from any final adverse judgment in the trial court or by other available means.\" S.J.C. Rule 2:21 (2). Crittenden failed to meet that burden. The single justice properly declined to exercise the court's extraordinary power of superintendence under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, in light of an adequate alternative remedy, namely, a petition for relief in the Appeals\n     Court under G.
