JONES, SR., J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant Lewis Merletti (\"Merletti\") appeals from the trial court's August 1, 2017 decision granting summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellees Jeremy Samide (\"Samide\") and Ann Katigbak (\"Katigbak\"). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Samide and Katigbak, along with nonparties Don Heestand (\"Heestand\") and Brian McCune, founded defendant-appellee E-Merging Technologies Group, Inc. (\"ETG\" or \"the company\"). Pursuant to a January 1, 2001 shareholder agreement, Heestand was the chief executive officer and owned 85 shares of the company's stock; Samide was the treasurer and owned five shares; and Katigbak was the secretary and owned five shares. McCune owned the remaining five shares of the company's stock. Heestand, Samide, and Katigbak were primarily responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 2007, Heestand recruited Merletti to sit on ETG's senior advisory board and Merletti agreed. Heestand gifted Merletti ten shares of the company's stock in exchange for his participation. Merletti thereby became an ETG minority shareholder and advisory board member; it is undisputed that Merletti was never an ETG employee. According to Merletti, Heestand told him that his shares in the company would one day make him a millionaire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In June 2008, Heestand passed away. At the time of Heestand's passing, ETG was a multimillion dollar company. After Heestand's death, Samide and Katigbak took control of the company and, according to Merletti, did so in a manner to benefit themselves and to the detriment of the shareholders. For example, Merletti detailed \"dramatic pay increases [Samide and Katigbak took] without any notice to or approval by the other shareholders.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In March 2009, a meeting was held to nominate and appoint a board of directors for the company. As a result of the meeting, seven people were appointed: Samide, Katigbak, Merletti, Charles Painter, Thomas Kasza, Michael Dobeck, and Jacquelyn Huron.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In July 2009, Merletti was appointed as chairman of the board of directors, and was compensated for his services in that position. He was also provided a commission for any business that he helped the company develop. However, Merletti never received a salary or other employment-related compensation from ETG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} As a result of Heestand's passing, Samide was promoted to the position of chief executive officer, and he and the company executed an employment agreement. Katigbak also executed a similar employment agreement with the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Merlettti contends that the agreements were \"surreptitiously\" executed without board approval, and provided \"exorbitant\" compensation and \"significant fringe benefits\" for Samide and Katigbak. The agreements included provisions that if Samide or Katigbak were terminated or had their salaries reduced, they were entitled to have ETG repurchase their shares of stock. Additionally, after Heestand's passing, the company, as required by the shareholder agreement, entered into an agreement with Heestand's estate to purchase his shares in the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After this reorganization in the company, Samide and Katigbak each owned 20 shares in ETG; Merletti retained\n   his original ten shares; and other employees/directors owned the remaining shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Further, because a number of the company's shareholders were directors but not employees of the company (including Merletti), the shareholders executed a first amendment to the 2001 shareholder agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the company had the right, in its sole discretion, to purchase a director's shares in ETG upon the director's termination or resignation from service to the company in the same manner that the company could elect to purchase the shares of employees who resigned or were terminated from the company. The amended agreement provided that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [f]or purposes of the [shareholder agreement], a member of the Board of Directors of [the] Company shall be considered an employee and removal or resignation shall be considered a right for the Company to purchase the Director's shares at Book Value pursuant to Section 4 of the [shareholder agreement].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The record demonstrates that the company's financial outlook declined after Heestand's death. The board secured an outside accounting firm to conduct a forensic audit of the company for the year 2011. The audit revealed an unexplained increase of over $975,500 from 2010 to 2011 in \"general and administrative\" expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In August 2012, a board meeting was held, and the results of the audit were reviewed. According to Merletti, the unexplained increase was not properly accounted for. The board decided that it was going to conduct another audit for the years 2010-2012. Merletti sought to obtain documents relative to ETG, including financial documents. The company, through Katigbak, refused to provide Merletti with any financial documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} After Merletti raised his concerns, Samide scheduled a \"special\" shareholder meeting for September 7, 2012. The purpose of the meeting was to fix the number of board members to three and elect those members. During his deposition, Samide testified that he felt this was necessary because Merletti and some of the other board members had become \"adversarial\" toward him, and he felt that reducing the board to three members would help protect himself, his family, and ETG. Believing that his removal from the board was certain, Merletti resigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} After Merletti's resignation, the company provided Merletti notice of its intention to purchase his shares at book value as provided under the shareholder agreement and the first amendment to the agreement. In October 2012, the company informed Merletti that his shares in ETG had a negative book value and, thus, the company had no obligation to pay him for the shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In November 2012, Merletti initiated this action against ETG, Samide, and Katigbak seeking (1) a declaratory judgment regarding the \"appropriate method for calculating the value of [his] shares\" due to his resignation from the board (Count 1); (2) specific performance of the shareholder agreement to value his shares at the fair market value (Count 2); and (3) production of the company's financial documents (Count 3). Merletti also asserted claims against the defendants for breach of fiduciary duty (Count 4) and fraud (Count 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} ETG, Samide, and Katigbak counterclaimed against Merletti for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference with business relations,\n   and unjust enrichment. The defendants also filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss Merletti's complaint. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss as it related to Counts 1, 2, and 3 of Merletti's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The case proceeded through discovery, and in June 2015, while the case was still pending, ETG filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Despite the bankruptcy filing, the case remained active on the common pleas docket, and Samide and Katigbak filed motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} As a result of proceedings in the bankruptcy court, Merletti dismissed his claims against ETG and ETG dismissed its counterclaims against Merletti. Thus, Merletti's remaining claims were against Samide and Katigbak for breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In August 2017, the trial court rendered its decision on Samide's and Katigbak's motions for summary judgment. The court found that it was \"constrained by the bankruptcy proceeding of [ETG] from allowing [Merletti] to proceed forward with his remaining claims in the matter.\" The trial court therefore granted summary judgment in favor of Samide and Katigbak and against Merletti. Merletti now appeals, contending the following in his sole assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellees Jeremy Samide and Ann Katigbak based upon a finding that Plaintiff-Appellant Lewis Merletti's claims against Mr. Samide and Ms. Katigbak personally were derivative, became the property of the bankruptcy estate for the company in which he, Mr. Samide, and Ms. Katigbak were shareholders, and were resolved in the bankruptcy proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Additional facts will be discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Merletti relies on\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   for his contention that, as a minority shareholder of ETG, a closely held corporation, he was permitted to file a direct action against Samide and Katigbak for the alleged individual harm they caused him. He is correct that\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   stands for that proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   , Howard Crosby was a minority shareholder in Seascape Building Company, Inc. (\"Seascape\"). Crosby transferred all of his Seascape stock to Christian Caring Center, The Church of Holy Light (\"the church\"). A few months after Crosby's transfer of his Seascape stock, Seascape was voluntarily dissolved. As a result of its dissolution, all of its corporate assets were transferred to the Crosby Properties Liquidating Trust (\"the trust\"). Each shareholder of Seascape became a beneficiary of the trust in the percentage equaling his or her interest in Seascape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Two couples were the controlling shareholders and officers and directors of Seascape. Crosby and the church brought an action against the couples, contending that they improperly expended corporate funds by, for example, paying themselves unreasonable salaries and using Seascape funds for their personal benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The defendants sought dismissal of the action under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) on the ground that the plaintiffs' action could only be maintained as a shareholder derivative action under Civ.R. 23.1. According to the defendants, the alleged misappropriation of corporate funds directly affected the corporation and only indirectly harmed Crosby and the church and, therefore, Crosby and the church could not maintain their case as a direct action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The Ohio Supreme Court, recognizing the nature of a closely held corporation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   held that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   if we require a minority shareholder in a close corporation, who alleges that the majority shareholders breached their fiduciary duty to him, to institute an action pursuant to Civ.R. 23.1, then any recovery would accrue to the corporation and remain under the control of the very parties who are defendants in the litigation. Thus, a derivative remedy is not an effective remedy because the wrongdoers would be the principal beneficiaries of the recovery.\n   <em>\n    See, generally\n   </em>\n   , 2 [O'Neal &amp; Thompson] O'Neal's Close Corporations [ (3 Ed.1987) ] 120-123, Section 8.11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Under the authority of\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   , Merletti contends that, as a minority shareholder of ETG, a closely held corporation, he properly brought his breach of\n   fiduciary duty and fraud claims as direct claims against the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Court's Ruling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The trial court recognized\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   and its holding, stating that \"Ohio law allows for a minority shareholder like [Merletti] to file a direct action lawsuit at the outset for claims asserting individual harm against majority shareholders of a closely held corporation * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 31} But the court found that \"even in situations in which a direct action by a minority shareholder against majority shareholders is appropriate under state law, the bankruptcy proceeding of the debtor corporation takes precedence in rendering the minority shareholder's direct action inappropriate if the debtor corporation could have also brought forth an action for the same state claims at the time of its bankruptcy filing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The trial court went on to find that Merletti's \"state claims for breach of fiduciary duty and fraud against defendant Samide and defendant Katigbak could have been brought by debtor ETG at the commencement of ETG's bankruptcy proceeding, and thus those claims have exclusively become the property of ETG's bankruptcy estate and cannot be maintained by [Merletti] as a creditor at this stage in the litigation.\" In reaching its conclusion, the trial court relied on\n   <em>\n    Honigman v.

Van Dresser owned two subsidiaries: Renaissance Manufacturing Company (\"Renaissance\") and Van Dresser Corporation/Westland (\"Westland\"). One of the defendants, Grant Friley (\"Friley\"), was the president of Renaissance and the manufacturing manager of Westland. Friley drained approximately $2.7 million from Renaissance and Westland, causing both subsidiaries and the parent company, Van Dresser, to declare bankruptcy. In state court, Honigman sued Friley, Comerica Bank, which was the bank Honigman dealt with, and an assistant branch manager of the bank, alleging that the defendants caused him to lose approximately $1.1 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Honigman maintained that he was not suing as a shareholder who had been injured by the loss of his stock value; rather, he contended that he had a direct relationship with the bank as a longtime borrower, which gave rise to special duties owed to him personally. Specifically, according to Honigman, Van Dresser obtained a $225,000 loan from the bank because of his relationship with the bank and his cosigning on the loan, and he guaranteed another $900,000 in loans from the bank to Van Dresser. Thus, Honigman maintained that when the company defaulted on the loans, he was forced to repay them and, therefore, he suffered an injury separate and distinct from the injuries that Van Dresser, Renaissance, and Westland suffered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Renaissance and Westland recovered a portion of the $2.7 million from the bank. The bankruptcy trustees for the companies notified all creditors, including Honigman, of a proposed settlement with the bank. Honigman did not object, and the bankruptcy court approved the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The district court found that Honigman's claims were derivative and therefore were the exclusive property of\n   the debtors' estates. Honigman appealed, contending that state law (Michigan) allowed him to recover personally from Friley, the bank, and the bank's assistant manager\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   to recover from the defendants through the bankruptcy proceedings.

Thus, to the extent that Merletti's action was a direct action, it would generally be permissible under Ohio law. But that does not end our inquiry because there is a complicating factor here: the company's bankruptcy. The cases Merletti relies on -\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Yackel\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Edelman\n   </em>\n   - did not involve bankruptcy. Here, as mentioned, ETG filed for bankruptcy in June 2015, while this case was still pending, and a trustee was appointed. We now review some further facts relative to the bankruptcy proceeding in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 49} In addition to Merletti's claims against ETG, the company was also subject to claims made by others. Specifically, former board member and shareholder Jacquelyn Huron (\"Huron\") and former employee and shareholder Stephen Heestand filed an action against ETG, Samide, and Katigbak (\"the\n   <em>\n    Huron\n   </em>\n   case\").\n   <em>\n    The claims of all these plaintiffs - Merletti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Huron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    and Stephen Heestand - were subject to the bankruptcy proceedings\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 50} In regard to Merletti, the record demonstrates that in November 2015, by and through the same counsel who represented him in this action, Merletti filed a notice of claim in the bankruptcy case, seeking $1.6 million for the \"repurchase of [his] shares of stock per [the] shareholder agreement\"; Merletti also sought $1.6 million in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 51} During the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, the parties in the\n   <em>\n    Huron\n   </em>\n   case and the bankruptcy trustee entered into a settlement agreement. The settlement included a release of Samide and Katigbak. The settlement was approved by the bankruptcy court after finding that there were no objections to it and that it was \"in the best interests of this estate and its creditors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 52} In November 2016, the bankruptcy trustee and Merletti entered into a settlement agreement. Under the agreement, ETG would dismiss its counterclaims against Merletti set forth in this action in exchange for Merletti dismissing his claims against the company in this action and subordinating his $1.6. million claim.\n   <em>\n    Merletti also agreed not to object to the settlement in the Huron case\n   </em>\n   . The trustee stated the following in regard to the settlement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Having given serious consideration to the litigation alternative, the trustee believes that the compromise as proposed is fair and reasonable in light of the fact that the State Court Action [this case] has been aggressively prosecuted and defended without any meaningful prospect of settlement until now, the costs and expenses of continuing the litigation, the risks inherent in such litigation and the delay in expeditiously administering the estate as the result of continued litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 53} As stated, the settlement in the\n   <em>\n    Huron\n   </em>\n   case included a release of Samide and Katigbak; Merletti agreed to not object to that release. Merletti's claims were therefore settled in the bankruptcy proceeding, and review of documents submitted in this case from the bankruptcy proceeding demonstrate that that was the intent of the parties: to completely settle the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Therefore, Merletti's attempt to continue to litigate his claims in this case is an attempt to obtain a double recovery. It is a well-settled rule of law that the \"measure of damages is that which will compensate and make the plaintiff whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Pryor v. Webber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6711105\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/23/104/\">\n    23 Ohio St.2d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=263%20N.E.2d%20235\">\n    263 N.E.2d 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970), paragraph one of the syllabus.

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has determined that a claim is\n   \"related to\" a bankruptcy proceeding if the result of the matter \" 'could alter the debtor's rights, liabilities, options, or freedom of action and which in any way impacts upon the handling and administration of the bankrupt estate.' \"\n   <em>\n    Browning v.

The record further indicates that it was the intent of the parties that settlement of Merletti's bankruptcy claim was for complete settlement of the entire matter. The fact that ETG was a closely-held corporation does not change the outcome for the purpose of resolving this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Further, although\n   <em>\n    Boedeker\n   </em>\n   did not involve bankruptcy, it addressed more than the issue of a real party in interest, as previously discussed. And the ruling that although a plaintiff may have had a right to prosecute his or her claim prior to liquidation, but the interest transfers to a liquidator upon a liquidation order, is persuasive, analogous authority for us in resolving this matter involving bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, we find that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Samide and Katigbak.
