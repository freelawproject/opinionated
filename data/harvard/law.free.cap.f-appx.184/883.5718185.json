He argues on appeal that the sentence imposed by the district court on remand was unreasonable in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">It light of <em>Booker, </em>we review a final sentence under the advisory Guidelines for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005). We do not review each individual decision made during the sentencing process, however. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). This reasonableness inquiry is guided by the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246; <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 766. We have rejected the proposition that sentences at the low-end of the advisory Guideline range are <em>per se </em>reasonable, though we have stated that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">Under <em>Booker, </em>\u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where under a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). Specifically, the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 749-52. However, it also stated that \u201c[i]f the Guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-15\">In a second and separate majority opinion in <em>Booker, </em>the Court concluded that, to best preserve Congress\u2019 intent in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the appropriate remedy was to \u201cexcise\u201d two specific sections \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence within the Guideline range, absent a departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal, including <em>de novo </em>review of departures from the applicable Guideline range) \u2014 thereby effectively rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-16\">Therefore, in light of <em>Booker, </em>the district court must first accurately calculate the Guideline range, and then it \u201cmay impose a more severe or more lenient sentence\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1179. The factors include the available sentences, the applicable Guideline range, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for. the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We have clarified that the district court is not obligated to specifically address and analyze on the record every \u00a7 3553(a) factor, rather, a statement that the court considered the factors is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">At Holmes\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court heard mitigating factors as to his family and personal situation. The court stated that it reached the 57-month sentence after calculating the Guideline range and applying it in an advisory manner. It specified it had considered the advisory nature of the Guidelines as well as the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), and determined that a sentence at the low-end of the range was most appropriate in light of those considerations. The sentence fell well below the statutory maximum term of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2); <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246. Accordingly, the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and conducted a proper reasonableness inquiry. <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246; <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 766; <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Holmes\u2019s claim that the district court should have ordered his federal sentence run, at least in part, concurrent with his state sentence is similarly without merit, given that the 57-month sentence on its own is not unreasonable. <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246; <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 766; <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Finally, Holmes does not claim that there was error in the district court\u2019s Guideline calculations, and none is apparent. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Based upon the foregoing, we affirm Holmes\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
