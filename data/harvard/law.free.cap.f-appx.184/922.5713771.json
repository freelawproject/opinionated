Strongwater, Strongwater &amp; Associates, Atlanta, GA, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b947-9\">Before EDMONDSON, Chief Judge, ANDERSON and BIRCH, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b947-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">Defendant-Appellant Charles Odukoya appeals his 60-month sentence, imposed after he pled guilty plea to defrauding Ameritrade, Inc., a provider of discount brokerage services, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 2. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm Defendant\u2019s sentence and dismiss the part of his appeal governed by a limited sentence appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">On appeal, Defendant challenges (1) his criminal history calculation, (2) the assessment of a two-level leadership enhancement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), (3) the application of a vulnerable victim enhancement, \u00a7 3A1.1, (4) the loss calculation, which was based in part on relevant conduct occurring three years after the count of conviction, and (5) the district court\u2019s failure to give full consideration to Defendant\u2019s downward departure motion, where the court erroneously assumed that the statutory maximum sentence of imprisonment was 30 years, as opposed to 5 years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the government that Defendant waived his right to appeal all these issues \u2014 except Defendant\u2019s challenge to the leadership enhancement \u2014 based on a valid limited sentence appeal waiver that was part of his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">We review the validity of a sentence appeal waiver <em>de novo. United States v. Weaver, </em>275 F.3d 1320, 1333 n. 21 (11th Cir.2001). We will enforce a sentence appeal waiver if the waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1350-51 (11th Cir.1993). For a sentence appeal waiver to be knowing and voluntary, the government must show (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>that the district court specifically questioned the defendant about the waiver during the plea colloquy, or (2) that the record is manifestly clear that the defendant otherwise understood the significance of the appeal waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Defendant\u2019s written plea agreement provided that he was giving up the right to appeal his sentence except (1) for an upward departure from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline, (2) for an adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2)-(8), or (3) for an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.1. At the plea hearing, the government read the appeal waiver before Defendant, and Defendant and his lawyer indicated their understanding of the plea agreement. The district court then asked if Defendant understood that he had the right to appeal his sentence, \u201cexcept in this case as a part of the plea agreement ... unless there is an upward departure by the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant stated that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Based on our review of the record, Defendant\u2019s limited sentence appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary. Except for his challenge to the \u00a7 3B1.1 leadership enhancement, none of the sentencing issues he raises are excepted from the appeal waiver. He, thus, has waived the right to appeal these issues; and we dismiss Defendant\u2019s appeal except for his challenge to the \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">About the leadership enhancement, Defendant argues that the government failed to prove the enhancement\u2019s applicability because it relied on the allegedly unreliable statements of Chukwudubem Aniweta. Aniweta was listed as having aided and abetted Defendant in one of the charges dismissed from the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s decision to impose an aggravating role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. <em>United States v. Poirier, </em>321 F.3d 1024, 1036 (11th Cir.2003). \u201c[T]he assertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">The district court did not clearly err in applying a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement. The presentence investigation report indicated that Defendant deposited fraudulent checks into Aniweta\u2019s bank account. After the fraud was discovered and after Aniweta was arrested by United States Postal Inspectors, Aniweta made a monitored phone call to Defendant. Aniweta told Defendant that his account had been frozen; and Defendant responded, \u201cI told you to remove the money from the account right away.\u201d Defendant then instructed Aniweta to give information about another bank account so that Defendant could deposit another check into that account. At sentencing, the government proffered that testimony by an agent would support these facts, which show that Defendant exercised control over Aniweta. Although Defendant challenges the reliability of Aniweta\u2019s statements, a district court may rely on the statements of a co-conspirator in determining that a sentencing enhancement is appropriate. <em>See United States v. Shazier, </em>179 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">We uphold the district court\u2019s imposition of the \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement. And, based on the valid limited sentence appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>waiver, we dismiss Defendant\u2019s other challenges to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-10\">. Defendant also argues that he did not enter his guilty plea knowingly because the district court failed to advise him of the correct applicable maximum statutory penalty, resulting in a violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. But Defendant raises this argument for the first time in his reply brief: we do not consider it. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1276 n. 3 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 643, 163 L.Ed.2d 520 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b948-7\">. We note that, in this statement, the district court did not list all the circumstances where Defendant retained the right to appeal his sentence under the appeal waiver. But Defendant indicated that he understood the sentence appeal waiver after the entire \u2014 and accurate \u2014 appeal waiver was read to him. And the way in which the district court judge framed his question did not overstate Defendant's appeal rights. The district court\u2019s apparent misstatement does not affect the applicability of Defendant\u2019s appeal waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
