Shah contends that he is entitled to asylum and asserts that the immigration judge erred in determining that there were no changed country conditions so as to excuse the untimeliness of his asylum application. We do not, however, have jurisdiction to review the immigration judge\u2019s discretionary determination that Shah\u2019s asylum application was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). The petition for review is thus DISMISSED as to the claims concerning asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">The IJ\u2019s conclusion that Shaw was ineligible for withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence. The evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion. Shah has not shown that he will be singled out for persecution if he returns or that there is a pattern or practice of discrimination against Muslims. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1), (2); <em>see Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 307 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">Shah does not argue in his brief that he was due relief under the CAT. As such, the claim is waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Shah\u2019s petition for review is DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
