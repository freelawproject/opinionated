Christian\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that he finds no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning the validity of Christian\u2019s plea agreement. Christian\u2019s counsel also questions whether Christian pled guilty to the charge that he thought he was pleading guilty to, and whether the sentence was reasonable. Christian filed a pro se supplemental brief, wherein he challenged the validity of his plea agreement, alleged errors in his arrest and indictment, and claimed that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel. The Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>did not file an answering brief. We have reviewed the record and, finding no reversible error, affirm Christian\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">A guilty plea is an admission of factual guilt, and it forecloses most challenges to the resulting conviction. A defendant may, however, challenge the knowing and voluntary nature of his plea, and may challenge .the jurisdictional basis for the conviction. <em>See, e.g., Menna v. New York, </em>423 U.S. 61, 63 n. 2, 96 S.Ct. 241, 46 L.Ed.2d 195 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Christian seeks to challenge the voluntariness of his guilty plea. At the time of his plea hearing, Christian was forty-three and had managed his own remodeling business. He indicated that he was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and affirmed that he had discussed the agreement with his counsel. The district court also specifically discussed the charges and factual basis for the charges, and Christian indicated that he understood. When Christian expressed some ambivalence about his guilty plea, the court offered him the opportunity to withdraw the plea, but Christian did not avail himself of this opportunity. We find Christian\u2019s guilty plea to have been made knowingly and voluntarily, and reject his argument that he thought he was pleading guilty to a different count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Christian\u2019s challenges to his arrest and indictment are precluded by his guilty plea, which acts as a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects in the indictment. <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>992 F.2d 489, 490 (4th Cir.1993) (holding guilty plea constitutes a waiver of nonjurisdictional defects).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Christian raises several challenges to his counsel\u2019s performance. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). Instead, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant generally must bring his ineffective assistance claims in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). An exception exists where the record conclusively shows ineffective assistance. <em>Id. </em>Here, the record on its face does not conclusively demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Christian\u2019s counsel has questioned whether the sentence of seventy-eight months\u2019 imprisonment was reasonable in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We have stated that a sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir. 2005) (internal citation omitted). A sentence imposed within a correctly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d at 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">A reasonable sentence is \u201cselected pursuant to a reasoned process in accordance with the law, in which the court [does] not give excessive weight to any relevant factor, and which [effects] a fair and just result in light of the relevant facts and law.\u201d <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457. Here, the district court discussed several factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), including the type of crime, the need for deterrence, the risk of recidivism and Christian\u2019s age and circumstances. The record does not indicate that the district court gave excessive weight to any one factor. Christian was also sentenced at the bottom end of a properly-calculated advisory guideline range. Accordingly, because the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>was within the advisory guideline range and was determined according to a reasoned process in accordance with the law, we find the sentence to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Christian\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
