Corrales argues that the district court erroneously denied his motions to suppress evidence and continue his trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Federal agents arrested Corrales on February 5, 2003, during the course of drug trafficking and robbery investigation. Detective Robert Christie and Detective Mitch Jacobs interviewed Corrales at a federal facility later that evening. The detectives established that Corrales understood English and was not under the influence of medication, alcohol, or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">The detectives then read Corrales warnings about his rights to remain silent and have counsel, under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602,16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), from a form written in English and provided him a Spanish text of the warnings. Corrales \u201cstated [that] he understood what [the detectives] were doing\u201d and \u201che understood his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and his rights,\u201d but he did not want to sign a waiver form. Jacobs told Corrales \u201cthat signing the form wasn\u2019t an admission of guilt,\u201d but Corrales refused to sign a form. Corrales then discussed with the detectives his participation in the alleged criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Corrales moved pretrial to suppress his statements to the detectives on the ground that he had not waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. A magistrate judge held a hearing, and Christie and Jacobs testified. Christie testified that Corrales told Christie that he, Corrales, \u201cdid not want to sign, but that he would talk.\u201d Jacobs testified that Corrales \u201cdid not want to sign the form\u201d but \u201cwanted to speak with us\u201d and \u201cwanted to give a verbal statement.\u201d Jacobs testified that he and Christie \u201cproceeded with the interview without the form being signed, as [Corrales] requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">The magistrate judge found that Christie\u2019s and Jacobs\u2019s testimonies were credible. The magistrate judge concluded that the detectives had advised Corrales of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, Corrales had \u201cunderstood these rights,\u201d and Corrales had \u201cknowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his rights and agreed to make a statement.\u201d The magistrate judge rejected Corrales\u2019s argument that the detectives had misrepresented the <em>Miranda </em>rights to him when they told him that signing the form would not be an admission of guilt. The district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denied Corrales\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">On a Friday afternoon at trial, after the government had rested its case, Corrales requested a continuance until Monday because, his lawyer explained, Corrales was not \u201cclear headed enough\u201d to testify at that time. Corrales explained that he was \u201cin no condition to do this today. Nobody understands my situation. I don\u2019t feel well. I am tired. I did not sleep.\u201d Corrales also explained that he was \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cvery upset\u201d and had not taken a medication that he had been taking for two years to help him sleep. Corrales refused to state whether or not he would testify on Monday. He stated instead, \u201cI possibly will or maybe I possibly won\u2019t. I am not sure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">The court denied Corrales\u2019s request for a continuance. The trial judge explained she might have considered a continuance if she \u201cthought that this defendant genuinely suffered from a physical or mental sit\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>tion and all he needed was time; that he had expressed to me a willingness to testify, that he was going to testify, and this was merely a physical issue preventing him today.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d the judge continued, \u201cI have a feeling, based on Mr. Corrales\u2019s behavior today and other days, that on Monday morning we will be faced with a similar situation and we would have allowed most of the day to go.\u201d The judge explained that \u201cI don\u2019t try to try a case merely on the basis of time. I try to give everyone a fair trial. I have done it in this case.\u201d The judge concluded that \u201cto allow a continuance in this case is an abuse of this Court\u2019s patience, as well as the time and energy of this jury.\u201d The trial proceeded, and the jury convicted Corrales on the three counts charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">\u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. This Court reviews the district court\u2019s finding of facts under the clearly erroneous standard. The district court\u2019s application of the law to those facts is subject to de novo review.\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>180 F.3d 1237, 1240 (11th Cir. 1999). We will not reverse the decision of a district court to deny a continuance unless the district court abused its discretion. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>854 F.2d 1280, 1283 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Corrales first argues that he did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights. A waiver is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent when (1) \u201cit was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception\u201d and (2) it was \u201cmade with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u201d <em>United States v. Barbour, </em>70 F.3d 580, 585 (11th Cir.1995). This argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">There are two problems with Corrales\u2019s argument. First, there is no evidence that Corrales was intimidated, coerced, or deceived during his interview with Christie and Jacobs. Jacobs provided truthful information when he told Corrales that signing the waiver form was not an admission of guilt. Second, there is ample evidence that Corrales was fully aware of his rights and of the consequences of waiving them. The detectives provided the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Corrales in English and Spanish and asked Corrales if he understood the warnings, and Corrales expressed that he understood the warnings and wanted to make a statement. The district court did not err by denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Corrales\u2019s other argument, that the district court abused its discretion by denying the continuance, also fails. The trial judge explained that she did not believe that Corrales \u201cgenuinely suffered from a physical or mental situation and all he needed was time.\u201d The trial judge was concerned that Corrales\u2019s intent was to abuse the judicial system. Based on our review of the record, we have no reason to question that judgment. The court did not abuse its discretion by denying the continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
