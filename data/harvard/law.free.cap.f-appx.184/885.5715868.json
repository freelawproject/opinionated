We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Portocabrero contends that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minor participant role reduction. He argues that he is entitled to that reduction for the following reasons: he was just a mariner and was not the captain of the vessel; he did not own the drugs; and he was not involved in planning the route or the distribution of the drugs. He also contends that the district court clearly erred when it considered the government\u2019s statements at sentencing that he trained and recruited crew members. He argues that those statements were unsubstantiated and did not satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The proponent of the reduction bears the burden of proving the minor role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. The determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense \u201cfalls within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. \u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court need not make \u201cany specific subsidiary factual findings\u201d in determining the defendant\u2019s role. <em>Id. </em>at 939. \u201cSo long as the district court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and the court clearly resolves any <em>disputed </em>factual issues, a simple statement of the district court\u2019s conclusion is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">The guidelines provide for a two-level reduction if the defendant was a minor participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is a minor participant if he is less culpable than most other participants, but his role was not minimal. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5. In determining whether a role reduction is warranted, a district court\u2019s decision \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which she has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, her role as compared to that of other participants in her relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. Under the first prong, the district court \u201cmust assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating her base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. Under the second prong, the court measures the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">The district court did not make any specific factfindings when it denied Portocabrero a minor participant role reduction, and as we have explained, it was not required to do so. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939. The record demonstrates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>court did not clearly err in its decision to deny Portocabrero that reduction. During his plea proceedings, Portocabrero admitted he knew that \u201cthis was going to be a drug trip.\u201d Plea Transcript at 15. The record also shows that Portocabrero had participated in other drug smuggling trips and was one of the more experienced crewmembers on board the vessel. The large amount of cocaine involved (1,170 kilograms) is also a factor that weighs against a finding that Portocabrero was entitled to a minor role reduction. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">At sentencing, the government asserted that Portocabrero participated in recruiting and training other crewmembers, and he objected to that statement, arguing that there was no evidence to support it. The district court, however, did not indicate that it relied on the government\u2019s statements about training and recruiting in denying Portocabrero a minor role reduction. Because undisputed facts in the record support the decision to deny that reduction, the court\u2019s simple statement of its conclusion is sufficient. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939. The district court did not clearly err in finding that Portocabrero failed to meet his burden of proving that he was less culpable than most other participants. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Portocabrero contends that the district court should have awarded him a one-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) for providing timely notice of his intention to plead guilty. He explains that any delay in making his plea occurred because he was not in good mental condition while in custody as a result of drinking too much coffee and not having any communication with his family. He argues that despite the delay, his plea still saved government resources because the government did not have to pay to bring witnesses from California for a trial. We review the findings by the district court regarding a reduction for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Calhoon, </em>97 F.3d 518, 531 (11th Cir.1996). A defendant bears the burden of establishing that he is entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">The guidelines provide for two separate reductions for acceptance of responsibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-9\">(a) If the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense, decrease the offense level by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-10\">(b) If the defendant qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a), the offense level determined prior to the operation of subsection (a) is level 16 or greater, <em>and upon motion of the government </em>stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently, decrease the offense level by 1 additional level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 (emphasis added). \u201cBecause the Government is in the best position to determine whether the defendant has assisted authorities in a manner that avoids preparing for trial, an adjustment under subsection (b) <em>may only he granted </em>upon a formal motion by the Government at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 6 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">In the present case, the government explained at sentencing that it did not file a motion for a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) because Portocabrero was the last of the codefendants to plead guilty. Portocabrero did so only after a trial date had been set and after he had moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>continue the trial for a competency evaluation on the eve of trial. The government explained that his guilty plea did not save expenses because it still had to prepare for trial. Regardless of Portocabrero\u2019s explanation about why he waited to plead guilty, the guidelines clearly state that a district court cannot grant a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) unless the government files a motion requesting it. Because the government did not file a motion here, the district court did not clearly err in refusing to grant the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Portocabrero contends that his sentence is unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court did not consider his impoverished and abusive childhood and disregarded the fact that he now works to provide for his siblings, his mother, and his children. He argues that he was less culpable than his codefendants who all received lesser sentences than he did. He also argues that his sentence does not provide just punishment for the offense and notes that he was not given adequate medical attention while in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">We review a sentence for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. at 767; <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Among the factors that a district court should consider at sentencing are the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, the pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). A district court is not required to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Although we have refused to hold that a sentence within the guidelines range is per se reasonable, we have concluded that \u201cthe use of the Guidelines remains central to the sentencing process.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 787 (11th Cir.2005). We have also stated that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. As we have explained, however, that expectation \u201cstill has to be measured against the record, and the party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both that record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">Portocabrero\u2019s 151-month sentence is reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. His sentence was at the bottom of the guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court stated that it considered the PSI, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the statements made by Portocabrero at sentencing. The 151-month sentence shows that the court considered the significant amount of drugs involved and the need to impose a punishment that would provide adequate deterrence. The court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines, however, shows that it also considered Portocabrero\u2019s expression of remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">Portocabrero argues that the court should avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities and asserts that more culpable codefendants received lesser sentences, but the differences in the sentences may reflect the fact that Portocabrero did not receive the one-level reduction for timely notification of a guilty plea. Therefore, any sentencing disparities cannot be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>sidered unwarranted. Furthermore, in designing the guidelines \u201cthe Sentencing Commission fully anticipated sentencing disparity between defendants involved in the same offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Chotas, </em>968 F.2d 1198, 1197 (11th Cir.1992); <em>see also United States v. Hendrieth, </em>922 F.2d 748, 752 (11th Cir.1991) (stating that \u201cthis court has rejected as \u2018frivolous\u2019 challenges to sentencing because a co-defendant received a less severe penalty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Finally, Portocabrero\u2019s assertions about his lack of medical treatment in jail when his blood pressure dropped do not have any bearing on the justness or the reasonableness of his sentence. After considering the briefs and the record in light of our deferential standard of review, <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788, we conclude that Portocabrero\u2019s 151-month sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
