In 1999, Gomez sought to reopen the 1984 and 1985 applications. The Commissioner denied Gomez\u2019s request. Gomez filed an action in district court seeking judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s adverse decision. The district court dismissed her case for lack of jurisdiction. Gomez appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-17\">Absent a colorable constitutional claim, we lack jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 205 over the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to reopen a prior decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gomez argues that her mental impairment prevented her from understanding and pursuing her right to appeal the denial of her 1984 and 1985 applications. Her evidence of a mental impairment falls short. First, Gomez submitted an \u201cearnings statement\u201d indicating that she did not work between 1984 and 1990. While it could be that Gomez did not work because of her mental impairment, the earnings statement alone does not prove this proposition. Second, Gomez submitted a 1998 letter from her current doctor who stated that a different doctor diagnosed Gomez with borderline personality disorder and dissociative disorder in 1994. That Gomez was mentally impaired in 1994 hardly suggests that she was mentally impaired in 1984 or 1985. Third, Gomez submitted a 1999 letter from her current doctor stating that when Gomez first visited a hospital in 1984, she had been unable to work for a year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Again, this evidence is insufficient to establish that Gomez was mentally impaired, as there are many reasons why she was not working prior to 1984. Finally, the 1999 letter referred to an April 1984 psychological examination, which found that Gomez\u2019s \u201chighest level of adaptive functioning [was] level 5,\u201d which results in \u201ca moderate amount of impairment in both social relations and occupational functioning.\u201d This too is insufficient to establish a constitutional claim, as there is no explanation of what \u201clevel 5\u201d means or whether that condition would prevent Gomez from understanding that she needed to timely appeal the denial of her benefits applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
