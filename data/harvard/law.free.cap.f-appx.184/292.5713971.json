Spain appeals his conviction of three counts of possessing contraband in prison, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(b) (2000), and the resulting sixty-month sentence on each count, to run concurrent with each other and consecutive to any previous sentence. Spain\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising two claims: (1) the district court erred at sentencing in considering several prior arrests that did not result in convictions; and (2) defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance at trial. Spain, informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005), and impose a sentence. The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). If the district court concludes that a sentence within the sentencing range does not adequately reflect the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it may impose a sentence outside the sentencing range, upon explaining why a sentence outside the range better serves statutory goals. <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 632 (4th Cir.2006). \u201c[I]n reviewing a variance sentence, this court must consider \u2014 in light of the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a) and any relevant guideline provisions \u2014 whether the district court acted reasonably with respect to (1) the imposition of a variance sentence, and (2) the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433-34 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). \u201cGenerally, if the reasons justifying [a] variance are tied to \u00a7 3553(a) and are plausible, the sentence will be deemed reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">Here, the district court properly calculated the guideline range. The court then concluded that a sentence within that range would not sufficiently reflect the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In imposing the variance, the court reviewed \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The court also observed that the variance was intended to \u201creflect the seriousness of the offense\u201d and \u201cpromote respect for the law,\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), to deter other inmates from similar behavior, \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), and to protect staff and inmates from illegal weapons within the prison, \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). We conclude that the district court acted reasonably in imposing this variance sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-14\">As to the specific issues raised by Spain, first, there is no suggestion in the record that the district court relied on the charges, noted in the presentence report, that did not result in convictions. Therefore, we conclude that this claim lacks merit. Spain also alleges that trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance. \u201cIneffective assistance claims are not cognizable on direct appeal unless counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003). Instead, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant generally must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>bring his ineffective assistance claims in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Because the record does not conclusively show that counsel was ineffective, we will not review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
