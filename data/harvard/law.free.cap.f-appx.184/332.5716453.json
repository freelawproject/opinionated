We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">The INA authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2000). It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to her native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). An applicant can establish refugee status based on past persecution in her native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2005). \u201cAn applicant who demonstrates that [s]he was the subject of past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004) (alteration added). To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show a clear probability that, if she was removed to her native country, her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d on a protected ground. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (2000); <em>see Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 370 (4th Cir.2004). An applicant has the burden of demonstrating her eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2005); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). Credibility findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer specific, cogent reasons for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). This court accords broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). This court will reverse the Board \u201conly if the evidence presented by the petitioner was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">We find substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s findings that Zetchem was not credible and she failed to provide reliable corroborative evidence supporting her claim. Accordingly, the evidence does not compel a different result with respect to her applications for asylum and withholding from removal. We further find the immigration judge did not err in denying the application for withholding under the Convention Against Torture. Zetchem failed to submit reliable independent evidence showing it was more likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>than not she will be tortured if she returns to Cameroon.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We also deny Zetchem\u2019s second motion for a stay of deportation. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
