First, Stewart argues that the district court erred by applying a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) when his possession of the firearm was not in connection with another felony offense. Second, Stewart argues that the district court violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by enhancing his offense level based on facts not alleged in the indictment nor admitted by him. Stewart also argues that the district court violated due process and <em>ex post facto </em>principles by sentencing him based on the retroactive application of the remedial opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Third, Stewart argues that the district court plainly erred by failing to conclude <em>sua sponte </em>that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to Stewart.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">We \u201creview[ ] the district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review, but review[ ] its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Federal law makes it unlawful for a convicted felon to possess a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Section 2K2.1 of the Guidelines provides for a four-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant ... possessed any firearm ... in connection with another felony offense.\u201d \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). This section of the Guidelines does not define the phrase \u201cin connection with.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K1.1, comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">A district court\u2019s determination that a firearm was possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony offense is a factual one. <em>See United States v. Whitfield, </em>50 F.3d 947, 949 &amp; n. 8 (11th Cir.1995) (addressing the \u201cin connection with\u201d phrase in \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)). Some circuits require at least an inference that the firearm facilitated the defendant\u2019s felonious conduct, while other circuits have held that mere possession is enough. <em>Id. </em>at 948-49 (citations omitted). We have refused to adopt a more restrictive approach of interpreting \u201cin connection with\u201d used in other courts. <em>United States v. Young, </em>115 F.3d 834, 837-38 (11th Cir.1997) (addressing the phrase in \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A)). Subsequently, we could not discern a principled reason why we should not follow the reasoning in the <em>Young </em>decision. <em>United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir. 1999) (addressing the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d found in \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(3)). When the Guidelines do not provide a definition, we have held that district courts should give phrases within the Guidelines their ordinary meaning, unless there is a clearly contrary intent. <em>Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695. We have considered the definition of \u201cin connection with\u201d in other sections of the Guidelines and have determined that the phrase \u201cmerely reflects the context of the defendant\u2019s possession of the firearm\u201d and the firearm \u201cdoes not have to facilitate the underlying offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d reflects the context of Stewart\u2019s possession of the firearm, and the district court did not clearly err in its factual determination that Stewart possessed the firearm in connection with either of the two felony offenses that he committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Stewart\u2019s two additional issues are foreclosed by prior precedent. Stewart\u2019s argument that the imposed sentence was unconstitutional because it was based in part on facts neither charged in the indictment nor admitted by him, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, Due Process, and <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause, has been rejected in <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005). We have also held that \u201cthe use of extra-verdict enhancements in an advisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>guidelines system is not unconstitutional.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). Stewart\u2019s constitutional challenge, facial and as applied, that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) exceeds Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power, has also been rejected. <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996). For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Stewart\u2019s conviction and 92-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
