Robrish, appointed counsel for Andre Pierre-Rene in this direct criminal appeal, has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Pierre-Rene\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. We also DENY Pierre-Rene\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel as moot in light of our grant of counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
