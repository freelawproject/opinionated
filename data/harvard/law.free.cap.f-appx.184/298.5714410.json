Law challenges the reasonableness of his sentence, contending that it was longer than necessary because the sentencing court gave undue weight to his criminal history. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Law\u2019s sentence was within the properly calculated advisory guideline range and was well within the statutory maximum set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). In sentencing Law, the district court considered Law\u2019s \u201csignificant\u201d criminal history for a person of his age, in addition to other factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2005). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, properly calculated and considered the guideline range, and weighed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we cannot conclude that Law\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006) (finding sentence imposed within properly calculated advisory guidelines range was presumptively reasonable); <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 346 (4th Cir.2006) (finding district court\u2019s \u201cdetailed inquiry into the various circumstances bearing upon [defendant\u2019s] sentence\u201d satisfied obligation to consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Law\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
