Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>i.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">This appeal is the second arising from the Government\u2019s case against Katz. At the first sentencing, which predated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court determined that Katz\u2019s offense level was 28 and that his criminal history category was III, yielding a sentencing guideline range of 97-121 months. The district court imposed a sentence of 97 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">On appeal, we affirmed Katz\u2019s convictions but concluded that Katz\u2019s sentence had been imposed in violation of <em>Booker. See United States v. Lugo, </em>131 Fed.Appx. 901, 908 (4th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Prior to vacating the sentence, however, we addressed several issues regarding the guideline range calculation in light of \u201cthe complexity of this case and in an effort to assist the district court by narrowing the issues that must be resolved upon resentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 908 n. 7. We determined that the district court had not erred in its guidelines application and then vacated the sentence on <em>Booker </em>grounds and remanded for resentencing. <em>See id. </em>at 908-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">At the resentencing hearing, because Katz presented no new arguments regarding the appropriate guideline range, the district court adopted the range that it had previously calculated. The court then considered whether a sentence in that range served the factors listed in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). Focusing on the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of Katz\u2019s offense as well as the vulnerability of many of the victims that he targeted, the district court also noted Katz\u2019s long \u201chistory of willfully-fraudulent activity, willful disobedience to lawful orders, willful connivance, scheming, [and] theft.\u201d J.A. 285. The court further explicitly considered Katz\u2019s medical condition and advanced age as well as the fact that codefendant Mark Cohn received a 57-month sentence. Finally, the court noted that Katz had achieved some degree of rehabilitation during his time in prison. In light of all of these factors, the court imposed a sentence of 72 months imprisonment \u2014 25 months below the low end of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Katz contends that the district court violated our mandate and the Sixth Amendment by utilizing the facts found during the first sentencing to determine Katz\u2019s guideline range on remand. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Katz points us to nothing in our first opinion that required the district court to revisit guidelines-related issues that it had already decided. Nor did the Sixth Amendment require that the issues be revisited. Because the guidelines had the force of law at the time of the first sentencing, <em>see Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 233-34, 125 S.Ct. 738 the factual findings supporting offense level enhancements served to increase the maximum sentence that the district court was legally authorized to impose. And, since the district court, rather than the jury, made those findings increasing the maximum punishment, Katz\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated at the first sentencing. <em>See id. </em>at 235, 125 S.Ct. 738. In contrast, by the second sentencing, <em>Booker </em>had already established that the sentencing guidelines no longer had the force of law, <em>see id. </em>at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005), and therefore could not establish the maximum sentence to which a defendant was subject. Thus, the same enhancements that were uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>stitutional at the first sentencing did not increase the maximum sentence to which Katz was subject (and therefore were not unconstitutional) the second time around.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> For all of these reasons, the district court did not err by siiriply adopting the guidelines range it had previously calculated. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 560 &amp; n. 19 (vacating sentence when district court correctly calculated guideline range but committed Sixth Amendment error by utilizing judicial factfinding to enhance sentence under mandatory regime, but instructing district court on remand, absent any changed circumstances, to utilize previously calculated guideline range to sentence defendant under advisory guidelines regime).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In sum, we affirm Katz\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before us and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\"> Katz also argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable because the district court \"failed to articulate the disparity of sentences between co-defendants\u2014 particularly between Mark Cohn and Mr. Katz\u201d and \"failed to consider Mr. Katz's significant health problems, infirmity and age.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 19. We disagree. As we indicated in our factual summary, the district court explicitly considered each of these factors during the sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
