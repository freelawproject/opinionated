Cook appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>remand and dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim. We have reviewed the record and the arguments of the parties, and we affirm the denial of the motion to remand and the dismissal of Cook\u2019s retaliatory discharge claim for the reasons stated by the district court from the bench. <em>(See </em>Hearing Transcript at 14-17).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Regarding Cook\u2019s common law tort claims, the district court did not specify a reason for dismissing these claims. However, while the liberal pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a) demand only a \u201cshort and plain\u201d statement of the claim, a plaintiff must often offer more detail than the bald statement that he has a valid claim of some type against the defendant. <em>Trulock v. Freeh, </em>275 F.3d 391, 405 (4th Cir.2001). \u201cThe presence [ ] of a few conclusory legal terms does not insulate a complaint from dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) when the facts alleged in the complaint\u201d do not support the legal conclusion. <em>Young v. City of Mount Ranier, </em>238 F.3d 567, 577 (4th Cir.2001) (dismissing Fourteenth Amendment claims where complaint alleged deliberate indifference but included no facts to support allegation).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In Cook\u2019s complaint, he asserted that his employer committed \u201cgrievous\u201d torts by \u201ccommitting perjury, slander, accusing the plaintiff of filing a false workers compensation claim, malingering, ploys, and has allowed Personnel Manager Thomas Carlyle to carry out a personal vendetta.\u201d Cook offered no facts, dates, or details to support his claims either in his complaint, in response to the motion to dismiss, or on appeal. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in dismissing these causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
