Because the petition for review is timely only as to the March 31, 2005, order, we have jurisdiction over that order only. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 111 (5th Cir.1993); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-22\">Khan has not demonstrated any abuse of discretion on the BIA\u2019s part in connection with the denial of his motion to reconsider. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>(5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 399, 402, 1991 WL 353528 (BIA1991). His argument that the motion automatically tolled his voluntary-departure period is without merit, as is his contention that the instant petition for review tolled his voluntary-departure date. <em>See Bandar-Ortiz v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 387, 389-91 (5th Cir.2006). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
