That waiver provision stated that Rodriguez was \u201cwaiving] the right to appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined,\u201d except for an upward departure or a sentence imposed above the statutory maximum. At Rodriguez\u2019s rearraignment proceeding, the magistrate judge called attention to the waiver-of-appeal provision in Rodriguez\u2019s plea agreement but advised him that he retained his right to appeal an \u201cillegal sentence.\u201d It is arguable that this advice was an inaccurate characterization of the appeal waiver and thus did not comply with Fed. R. Crim.P. ll(b)(l)(N)\u2019s requirement that the court advise the defendant of \u201cthe terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the appeal waiver was not knowing and voluntary, <em>see United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517-18 (5th Cir.1999), and that it therefore does not bar this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Rodriguez argues that his sentence must be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing because the district court committed reversible error by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Rodriguez\u2019s objection in district court, pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), was sufficient to preserve this issue for harmless-error review. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see United States v. Molina, </em>174 Fed. Appx. 812, 815 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished). The district court\u2019s sentence pursuant to a mandatory Guidelines scheme constitutes \u201cFanfan\u201d error. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 463-64. Because the sentencing transcript is silent regarding whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory, the Government has failed to meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory only. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>440 F.3d 255, 257 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">In \u201cthe interest of judicial efficiency and to provide guidance on remand,\u201d <em>see United States v. Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2006), we address other sentencing issues raised by Rodriguez. Rodriguez contends that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level Sentencing Guidelines increase for having committed a prior \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d based on his 1992 Texas conviction of burglary of a habitation. He maintains that the elements of the 1992 offense do not include the use or attempted or threatened use of physical force against another, as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Because Rodriguez did not raise this particular argument in the district court, we review it for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Olmo, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 643 (5th Cir.2003). We have held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Texas offense of burglary of a dwelling is equivalent to the enumerated offense of \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d in \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iii). <em>See United States v. Garciar-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006). No error, plain or otherwise, is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Rodriguez also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. This constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rodriguez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rodriguez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">We AFFIRM Rodriguez\u2019s conviction, VACATE his sentence, and REMAND the case for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
