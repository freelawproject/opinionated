The Government thereafter filed a notice of intent to rely on the penalty enhancement contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), citing three second degree felonies: robbery convictions dated July 13, 2001, and April 2, 2002, and a drug conviction dated July 13, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-16\">A jury found Taylor guilty as charged, and the court, after finding (on the basis of evidence adduced at the sentencing hearing) that Taylor had murdered Hermanth Rao on February 1, 2003 using the Count 1 pistol, sentenced Taylor to life imprisonment on Count l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After we vacated the life sentence and remanded the case for resentencing in conformance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court held a new sentencing hearing. Without objection, the court adopted the record of the previous sentencing hearing \u2014 including its finding that Taylor had murdered Rao on February 1, 2003 \u2014 and gave Taylor an opportunity to present additional evidence. Then, after the evidentiary record closed, the court afforded him his right of allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-17\">The court sentenced Taylor to prison for life. It did so after consulting the Guidelines, treating them as advisory, and considering the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), all as required by <em>Booker. </em>Taylor now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-18\">The presentence report (\u201cPSI\u201d), prepared pursuant to the 2003 Guidelines Manual, applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>guideline applicable to \u00a7 922(g) offenses. That guideline provides that if the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense, and if death resulted, the court must apply \u201cthe most analogous offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A, Sub-part 1 (Homicide), if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(B) (Cross Reference). The guideline for homicide fixes the base offense level for first degree murder at 43. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Al.l(a). Taylor was an armed career criminal, but because the offense level prescribed by \u00a7 2Al.l(a), 43, was greater than the level prescribed for armed career criminals, the offense level remained at 43. Taylor used the Count 1 firearm in connection with a crime of violence \u2014 he murdered Hermanth Rao on February 1, 2003 \u2014 so his criminal history increased to category VI, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.4(c)(2). Total offense level 43, coupled with category VI, yielded an imprisonment range of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">In his brief, Taylor contends that the Due Process Clause precluded the court from considering his murder of Rao under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Al.l(a) because the indictment did not charge him with murder. The law-of-the-case doctrine forecloses this contention. In vacating Taylor\u2019s previous sentence, we instructed the court to comply with Booker\u2019s dictates. <em>Booker </em>instructs that the sentencing court consult the Guidelines, and, as Taylor must concede, the district court did just that. As a fallback argument, Taylor says that due process precluded the court from making its murder finding by a preponderance of the evidence. Our cases foreclose this argument. <em>See e.g., United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1304-05 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005). Taylor next challenges the court\u2019s use of hearsay in finding that Taylor murdered Rao, citing <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). <em>Crawford </em>does not apply to hearsay evidence offered at sentencing hearings. <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1146 (11th Cir. 2005) (admission of hearsay and documentary evidence at defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing to prove his prior convictions did not violate the Sixth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Taylor\u2019s final argument is one that he did not present to the district court; hence, we review it for plain error. The argument is that the court improperly increased Taylor\u2019s criminal history category on the basis of the Rao murder. We find no error, much less plain error, in the court\u2019s use of that evidence in assessing the defendant\u2019s potential for recidivism, i.e., the service performed by the criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Taylor\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-14\">. The court properly treated the Count 2 conviction as having merged into the Count 1 conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
