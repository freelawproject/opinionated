Hammonds, </em>139 Fed. Appx. 486 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished). For the reasons stated below, we affirm Hammonds\u2019 300-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-18\">Hammonds pled guilty to armed robbery interfering with interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a), 2 (2000); armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d) (2000); and attempted armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (2000). Hammonds received two sentences of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment and one sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, all to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-19\">Hammonds appealed, alleging claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, and challenging his four sentencing enhancements under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We affirmed Hammonds\u2019 convictions, but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing because Hammonds\u2019 six-level sentencing enhancement for use of a firearm violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On remand, the district court limited its reconsideration to the firearm enhancement. The district court, noting that the sentencing guidelines were advisory, overruled Hammonds\u2019 objection to the six-level enhancement for use of a firearm and imposed the identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>300-month sentence, which it concluded was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Hammonds appealed, and his attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether: (1) the mandate rule precludes consideration of any issues other than Hammonds\u2019 sentencing enhancement for use of a firearm; and (2) Hammonds\u2019 sentence was reasonable under <em>Booker. </em>Hammonds was informed of the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief, but declined to do so. The Government did not file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The mandate rule \u201cforecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court,\u201d as well as \u201cissues decided by the district court but foregone on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1993). We find the district court properly limited its decision on remand to resentencing on the firearm enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2005), and impose a sentence. If the court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, it must state its reasons for doing so. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 258-61, 125 S.Ct. 738). The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47. A sentence imposed within a correctly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006). At Hammonds\u2019 resentencing, the district court calculated the advisory guidelines range, made a finding of fact regarding the firearm enhancement, that was amply supported by the record, noted it had considered the statutory sentencing factors, and concluded the imposed sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">We affirm Hammonds\u2019 sentence, as the reasoning and decision making by the district court on remand fall well within the boundaries of reasonableness. As constrained by the mandate rule, we have, as required by <em>Anders, </em>reviewed the record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
