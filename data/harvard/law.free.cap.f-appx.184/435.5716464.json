Villeda contends that his sentence should be vacated and remanded because the district court sentenced him under the mandatory guidelines scheme held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">As the district court sentenced Villeda under a mandatory guidelines regime, it committed <em>Fanfan </em>error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). When a defendant has preserved a <em>Fanfan </em>challenge in the district court, this court reviews for harmless error. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 732-33. Villeda\u2019s <em>Fanfan </em>challenge was preserved by his objection in the district court under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <em>See United States v. Reyes-Celestino, </em>443 F.3d 451, 453 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">We conclude that the Government has not met its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error. <em>See id.; United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170-71 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1444, 164 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006). We therefore vacate Villeda\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">Villeda also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Villeda\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Villeda contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Villeda properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Therefore, Villeda\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-18\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ard0\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
