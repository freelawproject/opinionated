Joseph Salazar, II, Texas prisoner #412334, and Johnny Maldonado, Texas prisoner # 483291, appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action challenging their indefinite detention in administrative segregation. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims were dismissed as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). This court reviews such a dismissal de novo. <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Salazar and Maldonado contend that under Supreme Court and circuit precedent, they sufficiently alleged nonfrivolous claims that they have been held in administrative segregation for over 15 years and that the scheduled review procedures were a \u201csham\u201d in which the State Classification Committee lacked the authority to remove them from administrative segregation. A Supreme Court case decided after the district court issued its opinion may affect the analysis of a prisoner\u2019s due process claims relating to indefinite detention based on initial classification. <em>See Wilkinson v. Austin, </em>545 U.S. 209, 125 S.Ct. 2384, 2393-95,162 L.Ed.2d 174 (2005). However, it is not clear on the record before us whether Salazar and Maldonado were placed in administrative segregation based on an initial classification of gang membership or whether it resulted from prison disciplinary proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Wilkerson v. Stalder, </em>329 F.3d 431, 433 (5th Cir.2003). As the plaintiffs note, they were not given an opportunity to amend their complaint before the district court dismissed the case. In light of the Supreme Court precedent that the district court could not have considered before issuing its opinion, the judgment of the district court is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
