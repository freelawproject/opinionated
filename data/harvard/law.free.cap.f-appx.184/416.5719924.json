Moya argues that she suffered past persecution and fears future persecution on account of her political opinion and that the BIA erred in finding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-18\">We will uphold the BIA\u2019s factual finding that an alien is not eligible for asylum if supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under this substantial evidence standard, we cannot reverse the BIA\u2019s factual determinations unless we decide \u201cnot only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence compels it.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-19\">Moya\u2019s credited testimony relating to threats she received does not compel us to conclude either that she suffered past persecution or that she has established a well-founded fear of future persecution upon repatriation based on political opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The threats stem from Moya\u2019s statements advising displaced youth at her place of work, a social program to provide food and other assistance to displaced individuals, to resist recruitment into FARC, a guerilla movement, because they were too young to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>be involved in \u201cweapons and drugs.\u201d The IJ found that the FARC\u2019s interest in Petitioner did not stem from any immutable characteristic, such as membership in a specific group.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Though the \u201cLiberal Party sponsored her place of employment, no record evidence demonstrates that Moya was a member of the party or that her statements were motivated by the group\u2019s political views. Relying on <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>we have held that persecution because of refusal to fight with a particular group is not persecution on account of political opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cEven a person who supports a guerilla movement might resist recruitment for a variety of reasons\u201d besides political opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The IJ further found that her intention, if returned to Colombia, to continue to counsel displaced persons from joining FARC belied the reasonableness of her purported fear.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Because the BIA\u2019s decision rests on substantial evidence, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-11\"> Pursuant to the 5th Cir.
