Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Laterza v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 1106, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>125 S.Ct. 1006, 160 L.Ed.2d 1024 (Mem.) (2005). In our previous decision, <em>United States v. Laterza, </em>No. 03-12499, 99 Fed. Appx. 886 (11th Cir. March 17, 2004) (unpublished opinion), which the Supreme Court has vacated, we affirmed the 60 months prison sentence appellant received for manufacturing more than 100 marijuana plants, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Appellant now contends that <em>Booker </em>requires that we vacate his sentence and remand the case for resentencing because the district court sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory guidelines sentencing scheme based on facts neither admitted by him nor found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">We reject appellant\u2019s contention. First, appellant did not raise it in his initial brief on appeal, and his failure is fatal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989 (11th Cir.2001). Second, and alternatively, the district court did not commit a <em>Booker </em>error at all. The court sentenced appellant to the mandatory minimum sentence required by law \u2014 60 months imprisonment \u2014 because the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant\u2019s offense involved more than 100 marijuana plants. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">We have considered this appeal in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>and find no basis for disturbing our previous decision. That decision is therefore reinstated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\">. Appellant did not qualify for the \u201csafety-valve\u201d provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>United States v. Laterza, </em>at 6-7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-25\">. All outstanding motions are denied as MOOT in light of the court's ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
