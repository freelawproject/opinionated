The Government\u2019s \u201cmotion for reconsideration of the motion to supplement the record with documents in possession of the federal probation officer concerning Morales\u2019s prior North Carolina state conviction for attempted trafficking in marijuana\u201d is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-24\">Morales\u2019s sentence was increased by 12 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) on the basis of his prior North Carolina conviction for attempting to transport marijuana. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 90-95, 90-98 (2001). Morales argues that this was a misapplication of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-25\">A \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) is \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)) (2003). North Carolina\u2019s labeling of the offense of transporting more than 10 pounds of marijuana as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u201ctrafficking\u201d is not controlling. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 592, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). The North Carolina offense does not fall within U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a drug trafficking offense. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Therefore, the 12-level enhancement was inapplicable. Morales\u2019s sentence is vacated and this ease is remanded to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"AkV\">Morales argues that the district court misapplied the Guidelines when it imposed a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice. The enhancement was based on Morales\u2019s failure to be truthful about his identity with law enforcement officers and with the probation officer. The sentencing transcript indicates that the district court may have imposed this enhancement on the basis of Morales\u2019s untruthfulness about his identity in a previous illegal reentry case. If that was the case, the enhancement was unwarranted because it applies only to obstruction of justice in the instant case. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Because this case is being remanded for resentencing based on the district court\u2019s misapplication of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), the district court will have the opportunity to reexamine the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement to determine its applicability to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Morales challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). However, Morales\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Morales contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 276. Morales properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD WITH DOCUMENTS IN POSSESSION OF THE FEDERAL PROBATION OFFICER CONCERNING MORALES\u2019 PRIOR NORTH CAROLINA STATE CONVICTION FOR ATTEMPTED TRAFFICKING IN MARIJUANA GRANTED; CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
