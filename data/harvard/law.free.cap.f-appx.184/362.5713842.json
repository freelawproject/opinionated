Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, Defendant-Appellant Santos Herrera-Nunez has submitted a supplemental letter brief addressing the impact of <em>Booker. </em>The government has submitted a motion to reinstate our prior affirmance of Herrera-Nunez\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b386-25\">Herrera-Nunez pleaded guilty to reentering the United States unlawfully following removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. The district court determined that the applicable term of imprisonment under the then-mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) was 46 to 57 months, and ultimately sentenced him to a term of 48 months imprisonment. Herrera-Nunez appealed his conviction and sentence, and we affirmed in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Herrera-Nunez then obtained Supreme Court review on the issues he raised on appeal and on the constitutionality of his sentence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>Booker. </em>As noted above, the Supreme Court remanded to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ADA\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Herrera-Nunez raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in his petition for certiorari. Therefore, we will not review his <em>Booker </em>claim absent \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The extraordinary circumstances standard is more demanding than the plain error review that we employ when a defendant has raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, if a defendant cannot satisfy plain error review, he certainly cannot satisfy extraordinary circumstances review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the circumstances meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since <em>Booker, </em>sentencing under mandatory Guidelines constitutes error, and that error is plain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry in which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He carries his burden only if he can \u201cdemonstrate a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant demonstrates such a probability when he identifies from the record an indication that the sentencing judge would have reached a significantly different result under an advisory Guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">In his supplemental letter brief, Herrera-Nunez concedes that he cannot carry his burden under the third prong of the plain error test. Specifically, Herrera-Nunez is unable to point to any indication in the record that there is a probability that the sentencing judge would have sentenced him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme. Instead, he advances his arguments regarding his sentence only to preserve them for possible Supreme Court review. As Herrera-Nunez candidly admits, his sentence does not conflict with <em>Booker </em>under the settled law of this Circuit. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence as imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-18\">As there exist no extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, Herrera-Nunez\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED. The government\u2019s motion to reinstate our prior affirmance is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
