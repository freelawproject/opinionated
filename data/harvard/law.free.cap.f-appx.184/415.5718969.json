Manuel challenges the adverse credibility determination made by the IJ. He contends that he has been the victim of persecution and that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution and torture on account of his religion and imputed political opinion. He maintains that he is eligible for asylum or, in the alternative, withholding of removal and relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u201cCredibility determinations are given great deference.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). This court \u201ccannot substitute [its] judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to the credibility of the witnesses or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Rather, \u201ca credibility determination may not be overturned unless the record compels it.\u201d <em>Lopez De Jesus v. INS, </em>312 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2002) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The adverse credibility determination made by the IJ and the BIA is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79. The record thus does not compel a credibility determination contrary to that of the IJ and the BIA: <em>See Lopez De Jesus, </em>312 F.3d at 161. We also conclude that Manuel\u2019s arguments that the BIA erred in summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s decision are without merit. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (describing summary affirmance procedure); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003) (BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedure does not violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">Accordingly, Manuel\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
