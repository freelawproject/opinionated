In reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). \u201cWe have defined \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 as \u2018evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Alerre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 693 (4th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)). We \u201cmust consider circumstantial as well as direct evidence, and allow the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir. 1982). This court \u201cmay not weigh the evidence or review the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>118 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.1997). With these standards in mind, we have reviewed the record and conclude that the evidence at trial was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
