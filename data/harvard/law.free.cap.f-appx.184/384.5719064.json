Brown, Texas prisoner #519699, has filed an application for a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his styled 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action asserting unconstitutionality of procedures applied by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (the board) to deny him parole in 2001, relative to his conviction of aggravated sexual assault. The district court construed Brown\u2019s action as a habeas corpus petition and held that relief was barred by the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The district court was correct in holding that Brown\u2019s claim that the board used erroneous or inaccurate information to deny him parole after a single defective hearing is a habeas corpus claim that is time-barred, rather than a \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Serio v. Members, La. State Bd. of Pardons, </em>821 F.2d 1112, 1117-18 (5th Cir. 1987). Therefore Brown\u2019s application for a COA relative to this claim is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Brown also contends that he is entitled to relief because the board retroactively applied 1995 procedures in denying him parole. He argues that this violated his civil rights under the Ex Post Facto, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses. Brown is not entitled to relief under the Due Process Clause because Texas has not created a liberty interest in parole that is protected by this clause. <em>See Orellana v. Kyle, </em>65 F.3d 29, 32 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Furthermore, Brown failed to state a cognizable equal-protection claim because he did not show that sex offenders are a suspect class or that they have been denied a fundamental right. <em>See Rublee v. Fleming, </em>160 F.3d 213, 217 (5th Cir.1998). Also, subjecting such offenders to different parole procedures is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests. See, <em>e.g., Finley v. Staton, </em>542 F.2d 250, 250 (5th Cir.1976). Accordingly, Brown is not entitled to \u00a7 1983 relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Without specifically adverting to Brown\u2019s ex post facto claim, the defendants have asserted that he is not entitled to relief because a Texas inmate has no liberty interest in obtaining parole. The district court dismissed the action as time-barred without discussing Brown\u2019s constitutional claims. However, \u201c[a] law need not impair a vested right to violate the Ex Post Facto prohibition.\u201d <em>Orellana, </em>65 F.3d at 32 (citing <em>Weaver v. Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 29-30, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981)). \u201c \u2018The presence or absence of an affirmative, enforceable right is not relevant\u2019 \u201d to the viability of an ex post facto claim. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Weaver, </em>450 U.S. at 30, 101 S.Ct. 960).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">The Supreme Court recently held that a prisoner can maintain a \u00a7 1983 claim seeking to invalidate state parole procedures, and that <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), is not an impediment to such a claim. <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 1246-49, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). The Court reasoned that \u201c[sjuccess for Dotson ... means at most new eligibility review, which at most will speed <em>consideration </em>of a new parole application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248. Thus it appears that the district court erred by not treating Brown\u2019s parole-procedure claim as a \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">Brown\u2019s ex post facto claim would not be untimely under Texas\u2019s two-year rule for \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>Cooper v. Brookshire, </em>70 F.3d 377, 380 n. 20 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see </em>Tex. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Civ. Peac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a) (Vernon). Therefore, the judgment is VACATED in part, and the case is REMANDED for the district court to address Brown\u2019s ex post facto claim as a \u00a7 1983 allegation, pursuant to <em>Wilkinson. </em>As to this claim, COA is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
