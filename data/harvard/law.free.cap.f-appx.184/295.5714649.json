Wilson was sentenced to 84 months\u2019 imprisonment. Wilson appeals his sentence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>arguing the district court erred in applying the federal sentencing guidelines as mandatory in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">In <em>Booker, </em>which issued after Wilson was sentenced, the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. 543 U.S. at 233-34, 125 S.Ct. 738 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(b)(1), 3742(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In reviewing sentences for errors that do not involve a Sixth Amendment violation, this court may apply the plain error and harmless error doctrines in determining whether resentencing is required. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769; <em>see </em>Fed. R.CrimP. 52(a) (appellate court may disregard any error that does not affect substantial rights). Because Wilson objected below based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), this claim is reviewed under harmless error analysis. <em>United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003). Under harmless error review, the Government bears the burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Mackins, </em>315 F.3d at 405; <em>United States v. Stokes, </em>261 F.3d 496, 499 (4th Cir.2001). Affecting substantial rights means that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>Stokes, </em>261 F.3d at 499. The harmless error standard permits an error at sentencing to be disregarded if the reviewing court is certain that any such error \u201cdid not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">While we find the imposition of Wilson\u2019s sentence under the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines was error,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>see United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 216-17 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005), we find the error was harmless because the district court announced an identical alternate sentence and thus the error did not affect the selection of Wilson\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Revels, </em>455 F.3d 448, 451-52 (4th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Wilson\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\"> As in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time of [the defendant's] sentencing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
