The district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) with respect to the question whether Garcia\u2019s motion to reopen the revocation proceedings constituted \u201cother collateral review\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). We need not decide this question in this case. Even if it is assumed that Garcia\u2019s motion constituted \u201cother collateral review,\u201d the limitation period nevertheless expired prior to the filing of the federal habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Although Garcia contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling, COA was not granted as to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
