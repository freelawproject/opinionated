Wendy\u2019s International, Inc., </em>365 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThus, a trustee, as the representative of the bankruptcy estate, is the proper party in interest, and is the only party with standing to prosecute causes of action belonging to the estate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Jones had put forth no arguments, either in the district court or on appeal, addressing his lack of standing to bring this action, which was the district court\u2019s primary reasoning for entering summary judgment. Instead, on appeal, Jones argues that he presented sufficient evidence of a pattern of racially motivated employment practices and disparate treatment based on race, sufficient to avoid entry of summary judgment on his Title VII claims. We refuse to reach the merits of Jones\u2019s underlying suit because our caselaw make <em>dear </em>that Jones\u2019s failure to list this cause of action as a potential asset on his bankruptcy petition means that he lacks standing to bring this claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1271-72. Jones\u2019s potential discrimination claim became an asset of the bankruptcy estate when he filed his bankruptcy petition and the claim remains an asset of the bankruptcy estate. <em>Id. </em>Because there is no evidence that the trustee, who is the real party in interest in this discrimination suit, ever abandoned this claim, Jones lacks standing to bring the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1272. We affirm the entry of summary judgment on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">Finally, Clayton County has moved this court to award sanctions, in the form of appellate attorneys\u2019 fees and double costs, pursuant to Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Rule 38 provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-9\">If a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-10\">Fed. R.App. P. 38. Clayton County highlights that Jones has not so much as mentioned the issue of standing in his appellate brief. His lack of standing was the first reason noted by the district court for entering summary judgment and, alone, provides a sufficient basis for us to affirm. Clayton County urges that the filing of this appeal has resulted in a waste of resources to the County and its taxpayers and the resources of this Court. We agree. Accordingly, we grant the motion, in part, awarding the County appellate attorneys\u2019 fees and <em>single </em>costs, and remand to the district court for a determination of reasonable fees. <em>See Williams v. City of Fairburn, Ga., </em>702 F.2d 973, 974 (11th Cir.1983) (awarding appellate attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and remanding to district court for determination of amount).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>DISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART; REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1064-15\">. We lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s entry of sanctions against Jones's counsel, based on the court\u2019s finding that counsel acted in bad faith and knowingly pursued a frivolous, time-barred claim. It is well-settled that we must consider questions concerning our jurisdiction, even where neither party raises jurisdiction as an issue. <em>Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 844 (11th Cir.2006). This Court is without jurisdiction to consider the propriety of a district court's imposition of sanctions against a party's attorney, where the attorney has not filed a timely document clearly indicating his intent to appeal the sanctions. <em>Id. </em>As in <em>Hol-loman, </em>Jones's attorney failed to file a separate notice of appeal, indicating his intent to appeal the district court's imposition of sanctions against him, and likewise did not list himself as a party on appeal in his client\u2019s notice. Moreover, Jones's brief in this action was filed on January 11, 2006, which was over two months after the final judgment was entered and well after the deadline for filing a notice of appeal had expired. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, we DISMISS the appeal as to the entry of sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">. Jones was terminated in May 2003, but did not file a claim with the EEOC until July 2004, which was well after expiration of the 180-day limitation period enumerated in Title VII. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2005e-5(e)(l); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). And he made no argument in favor of equitable tolling of the limitation period. <em>Cf. Forehand v. Fla. State Hosp. at Chattahoochee, </em>89 F.3d 1562, 1570 n. 17 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that the timely filing of an EEOC charge is \"subject to waiver, estoppel and equitable tolling\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
