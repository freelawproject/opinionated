After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>Sentences imposed under an advisory Guidelines system are reviewed for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Following the <em>Booker </em>decision, we have stated that the district court must first correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, and then, using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Cranford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[NJothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). A district court\u2019s statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences to indicate that it considered the factors. <em>See id. </em>at 1330. \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[TJhe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Though the district court is no longer strictly bound to the Guidelines, it is nonetheless bound by statutory mandatory minimum sentences. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005). <em>Booker </em>does not grant a court discretion to sentence below the mandatory minimum sentence. <em>United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir. 2006). Further, when the statutory mandatory minimum sentence is greater than the applicable Guidelines range, the mandatory minimum is the Guidelines sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find that Hernandez\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sentenced Hernandez to the lowest sentence possible, the applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence. Further, 60 months was the lowest possible Guidelines sentence. In arriving at the sentence, the district court mentioned its consideration of the statutory factors. The court found that a sentence of more than 60 months\u2019 imprisonment was unnecessary. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-5\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the available sentences, the applicable Guideline range and policy statements, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to (1) reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, (2) afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, (3) protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and (4) provide the defendant with needed correctional treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
