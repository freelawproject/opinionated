Chi has failed to show that the record compels reversal of the finding of the BIA and IJ that Chi failed to give credible testimony that he is entitled to asylum or withholding of removal. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Because Chi does not argue in his brief that he is entitled to relief under the CAT, he has abandoned any challenge to the denial of that relief. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993). Chi\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
