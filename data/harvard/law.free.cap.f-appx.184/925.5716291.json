He contends that, because the characterization of his prior conviction for aggravated assault as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d was not charged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>the indictment or proven to a jury, the 16-level sentencing enhancement applied by the district court pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Although we review Delgado-Aguilar\u2019s constitutional objection de novo, and will reverse only for harmful error, <em>see United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam), his argument is clearly foreclosed by our circuit precedent interpreting <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and Apprendi\u2019s progeny. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-63 (11th Cir.) <em>{Booker </em>did not disturb Almendarez-Torres\u2019s holding that \u201crecidivism is <em>not </em>a separate element of an offense that the government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005); <em>United States v. Glover, </em>431 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (\u201c[Wjhether a previous conviction is a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 is a question of law, not of fact....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Therefore, the district court did not violate <em>Booker </em>when it enhanced Delgado-Aguilar\u2019s sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines based on its finding that his prior conviction was for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Even so, Delgado-Aguilar was sentenced under an advisory guidelines scheme, so the district court did not commit constitutional error in sentencing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">Thus, we affirm Delgado-Aguilar\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
