Che sought rescission of a final order of deportation entered in absentia, asserting that his absence from court was due to exceptional circumstances beyond his control. We have reviewed the administrative record and conclude that the denial of the motion to reopen the in absentia order was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(I), (e)(1) (West 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-20\">We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
