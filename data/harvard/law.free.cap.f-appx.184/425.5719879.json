However, Perez knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights, the Government seeks to enforce the waiver, Perez\u2019s sentencing claim does not fall within any of the exceptions to the appeal waiver, and the plain language of the waiver bars this appeal. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 546 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-21\">Although Perez\u2019s claim is barred, there is a clerical error in the judgment that requires remand. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>588 F.2d 961, 964 (5th Cir.1979). The judgment of conviction indicates that the offense to which Perez pleaded guilty was illegal reentry rather than the separate and distinct offense of attempted illegal reentry. <em>See United States v. Angeles-Mascote, </em>206 F.3d 529, 531-32 (5th Cir. 2000). The indictment and the guilty-plea-hearing transcript reveal that Perez pleaded guilty to attempted illegal reentry following deportation subsequent to conviction for an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed, and this case is remanded for the limited purpose of correcting the clerical error in the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-22\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF CORRECT<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>ING CLERICAL ERROR IN JUDGMENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
