The IJ denied asylum after making an adverse credibility finding based on inconsistencies between Makharashvili\u2019s prior statements, including in her asylum application, and her testimony before the IJ.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-18\">The IJ\u2019s factual determination that an alien is not entitled to asylum must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Mazariegos v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). Under this highly deferential standard of review, a denial of asylum may be reversed only if the evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>See INS v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number><em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d). A finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal.... \u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Like other factual findings, credibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, meaning that the IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-1287 (11th Cir.2005). And \u201can adverse credibility determination <em>alone </em>may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application\u201d when there is no other evidence of persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (emphasis added); <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004) (same). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (citations omitted). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to his home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his or her statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. The applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain her burden of proof without corroborating evidence. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13. \u201c[T]he weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir. 2005). An adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support an IJ\u2019s decision to deny an application for asylum. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">\u201c[Pjersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>378 F.3d 1260, 1264 (11th Cir.2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Put another way, \u201c \u2018[m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000)). An asylum applicant may not show merely that she practices a particular faith, but must show that she was persecuted <em>because of </em>that faith. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Here, substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>decision, based on those findings, that Makharashvili was not entitled to asylum. The IJ cited numerous inconsistencies and unbelievable testimony to support his adverse credibility finding, including: (1) inconsistencies between Makharashvili\u2019s asylum application and testimony concerning when she met her friend Maria, who introduced her to the Warriors of God, the group upon which her asylum application was based; (2) inconsistencies between Makharashvili\u2019s statements in her medical records, in which she did not attribute her depression to being raped by Georgian police officers, and her prior statements, including her asylum application, and testimony in which she detailed being raped by Georgian police officers; and (3) her testimony that she traveled to the United States to seek asylum was inconsistent with her one-year delay in applying for asylum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the substantial evidence test, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The IJ considered the adverse credibility determination to be dispositive of Makharashvili\u2019s application, since she presented no other evidence of her persecution. <em>Cf. Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (holding that \u201can adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application\u201d when there is no other evidence of persecution). On this record, based on the inconsistencies we have noted above, we cannot say that the record compels reversal of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-13\">. We have jurisdiction over a \"final order of removal,\u201d so long as the petition for review is filed within 30 days. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). The BIA\u2019s November 3, 2005 order, affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, was a final order of removal. Makharashvili timely filed her petition for review on December 5, 2005. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b853-19\">. Because we find that Makharashvili has not established a case for asylum under the INA, we do not address her arguments that she also satisfied the higher standards for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b855-8\">. Because we find these inconsistencies sufficient to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding (and, consequently, the denial of asylum), we need not and do not reach the other inconsistencies noted by the IJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
