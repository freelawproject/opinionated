Avila argues that he demonstrated both past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution as a result of his activities in a defunct political party.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">We conclude from a review of the record that the BIA\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
