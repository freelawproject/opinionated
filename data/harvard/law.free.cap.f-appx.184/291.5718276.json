Timmons was sentenced to 235 months in prison for the drug offense and a consecutive 120-month term for the firearm offense, for an aggregate sentence of 355 months in prison. Timmons now appeals, challenging his sentence as unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-20\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the sentencing range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines, which are now advisory. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are required to consider the correctly calculated guideline range and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). <em>Id. </em>We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it falls within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47. A sentence that falls within the correctly determined guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-22\">Here, the district court sentenced Timmons within the statutorily prescribed ranges, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii), and within the properly calculated guideline range. The court also took note of Timmons\u2019 Position Statement Regarding Sentencing, in which Timmons\u2019 attorney argued that a 240-month aggregate sentence would be appropriate in light of the sentencing factors set forth at \u00a7 3553(a). We therefore conclude that the sentence imposed is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-23\">We accordingly affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately set forth in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
