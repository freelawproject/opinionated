The issue before this court is whether the judge who presided over the criminal trial abused his discretion in denying the defendant's oral motion for disqualification following the judge's disclosure that he previously had been employed by the hospital. We conclude that the limited facts in the record provide no basis to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts. In addition to the four counts of which he was convicted, the state charged the defendant with one count each of the crimes of reckless endangerment in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-64 (a) and disorderly conduct in violation of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1). All of the charges stemmed from the defendant's conduct both inside and outside of the emergency department at the hospital, where he sought treatment for scratches sustained in an altercation earlier that evening. Specifically, the defendant was alleged to have nearly hit a hospital security guard with his vehicle when arriving at the drop off area for the emergency department and, after entering the emergency room, to have been loud\n   and disruptive as he waited for treatment. The defendant repeatedly refused the staff's demands to leave the premises after he was initially evaluated. He also was alleged to have acted aggressively and threateningly toward the police officers who had been summoned to escort the defendant from the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Judge Kwak presided over the trial. Jury selection took place on June 19, 2014. On June 23, 2014, the day before the state was set to commence presentation of its case-in-chief, an off-the-record meeting occurred between Judge Kwak and counsel. The following day, immediately before the commencement of evidence, defense counsel made an oral motion to disqualify Judge Kwak, citing the judge's disclosure in chambers the prior day that he had previously served as the hospital's director of risk management. The defendant argued that the hospital was the victim of the criminal trespass charge, and that Judge Kwak's prior employment would give rise to the appearance of bias insofar as he would have discretion to impose a sentence in the event the defendant were found guilty of that charge. The state declined to be heard on the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response to the defendant's motion, Judge Kwak stated: \"I've consulted the [Code of Judicial Conduct], rule 2.11 specifically, regarding disqualifications, and I've read everything there and I don't believe it's going to be a conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"I don't work for [the] [h]ospital. I did not recognize any of the names that were mentioned by [the prosecutor] as possible witnesses. Yes, it does involve [the] [h]ospital, to the extent that the incident allegedly occurred there, but [the hospital] is really not a party here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"It's the [s]tate versus [the defendant]. Therefore, I don't see a reason why I need to recuse myself. Certainly,\n   I'm going to be fair and impartial to both parties. Therefore, your motion is denied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the matter was submitted to the jury, the court declared a mistrial on the reckless endangerment count and one of the disorderly conduct counts. The jury\n   returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of criminal trespass, as well as the three other charges. Judge Kwak thereafter imposed a total effective sentence of two years imprisonment, execution suspended after one year, and two years of probation. The defendant appealed from the judgment to the Appellate Court, and the appeal was subsequently transferred to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that Judge Kwak abused his discretion in declining to disqualify himself. The defendant asserts that Judge Kwak improperly based his decision solely on the question of actual bias and that the judge's prior employment created an appearance of bias that required his disqualification. The state contends that the defendant's claim is unreviewable because his motion for disqualification was procedurally defective. We disagree with the state as to the issue of reviewability and reject the defendant's claim on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We begin with the question of whether the defendant's claim is amenable to review. The state points to the defendant's failure to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 1-23, insofar as that rule requires that a motion for judicial disqualification be in writing and accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the facts relied on and a certificate of counsel attesting that it was made in good\n   faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree that there is a per se rule that noncompliance with the rule's procedural requirements is fatal to review. We further conclude that the defendant's claim is amenable to review under the circumstances of the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Initially, we note that the defendant's claim of judicial bias was preserved via his oral motion for disqualification. The trial court and the state were put on notice of the claim, and neither objected to the motion's form or the defendant's good faith basis for so moving. The trial court's ruling squarely addressed the ground on which the defendant's oral motion was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a general matter, in determining whether a preserved claim is amenable to review, it is well settled that the appellant is obligated to present a record that contains the requisite facts necessary to resolve the claim. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Santangelo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"504652\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/205/578/#p584\">\n    205 Conn. 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 584,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=534%20A.2d%201175\">\n    534 A.2d 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987).

As previously stated, the trial court acted on the defendant's oral motion in the absence of any objection by the state, thus reflecting that both understood the factual basis of the motion. See\n   <em>\n    Tracey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tracey\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687141\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/97/278/#p279\">\n    97 Conn.App. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   280 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20A.2d%20679\">\n    903 A.2d 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reviewing claim of judicial bias despite noncompliance with \u00a7 1-23 because, inter alia, \"court acted on the defendant's oral motion without objection by the plaintiff\"). Significantly, the factual basis for the defendant's claim is Judge Kwak's own representation, which he confirmed on the record, that he previously had been employed as director of risk management for the hospital. In the absence of any dispute as to the factual basis of the disqualification motion, the lack of an evidentiary hearing or formal factual findings is not fatal to review of the defendant's claim.

Finally, we note that the defendant's oral motion was made at the first available opportunity to place it on the record. See\n   <em>\n    Giordano\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Giordano\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1311279\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/9/641/#p643\">\n    9 Conn.App. at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20A.2d%201290\">\n    520 A.2d 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given the limited and undisputed nature of the defendant's claim and mindful of the timing of Judge Kwak's disclosure, we conclude that the record is adequate for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This is not to say that the defendant's noncompliance with the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 1-23 is without consequence. As we explain in part II of this opinion, our review is limited to those facts that are established in the record. Moreover, we do not intend to suggest that noncompliance with \u00a7 1-23 could never be fatal to a trial court's consideration of a claim of judicial disqualification or to appellate review of such a claim. We simply conclude that it is not fatal under the record presented in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We now turn to the merits of the defendant's claim that the trial court's ruling denying his oral motion for judicial disqualification was improper in two respects. First, he contends that Judge Kwak applied the wrong standard in deciding the disqualification motion insofar as Judge\n   Kwak considered only whether he could, in fact, be impartial and thus failed to analyze whether his impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Second, the defendant contends that there was an appearance of impartiality insofar as (1) the hospital was the victim of the criminal trespass charge and Judge Kwak had discretion to impose a sentence on the defendant if he were found guilty of that crime, and (2) it was reasonable to assume that the judge's former position as the director of risk management entailed devising policies for the safety of patients and staff, which gave\n   Judge Kwak personal knowledge of facts relevant to this matter. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rule 2.11 (a) (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides in relevant part that \"[a] judge shall disqualify himself ... in any proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned including, but not limited to, the following circumstances ... [t]he judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or a party's lawyer, or personal knowledge of facts that are in dispute in the proceeding.\" \"In applying this rule, [t]he reasonableness standard is an objective one. Thus, the question is not only whether the particular judge is, in fact, impartial but whether a reasonable person would question the judge's impartiality on the basis of all the circumstances. ... Moreover, it is well established that [e]ven in the absence of actual bias, a judge must disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, because the appearance and the existence of impartiality are both essential elements of a fair exercise of judicial authority. ... Nevertheless, because the law presumes that duly elected or appointed judges, consistent with their oaths of office, will perform their duties impartially ... the burden rests with the party urging disqualification to show that it is warranted.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rizzo\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174073\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/71/#p115\">\n    303 Conn. at 118-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20A.3d%201094\">\n    31 A.3d 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our review of the trial court's denial of a motion for disqualification is governed by an abuse of discretion standard. See\n   <em>\n    Abington Ltd. Partnership\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Heublein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"245256\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/246/815/#p823\">\n    246 Conn. 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 823-24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=717%20A.2d%201232\">\n    717 A.2d 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the present case, Judge Kwak stated that he had reviewed rule 2.11 of the Code of Judicial Conduct in its entirety prior to defense counsel's oral request for disqualification. The plain language of rule 2.11 sets forth the objective standard for determining whether disqualification is warranted-i.e., whether the judge's\n   impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Moreover, before deciding the motion, Judge Kwak placed on the record additional facts relevant to the objective inquiry of whether an appearance of bias might exist, including that he no longer worked for the hospital and that he did not recognize any names on the prosecutor's list of potential witnesses. From this, it is fair to assume that the trial court reflected on the appropriate standard and rendered a conclusion consistent with its application of an objective inquiry. The mere fact that Judge Kwak used the first person when he stated, \"I don't believe it's going to be a conflict\" and \"I don't see any reason why I need to recuse myself,\" does not establish that he considered only whether he subjectively believed that he could remain impartial. It is well settled that \"[w]e do not presume error; the trial court's ruling is entitled to the reasonable presumption that it is correct unless the party challenging the ruling has satisfied its burden demonstrating the contrary.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Crumpton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498050\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/224/#p231\">\n    202 Conn. 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20A.2d%20226\">\n    520 A.2d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Orcutt\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957231\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/724/\">\n    284 Conn. 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739 n.25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=937%20A.2d%20656\">\n    937 A.2d 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (\"in the absence of an articulation-which the appellant is responsible\n   for obtaining-we presume that the trial court acted properly\"). Because nothing in the record indicates otherwise, we conclude that the correct legal standard was applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Turning to the defendant's claim that Judge Kwak's impartiality reasonably might be questioned, we note that, because the defendant declined to file an affidavit or seek an evidentiary hearing, the record consists only of Judge Kwak's representations to counsel. Those representations established the following facts: Judge Kwak worked for the hospital as the director of risk management prior to his appointment to the bench; he no longer worked at the hospital in any capacity; and he did not recognize the names of any of the state's\n   potential witnesses. In our view, a reasonable person presented with these facts would not doubt Judge Kwak's impartiality to the extent he would have the discretion to impose a sentence on the defendant if he were found guilty of the charge of criminal trespass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Insofar as the defendant suggests that a reasonable person would assume that Judge Kwak's responsibilities as the director of risk management would have included creating policies and safeguards to prevent criminal activity at the hospital, he has established no facts in the record from which such an inference could be drawn. The job title alone does not provide such a basis. Judge Kwak may have been responsible for assessing actuarial risk for insurance purposes or minimizing the risk of the spread of disease. Even if the scope of Judge Kwak's responsibilities could have included or related to the prevention of criminal activity, the defendant has failed to establish when the judge held that position and for how long. It was the defendant's burden to establish the factual basis that created an appearance of bias or partiality. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Santangelo\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"504652\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/205/578/#p584\">\n    205 Conn. at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=534%20A.2d%201175\">\n    534 A.2d 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
