On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred (1) by not sua sponte ordering pretrial and posttrial competency hearings and canvassing him on his purported right to testify at those hearings; (2) in joining the sexual assault information and the escape information for trial; (3) in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from his apartment; and (4) in denying his motion to vacate his convictions for sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child on double jeopardy grounds. We affirm the judgment in part, and we reverse the judgment in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On August 31, 2011, the eleven year old victim and her sisters were sitting outside their home when the\n   defendant approached them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The victim did not know the defendant, but she recalled seeing him the day before. The defendant invited the victim and one of her sisters to go to the store with him to get candy. The victim agreed to go to the store with the defendant while her sister remained behind. Once the victim and the defendant were inside the store, however, the defendant said that he did not have any money on him to purchase anything. The defendant offered to call the victim's sister to ask if the victim could go with him to his apartment nearby to get some money. The defendant purportedly called the victim's sister and received permission for the victim to come with him, but when the victim asked to speak to her sister, the defendant said that her sister had already hung up the phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant and the victim then walked to the defendant's apartment, which was a few blocks away from where the victim lived. Once at the defendant's apartment complex, the victim told the defendant that she wanted to wait outside\n   on the sidewalk for him while he retrieved his money. The defendant told the victim to go upstairs. When she refused, he pushed her upstairs and into his apartment on the second floor. The victim tried to scream for help, but the defendant covered her mouth. Once inside the defendant's apartment, the victim hit and kicked the defendant in an attempt to get away, but she could not fight him off.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant pushed her into his bedroom and onto his bed. Once their pants were off, the defendant retrieved a small package from his dresser drawer. The victim again attempted to run away from the defendant, but he\n   pushed her onto his bed, put a clear cream on her vagina, and vaginally penetrated her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After sexually assaulting the victim, the defendant walked her home and told her that if she told anyone what happened, he would come after her. Despite the defendant's threat, the victim told her mother what happened to her once she was inside her home. The victim's mother called the police, and the victim directed the police to the defendant's apartment. The victim was taken then to an emergency room, where a sexual assault evidence collection kit was used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   That same day, the defendant was arrested at his apartment. When officers initially encountered the defendant outside of his apartment, they detained him for investigatory purposes. While he was detained, the defendant consented to a search of his apartment. During their search of the defendant's apartment, officers found a small packet of personal lubricant with the corner torn off in the trash in the defendant's bathroom and a corner piece of foil that had been torn from the packet of lubricant in the defendant's bedroom. At the police department, the defendant consented to a buccal swab so that officers could obtain a sample of his DNA. A comparison of the victim's vaginal swab and the defendant's buccal swab confirmed the presence of the defendant's spermatozoa in the victim's vaginal cavity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons addressed later in this opinion, the defendant was not released on bond following his arrest. On September 26, 2012, during a pretrial hearing, the defendant attempted to escape custody by running for the back door of the courtroom. Judicial marshals immediately apprehended the defendant. The state subsequently charged the defendant in a separate information with attempt to escape custody in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49(a)(2) and 53a-171(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 9, 2013, a consolidated trial commenced on a three count long form information relating to the defendant's sexual assault of the victim and a one count long form information relating to the defendant's attempt to escape custody. On October 11, 2013, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts. On June 18, 2014, the court imposed a total effective sentence of fifty years imprisonment followed by five years special parole for the two informations. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant raises four claims with respect to his competency to stand trial and the process by which he was found competent to stand trial. The following additional facts are relevant to these claims. On September 1, 2011, the defendant was arraigned and appointed counsel\n   from the public defender's office. During arraignment, defense counsel noted that the defendant was a \"client\" of a mental health facility and that \"[h]e appears to have been steady with his treatment there.\" The court,\n   <em>\n    Newson, J.\n   </em>\n   , stated that \"mental health attention should be noted on the [mittimus].\" During the defendant's first six court appearances, between September 1, 2011 and December 12, 2011, his courtroom behavior was unremarkable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 17, 2012, the defendant was unable to be transported to court because \"while in the custody of [the Department of Correction] he covered himself in feces and refused to be transported.\" Defense counsel moved for a competency examination pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d, and the court\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted the motion and issued an order for a competency examination. On March 28, 2012, the Department of Mental Health and\n   Addiction Services, Office of Forensic Evaluations, submitted a competency report, in which the clinical team unanimously concluded that, while the defendant was presently not competent to stand trial, there was a substantial probability that he could be restored to competency within the statutory time frame.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 29, 2012, the court held a competency hearing, at which the court agreed with the clinical team's assessment, ordered that the defendant receive treatment in an inpatient setting, and continued the case until May 31, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 25, 2012, Dr. Mark S. Cotterell, a forensic psychiatrist, submitted a second competency report to the court, in which he concluded that the defendant had not yet been restored to competency but was still capable of restoration within the statutory time frame. Cotterell's report acknowledged that the defendant had a history of mental health treatment and engaging in behaviors indicative of mental illness. However, Cotterell also observed that \"there appears to be a volitional component to [the defendant's] presentation. It appears that he knows more than he is willing to admit.\" On May 31, 2012, the court held a competency reconsideration hearing at which it concluded that the defendant was not competent but was restorable to competency and ordered the defendant to continue to receive treatment in an inpatient setting. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d(k).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 16, 2012, Cotterell submitted a third competency report to the court in which he concluded that the defendant was competent to stand trial. In that report, Cotterell noted that the defendant had consistently refused to participate in formal evaluations. However, Cotterell detailed aspects of the defendant's\n   behavior that indicated that \"he has the capacity to understand his legal situation and the capacity to assist his attorney if he were to choose to do so.\" The report observed that \"there is definitely a volitional component\" to defendant's refusal to engage in a formal evaluation and that \"[i]t is clear that he knows more than he is willing to admit.\" The report also stated that \"[the defendant] is not currently taking psychiatric medication, and he has not demonstrated any symptoms of a serious mental illness that would require such treatment.\" On August 31, 2012, the court held a competency reconsideration hearing to reassess the defendant's competency to stand trial. At the hearing, Cotterell's report was\n   marked as an exhibit, and defense counsel and the state stipulated that the defendant was competent to stand trial. The court then found that the defendant was competent to stand trial based on Cotterell's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 26, 2012, the defendant attempted to escape from the custody of the judicial marshals after being brought into the courtroom. When court reconvened after a recess, the defendant was not present. The court indicated that he was \"not behaving in any appropriate manner in the lockup,\" was \"spitting at the cell door\" and was \"giving the correction officers a difficult time ....\" Defense counsel, who had represented the defendant over the last year, agreed that the defendant \"appear[ed] to be in a somewhat agitated state.\" The court stated that the defendant's next court appearance would be conducted by video conference \"to minimize the further potential of any harm to any correction[al] and/or judicial marshal staff.\" Despite this arrangement, the defendant's behavior prior to the next two court hearings prevented him from participating in those hearings, even via video conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Trial commenced on October 9, 2013. When court reconvened after the first morning recess, the court\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   announced that there had been \"a major problem with the defendant\" because \"[h]e decided to flush his jumpsuit down the toilet\" and urinated on the floor. The court directed defense counsel to find substitute clothing for him and stated that \"if [the defendant] continues to act up, he will have handcuffs put on eventually.\" The court observed that \"[the defendant] has been behaved in the courtroom and I'm not concerned about his behavior in the courtroom.\" The court further noted that problems arose only when he leaves the courtroom. While the court was discussing the defendant's conduct with defense counsel, the defendant interjected that he was acting out when outside the courtroom \"because [the judicial marshals] put handcuffs on me in a-in a secured cell where they ain't supposed to do that.\" The court admonished the defendant that the judicial marshals were the ones in control, not him, and gave defense counsel an opportunity to speak with the defendant. The jury was then brought back into the court and evidence continued without the defendant being present in the courtroom. Later that morning, after another recess, the court observed that \"[the defendant] is back in the courtroom. ... [He] has been very well behaved in court. And that's what I see and that's what I care about, primarily. So, there has been no problem in the courtroom itself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 10, 2013, the second day of trial and the final day of evidence, the defendant testified with respect to the escape charge. After defense counsel declined to conduct a redirect examination of the defendant, the defendant interjected: \"You're an idiot.\" The court excused the jury and engaged in the following\n   colloquy with the defendant after he was returned to the defense table:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The Court: ... [Y]our last comment was totally gratuitous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The Defendant: I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm on frustration, I kind of lost a little control. I apologize. It's kind of hard, you know, to sit there and like, you know.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"The Court: Your apology is accepted. You don't have to go any further. However, do be advised that calling anyone [names], your attorneys, the state's attorney, anyone in the building, that is unacceptable, and if you weren't facing so much, you would be facing a contempt\n   charge. But you did apologize, and it's just not worth even considering the contempt because you are facing so many other serious charges. All right, sir?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"The Defendant: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The Court: But thank you for the apology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The Defendant: All right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The jury then was brought back into the courtroom, and the defendant did not make any other comments or cause any additional disruptions. On October 11, 2013, the third and final day of trial, the jury heard closing arguments from counsel and was charged by the court. The defendant did not make any comments or cause any disruptions in court that day. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, the defendant seeks\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   of his claim that the court violated his purported right to testify at a competency hearing by not canvassing him, sua sponte, on whether he understood that by stipulating to his competency he was waiving his right to testify at a competency hearing. Second, the defendant claims that\n   the court committed plain error by permitting defense counsel to waive the second reconsideration hearing because \u00a7 54-56d(k) permits only the accused to waive a reconsideration hearing. Third, the defendant claims that the court violated his due process rights and committed plain error by accepting his stipulation to his competency and by not ordering, sua sponte, an evidentiary hearing to evaluate his competency. Finally, the defendant claims that the court violated his due process rights and committed plain error by failing to order, sua sponte, a nunc pro tunc, or retrospective,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   competency hearing to evaluate his competency at trial in light of his erratic posttrial conduct, which we discuss in detail later in this opinion. We reject the defendant's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We begin by setting forth the standards of review that will guide our analysis of the defendant's claims. \"Under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant's claim will fail.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%20495\">\n    318 Conn. 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 511,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20542\">\n    122 A.3d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). \"The first two steps in the\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   analysis address the reviewability of the claim, while the last two steps involve the merits of the claim.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Britton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730402\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/283/598/#p615\">\n    283 Conn. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 615,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=929%20A.2d%20312\">\n    929 A.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). \"The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant's claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 511,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20542\">\n    122 A.3d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   is a doctrine that parties invoke to obtain review of unpreserved constitutional claims, the plain error doctrine \"is an extraordinary remedy used by appellate courts to rectify errors committed at trial that, although unpreserved, are of such monumental proportion that they threaten to erode our system of justice and work a serious and manifest injustice on the aggrieved party.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142981\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/278/#p289\">\n    290 Conn. 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 289,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=963%20A.2d%2011\">\n    963 A.2d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). \"Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The defendant's argument is predicated on the assumption that he has a constitutional right to testify at a pretrial competency hearing, that this is a \"personal right\" that can be waived only by the defendant, and that only the accused personally can waive a competency hearing as a result. Although we conclude that the defendant's claim is reviewable pursuant to the first and second prongs of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , the defendant is not entitled to reversal under the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   because he has not established that a constitutional violation exists and deprived him of a fair trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Assuming, without deciding, that there is a constitutional right to testify at a pretrial competency hearing, the outcome of this case is controlled by\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Paradise\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566677\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/388/\">\n    213 Conn. 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%201221\">\n    567 A.2d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), overruled in part on other grounds by\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Skakel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3992204\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/276/633/#p693\">\n    276 Conn. 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 693,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=888%20A.2d%20985\">\n    888 A.2d 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=549%20U.S.%201030\">\n    549 U.S. 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20S.%20Ct.%20578\">\n    127 S.Ct. 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20428\">\n    166 L.Ed.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).

In the present case, it is undisputed that at the second reconsideration hearing the defendant never affirmatively stated that he wished to testify at the competency hearing or that he did not know that he could testify. Therefore, the court had no duty to canvass the defendant on his purported right to testify at a competency hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The defendant nevertheless urges us to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Paradise\n   </em>\n   because we are addressing the purported right to testify at a competency hearing rather than the well established right to testify at trial, which was the subject of\n   <em>\n    Paradise\n   </em>\n   . The defendant reasons that inferring a waiver of the purported right to testify at a competency hearing is \"illogical, because the defendant (at that point in time) may be 'unable to understand the proceedings against him or her or to assist in his or her own defense.' \" Additionally, the defendant argues that a defendant's testimony at a competency hearing can be particularly important because \"[t]he defendant's demeanor and behavior in the courtroom can often be as probative on the issue of his competence as the testimony of expert witnesses.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

This statutory scheme includes procedures for initial competency evaluations as well as procedures for determining whether a defendant who has been found incompetent to stand trial has been restored to competency. In particular, subsection (e) of \u00a7 54-56d, which governs the initial competency hearing, states in relevant part: \"A\n   <em>\n    defendant and the defendant's counsel\n   </em>\n   may waive the court hearing only if the examiners, in the written report, determine without qualification that the defendant is competent....\" (Emphasis added.) By contrast, subsection (k), which governs competency reconsideration hearings, states in relevant part: \"The [reconsideration] hearing may be waived\n   <em>\n    by the defendant\n   </em>\n   only if the report indicates that the defendant is competent....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The defendant argues that because \"the word 'defendant' as used in subsection (e) refers to the accused person rather than his 'counsel,' the use of the word\n   'defendant' in subsection (k) obviously has the same meaning.\" Nevertheless, assuming arguendo that the distinction noted by the defendant is meaningful and that the court then failed to comply strictly with \u00a7 54-56d(k), the record in this case does not establish that the court's failure deprived the defendant of his constitutional rights or otherwise harmed him. The purpose of \u00a7 54-56d is to ensure that the defendant is not tried, convicted, or sentenced while legally incompetent, and the defendant has not established that he was tried and convicted while legally incompetent. For all of the reasons discussed in part I C of this opinion, we conclude that the defendant has failed to establish that the court violated his constitutional rights by finding him competent to stand trial at the second reconsideration hearing. Similarly, for all the reasons discussed in part I D of this opinion, we conclude that the defendant has failed to establish that there was a reasonable doubt during trial that he was competent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Therefore, because the defendant has failed to establish that this purported procedural error was \"so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice,\" he has failed to meet the exacting standard for reversal under the plain error doctrine.

For example, in the conclusions and recommendations section of the report, Cotterell described how the defendant, inter alia, \"is able to pay attention to his environment ... and the rules of his status.... He is able to communicate when he wants, and he can use appropriate vocabulary and grammar. He can listen to what others tell him and understand routine instructions and guidance.... His long and short-term memory functions are intact. If he wants something, he can make a plan to get it and then carry out that plan. He can show initiative if he is sufficiently motivated. He is able to work with others when he perceives that he will receive a benefit from that interaction.... He can and does pay attention to what is going on around him.... He can bring information or requests to the attention of others.... He knows what he wants and he can identify things that would help him to improve his situation. Sometimes, he makes choices that are maladaptive, immature, and impulsive. However, he is always aware of his options, even if he chooses unwisely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Cotterell also explained that some of the negative aspects of the defendant's presentation were due to the defendant malingering to avoid the consequences of his legal situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was not an unexpected diagnosis\n   either; the prior competency reports also intimated that the defendant might be malingering. For example, the first and second competency reports noted that while incarcerated the defendant had a habit of threatening suicide or engaging in self-injurious or bizarre behavior in an attempt to change his placement to a more desirable housing block. The first competency report, while concluding that the\n   defendant's behavior during interviews was indicative of psychiatric issues, also acknowledged that \"there was a volitional element to his refusal to participate in the interview process.\" Similarly, the second competency report observed that there was a \"volitional component to [the defendant's] presentation\" and that \"[i]t appears that [the defendant] knows more than he is willing to admit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the second competency report, the defendant's behavior \"suggested that he was trying to find a way to\n   avoid facing the implications of his charges.\" Cotterell's conclusion in the third competency report that the defendant was both competent to stand trial and malingering, therefore, was not as dramatic and inexplicable as suggested by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, at the second reconsideration hearing, defense counsel, who originally moved to have the defendant's competency evaluated, did not contest the findings of the third competency report or express any concerns about his client's competency to stand trial.

Additionally, we conclude that the court was not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing at the second reconsideration hearing because there was not substantial evidence that the defendant still lacked legal capacity. Therefore, the defendant has failed to meet the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   as well as the stringent standard for relief pursuant to the plain error doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, the defendant seeks\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   and plain error review of his claim that the court violated his due process rights by failing to order, sua sponte, a nunc pro\n   tunc competency hearing to evaluate his\n   competency at trial in light of his posttrial conduct between December, 2013 and April, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the defendant is not entitled to reversal under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   or the plain error doctrine because he has not established that the court's failure to order, sua sponte, a nunc pro tunc competency hearing violated his constitutional rights or constitutes a manifest injustice requiring reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. On December 12, 2013, the defendant was scheduled for sentencing. When court opened that day, the court observed the defendant's absence. A judicial marshal then explained that while the defendant was being transported to the courthouse, \"he defecated on himself in the back of the transport van\" and was, therefore, transported back to the correctional facility. The court and counsel decided to proceed with the hearing on the defendant's posttrial motions and to reschedule the defendant's sentencing. After the court heard argument on, and denied, the defendant's motion for a new trial and motion to vacate, defense counsel moved to have the defendant evaluated pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-566.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel explained that he and cocounsel had visited the defendant the prior week, at\n   which time the defendant \"exhibited certain behaviors, which concerned us ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, defense counsel stated that the defendant had \"made certain statements,\" that he \"had a different presentation than he did during the trial,\" and that his \"psychiatric condition appears to be more prevalent than it did at times during the trial ....\" The court granted defense counsel's motion and ordered that the defendant be evaluated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On January 13, 2014, the clinical team informed the court that they had attempted to evaluate the defendant on two occasions but he had refused to meet with them. The defendant was present at the next court hearing on January 31, 2014. When the court explained to the defendant that a competency evaluation had been ordered, the defendant initially seemed confused about what the court was saying, but ultimately he agreed to participate in a competency evaluation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On February 28, 2014, the court held a hearing concerning a motion to quash a subpoena for the defendant's mental health records, which was filed on behalf of the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. The court denied the motion because the defendant had waived his confidentiality in the records at the prior hearing. See footnote 14 of this opinion. The court stated that while the defendant \"does have some form of a mental disability,\" it was \"not sure that it's a competency disability.\" The court entered another order for a competency evaluation of the defendant.

After careful review of the record, however, we conclude that the\n   defendant's posttrial conduct did not create a reasonable doubt, in hindsight, as to his competency at trial. Thus, the court was not obligated to order sua sponte a nunc pro tunc competency hearing to reevaluate the defendant's competency at trial. Therefore, because the defendant has not established that the court's failure to order, sua sponte, a nunc pro tunc competency hearing violated his due process rights or constitutes a manifest injustice requiring reversal, he is not entitled to reversal under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   or the plain error doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Our conclusion is first based on the fact that defense counsel, who represented the defendant for approximately two years and previously had sought competency evaluations for the defendant, never raised concerns about his client's competency\n   <em>\n    to stand trial\n   </em>\n   after he was found to be competent at the second reconsideration hearing. Defense counsel did raise concerns about the defendant's competency\n   <em>\n    to be sentenced\n   </em>\n   when the defendant's presentation became more argumentative posttrial. Notably, when defense counsel moved for a competency hearing posttrial, he supported that motion by highlighting the difference between the defendant's presentation\n   <em>\n    posttrial\n   </em>\n   and his presentation\n   <em>\n    at trial\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, after the defendant's conduct prevented him from being transported to the courthouse on December 12, 2013, defense counsel observed that the defendant had \"had a different presentation than he did during the trial\" and the defendant's \"psychiatric condition appears to be more prevalent than it did at times during the trial ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   It is also significant that during the trial the court did not voice any concerns about the defendant's competency to stand trial. Quite to the contrary, the court expressly stated that it was \"not concerned about his behavior in the courtroom\" and observed that \"[the defendant] has been very well behaved in court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, it is significant that during the trial, the defendant appeared to be competent. We acknowledge that the defendant engaged in disruptive behavior on two occasions during trial, but neither the defendant's behavior nor his responses to the court's admonitions indicated a lack of competency. On the first day of trial, the defendant flushed his jumpsuit down the toilet and urinated on the floor. When asked by the court about this behavior, he was able to articulate why he acted that way-i.e. because the courtroom marshals \"put handcuffs on me in a-in a secured cell where they ain't supposed to do that.\" On the second day of trial, the defendant was again disruptive when he called defense\n   counsel \"an idiot\" for not conducting a redirect examination of him. When the court admonished the defendant for his comment, however, he responded appropriately by recognizing that \"[he] kind of lost a little control\" and by apologizing for his remark. Although the defendant's conduct at trial might be reflective of the impulsivity described by Cotterell, it does not indicate a lack of competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In sum, there was significant evidence at trial that the defendant was competent. The defendant's posttrial conduct did not call into question any of this contemporaneous evidence of competency. As defense counsel observed, the defendant's presentation during and after trial was different. Therefore, because the defendant has not established that the court's failure to order sua sponte a nunc pro tunc competency hearing violated his due process rights or constitutes a manifest injustice requiring reversal, we conclude that he is not entitled to reversal under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   or the plain error doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   We next address the defendant's claims concerning the consolidation of the sexual assault information and the escape information for trial. First, the defendant\n   claims that the court abused its discretion by granting the state's motion for consolidation because the evidence relating to each information was not fully cross admissible and a\n   <em>\n    Boscarino\n   </em>\n   factor\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   was present. Second, the defendant claims that the court unduly burdened his constitutional right to remain silent in the sexual assault case by joining that case, in which he did not testify, with the escape case, in which he did testify. We reject the defendant's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to these claims. On September 19, 2013, five days before the start of jury selection, the defendant filed an anticipatory objection to joinder of informations for trial and the state filed a revised motion for consolidation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the revised motion to consolidate, the state argued that the\n   evidence in the two cases was cross\n   admissible\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that no\n   <em>\n    Boscarino\n   </em>\n   factors were present. In his anticipatory objection to the state's motion, the defendant argued that the motion to consolidate was untimely and that joinder would substantially prejudice his right to a fair trial, including his decision as to whether to testify. On September 23, 2013, the court held a hearing at which it addressed the state's motion to consolidate. On September 24, 2013, the court granted the state's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The defendant claims that the court abused its discretion by joining the sexual assault information and escape information for trial because the evidence was not cross admissible and a\n   <em>\n    Boscarino\n   </em>\n   factor was present in his trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We begin our analysis with a review of the law governing pretrial motions for joinder pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 41-19. \"[I]n deciding whether to [join informations] for trial, the trial court enjoys broad discretion, which, in the absence of manifest abuse, an appellate court may not disturb.... [W]hen charges are set forth in separate informations, presumably because they are not of the same character, and the state has moved in the trial court to join the multiple informations for trial, the state bears the burden of proving that the defendant will not be substantially prejudiced by joinder pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 41-19....

Specifically, the defendant argues that \"the improper joinder effectively undermined [his] valued right to remain silent-more precisely, his right to insure that no adverse inferences\n   were drawn from the exercise of that constitutional privilege.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. On September 19, 2013, the defendant filed an anticipatory objection to the state's motion to consolidate, in which he argued, inter alia, that joinder would\n   substantially prejudice his right to a fair trial, including his decision to testify. On September 23, 2013, the court held a hearing concerning the state's motion to consolidate. At that hearing, the defendant never addressed how joinder would affect his decision to testify as to the sexual assault charges or the escape charges. Trial commenced on October 9, 2013. In its preliminary instructions to the jury, the court explained that the trial would involve \"two separate informations\" that had been \"consolidated for purposes of the trial only.\" The court further emphasized that the two informations must be considered separately. That day, the state presented evidence pertaining only to the sexual assault charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   At the start of the second day of trial, the court reminded the jurors that \"there are two separate sets of factors that are being considered, two separate informations\" and that they were \"still receiving information concerning the first set, the allegations of what happened\" at the location where the victim was sexually assaulted. After presenting the testimony of two more witnesses, the state rested in the sexual assault case. The court then reminded the jurors that \"the defendant in this case is charged in two separate informations\" and that \"the state just concluded the evidence on the first information ....\" The court further reiterated that \"[t]he fact that the cases were consolidated for trial does not mean anything other than they were consolidated for trial. It's the same defendant in both. And ... the defendant is entitled to and has to be given separate consideration for each.\" The jury was then excused for a recess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   When court resumed, the court asked the defendant outside the presence of the jury whether he would be testifying \"for the first case.\" The defendant responded\n   that he would not, and the court canvassed the defendant on his election not to testify. The jury then reentered the courtroom, and the defense rested as to the sexual assault case. When the parties were ready to proceed with the escape case, the court reminded the jurors that \"this is a separate count\" and that the evidence being presented related to only the second information. After the state called two judicial marshals as witnesses and had an evidentiary stipulation read to the jury, it rested. The defendant then indicated that he wished to testify concerning the escape case, and the court canvassed the defendant concerning that decision. The defendant did not renew his objection to the consolidation of the cases for trial based on his decision to testify as to the escape charge but not the sexual assault charges. After the defendant testified concerning the escape charge, the defense rested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   On October 11, 2013, the court charged the jury. Throughout the charge, the court emphasized that the trial consisted of two separate informations that had been \"consolidated for the convenience of trial,\" and that \"the defendant is entitled to and must be given ... a separate and independent determination of whether he is guilty or not guilty as to each of the counts.\" Concerning the defendant's decision to testify concerning the escape charge but not the sexual assault charges, the court gave the following instruction: \"There are two separate sets of allegations, the [sexual assault] charges and the [escape] charges. The defendant has not testified in the [sexual assault] case. An accused person has the option to testify or not to testify at the\n   trial. He is under no obligation to testify and he has a constitutional right not to testify. You must draw no unfavorable inferences from the defendant's choice not to testify, that is with reference to the [sexual assault] charges.\"\n   After his conviction, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial based, in part, on the consolidation of the two cases. On December 12, 2013, the court held a hearing on the defendant's motion for a new trial. At that hearing, the defendant argued that the consolidation of the cases \"impacted [his] testimony in a negative way\" because \"there is at least a possibility that one or more of the jurors held it against [him] for not testifying on that second trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \"It long has been recognized that joinder of unrelated criminal charges can cause [substantial] prejudice when it 'embarrasses or confounds an accused in making his defense.' \"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485133\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/654/\">\n    322 Conn. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 134,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485133\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/654/\">\n    139 A.3d 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

The defendant reasoned that the officers' request for consent constituted an \"interrogation\" for the purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   because \"the police should [have known] that asking [the defendant] to sign [the consent to search] form [was] reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the defendant cited the fourth amendment in his motion to suppress,\n   he did not make any substantive arguments that suppression was required under the fourth amendment in that motion or at the evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   On October 8, 2013, the court orally denied the defendant's motion to suppress. On October 9, 2013, the first day of trial, the court memorialized its ruling briefly on the record during a recess. In relevant part, the court stated: \"There was a motion to suppress that was filed by defense counsel and I'd given an oral ruling yesterday that the motion to suppress was denied. There was consent for the apartment search.\" The remainder of the court's brief oral ruling addressed its denial of the motion to suppress with respect to the buccal swab taken from the defendant with his consent. The court concluded its oral ruling by stating: \"I will put this all in writing.\" The court, however, did not issue a written memorandum of decision. After the defendant's convictions, the defendant renewed his original suppression claim in\n   his motion for a new trial, which the court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   On appeal, the defendant now claims that the court violated his rights under the fourth amendment by denying his motion to suppress. Specifically, the defendant claims that the fourth amendment requires law enforcement to provide\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings before obtaining consent to search from an individual that is in custody. Alternatively, the defendant claims that he did not knowingly and voluntarily consent to the search of his apartment. Because the defendant failed to preserve his fourth amendment claim, he seeks\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \"The first\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   requirement is that the record be adequate to review the alleged claim of [constitutional] error ....

That compromise resulted in what legislators referred to as the \"new crime\" of aggravated sexual assault of a minor, which enabled, but did not require, prosecutors to pursue enhanced, mandatory sentences for sexual offenders of children when, in their judgment, the facts and circumstances of the particular case warranted a significant mandatory minimum sentence. Overall, although the legislative history of \u00a7 53a-70c reveals a clear legislative intent to specifically authorize enhanced, mandatory penalties, it does not reveal a clear legislative in tent to specifically authorize cumulative punishments for \u00a7 53a-70c and its predicate offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Section 53a-70c is part of a series of statutes commonly referred to as Jessica's Law.

One of the many initiatives of Jessica's Law is to create higher mandatory penalties for first and second time\n   sexual offenders of children to ensure that they are unable to reach future victims. M. Bell, supra, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Jessica's Law was first proposed in Connecticut in 2006. The original bill proposed amending the sentencing provisions of certain sexual offenses\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   to create high mandatory\n   minimum sentences when the victim was under the age of thirteen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bill did not alter the legal structure of the underlying sexual offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some\n   legislators were concerned, however, that the proposed bill would hamper the plea bargaining process and prosecutors' ability to pursue a lesser offense, and lesser penalties, if the facts and circumstances of the case did not warrant a high mandatory minimum sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, they\n   noted the wide array of sexual offenses encompassed by the bill and the fact that the bill (without qualification) required a high mandatory minimum sentence when the victim was under thirteen years old.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the proponents of the original bill maintained that prosecutors would retain their discretion in charging,\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   the bill was held over to the next legislative session.\n   In 2007, a revised bill was introduced. To address the concerns raised about the original bill, the revised bill consolidated the enhanced penalties for the sexual assault of a child under the age of thirteen into the \"new crime\" of aggravated sexual assault of a minor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite the new nomenclature, the legislature continued to treat this provision as a sentencing enhancement during legislative hearings. In particular, proponents of the bill touted this new crime as a \"tool\" that could be utilized by prosecutors to secure a high mandatory minimum sentence when the facts and circumstances of the case warranted it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   The revised bill was ultimately passed and codified, in relevant part, at \u00a7 53a-70c.\n   It is clear from the legislative history of \u00a7 53a-70c that the legislature wanted to authorize high mandatory minimum sentences for sexual offenders of children.\n   Initially, the legislature sought to obtain this result by amending only the sentencing provisions of each relevant statute. When concerns were raised about the effect of the original bill on prosecutorial discretion and the plea bargaining process, the legislature created the \"new crime\" of aggravated sexual assault of a minor. This new crime was designed to give prosecutors the discretion to charge\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   the greater offense with its high mandatory sentencing provision\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   the lesser offenses with those standard sentencing provisions, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case. It is not clear from this legislative history, however, that the legislature intended to specifically authorize cumulative convictions and sentences for aggravated sexual assault of a minor and the charged predicate offense(s).\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Therefore, on the basis of our examination of the language, structure, and legislative history of \u00a7 53a-70c,\n   we conclude that the state has failed to rebut the presumption created by the\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   test that \u00a7 53a-70c is the same offense as its charged predicate offenses for the purposes of double jeopardy. Accordingly, the defendant's cumulative convictions and sentences for the three sexual offenses violates his right against double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Having determined that the defendant's cumulative convictions and sentences for aggravated sexual assault of a minor, sexual assault in the first degree, and risk of injury to a child violate double jeopardy, we must determine the appropriate remedy. The defendant argues that the court must vacate his convictions and sentences for both lesser offenses, i.e., sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child. The state responds that we should vacate the defendant's conviction and sentence for\n   <em>\n    only one\n   </em>\n   of the lesser offenses because the state charged only one count of aggravated sexual assault when it could have charged two counts (i.e., it could have charged one count for each predicate offense). Therefore, the state reasons that \"vacating both lesser charges would grant the defendant a windfall he is not entitled to,\" namely, fifteen fewer years imprisonment. We are not persuaded that the remedy advocated by the state is available to us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The following facts are relevant to our resolution of this issue. On June 18, 2014, the court imposed a total effective sentence of fifty years imprisonment, thirty years of which were a mandatory minimum, followed by five years of special parole. For the sexual assault information, the court imposed a sentence of forty years imprisonment, thirty years of which were a mandatory minimum, followed by five years of special parole. Specifically, on\n   count one, sexual assault in the first degree, the court sentenced the defendant to twenty years\n   imprisonment, five years of which were a mandatory minimum, followed by five years of special parole, to be served concurrently with count three. On count two, risk of injury to a child, the court sentenced the defendant to fifteen years imprisonment, five of which were a mandatory minimum, to be served consecutively to counts one and three. On count three, aggravated sexual assault of a minor, the court sentenced the defendant to twenty-five years imprisonment, twenty-five of which were a mandatory minimum, to be served concurrently with count one. For the escape information, the court imposed a sentence of ten years imprisonment, to be served consecutively to count two of the sexual assault information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Our Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20242\">\n    308 Conn. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%201084\">\n    61 A.3d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), controls in this circumstance.

Second, it bears repeating that because the two statutory subsections in\n    <em>\n     Wright\n    </em>\n    were factually and legally distinct the burden was on the defendant to rebut the\n    <em>\n     Blockburger\n    </em>\n    presumption.

In this case, the\n    <em>\n     Blockburger\n    </em>\n    presumption is against the state, and the state bears the burden of demonstrating that the legislature clearly intended to specifically authorize cumulative punishments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"49\">\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    See footnote 35 of this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"50\">\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    The state maintains that only one lesser offense should be vacated lest the defendant be granted a \"windfall\" of fifteen fewer years of imprisonment. That is, if the lesser offenses are vacated, the defendant's effective sentence for his convictions under the sexual assault information will be twenty-five years imprisonment, rather than forty years imprisonment. The state's argument is premised on the fact that\n    <em>\n     it could have charged\n    </em>\n    two counts of aggravated sexual assault of a minor-one count alleging sexual assault in the first degree as a predicate offense and one count alleging risk of injury to a child as a predicate offense. The fundamental flaw in the state's argument, however, is that\n    <em>\n     it did not charge\n    </em>\n    the defendant with two counts of aggravated sexual assault of a minor. It charged the defendant with one count of the greater offense and two counts of lesser offenses.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"51\">\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    Resentencing for the defendant's convictions for aggravated sexual assault of a minor and attempt to escape custody is appropriate in the present case because our decision alters the defendant's total effective sentence.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Wade\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088596\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/297/262/#p271\">\n     297 Conn. 262\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 271-72,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=998%20A.2d%201114\">\n     998 A.2d 1114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2010). At sentencing, the court imposed a total effective sentence of fifty years imprisonment, followed by five years of special parole. To achieve the total effective term of imprisonment, the court imposed three consecutive sentences. Specifically, the court ordered that the defendant's sentence for risk of injury to a child (fifteen years imprisonment) be served consecutively to his sentence for aggravated sexual assault of a minor (twenty-five years imprisonment, followed by five years special parole). The court also ordered that the defendant's sentence for attempt to escape (ten years) be served consecutively to his sentence for risk of injury to a child. Therefore, vacatur of the defendant's risk of injury to a child conviction will alter the defendant's total effective sentence by reducing it from fifty years imprisonment to twenty-five years imprisonment. Additionally, the court imposed a term of special parole under the defendant's sexual assault in the first degree conviction. Therefore, vacatur of the defendant's sexual assault in the first degree conviction will eliminate the period of special parole imposed by the original sentencing court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
