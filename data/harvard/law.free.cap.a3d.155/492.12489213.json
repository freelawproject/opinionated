He proceeded to trial before a jury and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty to the charges of first-degree premeditated murder, second-degree specific-intent murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and robbery.

State\n   </em>\n   , which is the foundation and predicate for petitioner's charge for second-degree felony murder based on first-degree assault. Inasmuch as petitioner was acquitted in his jury trial of first-degree intentional murder, and second-degree intent to inflict serious harm murder, the only basis remaining for the State to proceed in a second prosecution was on second-degree felony murder based upon first-degree assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We adopt the facts as set out by the Court of Special Appeals, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Shortly before midnight on August 20, 2010, Julian Kelly was beaten, robbed, and shot by a group of men while on his way home from work. This criminal episode began when, according to witnesses, Kelly was surrounded by 'maybe ... five' men who began 'kicking and punching' him, upon his refusal to surrender his backpack and necklace. After he was knocked to the ground, one of Kelly's assailants stood over him and shot him five times, three times in the torso and twice in the head, wounds from which Kelly died several weeks later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Identified as one of Kelly's assailants, Jones was tried before a jury, in the Montgomery County circuit court, for his purported participation in Kelly's robbery and murder. At trial, the State advanced two different theories of the role Jones played in the perpetration of those crimes. The first theory alleged that Jones, although not a participant in the robbery and the beating, shot Kelly after mistaking him for someone else. The second suggested that Jones had, in fact, participated in both the robbery and the beating and had shot Kelly when Kelly had refused to relinquish his belongings. In response, Jones, who did not testify at trial, attempted to establish through the testimony of several witnesses that he had merely been a bystander to the incident and that it had been one of Kelly's assailants, not he, who had fired the fatal shots.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   At the close of evidence, the court instructed the jury on first-degree murder, first-degree felony murder, second-degree murder with the\n   <em>\n    intent to inflict serious bodily harm\n   </em>\n   , armed robbery, robbery, and the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence. With respect to first-degree felony murder, the court instructed the jury that, in order to convict Jones of that offense, it must find that Jones murdered Kelly 'during the commission' of an underlying felony and that, here, the underlying felony could have been either armed robbery, robbery, or assault in the first degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Section 2-201(a)(4) of the Criminal Law Article states that a murder 'is in the first degree' if it is 'committed in the perpetration of or an attempt to perpetrate' a number of enumerated felonies. Although robbery and armed robbery, two of the three offenses the court below included in its instructions, could underlie a finding of first-degree felony murder, first-degree assault cannot. Thus, both Jones and the State agree that that portion of the circuit court's instructions was an incorrect statement of the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The jury found Jones not guilty of first-degree murder, second-degree murder\n   <em>\n    with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm\n   </em>\n   , robbery, and armed robbery. But, as previously\n   noted, it was unable to reach a verdict on the charges of first-degree felony murder and the use of a\n   handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence. When Jones moved for a mistrial with respect to those charges, the court granted that motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The State then informed Jones of its intention to retry him on the two verdictless counts, that is, first-degree felony murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence. Jones responded by moving for a judgment of acquittal as to the first-degree felony murder charge, asserting that, since first-degree assault was not a 'predicate felony' for a charge of first-degree felony murder, his acquittal on the charges of robbery and armed robbery meant that there was no felony that could serve as the underlying offense for the charge of first-degree felony murder. While conceding in its opposition to Jones's motion that it could not retry Jones on first-degree felony murder, the State insisted that it could retry him on the charge of second-degree felony murder\n   <em>\n    based on first-degree assault\n   </em>\n   because, though first-degree assault is not an underlying felony for a charge of first-degree felony murder, it can serve as an underlying felony for a charge of second-degree felony murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   After the court, at the hearing that ensued on Jones's motion, granted a judgment of acquittal as to first-degree felony murder, it turned to the State's request to retry Jones on the charge of second-degree felony murder based on\n   <em>\n    first-degree assault\n   </em>\n   . Jones asserted that the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy barred the State from proceeding on such a charge. The circuit court, however, flatly rejected that claim. It stated that second-degree felony murder based on first-degree assault was a 'viable' charge as it arose 'out of the facts of this case' and because Jones had 'not been acquitted' of it or of the underlying offense of first-degree assault. Consequently, the court declared that 'double jeopardy would not bar the prosecution' of Jones on the charge of second-degree felony murder\n   <em>\n    based on first-degree assault\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183778\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/222/600/#p619\">\n    222 Md.App. at 605-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183778\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/222/600/#p619\">\n    114 A.3d at 259-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal footnotes omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We address first the State's jurisdictional argument presented in its supplemental brief, asserting that this Court does not have jurisdiction to reconsider\n   <em>\n    Roary v. State\n   </em>\n   in this case because this appeal comes before the Court pursuant to the collateral order doctrine as an interlocutory appeal. As such, the State argues, we are restricted narrowly in considering that Order, which does not include re-considering\n   <em>\n    Roary v\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   , and that a question outside of our interlocutory jurisdiction cannot be appended to one that is within the Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Respondent argues that this Court has jurisdiction to reconsider\n   <em>\n    Roary v. State\n   </em>\n   because the question of whether second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault is a cognizable crime in\n   Maryland underlies-and its abrogation would solve-the double jeopardy question\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   . In other words, the double jeopardy issues in this case exist because\n   <em>\n    Roary v. State\n   </em>\n   created them; whether assault with a firearm can serve as a predicate for second-degree felony murder is an issue of first impression; the question of whether to overrule\n   <em>\n    Roary v. State\n   </em>\n   is integral to the double jeopardy question; and its abrogation would resolve the double jeopardy issues that conferred jurisdiction in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We hold that this Court has jurisdiction to decide the issue embodied in the supplemental question raised by the Court: Should this Court reconsider the holding in\n   <em>\n    Roary v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ?\n   </em>\n   This Court has fundamental jurisdiction to overrule a prior decision of the Court, and has the\n   <em>\n    inherent authority\n   </em>\n   to consider an issue that is inextricably intertwined to the issue before it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wynn v.

The notion that a court is powerless to correct a prior legal principle and must decide a case based upon a principle it disagrees with is inconsistent with the inherent power the court possesses to review and to correct prior analyses as well as the development of the common law. The common law method is subject to judicial reappraisal and modification. Overruling a prior decision of this Court is likewise inherent in the common law method that is open to reappraisal.

'\n   <em>\n    The inherent power of the court is the power to protect itself; the power to administer justice ...; the power to promulgate rules for its practice; and the power to provide process where none exists.

Here, as noted, the issue we must decide is inextricably intertwined with the double jeopardy issue. The question of whether assault in the first-degree may serve as a predicate for second-degree felony murder as a cognizable crime is an integral part of the double jeopardy question before us. Petitioner's right to challenge the State's right to try him against being twice put to trial for the same offense includes inherent consideration of whether the offense alleged is one which could support the felony murder charge, particularly whether first-degree assault with a firearm may serve as a predicate for second-degree felony murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Both certiorari questions are predicated upon this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Roary v.

The California Supreme Court explained later the development of the \"merger doctrine\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"Prior to our decision in Ireland, the 'merger' doctrine had been developed in other jurisdictions as a shorthand explanation for the conclusion that the felony-murder rule should not be applied in circumstances where the only underlying\n   (or 'predicate') felony committed by the defendant was\n   <em>\n    assault\n   </em>\n   . The name of the doctrine derived from the characterization of the assault as an offense that 'merged' with the resulting homicide. In explaining the basis for the merger doctrine, courts and legal commentators reasoned that, because a homicide generally results from the commission of an assault, every felonious assault ending in death automatically would be elevated to murder in the event a felonious assault could serve as the predicate felony for purposes of the felony-murder doctrine. Consequently, application of the felony-murder rule to felonious assaults would usurp most of the law of homicide, relieve the prosecution in the great majority of homicide cases of the burden of having to prove malice in order to obtain a murder conviction, and thereby frustrate the Legislature's intent to punish certain felonious assaults resulting in death (those committed with malice aforethought, and therefore punishable as murder) more harshly than other felonious assaults that happened to result\n   in death (those committed without malice aforethought, and therefore punishable as manslaughter).

Shortly after\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   was announced by this Court, the decision was criticized strongly in the Maryland Law Review. Marcia J. Simon pointed out the flaws and errors in the Court's reasoning, noting as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   \"In reaching its decision, the court rejected the merger doctrine, which precludes felonious assault as a predicate for felony murder. Instead, the court mistakenly relied on a deterrence rationale that emphasized conduct rather than intent. The court's deterrence justification was flawed, however, because it\n   incorrectly presumed that rejecting the merger doctrine would deter dangerous assaults. Moreover, by focusing on conduct rather than intent, the court failed to consider individual culpability and proportionality, two cornerstones of modern criminal law. This misguided approach renders the statutory punishment scheme for homicide largely ineffective and will, as it did in\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   , lead to illogical, disproportionate punishments. Finally, the court's decision to allow assault as a predicate to felony murder permits prosecutors to circumvent the requirement to prove intent to kill and subsumes much of Maryland's second-degree murder and manslaughter law into felony murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   The court should have instead followed the lead of a number of other states and adopted the merger doctrine to preclude assault as a predicate for felony murder. In doing so, the court would have imposed a reasonable limitation on the\n   felony-murder doctrine while preserving an appropriate punishment scheme for homicide in Maryland.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 992-93 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As we have noted, second-degree felony murder is an unlawful killing in the course of the commission of a felony that is inherently dangerous to human life but is not included among the felonies enumerated in \u00a7 2-201.

In\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   , we noted that \"\n   <em>\n    in order to ameliorate the harshness of the strict common law felony murder doctrine, many jurisdictions limit the predicate felonies to those that are dangerous to human life\n   </em>\n   \" 367 Md. at 254, 786 A.2d at 727. In order to maintain the integrity of the different levels of culpability of murder and manslaughter and to ameliorate its perceived harshness, today we adopt the \"merger doctrine\" and we hold that first-degree assault that results in the victim's death merges with the homicide and therefore cannot serve as an underlying felony for the purposes of the felony murder rule.\n   <em>\n    Roary v.

The State contends that this Court lacks jurisdiction to overrule\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   because the collateral-order doctrine does not permit an appeal for failure to state an offense prior to final judgment in a case. The State explains that, if Jones had moved to dismiss in the circuit court on the ground that second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault was not a crime-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , if Jones had moved to dismiss for failure to state an offense-then the issue of overruling\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   would not be \"collateral\"; instead, the issue would go to the heart of guilt or innocence. In other words, the State asserts that the collateral-order doctrine is inapplicable because the denial of a motion to dismiss on such a ground-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the allegation that\n   the Indictment failed to properly charge an offense-is reviewable only after a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Jones counters that this Court has jurisdiction to reconsider\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   because according to Jones,\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   is the cause of the double jeopardy issue in this case, and overruling\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   would resolve this case's double jeopardy issues. Both parties appear to agree that the appeal on the double jeopardy issue arose under the collateral-order doctrine. Simply put, with respect to the issue of Court's jurisdiction to overrule\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   , I agree with the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Pursuant to Md.

It would be wrong to hold otherwise. When a court decides a double jeopardy issue, the court decides whether two crimes are \"the same offense\" for purposes of double jeopardy. The court does not inquire as to whether one of those crimes is actually a crime in the first place. To the contrary, a double jeopardy analysis presumes that the two crimes are, indeed, crimes. If there is a challenge to the existence or propriety of one crime, that challenge does not constitute a double jeopardy issue. Indeed, a\n   double jeopardy issue like the instant one can arise only if the State charges the defendant with at least two crimes and engages in at least two consecutive prosecutions. By contrast, a defendant's claim that there is no such thing as a particular crime can arise even if the State charges the defendant with only one crime in only one prosecution. The double jeopardy issue clearly does not encompass the question of whether second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault is actually a crime or whether\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   should be overruled.\n   In short, the two questions are distinct. To use algebraic terms, the question of \"Are X and Y the same?\" does not encompass the question of \"Does X exist?\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the first question does not include the second question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In this case, the double jeopardy question is: \"Is second-degree specific-intent murder the same offense as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault?\" The\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   question is: \"Is there such a crime as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault?\" The double jeopardy question asks whether Jones should be tried again for the same offense; the\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   question does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   It would be incorrect to hold that the double jeopardy question depends on the answer to the\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   question. Assuming hypothetically, purely for argument's sake, that\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided, and that there is no such crime as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault, then the result is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   that double jeopardy bars a new trial of Jones on that charge. Indeed, the reason why a new trial would not occur in that circumstance has nothing to do with double jeopardy; the reason is not that Jones has already been acquitted of a crime, but instead that the offense in question is not a crime at all, and thus could be neither properly charged nor the subject of any trial-whether it is Jones's first trial, second trial, or whichever number trial. In other words, the outcome of the\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   question has nothing to do with double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Although the motion to dismiss would not have satisfied the collateral-order doctrine if it had been based on the\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   issue, the reality is that the motion to dismiss was, in fact, based on the double jeopardy issue; thus, the circuit court's denial of the motion to dismiss satisfied the collateral-order doctrine. Accordingly, the issue becomes: May this Court, on its own initiative, append the\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   issue to a properly-taken appeal, where that issue could not have been the subject of a properly-taken appeal?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The State is correct in advocating that\n   <em>\n    Rush v.

Specifically, Judge Raker stated that she \"agree[d] with the State that [the defendant could ]not appeal the [trial c]ourt's finding that portions of her statement were voluntary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688906\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/403/68/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688906\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/403/68/\">\n    at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688906\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/403/68/\">\n    939 A.2d at 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Raker, J., concurring and dissenting). Judge Raker explained: \"The ruling was interlocutory, and because there exists no statute or right to appeal such an order, her claim may be raised in an appeal from a final judgment, and not within the State's appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688906\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/403/68/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688906\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/403/68/\">\n    at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688906\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/403/68/\">\n    939 A.2d at 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Raker, J., concurring and dissenting). In other words, contrary to the position taken in this case, Judge Raker would not have permitted the appending of the issue of voluntariness to the State's appeal of a trial court's grant of the motion to suppress on the basis of a failure to comply with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    R ush\n   </em>\n   provides no support for the idea that this Court may address the\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   issue in this appeal. In\n   <em>\n    Rush\n   </em>\n   , the defendant moved to suppress on two grounds, and the trial court granted the motion to suppress on one of those grounds. The State was empowered by statute-specifically, what is now CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4) -to appeal the trial court's grant of the motion to suppress. Significantly, this Court held that the defendant was entitled to argue in favor of upholding the trial court's grant of the motion to suppress on both of the grounds that the defendant raised in the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   This appeal is vastly different. Here, Jones moved to dismiss the charge for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault on the ground of double jeopardy. Jones did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   , in the motion to dismiss, contend that there is no such crime as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault. In other words, Jones did not raise the\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   issue in the motion to dismiss. The circuit court denied the motion to dismiss, and Jones appealed. Jones was empowered by the collateral-order doctrine to appeal the circuit\n   court's denial of the motion to dismiss only because the motion to dismiss was based on double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The distinction between the double jeopardy issue and the\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   issue is crucial, and materially distinguishes this appeal from\n   <em>\n    Rush\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Rush\n   </em>\n   , regardless of whether the trial court granted the motion to suppress on the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   issue, the voluntariness issue, or both, the State would have had a right to appeal the trial court's grant of the motion to suppress. By contrast, here, Jones had a right to appeal the trial court's denial of the motion to dismissed only because Jones moved dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy. If Jones had raised only the\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   issue in the motion to dismiss-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , simply argued that there is no such crime as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault-then Jones would have lacked a right to appeal, because the circuit court's denial of the motion to suppress would not have satisfied the collateral-order doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Also significant is the fact that, in\n   <em>\n    Rush\n   </em>\n   , this Court concluded that the defendant-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the appellee, the non-appealing party, in whose favor the trial court ruled-was entitled to argue in favor of\n   <strong>\n    upholding\n   </strong>\n   the trial court's grant of the motion to suppress on both of the grounds that the defendant raised in the motion to suppress. By contrast, here, Jones is the appellant-the appealing party, whose motion to dismiss the circuit court denied. In contrast to the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Rush\n   </em>\n   , Jones is not seeking to uphold a trial court's ruling. To the contrary, Jones seeks\n   <strong>\n    reversal\n   </strong>\n   of the circuit court's denial of the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The reason why this fact is important is demonstrated by the following quotation in\n   <em>\n    Rush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688906\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/403/68/\">\n    403 Md. at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688906\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/403/68/\">\n    939 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   709 : \"[A] reviewing court may\n   <strong>\n    uphold\n   </strong>\n   the final judgment of a lower court on any ground adequately shown by the record[.]\" (Emphasis added) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

The quotation from\n   <em>\n    Rush\n   </em>\n   is conspicuously silent on whether an appellate court may reverse a trial court's ruling on any ground that the record shows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   This is appropriate, given that, generally, appellate courts consider whether to reverse a trial court's ruling only on the grounds that are raised by the appealing party-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the party who is aggrieved by the trial court's ruling. Appellate courts do not comb the record, looking for grounds for reversal that the appellant did not raise. Or, as Judge Charles E.

As discussed above, appellate jurisdiction is not automatic; it must arise from one of the four specific bases for appealability, such as the collateral-order doctrine. Jones provides no case law, and I know of none, that stands for the proposition that, where Issue A is properly before an appellate court, the appellate court may consider a different legal question, Issue B, solely by virtue of the circumstance that resolving Issue B in a certain way would render Issue A moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Even more troubling is the circumstance that this Court, not Jones, raised the\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   issue by\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   ordering the parties to brief it.

Jones is absolutely correct in conceding that\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   was not clearly wrong.

The other theories of second-degree murder already cover what\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   proscribes.\" This argument is circular-and, indeed, meaningless-because it is premised on the assumption that Jones is correct about the ultimate issue before the Court-whether second-degree specific-intent murder and second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault are the same offense. If, in fact, second-degree specific-intent murder and second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault are different offenses-and they are, because, as discussed below, our precedent establishes that \"substantial risk of death\" is not synonymous with death being \"the likely result\"-then the State is losing the ability to prosecute defendants for deaths that arise from conduct that does not rise to the level of second-degree specific-intent murder. For example, a defendant may use a knife to stab a victim in the toe, and the victim may bleed to death as a result of the wound. Under such circumstances, it could be argued that the defendant did not commit second-degree specific-intent murder because: (1) the defendant did not intend to kill the victim; and (2) death is not \"the likely result\" of stabbing someone in the toe, which does not contain a vital organ. Certainly, however, the defendant committed second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury, as the defendant created a substantial and foreseeable-but not necessarily likely or very probable-risk of death. Thus, contrary to Jones's assertion, the State does \"lose\" the ability to obtain convictions for certain violent assaults resulting in death by virtue of overruling\n   <em>\n    Roary\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The Majority spends much time discussing cases in which courts in other jurisdictions have adopted the \"merger\" doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj.

The mental state that is required for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury is subsumed by second-degree specific-intent murder's unique element of intent to kill or inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result. In short, second-degree specific-intent murder has all of the elements of first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury, plus a unique element: intent to kill or inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result.

If there is a substantial risk of death, then the risk of death is merely \"considerable\"-not necessarily \"likely\" or \"very probable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   As explained earlier, the following hypothetical illustrates how there can be a \"substantial risk of death\" even though death is not \"the likely result.\" A defendant wants to severely injure a victim without killing the victim. In other words, the defendant intends to cause a serious, but non-life-threatening, injury to the victim. Accordingly, the defendant uses a knife to stab the victim in the toe. The victim bleeds to death as a result of the wound. Under such circumstances, it could be argued that the defendant did not commit second-degree specific-intent murder because: (1) the defendant did not intend to kill the victim; and (2) death is not \"the likely result\" of stabbing someone in the toe, which does not contain a vital organ.

To convict the defendant of second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm, the State must prove that: (1) the defendant committed a first-degree assault with a firearm; (2) the way in which the first-degree assault with a firearm was committed, under all of the circumstances, created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death; (3) the defendant killed the victim; and (4) the act that resulted in the victim's death occurred during the first-degree assault with a firearm. To convict the defendant of first-degree assault with a firearm, the State must prove that: (1) the defendant used a firearm to cause physical harm to the victim; (2) the physical harm was the result of an intentional or reckless act of the defendant and was not accidental; and (3) the physical harm was not consented to by the victim or legally justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   As the Court of Special Appeals did, I would determine that the way in which the first-degree assault with a firearm was committed in this case, under all of the circumstances, created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death. Indeed, as the Court of Special Appeals concluded: \"[A] first-degree assault is committed in a manner that is 'dangerous to life' and 'made death a foreseeable consequence' when it is committed by using a firearm to shoot the victim multiple times, including twice in the head.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183778\" index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/222/600/#p619\">\n    222 Md.App. at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183778\" index=\"365\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/222/600/#p619\">\n    114 A.3d at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Nonetheless, that is not the end of the inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Comparing the elements of second-degree specific-intent murder to the elements of second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm yields the unavoidable\n   determination that second-degree specific-intent murder has the unique element of intent to kill or inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result, and second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm has the unique element of use of a firearm. And, second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm does not have the same intent element as second-degree specific-intent murder, as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm does not require that the defendant intend to cause a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death, but rather requires that the way in which the first-degree assault with a firearm was committed, under all of the circumstances, created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   In other words, the reasonable foreseeable risk of death is an element that depends on the way in which the first-degree assault with a firearm was committed, under all of the circumstances; the defendant need not have intended to create a reasonable foreseeable risk of death, or, as is required for second-degree specific-intent murder, intended \"to kill or ... inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result[.]\" MPJI-Cr 4:17(B). Second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm, while encompassing the element that the use of the firearm created a reasonably foreseeable\n   risk of death, does not require that the defendant have had the requisite intent for second-degree specific-intent murder, and includes the unique element that the offense be committed with a firearm. Thus, second-degree specific-intent murder and second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm do not have the same elements and are not the same offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <strong>\n    Double Jeopardy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   I would conclude that, if a jury acquits a defendant of second-degree specific-intent murder and hangs on first-degree felony murder, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the State from prosecuting the defendant for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   In sum, the State prosecuting Jones for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury does not implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause because that form of murder is a lesser-included offense of second-degree specific-intent murder; in other words, here, the jury acquitted on a greater-inclusive offense (namely, second-degree specific-intent murder) and hung on a lesser-included offense (namely, second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury). And, the State prosecuting Jones for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm does not implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause because its elements are not the same as those of second-degree specific intent murder. For the reasons above, I would conclude that the State may prosecute Jones for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   For the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Judge Greene and Judge Battaglia have authorized me to state that they join in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    <em>\n     Doe v.
