On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly dismissed his habeas petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the petitioner was not in the custody of the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, on the challenged conviction when he filed his petition, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-466. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Our review of the record reveals the following facts and procedural history. On November 13, 2002, the petitioner was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent and received a sentence of eight years incarceration and five years special parole (Ansonia conviction). See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Foote\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3944633\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/85/356/#p360\">\n    85 Conn.App. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=857%20A.2d%20406\">\n    857 A.2d 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (affirming petitioner's conviction), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5708296,5708017,5706952\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/273/937/\">\n    273 Conn. 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=875%20A.2d%2043\">\n    875 A.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 44 (2005). Thereafter, the special parole portion of his sentence was reduced to three and one-half years. On July 21, 2010, while he was on parole on the Ansonia conviction, the petitioner was arrested for participating in a narcotics sale. On September 14, 2010, in connection with this incident, the petitioner pleaded guilty under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to conspiracy to sell narcotics. He received a sentence of two years incarceration (Waterbury conviction), to run concurrently with his existing sentence on the Ansonia conviction. After the petitioner was sentenced, he was informed by the Department of Correction that the unexpired portion of his special parole on the Ansonia conviction would not begin to run until after the petitioner completed his sentence on the Waterbury conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 3, 2013, after completing the sentence on the Waterbury conviction, but before completing the sentence on the Ansonia conviction, the petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the Waterbury conviction. An amended petition was filed on May 19, 2014. On May 23, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that the petitioner was not in custody on the Waterbury conviction at the time that he filed the petition. On July 2, 2014, the petitioner filed an objection, arguing that, although the Waterbury conviction had expired at the time of the petition, the court had jurisdiction pursuant to the custody exception as expressed in\n   <em>\n    Garlotte\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fordice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563888\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/39/\">\n    515 U.S. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563888\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/39/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563888\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/39/\">\n    132 L.Ed.2d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995).

The habeas court issued a memorandum of decision on September 17, 2014, granting the respondent's motion to dismiss. The habeas court held that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the petitioner's habeas petition because he was not in custody on the Waterbury conviction when he filed his petition, and the\n   <em>\n    Garlotte\n   </em>\n   custody exception did not apply. The habeas court subsequently granted the petitioner's petition for certification to appeal, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improperly dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he was not in the custody of the respondent on the challenged Waterbury conviction when he filed his petition, as required by \u00a7 52-466.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, he claims that, although the trial court gave the petitioner a concurrent sentence on the Waterbury conviction, it became a consecutive sentence in practice because the unexpired portion of his special parole on the Ansonia conviction did not begin to run until after he finished his sentence on the Waterbury conviction. Moreover, the petitioner claims that he is actually challenging how the sentence on the Waterbury conviction affected the sentence on the Ansonia conviction, and that he should have been allowed to amend the petition to include a challenge to the Ansonia conviction. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To resolve the petitioner's claim, we begin by setting forth our standard of review and the relevant legal principles. \"We have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary. ... Moreover, [i]t is a fundamental rule that a court may raise and review the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time. ...

In the present case, the petitioner did not file a request to amend the petition to include a challenge to the Ansonia sentence. As it is not the court's obligation to amend pleadings sua sponte, the habeas court was not required to save the petition from dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <em>\n     North Carolina\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Alford\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/#p37\">\n     400 U.S. 25\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 37,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/#p37\">\n     91 S.Ct. 160\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/#p37\">\n     27 L.Ed.2d 162\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1970).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    At oral argument before this court, counsel for the petitioner conceded that the outcome of this appeal would not affect the petitioner, but argued that his claim fell under the mootness exception of capable of repetition, yet evading review.

[t]he mootness doctrine does not preclude a court from addressing an issue that is capable of repetition, yet evading review\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Mootness, however, was not briefed, and, in his oral argument, counsel for the respondent indicated that the petitioner's claim is not moot because, should the petitioner prevail on appeal, he could argue the merits of the Waterbury conviction and potentially could have the conviction removed from his record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 52-466 (a) (1) provides in relevant part: \"[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus ... shall be made to the superior court ... for the judicial district in which the person whose custody is in question is claimed to be illegally confined or deprived of such person's liberty.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Although sentenced on September 14, 2010, the defendant was credited with the time he served between his arrest on July 21, 2010, and his sentencing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    In both his brief and at oral argument, the respondent argued that the petitioner did not meet the second prong of\n    <em>\n     Garlotte\n    </em>\n    , which requires that the petitioner show that the expired sentence had an appreciable effect on the current sentence.\n    <em>\n     Garlotte\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Fordice\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563888\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/39/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563888\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/39/\">\n     515 U.S. at 47\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563888\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/39/\">\n     115 S.Ct. 1948\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The petitioner, however, failed to meet the first prong, requiring that the petitioner be serving consecutive sentences.
