Jakle, administrator of the estate of Kathleen Mullin, appeals an order of the Circuit Court\n   (\n   <em>\n    Quigley\n   </em>\n   , J.) denying her motion for declaratory judgment. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The pertinent facts are as follows. The decedent, Kathleen Mullin, a resident of Hancock, New Hampshire, died intestate on November 26, 2014. Her heirs at law are her three siblings: Michael Mullin, J. Stanley Mullin, Jr., and the appellant. All of the heirs at law are California residents, as is the appellee Laura Bushley. From 2008 until her death, the decedent lived in Hancock and owned real property there valued at $235,000. She also owned real property in California, where she had lived for many years prior to 2008, as well as personal property valued at $2,531,164 at the time of her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although the decedent did not have a will, in 2012, while in California, she executed a trust document (Trust) that had been drafted by a California attorney. Schedule A of the Trust lists as Trust property some of the decedent's personal property and all of her real property. She also executed an \"Assignment of Property to Trust\" (Assignment) that purported to transfer to the Trust all of her real property and some of her personal property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trust contains the following choice of law provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The laws of the State of California in force from time to time shall govern the validity, construction, and administration of this Trust, except that all matters relating to real property shall be governed by the laws of the situs of that real property. This article shall apply regardless of any change of residence of the Trustee or any beneficiary, or the appointment or substitution of a Trustee residing or doing business in another state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to her death, the decedent was the beneficiary of the Trust. The terms of the Trust provide that, upon the decedent's death, approximately 88 percent of the Trust property is to be distributed to charitable organizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Laura Bushley, the appellee, is trustee of the Trust. After the decedent's death, the appellee became administrator of the Trust. That same month, the appellee filed in the circuit court a petition for estate administration, which was subsequently granted. In May 2015, the appellee resigned as estate administrator and the appellant was appointed as the successor administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In July, the appellant filed an Inventory of Fiduciary listing the decedent's estate as consisting of approximately $2.5 million worth of real estate and personal property. In August, the appellee filed an objection to the Inventory, claiming that it listed property that was owned by the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In October, the appellee commenced an action in the California Superior Court. Titled a \"Petition for Order Transferring Title to Real and Personal Property to Living Trust\" (Petition), it referenced the ongoing probate proceedings in New Hampshire, but asserted that, under California law, the Assignment was sufficient to transfer the decedent's property to the Trust. The appellee also asserted in the\n   petition that the California court \"has authority and general subject matter jurisdiction over the decedent's property\" and \"the power to resolve claims over title\" to the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the appellant filed a motion for declaratory judgment in the circuit court to determine title to the decedent's property. In the motion, the appellant requested that the court declare: (1) that it had \"exclusive jurisdiction to determine all claims to the title of property listed on the Inventory\"; (2) that the \"situs of the property listed on the Inventory is New Hampshire\"; and (3) that both \"legal and equitable title to the property ... was held by Kathleen Mullin at the time of her death.\" The appellee objected to the motion, arguing, among other things, that a declaratory judgment could be rendered only after the filing of an equity petition, the completion of discovery, and the presentation of evidence. The appellee also argued that the validity of the decedent's transfers to the Trust should be determined \"by a court in California, under California law,\" with the exception of the transfer of the New Hampshire real estate, which the appellee acknowledged could be decided by the California court under New Hampshire law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The circuit court denied the appellant's motion, ruling: (1) that the court was \"unable to make a ruling on the requests of the [appellant] regarding the legal and equitable title to the property or to declare that the situs of the property ... is New Hampshire without appropriate testimony and evidence\"; (2) that jurisdiction over the Trust was \"properly before\" the California court, and that California law must apply except with respect to the New Hampshire real estate; and (3) that the California court was \"a more convenient forum\" to hear the matter because \"[e]vidence and witnesses would more easily be available\" there, the decedent \"lived in California for many years and utilized services of a California attorney and California financial advisor,\" the Trust \"was drafted in California,\" and the \"trustee and all three heirs-at-law, including the [appellant], are residents of California.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, the appellant argues that the circuit court erred by ruling that the courts of New Hampshire do not have exclusive jurisdiction to consider claims regarding the property of the decedent, who was domiciled in New Hampshire at the time of her death. Next, the appellant challenges the circuit court's ruling that the choice of law provision in the Trust dictates that California law governs claims to the decedent's New Hampshire personal property. Finally, the appellant contends that the court erroneously concluded that California is a more convenient forum for adjudicating the claims over the decedent's property. We address these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The appellant first asserts that the circuit court erred by \"refusing to declare that [it] has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the underlying dispute\"; namely, the validity of the purported\n   <em>\n    inter vivos\n   </em>\n   transfer of the decedent's property to the Trust. The appellant argues that the circuit court had \"exclusive\"\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over the decedent's New Hampshire assets because those assets were either located in the state, or were the personal property of a deceased New Hampshire resident. The appellant argues that, by ruling that it did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the decedent's assets, the court acted contrary to over 150 years of precedent and New\n   Hampshire's strong public policy in favor of the expeditious settlement of the estates of its residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On issues related to the circuit court's jurisdiction, we apply a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review.\n   <em>\n    See Attorney General, Dir. of Charitable Trusts v.

That New Hampshire possesses jurisdiction to probate the decedent's estate does not mean that jurisdiction is necessarily exclusive, nor does it\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   the court to exercise its jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the contrary, a court may decline to exercise jurisdiction for a variety of reasons.\n   <em>\n    See Bartlett v. Dumaine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4411349\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/128/497/#p516\">\n    128 N.H. 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 516-18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20A.2d%201\">\n    523 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). For instance, another court with concurrent\n   jurisdiction may be a more convenient forum to decide the particular matter, or proceedings pertaining to the same matter may be pending in another state.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; George G. Bogert\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    The Law of Trusts and Trustees\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 294, at 244 (2d ed. rev. 1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the instant case, both considerations are present. Although we acknowledge that New Hampshire has a strong public policy in favor of the expeditious settlement of the estates of its residents, as the appellant asserts, we have held that there is an \"equally strong policy favoring the orderly administration of trusts.\"\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4411349\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/128/497/#p516\">\n    128 N.H. at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20A.2d%201\">\n    523 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a New Hampshire court should have declined jurisdiction over a petition regarding a trust with connections to both Massachusetts and New Hampshire). We note that, contrary to the appellant's suggestion, the circuit court did not rule that it was not the proper forum to probate the decedent's estate. Rather, we interpret the court's order as ruling merely that the California court has jurisdiction to decide what, if any, property of the decedent had been properly transferred to the Trust; once that determination has been made, the circuit court could\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   exercise its jurisdiction to probate whatever property of the decedent remained in her estate. Under the circumstances presented here, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in concluding that the California court had jurisdiction to determine what property belonged to the Trust and in not proceeding with the probate of the decedent's estate until after that determination has been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The appellant next contends that the circuit court erred by relying solely upon a choice of law provision found in the Trust, which she argues is irrelevant because the phrase \"validity, construction, and administration of [the] Trust\" in the Trust's choice of law provision does not apply to the \"question of the validity and effectiveness of a transfer of property to the Trust.\" Rather, the appellant argues, the court should have based its decision on \"various factual considerations, including the situs of the property, the [d]ecedent's place of residence, the [d]ecedent's intention, and contacts with and the competing interests of the competing forums.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we note that in the absence of specification of the law of California, by which the rights of the parties are governed, we may apply the law of the forum on the assumption that the law of California is the same as that here in force.\n   <em>\n    See Garapedian, Inc. v.

There is no reason for not applying this same principle to the\n   <em>\n    inter vivos\n   </em>\n   trust at issue here. The terms of the Trust state explicitly that the \"law of the State of California ... shall govern the validity, construction, and administration of this Trust, except that all matters relating to real property shall be governed by the laws of the situs of that real property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The appellant argues that the words \"validity,\" \"construction,\" and \"administration\" refer to the \"internal affairs\" of the Trust only, and do not govern the present case, which she characterizes as a dispute involving a \"third party\"-the decedent's estate-rather than the Trust's \"internal affairs.\" The appellant cites no authority, and we are aware of none, that supports her interpretation. On the contrary, we conclude that the term \"validity\" can encompass questions relating to whether the documents creating a trust were executed in accordance with the formalities required by the applicable jurisdiction, whether a transfer of property to a trust created in another state is valid, and whether a trust violates state property rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bogert\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 293, at 253-54. This dispute turns upon the validity of the decedent's\n   <em>\n    inter vivos\n   </em>\n   transfers to her own Trust, and specifically whether those transfers conform to the requirements established by the relevant statutes of New Hampshire and California. Thus, the choice of law provision in the Trust is controlling, and we uphold the circuit court's decision implementing the decedent's intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The appellant's final contention is that the circuit court erred in its\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis by considering only the \"location of the witnesses and whether the law of another jurisdiction may apply\" when it should have also considered \"a host of other factors.\" The appellant argues that the presence of witnesses in California was more than outweighed by the various public interests of New Hampshire, thereby rendering the circuit court's analysis incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"The dismissal of a case due to\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   is generally within the discretion of the [circuit] court.\"\n   <em>\n    Stankunas v.
