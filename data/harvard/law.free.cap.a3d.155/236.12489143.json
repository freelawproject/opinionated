We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the early morning hours of March 18, 2011, Patricia Beverly was pulling into the driveway of a pool hall in Stamford when her vehicle was struck by another vehicle. Beverly exited her car to confront the other driver, but the other driver drove off. The defendant, who was friends with the driver whose vehicle had struck Beverly's vehicle, pulled into the pool hall a couple of minutes later. The defendant was heavily intoxicated,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was illegally in possession of a loaded nine millimeter semiautomatic pistol without a permit. Prior to getting out of his car, the defendant cocked his gun, not noticing that there was already a cartridge in the chamber,\n   which caused the gun to jam and become temporarily inoperable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At some point after exiting his car, the defendant began \"waving\" his gun around and then aimed the gun at Beverly. Beverly retreated around the corner of the building and called 911. After learning that someone had called the police,\n   the defendant put his gun back into his waistband and called a friend to obtain a ride before the police arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer William Garay of the Stamford Police Department responded to the scene and spotted the defendant walking down a nearby street while talking on his cell phone. Recognizing that the defendant fit the description of the person who reportedly was waving a gun, Garay exited his marked police cruiser near where the defendant was walking, shined a spotlight on the defendant, and instructed the defendant to show his hands. The defendant recognized Garay as a police officer but, because he was carrying an illegal firearm, ignored Garay's commands and continued walking. Garay drew his gun, aimed it at the defendant, and ordered him to stop and show his hands. The defendant again ignored Garay and kept walking. Garay began advancing toward the defendant with his gun drawn and shouted for the defendant to get on the ground. The defendant then broke into a run, and Garay chased after him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At some point during the chase, Officer Luis Vidal of the Stamford Police Department arrived on the scene and attempted to block the defendant's path of escape by driving his cruiser onto the sidewalk at an angle in front of where the defendant was running. Garay, who was positioned behind and to the left of the defendant, could not see the defendant's right hand as he ran, which was \"somewhere in his stomach and waistband ... area.\" Just as Vidal stopped and exited his cruiser, the defendant, while still running, suddenly removed his gun from his waistband, \"turned toward his right\" with the gun in his right hand, and pointed the gun directly at Garay's midsection. Garay, who was about fifteen feet away, thought that the defendant was going to shoot him, and fired a shot at the defendant that missed. As Garay fired the shot, the defendant \"[a]lmost simultaneously\" \"dropped\" his gun to the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Garay dropped his gun and tackled the defendant to the ground. A violent struggle ensued. The defendant pushed Garay off him and struggled to get away, ignored Garay's repeated demands to stop resisting, and evaded Garay's attempts to handcuff him by lying on his stomach and clenching his hands beneath his chest. Vidal \"jumped on\" the defendant to help Garay restrain him. Officer Faruk Yilmaz of the Stamford Police Department arrived moments later and noticed the defendant's handgun, which was in a jammed and temporarily inoperable condition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   lying about a foot away from where the struggle was taking place. Yilmaz removed it from the area before assisting with the defendant. Eventually, the three officers subdued and arrested the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant was subsequently charged with multiple offenses, including attempt to commit assault in the first degree. See footnote 1 of this opinion. On March 14, 2013, the jury found the defendant guilty on all counts. The trial court thereafter rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict, and imposed a total effective sentence of fifteen years imprisonment and five years of special parole. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of attempt to commit assault in the first degree because no reasonable jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to inflict serious physical injury on Garay. In support of this claim, the defendant argues that \"[t]he simple act of pointing a gun, without any accompanying assertive\n   behavior that could permit an inference of specific intent to seriously injure [Garay] by shooting him, is too equivocal an act to prove intent.\" In response, the state contends that it introduced additional evidence, beyond the defendant's mere act of pointing the gun at Garay, to establish the defendant's intent, including the defendant's conduct prior to the encounter with Garay and the fact that the defendant raised his gun at Garay while attempting to resist arrest. We agree with the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant's innocence.... The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.... This does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from the evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt ... because this court has held that a jury's factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[A]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt\n   ... nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal.... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence.

Rejecting the defendant's claim on appeal that there was insufficient evidence of his intent, this court concluded that \"[t]he defendant's act of reaching quickly into his pocket and grabbing a cocked and loaded gun while struggling with uniformed police officers who were attempting physically and by verbal command to subdue him reasonably could have been found not only to have been the start of a line of conduct leading naturally to securing the gun and using it to shoot and cause serious physical injury to each of the three officers, but also to have been strongly corroborative of his alleged purpose to engage in such conduct and cause such results, and thus to commit assault in the first degree against each officer.\" Id., at 530-31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20A.3d%20284\">\n    53 A.3d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the present case, on the basis of the evidence adduced at trial, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant intended to shoot and cause serious physical injury to Garay. Leading up to the encounter, the defendant, who knew that the police were searching for him because he had brandished his gun at Beverly, recognized Garay to be a police officer. In order to avoid being arrested and prosecuted for carrying a firearm without a permit, the defendant\n   ignored Garay's orders to show his hands. When Garay raised his gun and ordered the defendant to get on the ground, the defendant ran.\n   After a brief chase, the defendant, while running full speed, abruptly removed his gun from his waistband, turned his body partially around toward Garay, and pointed his gun directly at Garay's midsection from fifteen feet away. Therefore, contrary to the defendant's contention, the evidence at trial demonstrated not only that the defendant pointed his gun at Garay, but that he did so in an abrupt and purposeful manner while engaged in a prolonged effort to resist being arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm. Viewing the defendant's actions in context with these surrounding circumstances, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant, in order to effectuate his escape, pointed his gun at Garay with the intent to shoot him in the midsection, \"an area of [his] body that would be likely to inflict physical injury which creates a substantial risk of death ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20845\">\n    317 Conn. at 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201229\">\n    120 A.3d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see\n   <em>\n    Godsey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9978630\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/719/578/#p583\">\n    719 S.W.2d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 583 (Tex.

The defendant was tackled by Garay immediately thereafter, and although he continued to resist, he was ultimately handcuffed and subdued by the three officers.

We disagree. The attempt statute merely requires the state to prove that the defendant took a substantial step \"under the circumstances as he believe[d] them to be ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49(a)(2). That statutory language \"sweeps aside any consideration of the defense of impossibility, including the distinction between so-called factual and legal impossibility. Under [\u00a7 53a-49(a)(2) ], the liability of the actor turns on his purpose, considered in the light of his beliefs, and not on what is actually possible under existing circumstances. If the actor attempted to pick an empty pocket of another person mistakenly thinking it contained money, he would be guilty of attempted larceny.\" D. Borden &amp; L. Orland, 10 Connecticut Practice Series: Connecticut Criminal Law (2d Ed. 2007) p. 115. In view of that principle, the existence of the jam in the present case does not bear on the jury's determination that the defendant was guilty of attempt to commit assault in the first degree if the defendant believed the gun to be operable\n   and ready to fire when he pointed it at Garay. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20845\">\n    317 Conn. at 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201229\">\n    120 A.3d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (fact that gun was not racked and thus incapable of firing did not negate intent element because \"it [was] ... entirely reasonable for [the jury] to infer that the defendant did not know that it was necessary to rack the gun\" in order to fire it).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Our review of the record discloses ample evidence from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant was unaware that his gun was inoperable when he raised it at Garay. First, the state presented evidence that the defendant was intoxicated around the time of the events in question; see footnote 2 of this opinion; from which the jury reasonably could have\n   inferred that the defendant failed to notice that he had caused the gun to jam by cocking it when there was already a cartridge in the chamber. Although the defendant argues that the jam was readily apparent because it caused the barrel of the gun to protrude outward, it was not unreasonable for the jury to have concluded that, given his intoxication, the defendant failed to notice the jam. Moreover, the defendant did not mention the jam in the sworn, written statement that he provided to the police the day after his arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the statement, the defendant claimed, untruthfully, that prior to confronting Beverly he \"made sure that [his gun] was on safety and that there [were] no bullets in the chamber.\" The defendant further claimed that while running from the scene he attempted to throw his gun over an adjacent fence and, contrary to his testimony at trial, that he did not realize that a police officer was chasing him. Despite the defendant's apparent willingness to downplay certain facts to the police in order to portray himself in a more favorable light, he did not mention the fact that the gun was jammed or make any suggestion that he believed that the gun was inoperable. On the basis of this evidence, it was entirely reasonable for the jury to have discounted the defendant's testimony at trial that he was aware of the jam prior to his encounter with Garay. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5709092\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/273/393/#p406\">\n    273 Conn. 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 406,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=869%20A.2d%201236\">\n    869 A.2d 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (\"[T]he [finder] of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant's innocence ....

The jury reasonably could have determined that the defendant was unaware of the jam, and therefore believed the gun to be fully operable and ready to fire when he pointed it at Garay.\n   Accordingly, the existence of\n   the jam does not negate the jury's finding of intent to inflict serious physical injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The defendant also was convicted of assault of a peace officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167c(a)(1), and carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35(a).
