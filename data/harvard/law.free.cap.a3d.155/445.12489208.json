Petitioner, a general contractor who successfully bid for work on a City of Baltimore construction project, argues that Respondent, the project's design engineering firm, owes it a tort duty of care because Respondent knew that Petitioner would rely on its designs in bidding and constructing the project. We shall hold, that, in the absence of contractual privity, physical injury, or risk of physical injury, design professionals in large government construction projects do not owe a tort duty to those who bid for and contract with a government entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The City of Baltimore (\"City\") contracted with Rummel Klepper &amp; Kahl, LLP (\"Engineer\") to design upgrades to the Patapsco Wastewater Treatment Plant. Under the contract, Engineer was tasked with designing the plans for two interrelated projects, Sanitary Contract 852R (\"SC 852R\") and Sanitary Contract 845R (\"the companion project\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc.'s (\"Contractor\") complaint, Engineer's responsibilities under the contract included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Developing the design for SC 852R and its companion project;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Developing drawings and specifications for prospective contractors to use when submitting bids and for the successful contractor to use for construction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Developing construction timetables for the projects;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Providing responses to questions from prospective bidders regarding the design of the projects;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Evaluating and commenting on contractors' bids;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Evaluating and approving submissions from the successful contractor during construction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Inspecting the successful contractor's work during construction to ensure conformance with Engineer's design; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Evaluating and accepting the successful contractor's work and certifying the work to the City.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The City opened both projects up to bids through its competitive bidding process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Contractors that submitted bids had to be prequalified as being able to complete the work required by the designs. Contractor\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   was the successful bidder for SC 852R.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under its contract with the City, Contractor agreed to construct 34 denitrification filter cells (\"DNF cells\"), which are concrete tubs that hold untreated wastewater, next\n   to the existing wastewater treatment facility. Contractor was also to construct \"pipes and pipe support systems\" for SC 852R. During construction, Contractor encountered leaking and other problems, which resulted in delays and cost overruns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2014, Contractor filed a complaint against Engineer in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking to recover its financial losses. According to Contractor's complaint, Engineer designed the DNF cells using expansion and contraction joints that were meant to accommodate changes in water pressure in the cells. On completion, the water retention ability of the DNF cells was tested. The testing revealed leaks due to cracks in the expansion joints. Contractor averred that it constructed the DNF cells according to Engineer's design, and any leaking from the expansion joints was a \"direct result of deficiencies in [Engineer's] design.\" It alleged \"substantial additional costs, expenses and time to remediate the leaks.\" Contractor also claimed that Engineer's \"design of the pipe support system was defective,\" which caused it to suffer additional financial losses and delays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, Contractor averred that Engineer failed to timely complete the design for SC 852R's companion project, which \"hindered and delayed\" Contractor's construction of SC 852R. Engineer also allegedly failed to warn SC 852R's prospective bidders of the delayed completion of the companion project's design and established an unreasonable time line for the completion of SC 852R, which Contractor relied on when submitting its bid. As a result, Contractor claimed, it \"incurred significant cost, expense and time for which [Engineer] is responsible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its three-count complaint against Engineer, Contractor brought a professional negligence claim, a negligent misrepresentation claim, and a cause of action based on Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552. As to the professional negligence claim, Contractor alleged that an \"intimate nexus\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   and \"contractual privity equivalent\" existed between it and Engineer, and that Engineer owed it a duty of reasonable care \"exercised\n   by similarly situated design professionals.\" Contractor further alleged that it was a foreseeable party who \"would utilize and directly rely upon [Engineer's] professional services including, but not limited to, the preliminary and final design of [SC 852R].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its negligent misrepresentation claim, Contractor asserted that because Engineer designed the interrelated projects, it was aware that any delay in the design of the companion project would impact SC 852R. Contractor also claimed that Engineer intended prospective bidders like Contractor to rely on the time line it had developed for SC 852R when submitting bids for the project, and an intimate nexus and privity equivalent existed between it and Engineer, establishing a duty. In Contractor's words, Engineer owed it \"a duty to fairly and accurately describe the contract duration for [SC 852R] as well as the status of the [companion project's] design.\" In addition, Contractor alleged, Engineer knew that the companion project's design was not sufficiently complete to allow for timely completion of SC 852R. Therefore, Contractor claimed, Engineer had a duty to advise prospective bidders, including Contractor, that SC 852R could not be completed within the time frame it had established. Finally, in its Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552 cause of action, Contractor alleged that Engineer provided designs, plans, and specifications for the construction of SC 852R, which contained deficiencies, and knew or should have known that Contractor would rely on those documents, causing it damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Engineer filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. In its motion, Engineer argued that without privity between the parties, no legally cognizable tort duty ran from Engineer to Contractor that would permit recovery of purely economic losses. Engineer also argued that the intimate nexus test and Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552 concepts of extra-contractual duty do not apply to design professionals and, even if they did, Contractor failed to allege facts satisfying these tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Circuit Court granted Engineer's motion to dismiss due to lack of privity between Contractor and Engineer. Contractor appealed. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the dismissal of Contractor's complaint based on lack of privity.\n   <em>\n    Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. v.

Instead, Contractor avers, the intimate nexus test applies to its claims, and the allegations in its complaint satisfy the test. Therefore, Contractor asserts, Engineer owes it a duty of care and may be held liable in tort for the economic losses it has incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Engineer urges us to apply the economic loss doctrine, which is a principle courts have used to limit the expansion of tort liability absent privity. Engineer avers that under this doctrine there is no liability without privity when a plaintiff has suffered only economic loss without physical injury or risk thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Professional Negligence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Contractor contends that Engineer is liable for damages it sustained under a\n   negligence theory.

Imposition of tort duties that cut across those contractual lines disrupts and frustrates the parties' contractual allocation of risk and permits the circumvention of a carefully negotiated contractual balance among owner, builder, and design professional.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Indianapolis-Marion Cty.

In\n   <em>\n    Village of Cross Keys\n   </em>\n   , the architect and developer used the curtain wall design specifications they found in a trade magazine. They had no opportunity to negotiate a contract with the manufacturer regarding the cost or remedies. There was no competitive bidding process or contract governing liability. Here, by contrast, Contractor had the opportunity to review Engineer's design, ask for clarifications, and submit a bid detailing how much it would cost to construct the project. In other words, Contractor was able to evaluate whether it could complete the project and at what cost, and the City was free to accept or reject its bid. If Contractor was not satisfied with the City's contract, it could have negotiated different terms or bid on a different project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Contractor also included in its complaint a \" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552\" count.
