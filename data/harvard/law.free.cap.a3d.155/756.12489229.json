The state responds that the court properly instructed the jury on the use of constancy evidence, and that the court issued a curative instruction regarding the uncharged prior misconduct testimony, thereby avoiding the need for a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude that the court's jury instruction was proper, and that the court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for mistrial. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. The victim was born in November, 1996, in Puerto Rico. She, her mother, sister, and\n   brother moved to Waterbury in 2007. The defendant, who also had lived in Puerto Rico, moved to Waterbury as well. The period of charged misconduct was from June, 2009 to June, 2011. The victim and her family lived in New York City from 2009 until at least April, 2011, before returning to Waterbury. In April, 2011, the victim wrote a journal entry in which she referenced the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her mother discovered the journal entry in June, 2011, after the family had moved back to Waterbury. About a week later, the victim told her mother that the defendant had touched her body, specifically her vagina, in a sexual manner. She also stated that the defendant had touched her sister, C.A., sexually as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   About a month after the victim's mother read the diary entry, the family held a meeting at the home of the defendant's mother to discuss the victim's allegations. The victim, C.A., their parents, their brother, the defendant, his parents, and his brother attended the meeting. C.A. and her mother testified at trial that when the victim announced that the defendant had been touching her, he became upset and threw a bottle of iced tea against the wall. After the meeting, the victim's mother took the victim and C.A. to the police department to file a report against the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The state filed two informations against the defendant, one alleging offenses related to the victim, and one alleging offenses related to C.A. The court consolidated the cases for trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the trial, the victim testified that she often visited the defendant at the Waterbury home he shared with his three children and their mother. The victim also testified that from 2009 to April, 2011, when she was living in New York, she and her\n   sister would sometimes stay overnight at the defendant's house on weekends. After the victim and her family moved back to Waterbury, she was at the defendant's house almost every day until June, 2011, when her mother discovered her journal entry pertaining to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The victim testified that during these visits the defendant touched her sexually many times in his kitchen and living room. In the kitchen, the defendant would lean against the table, hold her with her back to his chest, and touch her vagina over her clothes and then inside her vagina with his fingers. Afterward, the defendant would ask the victim to forgive him and promise never to do it again. On one occasion, the defendant's neighbor, Joshua Roman, walked into the kitchen while the defendant was touching her. The victim testified that the defendant was touching her breasts when Roman interrupted, but Roman testified that he only witnessed the defendant caressing her back. In the living room, the defendant would have the victim sit in his lap on the couch covered by a sheet while he put his fingers in her vagina. Additionally, the victim testified that, on another occasion, the defendant kissed her and put his fingers inside her vagina\n   while they were in the back seat of his car and his children were in the front seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   C.A. also testified regarding the defendant's conduct. Among other incidents, she testified that the defendant began touching her in a sexual manner when she was six years old and living in Puerto Rico. After C.A. testified as to this alleged misconduct, the court excused the jury and noted that the misconduct at issue was not included in the state's disclosure of uncharged misconduct. When the jury returned, the court instructed the jury to disregard any evidence concerning any alleged incidents involving the defendant and C.A. that took place in Puerto Rico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prior to the conclusion of the state's evidence, the defendant filed a motion for mistrial. In his motion, the defendant claimed that \"the introduction of testimony by the state, through C.A., alleging incidents of sexual contact by the defendant in Puerto Rico resulted in a violation of the defendant's right to due process under the state and federal constitutions, his right to a fair trial, and his right to effective assistance of counsel.\" Specifically, the defendant asserted that the state failed to give notice of certain allegations of sexual contact between the defendant and C.A. prior to 2009 and, therefore, improperly elicited testimony concerning these allegations. The court denied the motion, concluding that the improper solicitation of testimony on this subject did not rise to the level of denying the defendant a fair trial, specifically noting that the court had sua sponte issued a curative instruction to the jury before any objection by the defendant had been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to the testimony from the victim and C.A., the jury heard testimony from two constancy of accusation witnesses. The first was Roman, who testified about the incident in the defendant's kitchen where he saw the defendant caressing the victim's back. Roman walked into the living room, where the victim joined him a few minutes later. At that point, he testified that the victim said to him, \" 'I told you that he touched me and all that.' \" After Roman's testimony, the court instructed the jury on constancy of accusation testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The second constancy witness was the victim's mother, who testified that, about a week after she found the victim's diary, the victim told her that the defendant had \"touched her in a sexual way.\" Although C.A. was not a part of that particular conversation, she also told her mother later that same day that the defendant had touched her sexually while they were at his apartment. After the mother's testimony concluded, the court again instructed the jury on constancy of accusation witness testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant submitted a request to charge asking the court to instruct the jury that (1) constancy evidence was not to be used as substantive evidence to prove the truth of the complainants' out-of-court statements, and (2) constancy evidence could be used only to determine whether such statements were made. The defendant objected to any language that would have allowed the jury to use constancy of accusation testimony to \"bolster\" the complainants' credibility or \"corroborate\" their testimony. The defendant raised this objection before trial in a motion in limine, which was denied, and again orally after the court's limiting instruction with respect to Roman's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After considering the parties' requests to charge, the court gave the following instruction with respect to constancy of accusation evidence: \"The complainants testified here in court before you. You may use their testimony as evidence and proof of the facts asserted in that testimony and give it the weight you find is reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The state offered evidence of out-of-court statements made by the complainants to other persons that the defendant sexually assaulted them. Those persons to whom the state alleges that they made such statements are: as to [the victim], [her mother] and Joshua Roman; by [C.A.] to [her mother] and Joshua Roman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Under our law, the testimony of these witnesses was limited in its scope to the fact and timing of the complainants' complaints, the time and place of the alleged sexual assaults, and the identity of the alleged perpetrator. Each of these people testified as to the statements the complainants made to each of them regarding the defendant's-the defendant sexually assaulting them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"This evidence is to be considered by you only in determining the weight and credibility you will give the complainants' testimony as it pertains to the charges of sexual assault. This evidence of out-of-court statements by the complainants of a\n   sexual assault against them by the defendant is not to be considered by you to prove the truth of the matter asserted in those out-of-court statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"In determining whether or not these out-of-court statements corroborate the complainants' testimony in court, you should consider all of the circumstances under which they were made and to whom, and whether the statements made to these persons were or were not consistent with the complainants' testimony in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"If you find any delay in their reporting the alleged incidents, you may consider such delay and any reason which you may find for such delay in evaluating their testimony given in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"To the extent that you find what they ... have said outside the courtroom is consistent with their testimony in court, you may find their testimony in court to be corroborated or supported with respect to the fact and timing of their complaint, the time and place of the alleged sexual assault, and the identity of the alleged perpetrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"To the extent that you find that what they have said outside the courtroom is inconsistent with their testimony in court, you may consider the degree of inconsistency which you find, and you may consider the reasons which you may find for the inconsistency, in evaluating their testimony given in court.\" The defendant objected to the charge to the extent that it differed from his written request and oral requests. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal, the defendant asserts two separate claims. First, he argues that the court erred by instructing the\n   jury that the complainants' allegations were corroborated by the testimony of the two constancy of accusation witnesses, and that this error requires reversal. Second, the defendant argues that the court erred by denying his motion for mistrial after the state elicited testimony from C.A. regarding uncharged prior sexual misconduct by the defendant that had not been disclosed prior to trial. We consider each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court improperly instructed the jury regarding the correct use of constancy of accusation evidence, which is admitted under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200303\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/284/#p304\">\n    237 Conn. 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20917\">\n    677 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996), only to prove that a complaint was made, not to prove that the complaint was true. The defendant specifically claims that the jury instructions were improper in light of the preexisting susceptibility of jurors to disregard the subtle distinction between constancy evidence and substantive proof, and the court's use of the word \"corroborate.\" The state responds that it is not reasonably probable that the court's instructions misled the jury. We agree with the state that the court's instructions correctly stated the law and did not mislead the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Our review of [a jury instruction] claim requires that we examine the [trial] court's entire charge to determine whether it is reasonably [probable] that the jury could have been misled .... While a request to charge that is relevant to the issues in a case and that accurately states the applicable law must be honored, a [trial] court need not tailor its charge to the precise letter of such a request.... If a requested charge is in substance given, the [trial] court's failure to give a charge in exact conformance with the words of the request will not constitute a ground for reversal.... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will\n   not view the instructions as improper.... Additionally, we have noted\n   that [a]n [impropriety] in instructions in a criminal case is reversible ... when it is shown that it is\n   <em>\n    reasonably possible\n   </em>\n   for [improprieties] of constitutional dimension or\n   <em>\n    reasonably probable\n   </em>\n   for nonconstitutional [improprieties] that the jury [was] misled.\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Daniel W.

In all other respects, our current rules remain in effect. Thus, such evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim's testimony and not for substantive purposes. Before the evidence may be admitted, therefore, the victim must first have testified concerning the facts of the sexual assault and\n   the identity of the person or persons to whom the incident was reported.
