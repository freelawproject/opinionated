Pardo appeals from the denial of his motion to dismiss and motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure rendered by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee under the Pooling Servicing Agreement relating to IMPAC Secured Assets Corp., Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He claims that the court improperly (1) denied his\n   motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and (2) dismissed, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-15,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   his motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure as moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that neither of these claims are persuasive and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are pertinent to this appeal. The plaintiff commenced this action for strict foreclosure against the defendant on April 29, 2014. The plaintiff alleged the following facts in its complaint. On April 9, 2007, the defendant executed a promissory note in favor of IMPAC Funding Corporation d/b/a IMPAC Lending Group (IMPAC) in exchange for a loan in the amount of $627,500, which was secured by a mortgage on the defendant's real property located at 123 Jeanne Court in Stamford (property). The mortgage, originally executed in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as nominee for IMPAC, was assigned to the plaintiff on August 30, 2012, by virtue of an assignment of mortgage agreement. The plaintiff is \"the holder of [the] note and mortgage.\" The defendant executed loan modification agreements on May 4, 2010, and October 3, 2012, increasing the unpaid principal balance due under the note. The defendant has defaulted on the note, and the plaintiff has elected to declare the unpaid balance under the note\n   to be due in full and to foreclose the mortgage securing the note. Copies of the note, mortgage, and assignment of mortgage, which named the plaintiff as the assignee, were appended to the complaint as exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 8, 2014, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for entry of default against the defendant for failure to appear. On September 3, 2014, the plaintiff filed a motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure. On December 8, 2014, following a hearing, the court granted the plaintiff's motion, rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure, and set January 20, 2015, as the law day. Thereafter, the court granted the plaintiff's motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure, reset the date of judgment to February 2, 2015, and extended the law day to May 19, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 12, 2015, the defendant filed a motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure, asserting that the plaintiff lacked standing to commence the action, along with a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In support of his motion to dismiss, the defendant argued that the plaintiff was not a \" 'holder' \" of the note, and thus lacked standing to foreclose the mortgage, because the note was not a \"negotiable instrument\" within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-104.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the defendant argued that the note ceased to be an unconditional promise or order to pay under General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-106 (a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   because,\n   as pleaded in the complaint, the terms of the note were modified by loan modification agreements executed on May 4, 2010, and October 3, 2012. The loan modifications, the defendant maintained, made the promises and obligations set forth in the original note\n   \"subject to or governed by\" other writings and, consequently, rendered the original note \"conditional\" under \u00a7 42a-3-106 (a) (ii) and (iii). The defendant did not request a hearing on his motion to open or motion to dismiss prior to the May 19, 2015 law day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following a hearing on the defendant's motion to open, held on May 26, 2015, the court ordered the parties to submit briefs, and scheduled the motion for further argument at the June 16, 2015 short calendar. At the short calendar, the defendant contended that, notwithstanding \u00a7 49-15, which precludes trial courts from opening judgments of strict foreclosure after title to the mortgaged property vests following the running of the law days,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court retained authority to open the judgment because he filed a motion to dismiss challenging the court's subject matter jurisdiction on May 12, 2015, which, he asserted, tolled the running of the May 19, 2015 law day. The court disagreed and, pursuant to \u00a7 49-15, dismissed the defendant's motion to open as moot. The court then scheduled the motion to dismiss for argument on a later date and ordered the plaintiff not to transfer title to the property until after the motion was heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At a hearing held on June 22, 2015, the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss. The court noted that, at the time it rendered the judgment of strict foreclosure, it had found that the foreclosure documents were in order and that the plaintiff was the holder of the note. The court further found that the note remained a negotiable instrument regardless of the modification\n   agreements and that the plaintiff had standing to foreclose the mortgage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court improperly denied his motion to dismiss on the basis of its finding that the plaintiff was a holder of the note with standing to commence this action. Specifically, the defendant argues that the plaintiff was not a holder of the note because the note was not a \"negotiable instrument\" under \u00a7 42a-3-104 (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion.

In its complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant executed a mortgage on his property in favor of MERS to secure the underlying note, that\n   MERS assigned the note and mortgage to the plaintiff on August 30, 2012, and that the plaintiff \"is the holder of [the] note and mortgage.\" By alleging that it was the holder of the note and mortgage, the plaintiff also alleged, by implication, that it held the note and mortgage at the time the action was commenced. See\n   <em>\n    GMAC Mortgage, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415848\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/144/165/#p174\">\n    144 Conn.App. 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20A.3d%20742\">\n    73 A.3d 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Additionally, the plaintiff submitted the note, mortgage, and assignment, which names the plaintiff as assignee of the note and mortgage, as attachments to its complaint. Given those pleadings, the burden shifted to the defendant to \"prove the facts which limit or change the plaintiff's rights.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Property Asset Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lazarte\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484954\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/290/#p745\">\n    163 Conn.

The defendant failed to answer the complaint or otherwise appear in this action, and the court, on December 8, 2014, granted the plaintiff's motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure. In denying the defendant's motion to dismiss, which was filed after judgment was rendered, the court found that the foreclosure documents were in order and that the plaintiff was a holder of the note with standing to foreclose the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant's sole argument on appeal, which the trial court rejected, is a legal one-namely, that the plaintiff cannot be a holder of the note because the note is not a \"negotiable instrument\" as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code. See\n   <em>\n    Florian\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lenge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753088\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/91/268/#p276\">\n    91 Conn.App. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 276,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20985\">\n    880 A.2d 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (question of whether promissory note meets definition of negotiable instrument is question of law\n   subject to plenary review). General Statutes \u00a7 42a-1-201 (21) defines \"holder\" to mean, inter alia, \"[t]he person in possession of a\n   <em>\n    negotiable instrument\n   </em>\n   that is payable either to bearer or to an identified person that is the person in possession ....\" (Emphasis added.) The note is not a negotiable instrument, the defendant contends, because it was\n   modified by two subsequent loan modification agreements that increased the balance due under the note. The defendant's theory is that, as a result of the modification agreements, the note ceased to be \"an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money,\" as is required for a writing to qualify as a negotiable instrument; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-104 (a) ; because its terms became subject to other writings. In support of this novel proposition, the defendant cites only to \u00a7 42a-3-106 (a), which provides in relevant part that \"for the purposes of section 42a-3-104 (a), a promise or order is unconditional unless it states ... (ii) that the promise or order is subject to or governed by another writing, or (iii) that rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another writing....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We reject the contention that the note at issue in the present case was rendered \"conditional\" under \u00a7 42a-3-106 (a) (ii) or (iii) by the defendant's subsequent execution of the two loan modification agreements that increased the balance due under the note. The prefatory language in \u00a7 42a-3-106 (a) -\"a promise or order is unconditional unless it states\"-plainly indicates that in order for subsections (ii) or (iii) to apply, the promise or order to pay must\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   contain the reference to the other writing. That is, an unconditional promise or order to pay is not rendered conditional by a modification agreement that is not referenced in the original note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, because the note does not state that its terms are subject to any other writing, it is a negotiable instrument subject to the Uniform Commercial Code regardless of the two loan modification agreements. For that reason, the defendant has failed to rebut the evidence in the record demonstrating that the plaintiff was the holder of the note with standing to institute this action. Accordingly, the court properly denied the defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court improperly dismissed his motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure as moot. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Our determination of whether there is any practical relief that can be afforded the defendant depends on whether the trial court had the authority to\n   grant the defendant's motion to open and, therefore, requires us to interpret the statutory provision governing the opening of strict foreclosure judgments.

First, our rules of practice specifically provide that \"proceedings to enforce or carry out the judgment or order shall be automatically stayed until the time to file an appeal has expired\"; Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (a) ; whereas there is no such rule of practice for the filing of a motion to dismiss. Moreover, the automatic tolling of the law days is necessary in the context of filing an appeal because otherwise defendants would be deprived of their rights to file a timely appeal and to redeem. See\n    <em>\n     Continental Capital Corp.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Lazarte\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"445580\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/57/271/#p274\">\n     57 Conn.App. 271\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 274,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=749%20A.2d%20646\">\n     749 A.2d 646\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2000) (noting that setting law day within twenty-day appeal period is improper because \"[a] party may not effectively be deprived of the right to appeal within the twenty days by having the law day pass within that time, thereby causing a loss of the right of redemption\"). By contrast, the imposition of an automatic stay for the filing of a motion to dismiss does not serve any similar procedural safeguards. Indeed, our case law specifically provides a remedy for defendants who prevail in jurisdictional challenges that are instituted after the passing of the law days.
