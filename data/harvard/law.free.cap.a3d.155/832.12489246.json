ANDERSON, Defendant Below, Appellant,\n  <br/>\n  v.\n  <br/>\n  STATE of Delaware, Plaintiff Below, Appellee.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  No. 505, 2016\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Supreme Court of Delaware.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  Submitted: December 5, 2016\n  <br/>\n  Decided: January 20, 2017\n </decisiondate>\n <p id=\"p-5\">\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-6\">\n   Randy J. Holland, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   This 20th day of January 2017, upon consideration of the appellant's opening brief, the State's motion to affirm, and the record below, it appears to the Court that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   (1) The appellant, Lester F. Anderson, filed this appeal from the Superior Court's denial of his motion for review of his case. The State of Delaware has filed a motion to affirm the judgment below on the ground that it is manifest on the face of Anderson's opening brief that his appeal is without merit. We agree and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   (2) The record reflects that a Superior Court jury found Anderson guilty of Murder in the First Degree in February 1992. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. This Court affirmed Anderson's conviction on direct appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2013, this Court denied Anderson's fourth motion for postconviction relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (3) In August 2016, Anderson filed a motion for review of his case. The Superior Court treated the motion as a motion for sentence reduction under Superior Court Criminal Rule 35 and denied it. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (4) In his opening brief, Anderson argues, as he did below, that he was deprived of his right to call an expert witness at trial to support his affirmative defense of self-defense. To the extent Anderson challenges his conviction, Rule 61, not Rule 35, is the exclusive remedy for a person seeking to set aside a judgment of conviction\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Anderson has failed to satisfy the Rule 61(d)(2) procedural bars.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent Anderson seeks to reduce his sentence, the Superior Court correctly recognized that it had no authority to reduce his mandatory life sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (5) Anderson also claims that the Superior Court erred in not giving a deadly weapon charge to the jury. Anderson did not raise this claim in the Superior Court and we will not consider it for the first time on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having carefully considered the parties' positions, we conclude that the Superior Court did not err in denying Anderson's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (6) We note that Anderson unsuccessfully argued the Superior Court erred in not allowing him to call an expert witness in his direct appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We also note that Anderson has filed multiple, unsuccessful motions for postconviction relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We will not continue to invest scarce judicial resources to address untimely and repetitive claims. We encourage the appellant to be mindful of Rule 61(j).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the motion to affirm is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    <em>\n     Anderson v.
