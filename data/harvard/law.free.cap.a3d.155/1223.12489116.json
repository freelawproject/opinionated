Burns, Jr., to recover damages from the defendant homeowner, David Y. Adler,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for home improvement services despite the plaintiff's noncompliance with that statute. The parties entered into an agreement whereby the plaintiff agreed to furnish materials and supply labor in connection with the renovation of a residence owned by the defendant in the town of Salisbury. After the renovation project was largely complete, a dispute arose regarding amounts that the defendant owed the plaintiff for services performed. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this action claiming, among other things, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. The defendant raised the special defense that the plaintiff's claims were barred because the agreement did not comply with the requirements\n   of General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 20-429.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In turn, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant was precluded from relying on \u00a7 20-429 because his refusal to pay the plaintiff was in bad faith. After a trial to the court, the\n   trial court concluded that the plaintiff had incurred damages in the amount of $214,039 and that \u00a7 20-429 did not bar recovery because the defendant's refusal to pay was in bad faith. Accordingly, the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $214,039. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. See\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Adler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20Conn.%20App.%20766\">\n    158 Conn.App. 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 808,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%20555\">\n    120 A.3d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). We then granted the defendant's petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issues: (1) \"Did ...\n   \u00a7 20-429(f) abrogate the bad faith exception to the [act] created in\n   <em>\n    Habetz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Condon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"549792\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/224/231/#p240\">\n    224 Conn. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=618%20A.2d%20501\">\n    618 A.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) ?\"; and (2) \"Did the Appellate Court properly affirm the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff?\"\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Adler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20931\">\n    319 Conn. 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20A.3d%20205\">\n    125 A.3d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ; see also footnote 7 of this opinion. We conclude that the first certified question is not reviewable because it was not raised in the trial court. We further conclude that the defendant did not act in bad faith and, therefore, the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the ground that the plaintiff was barred from invoking the protection of the act. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and conclude that the case must be remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts, which are undisputed or were found by the trial court, and procedural history. In September, 2007, the plaintiff, who is a self-employed construction worker, and the defendant entered into negotiations regarding the renovation and remodeling of a weekend residence that the defendant was planning to buy in the town of Salisbury. The work was to include substantial demolition of the existing structure, the addition of a second floor and the expansion of the structure's footprint. The defendant wanted the work to be performed as quickly as possible so that he and his family could use the residence during the summer of 2008. The parties discussed a cost of approximately $400,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to these discussions, the plaintiff prepared a written \"Home Improvement Service Agreement\" (agreement) dated October 5, 2007. The agreement described the services that the plaintiff was to perform as \"begin demolition [of] existing home in preparation of planned remodel.\" The agreement also provided that \"[a]ny modifications or changes to the above described\n   scope of services shall be set forth in a\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   [c]hange [o]rder\n   <em>\n    signed by both parties\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis in original.) In addition, the agreement provided that the defendant would pay the plaintiff \"[$45] per man plus any expenses to include dumpsters [and/or] materials.\" The agreement further provided that \"once full plans have been provided we will start another contract with firm pricing for every aspect of [the] job with the exclusion of any changes as the project progresses.\" The trial court concluded that the agreement did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 20-249 (a) or (f) because it was not signed by the plaintiff, it did not contain a completion date and the plaintiff failed to prove that he delivered a completed copy of it to the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   From October, 2007 through September, 2008, the plaintiff worked exclusively on the defendant's renovation project. During that period, the plaintiff received numerous work orders related to the project from multiple sources, including the defendant, his wife, Amie R. Weitzman, the defendant's architect, Elizabeth Slotnick, and Weitzman's assistant, Julie Weiner. None of these four people had a complete understanding of the work that the plaintiff was being requested to perform. In addition, none of them ever inquired about the cost of doing the various items of work that they requested. The written plans for the project were frequently revised by the defendant and others acting on his behalf, and many\n   of the changes were significant. Indeed, the trial court found that the \"project was marked by untrammeled profligacy on the part of the [defendant].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the plaintiff, he continued to rely on the time and materials provision of the agreement and never executed a \"contract with firm pricing,\" as provided by the agreement, because he never received a full set of plans and \"things constantly changed from day to day ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As the project moved forward, the plaintiff periodically requested payments from the defendant, which the defendant provided. The plaintiff did not send the defendant itemized bills, however, and the defendant initially did not request them. Rather, the plaintiff calculated his expenses from his checkbook records, invoices and time sheets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff did not retain all invoices and time sheets relating to the project, nor did he keep a daily construction log or other records that would show which tradesmen were on the site, what work was performed, or what materials were delivered to the site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 15, 2008, the plaintiff presented the defendant with a written budget report showing that the projected total cost of the project was $810,267, including $521,944 for work already completed. On March 25, 2008, the plaintiff presented the defendant with a revised budget report showing that the projected total cost of the project was $795,038, including $518,352 for work already completed. On May 27, 2008, the plaintiff informed the defendant by e-mail that the budget had\n   increased to $886,954, not including certain additional items that the defendant had requested. The e-mail stated that \"all future changes will be done on a time and material basis unless it is more efficient to bid,\" and that \"[t]here will ... be a need for an [e-mail] or written response for these changes from either you or your wife's office approving them ....\" The plaintiff also told the defendant that he owed substantial amounts to his subcontractors and required additional funding to keep them working. The defendant was unhappy with the revised budget, but he chose to retain the plaintiff as his contractor because he was anxious to have the project completed so that he could use the house. Although the defendant contended that he believed that the e-mail represented the terms of a new \"fixed price contract,\" he and Weitzman continued to ask the plaintiff to perform additional tasks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 25, 2008, the plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant setting forth the\n   \"final numbers for all work performed\" at the residence. The plaintiff stated that the total cost of the project was $1,188,350 and that payments received to date totaled $985,000, for a balance due of $203,350.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that point, the project was approximately 98 percent complete. In response, the defendant sent an e-mail to the plaintiff on September 3, 2008, summarizing and comparing the various budget reports that the plaintiff had provided. The defendant complained that \"the numbers do not add up and there are different categories being created in each budget.\" According to the defendant's calculations, the total cost of the project was $963,923, or $21,077 less than the $985,000 that the defendant had already paid. The $963,923 figure included extra items of work that the defendant had approved since the plaintiff's May 27, 2008 budget report. The defendant indicated that he\n   was willing to pay for these extras if the plaintiff could establish that the amounts shown were correct, and he requested additional information for certain items. The defendant also noted that the plaintiff had not begun to address \"the 100+ item punch list\" that the defendant had provided to the plaintiff. Finally, the defendant stated that he had been \"very happy with the quality of [the plaintiff's] work generally and it is my hope that we can resolve this matter amicably.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 8, 2008, the plaintiff informed the defendant that the total cost of the project had increased to $1,199,911, and the total balance due was $214,911. On September 12, 2008, the plaintiff sent an e-mail to the defendant itemizing in detail the work that he and others had been performing at the residence since June 1, 2008. The plaintiff, however, did not provide the cost of each item or any backup documentation. The plaintiff stated that he had performed the work at the defendant's request on the understanding that he would be paid for it. He also stated that he was losing money on the project, that his relationships with his subcontractors and suppliers were in jeopardy, and that he needed to pay them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 9, 2008, the defendant's architect, Slotnick, sent an e-mail to the defendant indicating that she had received an e-mail from a supplier inquiring whether the defendant was happy with the kitchen cabinetry, because he had not been paid yet. Slotnick had told the supplier that the plaintiff and the defendant had financial issues that they were attempting to resolve. In response, the defendant sent an e-mail to Slotnick asking if she could recommend \"a good attorney who does this kind of work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 16, 2008, the defendant informed the plaintiff by e-mail that \"[w]e are at the end of the road.\" The defendant stated that the plaintiff's explanations\n   of the additional charges after the May 27, 2008 budget report \"were neither itemized, nor specific, and in my opinion are wholly inadequate ....\" Accordingly, the defendant concluded that he did not owe the plaintiff any amount beyond the $985,000 that he had already paid, which included payment for all extra work performed after May 27, 2008, of which the defendant was aware. The defendant also stated that he was going to hire a contractor to complete the punch list items and that he was \"officially and immediately terminating [the] relationship.\" Finally, the defendant stated that, if the plaintiff intended to litigate the matter in court, the defendant, who is an attorney, would represent himself, and he strongly believed that he would prevail. The defendant admitted at trial that the statement that he would represent himself was false and that he made\n   it in the hope that the plaintiff would not bring a lawsuit if he knew that he would incur litigation expenses that the defendant would not incur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response to the defendant's September 16, 2008 e-mail, the following day the plaintiff sent an e-mail to the defendant stating, \"[I] would like to finish the punch list. It is my respons[i]bility to complete the work.\" The plaintiff also asked whether his subcontractors would be paid. On September 24, 2008, the defendant sent an e-mail to the plaintiff inquiring when he would be able to complete the punch list. The defendant explained to the plaintiff that, \"unless an item is highlighted on the punch list in yellow, these items are included in the amounts I have paid you to date ....\" On October 10, 2008, the defendant sent another e-mail to the plaintiff stating that, although the plaintiff had indicated that he wanted to complete the punch list, the defendant had \"only seen modest progress ....\" Accordingly, the defendant was going to hire a contractor to complete the work. In addition, the defendant stated that, in light of the fact that he had received a notice of the plaintiff's\n   intent to file a mechanic's lien on the residence, the plaintiff was no longer permitted to enter the defendant's premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 10, 2008, the plaintiff filed a certificate of mechanic's lien in the amount of $214,039.09 on the defendant's property. According to the certificate of mechanic's lien, the \"last day substantial services were performed relative to the work done by [the plaintiff] was August 29, 2008.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this action against the defendant seeking foreclosure of his mechanic's lien (first count),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and claiming damages for breach of contract (second count) and unjust enrichment (third count). The defendant raised the special defense that, because the plaintiff had failed to comply with \u00a7 20-\n   429, the agreement was unenforceable. In his reply in avoidance, the plaintiff contended that the agreement complied with the provisions of \u00a7 20-429 or, in the alternative, if the agreement was noncompliant, he could seek restitution from the defendant because the defendant's reliance on \u00a7 20-429 was in bad faith.\n   The matter was tried to the court, which concluded that the agreement did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 20-429, but that the plaintiff could nevertheless recover damages from the defendant because the defendant had acted in bad faith. In support of this conclusion, the trial court found that the defendant and others had made numerous requests for extra work without inquiring as to the expense, that the defendant was aware that the plaintiff owed significant debts to his subcontractors and suppliers, and that the defendant terminated the contract between the parties, but then continued to ask the plaintiff to work on the project without any intention of making further payments. The court further found that the defendant \"unilaterally and arbitrarily selected a price that he was willing to pay for the project.\" The court reasoned that, because the defendant knew as of August 4, 2008, when he made his final payment, that the project was \"largely complete,\" he must have believed that the project itself would not be at risk if he made no further payments even if he \"could not trick the plaintiff into finishing the entire punch list ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court also found that the defendant knew that his failure to pay the\n   plaintiff \"created a serious risk of putting the plaintiff out of business,\" and that he \"took advantage of [this] fact\" to induce the plaintiff to continue to work for him by suggesting that he might make further payments, even though he had no intention of doing so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant increased the pressure for the plaintiff to complete the work when the defendant stated falsely that he would represent himself if the plaintiff brought an action, thereby reminding the plaintiff that, unlike the defendant, he would have to bear legal expenses. The trial court acknowledged, however, that another contractor ultimately completed most of the work that remained to be done after August 4, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court also acknowledged that \"the plaintiff's billing records were poorly maintained\" and that \"much of the difficulty in preparing the case for trial, trying this case and determining the appropriate resolution of the dispute can be traced directly to the plaintiff's failure to maintain better records. Indeed, the existence of the lawsuit itself is undoubtedly tied to the plaintiff's administrative shortcomings. Just as the parameters of the renovation project [were] a constantly moving target, the precise calculation of the plaintiff's expenses was a difficult exercise, the correct resolution of which is a matter upon which the parties vehemently disagree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the basis of these findings, the trial court concluded that the defendant's conduct \"constituted a design to mislead and/or deceive the plaintiff.\" Specifically, the court concluded that the defendant's \"decision to make no further payments after August 4, 2008, was not prompted by an honest mistake as to his rights or duties. Instead, this decision was the product of [the\n   defendant's] desire to use the plaintiff to finish the project at no further\n   expense to [the defendant].\" In addition, the court concluded that the defendant's course of conduct \"was the product of [the defendant's] choosing to serve his own financial interests at the plaintiff's expense.\" Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages from the defendant, notwithstanding the fact that the agreement did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 20-429, because the defendant's refusal to pay the amounts due to the plaintiff was in bad faith. The court rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $214,039.09 on his breach of contract claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also rendered judgment for the plaintiff on all of the defendant's counterclaims. See footnote 2 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, claiming that the bad faith exception to \u00a7 20-429 that this court adopted in\n   <em>\n    Habetz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Condon\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"549792\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/224/231/#p240\">\n    224 Conn. at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=618%20A.2d%20501\">\n    618 A.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , has been abrogated by the enactment of \u00a7 20-429 (f).\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Adler\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20Conn.%20App.%20766\">\n    158 Conn.App. at 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%20555\">\n    120 A.3d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant further claimed that, even if the bad faith exception still exists,\n   the trial court incorrectly determined that he acted in bad faith because \"the only situation in which a homeowner can be found to have invoked the act in bad faith to defeat a contractor's claim for payment for work performed without an act-compliant contract is when he does so to avoid paying for services he accepted with knowledge of the act and its requirements and the intent not to pay for them by later invoking the act.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%20555\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Finally, the defendant claimed that, even under a broader bad faith standard, the plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant acted in bad faith because the evidence showed only that the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff as the result of a good faith billing dispute.

Indeed, there is no evidence that the defendant had any reason to believe as of August 4, 2008, that he had received goods and services for which he had not paid. Rather, the undisputed evidence shows that, as of May 27, 2008, the last date that the plaintiff provided a contract price to the defendant, the plaintiff estimated that the price to complete the project would be $886,954, not including certain items that the defendant had requested, and that, as of August 4, 2008, the defendant had paid the plaintiff $985,000. Although the defendant continued to ask the plaintiff to perform\n   extra work between May 27, 2008, and August 4, 2008, the trial court did not find, and the plaintiff has cited no evidence that would support a finding, that the defendant knew or should have known that this extra work would raise the contract price from $886,954 to $1,199,911, an increase of $312,957, or 35 percent, in little more than two months. Indeed, the only evidence regarding the defendant's beliefs on this issue is the defendant's September 3, 2008 e-mail to the plaintiff indicating that,\n   according to the defendant's calculations, the total cost of the project, including extras that he had approved since May 27, 2008, was $963,923, $21,077 less than he had already paid the plaintiff, and the defendant's September 16, 2008 e-mail to the plaintiff stating that he had already paid for all of the extra work performed after May 27, 2008, of which he was aware.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the defendant's conduct before August 4, 2008, could not have been in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We further conclude that the defendant's repudiation of the contract after he made his final payment to the plaintiff on August 4, 2008, was not in bad faith. The trial court expressly found that \"the plaintiff's billing records were poorly maintained,\" that \"much of the difficulty in preparing the case for trial, trying this case and determining the appropriate resolution of the dispute can be traced directly to the plaintiff's failure to maintain better records,\" and that these \"administrative shortcomings\" caused the breakdown of the relationship between the parties that, in turn, led to the defendant's termination of the contract and the plaintiff's legal action. Although the trial court found that, \"when [the defendant] made his final payment on August 4, 2008, he had no intention of ever making any further payments,\" and that the defendant \"unilaterally and arbitrarily\" decided how much he would pay the plaintiff, the court made no finding, and the plaintiff has cited no evidence that would support a finding, that the defendant knew or should have known that the plaintiff's calculations of the amounts owed to him were\n   correct, or even close to correct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only documents that the plaintiff provided\n   to the defendant after August 4, 2008, were mutually inconsistent lists of work items and prices that were not supported by invoices, receipts, checks or time sheets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the trial court\n   expressly acknowledged that \"the parties vehemently disagree\" about the amounts that are owed to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff's poor record keeping made it difficult, if not impossible, to determine the precise amounts that he was owed\n   <em>\n    even after trial\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff had presented extensive documentation of his expenses that he previously had not provided to the defendant. Thus, it is implicit in the trial court's factual findings that the plaintiff's noncompliance with the act gave rise to a genuine, good faith disagreement between the parties as to whether the defendant owed the plaintiff the amounts that the plaintiff claimed. Moreover, even if there were no genuine dispute about the value of the goods and services that the plaintiff actually provided, the plaintiff's failure to comply with the act deprived the defendant of the opportunity to make an informed decision as to whether he should continue to accept goods and services from the plaintiff during the course of the renovation project, which is the core purpose of the act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Habetz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Condon\n   </em>\n   , supra, 224 Conn. at 239,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=618%20A.2d%20501\">\n    618 A.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the fact that the defendant paid almost $1,000,000 to the plaintiff on a project that was\n   initially estimated to cost $400,000, despite the plaintiff's failure to document the cost of the goods and services that he\n   provided, strongly suggests that the defendant did not act in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To the extent that the trial court concluded that the defendant acted in bad faith when he continued to allow the plaintiff to perform work after August 4, 2008, at which point he had decided that he would make no further payments, we disagree. The trial court made no factual findings as to what items of work the plaintiff performed after that date, nor did it make any findings as to when the plaintiff billed the defendant for those items of work, and the plaintiff has cited no evidence that could provide the basis for such findings. Thus, there is simply no way of knowing whether the defendant believed in good faith that he already had paid the plaintiff for the small amount of work that the plaintiff performed after August 4, 2008,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it clearly would not be in bad faith for the defendant to allow the plaintiff to finish work for which the defendant believed that he had already paid. Moreover, it is clear that the defendant's September 3, 2008 e-mail indicating that he was prepared to pay for extra items of work if the plaintiff could establish that the amounts he claimed were correct did not induce the plaintiff to perform substantial additional work, because, according to the mechanic's lien that the plaintiff prepared and placed on the property, \"[t]he last day [that] substantial services were performed\" on the project was August 29, 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because the trial court did not find, and the evidence would not support a finding, that the defendant received goods and services from the plaintiff with the intent of invoking \u00a7 20-429 to avoid paying for them, and because the trial court found that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 20-429(a) gave rise to a genuine dispute about the value of those goods and services, we conclude that the defendant did not act in bad faith when he invoked that statute as a bar to the plaintiff's enforcement action. Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the judgment of the trial court that the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages from the defendant notwithstanding the fact that the agreement between the parties did not comply with \u00a7 20-429.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed in part and the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the defendant on the first and second counts of the plaintiff's complaint; the plaintiff's appeal from the Appellate Court affirming the trial court's denial of his request for attorney's fees is dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In this opinion PALMER, EVELEIGH, McDONALD and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   ROBINSON, J., with whom ESPINOSA, J., joins, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   I respectfully disagree with the majority's decision in the first certified appeal, SC 19560, to reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the trial\n   court's judgment in favor of the plaintiff contractor, James E.

The [trial] court found that the defendant's conduct in asking the plaintiff to continue working on the project, knowing that he would not be paying the plaintiff for that work, constituted ... neglect and/or a refusal to fulfill [his] contractual obligations to the plaintiff. The [trial] court concluded, based upon its observation of the conduct, demeanor and attitude of the witnesses-all factors that trial courts are particularly well-suited to assess-that [the\n   defendant's] decision to make no further payments after August 4, 2008, was not prompted by an honest mistake as to his rights or duties.... [Rather], this decision was the product of [the defendant's] desire to use the plaintiff to finish the project at no further expense to [the defendant, which] was faster, more efficient and vastly more economical than concluding the relationship with the plaintiff and retaining a new contractor. Thus, it was a course of conduct that was the product of [himself] choosing to serve his own financial interests at the plaintiff's expense. The [trial] court concluded that the defendant's inducement of the plaintiff to continue working on his home on the pretense that he might pay him more, all the while not intending to do so, and his subsequent invocation of the act was made in bad faith.\" (Footnote added; internal quotation marks omitted.)

I also find significant that the trial court rejected, as a factual matter, the defendant's claim that the \"charges beyond the amount he chose to pay were unwarranted,\" given the defendant's expressed need for speed in completion, and the flurry of parties giving the plaintiff orders and incurring costs at the defendant's disinterested behest throughout the project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   I agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court reasonably could have inferred that the defendant's conduct constituted bad faith, insofar as it was a \"self-serving attempt by the homeowner to receive the benefit of a bargain for which he had freely contracted without fulfilling his own duty to pay for that benefit.

The Appellate Court's opinion aptly sets forth the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. \"[P]rior to the commencement of trial in this action, the parties agreed that trial on the first count of the plaintiff's complaint, the count seeking foreclosure of his mechanic's lien on the defendant's property, would be bifurcated from the trial on his breach of contract and unjust enrichment counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court acquiesced and the case proceeded accordingly.

The plaintiff argues that this approach is unworkable because it elevates \"form over substance\" by requiring the court to convene on the record for a very brief hearing. To this end, the plaintiff relies on\n   <em>\n    A.

Thus, the defendant contends that the plaintiff's \"form over substance\" arguments ask this court to rewrite the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 52-249(a), which calls for a specific type of hearing as a prerequisite to an award of attorney's fees, namely, one to determine the form of the foreclosure judgment and the defendant's right of redemption; he posits that requiring the\n   plaintiff to pay his own attorney's fees in the absence of such a hearing is consistent with the common-law American rule under which parties pay their own attorney's fees absent a statutory or contractual exception. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    ACMAT Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Greater New York Mutual Ins.

To this end, the defendant further contends that the stipulation did not have the formalities associated with a hearing.

Given the strict construction that we must afford \u00a7 52-249(a), I conclude that the Appellate Court properly upheld the trial court's denial of the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees because no hearing on the foreclosure remedy took place in the present case. Specifically, the parties stipulated during trial that the foreclosure and merits proceedings in the present case were to be bifurcated, and the conduct of the proceedings reflects this stipulation. Once the plaintiff had prevailed at the court trial, the foreclosure remedy was the product of a second stipulation resolving the plaintiff's motion for a supplemental judgment, rather than a judicial decision following an in-\n   court proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   This stipulated judgment procedure was inconsistent with the very specific language that the legislature used in drafting \u00a7 52-249(a), which requires \"a hearing as to the form of judgment or the limitation of time for redemption ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Allowing the stipulation to substitute for the required hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   as\n   urged by the plaintiff, would run afoul of the maxim that \"a court must construe a statute as written. ...

The intent of the legislature, as this court has repeatedly observed, is to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. ...

According to the plaintiff, he gave a signed copy of the agreement to the defendant, but no such document was presented as evidence at trial and the defendant denied that he received an executed agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The trial court found, for example, that the defendant or others acting on his behalf had directed the plaintiff to assemble furniture, roll up rugs, put mattresses on beds, mow the lawn, remove brush, chop firewood, shop for a wine refrigerator and an oven hood vent, and perform other \"tasks that do not normally fall to a contractor.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The plaintiff points to no evidence that he ever provided any of these records to the defendant in support of his requests for payment before bringing this action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The trial court found that the defendant made his last payment to the plaintiff on August 4, 2008, at which time the project was \"largely complete.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The parties agreed that the foreclosure claim would be bifurcated from the plaintiff's other claims and would be addressed in a separate hearing, if necessary, after trial. After the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff on his breach of contract claim, he moved for a supplemental judgment seeking foreclosure of the mechanic's lien. The parties then stipulated that there was no need for a hearing on the terms of the judgment of foreclosure. Accordingly, the trial court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure without a hearing, and the defendant filed an amended appeal to the Appellate Court from that ruling. The trial court denied the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees because, under General Statutes \u00a7 52-249, a hearing as to the form of judgment is a condition precedent to an award of attorney's fees in a foreclosure action. The plaintiff filed a separate appeal to the Appellate Court challenging the trial court's denial of his request for attorney's fees, and the Appellate Court affirmed that ruling.

To the contrary, we have expressly left open the possibility that a homeowner's repudiation of a contract on the basis of the contractor's technical noncompliance with the act, when the contractor has satisfactorily completed the work and his conduct has not given rise to any genuine dispute about the scope of the work or the contract price, may constitute bad faith under the act. See footnote 15 of this opinion. Moreover, we cannot rule out the possibility that there may be other forms of conduct that constitute bad faith under the act. We conclude only that the plaintiff in the present case has not established that the defendant's repudiation of the contract was in bad faith under the \"escape hatch\" theory, under the detrimental reliance theory, under the technical violation theory, or under any other theory.

Similarly, the trial court's findings that the defendant was profligate, that he was disinterested in managing the cost of the project, that, by repudiating the contract, he was serving his own financial interests at the plaintiff's expense, and that he lied to the plaintiff about representing himself if the plaintiff brought an action against him do not support a finding of bad faith under these circumstances because the act placed the burden of documenting contract changes on the plaintiff and the defendant had no duty to look out for the plaintiff's financial interests.

To the contrary, the trial court concluded that the agreement did not comply with \u00a7 20-429 and that it would be unenforceable in the absence of proof of bad faith.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Although \u00a7 20-429(a) does not expressly require contractors to reduce each change in the terms and conditions of the contract to a writing, signed by both parties,\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n    the work that is the subject of the change is performed, this court has held that the purpose of the statute is to ensure that homeowners can make informed decisions as to whether to authorize additional work.

Thus, if a contractor fails to obtain written authorization from the homeowner for work before performing the work, the risk is on the contractor that the homeowner will refuse to sign a writing ratifying that the work was authorized and the contractor's claim for payment will, therefore, be unenforceable under the act, at least in the absence of proof of bad faith.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The dissent contends that the trial court never made a finding that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the act deprived the defendant of the opportunity to make informed decisions as to whether he should continue to accept goods and services from the defendant. There is no dispute, however, that the plaintiff failed to comply with the act. Nor is there any dispute that the core purpose of the act is to enable homeowners to make such informed decisions.

It is clear, therefore, that the plaintiff could not have performed a substantial amount of work after August 4, 2008. Indeed, the trial court expressly found that there was little risk to the defendant if he refused to make any further payments to the plaintiff after August 4, 2008, because the project was largely complete at that time and the defendant could easily hire another contractor to finish the work, which is what actually happened.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    We also note that the defendant included these items of extra work in his calculations showing that the total cost of the project was $963,923, while the defendant's payments totaled $985,000. Thus, when the defendant stated that he was prepared to accept these extras, but reserved the right to review whether the amounts were correct, he was essentially stating the he was reserving the right to\n    <em>\n     recoup\n    </em>\n    payments that he had already made to the plaintiff. Thus, it is difficult to understand how the plaintiff reasonably could have believed on the basis of this statement that the defendant was prepared to pay him\n    <em>\n     additional\n    </em>\n    amounts if he continued to work on the project.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    I note that Amie R.

See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 35-53(b) (providing that court \"may award reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party\" in case brought under Uniform Trade Secrets Act for wilful or malicious misappropriation); General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g(d) (\"In any action brought by a person under [Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act], the court may award, to the plaintiff, in addition to the relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees based on the work reasonably performed by an attorney and not on the amount of recovery.

I also recognize the public policy that supports promoting settlement of disputes. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Black\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Goodwin, Loomis &amp; Britton, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"300402\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/239/144/#p166\">\n     239 Conn. 144\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 166,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=681%20A.2d%20293\">\n     681 A.2d 293\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1996) ;\n    <em>\n     Tomasso Bros., Inc.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     October Twenty-Four, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525846\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/221/194/#p198\">\n     221 Conn. 194\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 198,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=602%20A.2d%201011\">\n     602 A.2d 1011\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1992). Accordingly, I do not suggest that \u00a7 52-249(a) precludes parties from settling foreclosure cases in a manner that specifically accommodates the hearing requirements of \u00a7 52-249(a), or requires an extensive on-the-record proceeding. I similarly leave to another day the type of hearing necessary to satisfy the \"specific aspects\" of the foreclosure proceeding set forth in the plain language of \u00a7 52-249(a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    In his reply brief, the plaintiff posits that a decision by this court to affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court will result in a remand to the trial court for the purpose of setting new law days with respect to the judgment of strict foreclosure of the mechanic's lien. The plaintiff states that the hearing contemplated by \u00a7 52-249(a) will take place at that time, and asks this court to determine whether he is-contrary to the conclusion of the trial court-entitled to attorney's fees for successfully prosecuting the underlying action, defending this appeal, and defending against the defendant's counterclaims, in addition to those fees relevant only to the foreclosure proceedings. Indeed, as the trial court noted in its memorandum of decision, there appears to be a Superior Court split on whether the attorney's fees awarded pursuant to \u00a7 52-249(a) may encompass the trial of the underlying action, in addition to the foreclosure aspects of the proceeding-at least prior to the Appellate Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Clem Martone Construction, LLC\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     DePino\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415528\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/145/316/#p331\">\n     145 Conn.App. at 331-32\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%20760\">\n     77 A.3d 760\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Given the majority's reversal of the judgment in favor of the plaintiff, this issue is not likely to arise on remand and I need not consider it further. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Sullivan\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Metro-North Commuter Railroad Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146117\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/150/\">\n     292 Conn. 150\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 164 and n.8,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=971%20A.2d%20676\">\n     971 A.2d 676\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
