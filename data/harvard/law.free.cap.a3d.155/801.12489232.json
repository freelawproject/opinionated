After rendering a default judgment against Leticia Posta for her failure to appear, the court found Dominic Posta liable to the plaintiff under General Statutes \u00a7 22-357\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for injuries caused by the defendants' dog and awarded the plaintiff $30,910.30 in damages and court costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the defendants claim that the court improperly (1) denied the defendant's request for a jury trial, and (2) relied on the arguments of counsel rather than reviewing the medical records that had been admitted as evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   The court reasonably could have found the following facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 19, 2012, the plaintiff was walking his\n   leashed dog, Odie, a twenty-one pound miniature schnauzer, when the defendants' dog, Sarge, a seventy-pound pit bull, came across the street and charged at the plaintiff's dog. The plaintiff grabbed Odie and placed him on his shoulder in an attempt to keep Sarge from harming him. Sarge jumped up and latched his teeth onto Odie's left hind leg, at the base of his tail and back. Although the plaintiff tried to pry Sarge off Odie, he was unsuccessful and was supporting the full weight of both dogs during the attack. Hearing the commotion, a neighbor came over to assist the plaintiff and opened the gate to allow the plaintiff and Odie to enter, thereby separating them from Sarge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff took Odie to the VCA Shoreline Veterinary Referral and Emergency Center, where he was treated for his injuries. The veterinary bill totaled $643. The plaintiff, although not bitten by the defendants' dog, suffered injuries to his thumb and back. His medical expenses totaled $3637.45. Additionally, the plaintiff was unable to work for a short period of time. On October 18, 2012, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants seeking monetary damages. Although the plaintiff initially claimed his case for a jury trial, he withdrew his jury claim on October 6, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant was a self-represented party until February 17, 2015, at which time counsel filed an appearance on his behalf. That same day, the defendant's counsel filed a motion to continue the date of the scheduled trial from February 18 to April 16, 2015. The court,\n   <em>\n    Bellis, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the defendant's motion for a continuance. Although there is nothing in the record regarding a further request for a continuance, both parties agree\n   that the defendant's counsel made a verbal request for a continuance of the trial date on February 18, 2015, which the court granted until February 19, 2015. Again, although unsupported by the record, the parties agree that the defendant also verbally requested a jury trial on February 18, 2015, which was denied by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial proceeded on February 19, 2015. The court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Edward F. Stodolink\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, heard testimony from the plaintiff, the defendant, the Stratford animal control officer, the police officer who responded to the plaintiff's 911 call on the day of the incident, and two neighbors. Additionally, fourteen exhibits were submitted into evidence by the plaintiff, which included the police incident report, the plaintiff's medical records and bills, the veterinary report and bill for Odie's treatment, and photographs of Odie's injuries. At the beginning of the trial, the plaintiff's counsel requested that the court take judicial notice of the plaintiff's life expectancy of 40.4 years. The court did so, after confirming that the defendant's counsel had no objection. After the evidence had concluded, the court heard brief closing arguments by both counsel and then rendered its judgment from the bench.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court's oral decision was as follows: \"Having heard the-the testimony of the various witnesses, I've-and through counsel the various exhibits and reports. I did not read them, but I'm sure that they were recited properly by the counsel. Based on that and the evidence I've heard or-or the arguments, I will enter a judgment in\n   favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant.\" The court then awarded economic damages covering the plaintiff's medical bills, the veterinary bills and the plaintiff's lost wages in the amount of $5080.45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   With respect to noneconomic damages, the court stated: \"According to the testimony of the plaintiff and the-the recital of the injuries, as the hospital records show, and-and the fact that the [plaintiff] has a life expectancy of forty years and it's indicated that he has continuing chronic pain to the thumb and also to his back, I will award him $25,000 .... So, the total is\n   $30,080.45 plus costs.\" The defendant filed postjudgment motions for a new trial and for remittitur, which were denied by the court after a hearing on May 28, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 23, 2015, the defendants' appellate counsel filed separate appearances on behalf of Dominic Posta and Leticia Posta. On July 30, 2015, the defendants filed this appeal. The defendants filed a motion for articulation on November 2, 2015, requesting that the trial court articulate, inter alia, the evidence it relied on in determining that the plaintiff suffered permanent injuries. The court, in its response to the motion, stated: \"The injuries to the plaintiff's left thumb and low back that occurred on May 19, 2012, continued to be symptomatic on the date of the hearing in this matter on February 19, 2015, and therefore were found to be permanent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With this background in mind, we now turn to the defendants' specific claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendants claim that they were denied their state constitutional right to a trial by jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of that claim, the defendants argue that the defendant did not agree to the plaintiff's withdrawal of the jury claim, that the defendant was a self-represented party when the plaintiff withdrew his jury claim, that the defendant's counsel asserted the defendant's right to a jury trial on February 18, 2015, and that the court \"had no discretion not to try the case to the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendants concede that the record does not contain a transcript of the proceeding at which the defendant's counsel verbally requested a jury trial and the trial court denied that request. Accordingly, the defendants seek review pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v. Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or to prevail under\n   the plain error doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the defendants' claim fails under the first and third prongs of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-215 provides in relevant part: \"The following-named classes of cases shall be entered in the docket as jury cases upon the written request of either party made to the clerk within thirty days after the return day ... civil actions involving such an issue of fact as, prior to January 1, 1880, would not present a question properly cognizable in equity ....

The defendants filed their answer on November 23, 2012. Although the plaintiff initially claimed the case to the jury list, he thereafter withdrew the jury claim on October 6, 2014. The plaintiff filed a certificate of closed pleadings and a claim for a court trial on October 21, 2014. At no time did the defendant file his own written claim for a jury trial. The defendants now argue that the defendant had been a self-represented party during that period of time and that he had not agreed to the plaintiff's withdrawal of the jury claim. Because the defendant's counsel made a\n   verbal request for a jury trial on the day of the scheduled trial, the defendants claim that the court \"had no discretion not to try the case to the jury.\" Significantly, the defendants cite no statutory or case law in support of the claim that, under such circumstances, a court is required as a matter of law to grant the request for a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Moreover, we have no transcript to review that contains the request made by the defendant's counsel or the reasons for the court's denial of that request. Without a transcript, it is not possible to determine whether the defendant acquiesced in the court's ruling or otherwise waived his right to a jury trial. Although the defendants claim the record is adequate for review under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , we disagree and conclude that the claim fails under the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nevertheless, assuming arguendo that the record is sufficient simply because a request for a jury trial was made and was denied by the court, we conclude that the defendants' claim fails under the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   . It is not disputed that the defendant did not claim the case for a jury trial within thirty days of the return date or within ten days after an issue of fact had been joined. We recognize that the plaintiff had claimed the case to the jury list and that there was no reason for the defendant to file a jury claim at that time. When\n   the plaintiff withdrew the jury claim on October 6, 2014, however, the defendant did not object to that withdrawal or file his own jury claim. Instead, the defendant waited until the scheduled date of the trial to orally request a trial by jury. By that time, the court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant's request was untimely and that he had forfeited his right to a jury trial. See\n   <em>\n    Delahunty v. Targonski\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20Conn.%20App.%20741\">\n    158 Conn.App. at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20A.3d%20727\">\n    121 A.3d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore conclude that the defendant's rights under the Connecticut constitution were not violated under the circumstances of the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendants next claim is that the court improperly relied on the arguments of counsel, rather than reviewing the medical records that had been admitted as evidence, in determining the extent of the plaintiff's injuries and the appropriate amount of damages to be awarded. Specifically, they argue that the court found that the plaintiff's injuries were permanent and awarded damages for the plaintiff's life expectancy without looking at the medical reports. The defendants further claim that the court could not rely solely on the plaintiff's testimony to determine that he had sustained a permanent injury. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court stated that various exhibits and reports had been admitted into evidence, but that \"I did not read them, but I'm sure that they were recited properly by the counsel. Based on that and the evidence I've heard or-or the arguments, I will enter a judgment in favor of the plaintiff ....\" Those remarks are not reflective of exemplary judicial behavior. It is well established that \"the trier [of fact] is bound to consider all the evidence which has been admitted, as far as admissible, for all the purposes for which it was offered and claimed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Moye v.

Both counsel referred to the medical reports during the plaintiff's testimony, and portions of the reports were read into the record. Although inartfully expressed by the court, it is apparent that the court deemed that all relevant information had been presented, and that the court was satisfied that further review of those reports would not have been of any additional benefit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With respect to the defendants' claim that the court could not rely on the plaintiff's testimony alone to conclude that his injuries were permanent, Connecticut case law has long held to the contrary. \"Our state courts have recognized that the permanency of an injury is a finding that can be determined by jurors without expert\n   testimony. This principle is based on the recognition by Connecticut courts that jurors are able to evaluate for themselves the testimony of the plaintiff, as well as the nature and duration of the injury, the likelihood of its continuance into the future, and the lack of total recovery by the time of trial. ... If a jury has the opportunity to appraise the condition of a plaintiff and its probable future consequence, an award of damages for permanent injury and for future pain and suffering is proper.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Scandariato v.
