Duryea against William H. Andrews and George H\u201e Andrews for conversion of a horse. Defendants pleaded the statute of limitations of six years. It appeared that the horse was stolen from plaintiff in or before the year 1878, and in that year came into defendants\u2019 possession. In 1889, plaintiff learned that defendants had the horse, and made a demand that they turn it over to him; and thereafter brought this action.

The only defense interposed was that of the statute of limitations, and that statute did not begin to run until the demand for the delivery of the horse in question was made on December 10, 1889. The horse having been stolen, its possession until such demand was, in contemplation of law, in the plaintiff, as he was its legal owner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
