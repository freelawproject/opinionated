The plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s assignors entered into an agreement January 29, 1880, by which a given quantity of personal property, consisting of machinery, patterns, and merchandise, was transferred from the former to the latter, to be paid for in installments, represented in amount by promissory notes ranging in times of payment between April 1, 1881, and April 1, 1889. When this action was begun (April 17, 1887) three of such notes, of $1,000 each, remained unpaid, but only one of them was due at that time. By the terms of the contract between the original parties it was agreed that \u201csaid machinery shall be the property of the said Brewer, in care, custody, and charge of said Mix Brothers, until paid for.\u201d Upon the first trial objection was made by the defendant that no recovery could be had except upon a surrender of such outstanding notes. The justice presiding made a ruling to that effect, and afforded the plaintiff an opportunity to surrender the notes, which was declined by counsel, who had the notes in court, and who claimed the right to collect upon the notes any sum over and above the amount of the verdict which the jury might render in this action. A verdict for the defendant was accordingly directed. On appeal to this court, the judgment entered thereon, and an order denying a motion for a new trial, were reversed, and a0new trial granted. 7 N. Y. Supp. 244. The prevailing opinion placed the decision upon the ground that the action might' be main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>tained without tendering the unpaid notes, because, as was there decided, the seller was confined in his remedy neither to a repossession of the property nor to the notes, but could avail himself of both. The dissenting opinion was, in substance, that, by holding on to the commercial paper, the plaintiff assumed an attitude in this forum so inconsistent with the claim made in the complaint that the court could not properly permit him to proceed; for otherwise the rescission of the original contract, which the beginning of this action necessarily made, would not be a real, but a sham, rescission, and an action might still be maintained upon each of the outstanding notes; and that the active duty rested upon the plaintiff to restore, before recovering a verdict in this action, the unpaid paper still held by him. But, as stated above, a majority of the court decided otherwise, and held that the plaintiff had his cumulative remedy of recovering the property or its value, on the ground that no sale of it had been made, and prosecuting the outstanding notes to judgment, or proving them for payment or dividends against the defendant as assignee of the estate of the Clark Manufacturing Company, upon the ground that the property had been sold to the defendant\u2019s assignors, and that a debt existed therefor. The case was treated as though the plaintiff held a chattel mortgage as collateral security for the unpaid purchase money. The new trial has been conducted in accordance with the prevailing opinion of this court on the former appeal. The same persistent purpose to affirm and disaffirm the original contract prevails throughout the case. The counsel for the plaintiff, in the course of the trial, said: \u201cNow, if the court please, I have here the three notes in question. I offer to place them in the possession of the court, or with such person or persons as the court may direct, for the purpose and with authority to indorse upon these notes whatever recovery may be obtained in this action; and, if the recovery is equal to the amount of the notes, then that the notes may be surrendered to such person or persons as the court may direct. If the recovery is less than the amount of the notes, then the amount of such recovery to be indorsed upon the notes as so much payment. \u201d It was this attitude of counsel which induced the direction of the verdict at the first trial, which decision, on appeal, a minority of the court held to be correct. But the court held, otherwise. Except for the authority of that decision, adherence to precedent, as well as legal principle, would, in my judgment, lead to a different result. But that judgment was given in this case on facts in no wise materially different from those now before us. It stands, therefore, <em>res judicata. </em>It is binding and conclusive on this and all courts of concurrent power. The present case is identical with the former appeal in the parties, in the cause of action, and in the thing sued for. It was manifestly tried in accordance with the decision of this court previously rendered. We are not, consequently, at liberty to revise the former adjudication, though the present majority of the court are committed against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">There remain, therefore, to be considered by us only such subsidiary questions, if any, arising on the second trial as were not in the former case. It is contended by the appellant that, even though there may be a recovery for certain articles, there can be none for the patterns, for the reason, as is stated, that they are not \u201c machinery, \u201d and consequently the clause of the agreement retaining title in the vendor does not apply to them. By the terms of the contract, the plaintiff agreed to sell to the defendant\u2019s assignors \u201ca certain amount of machinery, and all patterns pertaining to the lock business. * * * Said machinery shall be the property of said Brewer * * * until paid for. * * * And the Clark Manufacturing Company agree to make the above-described purchase upon the conditions therein set forth and recited.\u201d It is now argued that the word \u201cmachinery\u201d does not include the patterns, which were valued at $3,400 of the original purchase. An attentive perusal, however, of the contract leads quite irresistibly to the conclusion that if the sale was conditioned in any part, and the title retained by the seller to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>any of the property until paid for, such condition and retention of title related to the whole of the property transferred. This obvious intention of the parties would overcome the restricted meaning given by the appellant to the word \u201cmachinery,\u201d and bring the patterns within its scope, even though, except in a metaphorical sense, the patterns may not be machinery. But they clearly are a part of the machinery. The word was here used in its most comprehensive sense, and included all the devices, tools, and implements used in the manufacturing business for which they were bought. <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>61 N. Y. 33. It is also claimed by the appellant that a written certificate signed by the plaintiff on the 21st day of October, 1887, six months after this action was begun, to the effect that the payments which had been made by the purchasers had been- applied, <em>first, </em>on the merchandise, and, <em>secondly, </em>on the patterns, the surplus to apply on the residue of the indebtedness, shows that the patterns have been paid for, and that, consequently, title to them passed absolutely to the Clark Manufacturing Company. But such certificate, in the absence of some agreement that title to certain classes of the property should become absolute when a given amount of the purchase money had been paid, which is nowhere shown, is meaningless, and has no bearing upon the question. The case is not materially different from the record of the former appeal. It follows, therefore, in pursuance of such previous decision, that the judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Dwight, P.

In 1880, the Clark Manufacturing Company was doing business in making builders\u2019 hardware in the city of Buffalo. On the 29th day of January of that year the following agreement was made between the plaintiff and the company:</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">\u201cOffice of Westfield Look-Works.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">\u201cWestfield, N. Y., January 29, 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">\u201cMemorandum of agreement, made the day above written, between E. B. Brewer, of Westfield, N. Y., and the Clark Manufacturing Company, of Buffalo, N. Y. F. B. Brewer agrees to sell to the Clark Manufacturing Company a certain amount of machinery, and all patterns pertaining to lock business, now owned by him in the Jock factory at Westfield. A list of said machinery has been made, and the prices fixed, and the amount will be about seven thousand dollars, more or less; the transfer to be made on or about the first day of April, when any changes which Mix Brothers may deem necessary or expedient, in choice or character of the machinery, or the price of machinery or merchandise, shall be finally established. Said machinery shall be the property of said Brewer, in care and custody of said Mix Brothers, until paid for. The said Brewer agrees to accept in payment for said purchase, as conditioned above, five hundred dollars on the first day of April prox., five hundred dollars with interest on. whole amount unpaid on the first day of April, 1881, and $1,000.00 and interest on whole amount unpaid on the first day of April thereafter, until all is paid. Notes to be given for the several amounts. And the said Clark Manufacturing Company agree to make the above-described purchase upon the conditions therein set forth and recited. For the faithful performance of the above-written agreement, the parties bind themselves, each to the other, in the sum of five thousand dollars, as witness their hands and seals, day and date above written.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">\u201cFrancis B.

F. B. Brewer. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">negotiable notes were executed and delivered in pursuance of the contract. All the notes were paid, including interest on the three last of a thousand dollars each, to April 1, 1887. On the 17th day of that month the firm made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors to the defendant. The plaintiff, on the 5th day of May of that year, made the following demand in writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\"><em>\u201cTo James B. Ford, </em>Bsq.\u2014Dear Sir: You will please take notice that I, the undersigned, am the owner and entitled to the immediate possession of the machinery and personal property hereinafter described, now in your possession and under your control, and of the value set opposite each item, respectively, to-wit. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Then comes a statement of the property, consisting mostly of machinery, and also the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">\u201cPatterns, ------- $8,400 00\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The whole value of the items stated in the demand is $3,539. The demand closes with the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">\u201cAnd you will further take notice that I do hereby require and demand the possession or delivery of said machinery and personal property to me from you.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\"><em>\u201cBated this </em>5 <em>th day of May, </em>1887.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">\u201cFrancis B. Brewer, Claimant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">The defendant did not deliver the property, and on the 12th day of May, 1887, the plaintiff brought trover, alleging the conversion of the above articles of property, and demanding judgment for $5,000. Issue was joined. The cause was first tried at the Erie circuit in October, 1887, when the court directed a verdict for the defendant. On appeal a new trial was granted. 7 N. Y. Supp. 244. The cause was again tried in February, 1890, and resulted in a verdict of $3,515 for the plaintiff. A motion for a new trial was made and denied. Judgment was entered on the verdict, and the defendant appealed to this court from the judgment and order. It appeared, on the trial that the prices finally fixed amounted in the aggregate to $9,000, instead of $7,000, as first estimated; that $6,000 of principal, also interest on the whole amount secured, were the sums paid in all by the firm. The agreed price of the machinery and tools when purchased was $3,585, and the patterns, $3,400, and of the merchandise, $2,015. All the payments had been made before the making of the certificate, a copy of which appears above. The evidence also tended to show that the three unpaid notes, before they fell due, were sold by the plaintiff to the Westfield Bank, indorsed by him; that he afterwards paid them, and had them in his possession at the last trial, when they were all due. There was considerable evidence given on the subject of the value of the property on the trial. Some of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that the property alleged to be converted was equal, if not greater, in value than the verdict; while the evidence on the part of the defendant tended to show that the property was very much less in value, and there was some evidence on the part of the plaintiff to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">The trial justice charged the jury, in substance, that if they found for the plaintiff' their verdict would be the value of the property, with interest from the time of the conversion, but that it could not be more than the amount unpaid on the notes, including interest. The verdict was for the exact amount unpaid upon the notes. The evidence on both sides tended to show that the property referred to in the agreement was delivered to the defendant\u2019s .assignors; that the patterns were frequently changed or replaced; and that the other property, except the machinery, had been to a considerable extent disposed of. All the evidence showed that the value of the machinery, outside the patterns, was very much less than the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The first question which naturally presents itself is whether the plaintiff could so far disaffirm the conditional sale as to maintain trover for the property, and then recover the amount unpaid on the notes. The rule in reference to the election of remedies is very familiar. In the case at bar, the plaintiff could have enforced payment of the notes by action; and, if he failed to collect, he could take the machinery, the title to which, by the terms of the contract, was to remain in him until payment, or on default he could bring replevin or trover. Either action necessarily proceeds on the assumption that all the rights of the defendant under the contract are ended, and that by reason of default in payment, the plaintiff could retake his property, having never parted with the title. Trover involves a wrongful conversion. In other words, the action could not be maintained unless retention of the property by the defendant was wrongful. It needs no argument to prove that the retention of the property would not be wrongful so long as the plaintiff looked upon the executory contract as continuing, and the right to recover the unpaid purchase money unimpaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The theory of a conversion and the continuance of the contract, so that the unpaid purchase money could be collected, is entirely inconsistent. The plaintiff had his election to pursue any of his remedies, but, having elected one remedy, all others are irrevocably gone. <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>113 N. Y. 450, 21 N. E. Rep. 172; <em>Bodermund </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>46 N. Y. 354; <em>Steinbach </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>77 N. Y. 498; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>92 N. Y. 596; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>93 N. Y. 233; <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>95 N. Y. 237; <em>Moller </em>v. <em>Tuska, </em>87 N. Y. 166; <em>Sweetser </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>5 N. Y. Supp. 378. In the case last cited, <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Benedict, </em>88 N. Y. 610, is shown to decide no different doctrine; it being there merely held that a replevin suit, where all the property was not taken, would not prevent a pursuit of other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The learned counsel for the respondent in his brief correctly states his position in saying: \u201cThis action is brought upon the conditional sale, <em>and is by virtue of the contract itself, and in pursuance of its terms, and therefore an enforcement of said contract, and not a rescission thereof.\u201d </em>The parts italicised are so in the brief. The trial justice adopted this view, and all his rulings were based on the assumption that the plaintiff could maintain trover, and also recover, in an action on contract, -the balance unpaid upon the notes. The amount paid by the defendant\u2019s assignors on the conditional contract was in pursuance of its provisions, and no reason is seen why the defendant should be entitled to recover back the sums paid. But a different question arises as to the unperformed part \u00f3f the contract. When the action was brought there were outstanding negotiable notes not then due. The plaintiff elected to treat the conditional sale as ended, and the continued possession of the property in the assignors or their assignees as wrongful, which entitled the defendant to the return of the unpaid notes. The moment he took this position, it logically and necessarily followed that, from the time of this election, he treated the executory contract as at an end. He could not, on the one hand, enforce payment under the provisions of the contract, and on the other repudiate it, and recover the property or its value in an action of tort. On the former appeal the learned justice, delivering the prevailing opinion, states, among other things: \u201cThe plaintiff has a right to take possession of the property as against the vendee, for the purpose of preserving his security and enforcing his right to have the property devoted to the payment of his debt.\u201d It is obvious that the learned justice fell into the error of assuming that title had vested in the defendant\u2019s assignors, and that the plaintiff held the property simply as security. The distinction between a conditional sale and chattel mortgage does not seem to have been noticed. In the present case, the defendant\u2019s assignors obtained no title, but were merely bailees for the plaintiff. <em>Comer </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>77 N. Y. 391-398; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Bye, </em>46 N. Y. 500; <em>Herring </em>v. <em>Hoppock, </em>15 N. Y. 409; <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Burgett, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>40 N. Y. 314. A demand of the property, and the bringing of trover, was decisive of the election of the plaintiff to treat the conditional contract as ended. <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>49 N. Y. 164. All the cases agree that inconsistent remedies cannot be pursued. <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Fearey, </em>19 linn, <em>277; Cobb </em>v. <em>Hatfield, </em>46 N. Y. 533; <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>21 Hun, 293, affirmed 86 N. Y. 76; <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>36 Hun, 513-522; <em>Iselin </em>v. <em>Henlein, </em>16 Abb. N. C. 73-80; <em>Fertilizer Co. </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>106 N. Y. 555, 13 N. E. Rep. 943; <em>Avila </em>v. <em>Chemical Co., </em>32 Hun, 1; <em>Wile </em>v. <em>Brovmstein, </em>35 Hun, 68. The same doctrine applies to conditional sales. <em>Keinbockle </em>v. <em>Zugbaum, </em>5 Mont. 344, 5 Pac. Rep. 897; <em>Fress, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>43 Hun, 449-452.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The trial in this case proceeded on the assumption that this action was entirely consistent with a recovery upon the notes for any deficiency. The learned counsel for the respondent argues that, inasmuch as the court charged that there could be no recovery beyond the amount unpaid on the notes with interest, and as the verdict was exactly that sum, even if the trial proceeded on a wrong theory, the defendant was not injured. The difficulty with this reasoning is that it assumed the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover the value of the property in trover, and also the balance unpaid upon the notes on contract; also that it is impossible to know to what extent the wrong theory adopted on the trial affected the amount of the verdict. The jury had a right and assumed that in .one sense they were finding a verdict fo.r the amount due the plaintiff.. It is true that the value of the property would determine the amount of the verdict, but it is clear that the theory of the trial induced the jury to take into consideration the amount due upon the notes in estimating this value. There was no.evidence showing that the value of the property was the .precise amount due. upon the notes. If the jury had been instructed that the plaintiff\u2019s election to bring trover would prevent an action on the notes, other considerations might have influenced them in determining the question of value. \u201cMachinery\u201d is defined by Webster as \u201cthe working parts of a machine, engine, or instrument, arranged and constructed so as to apply and regulate force; as the machinery of a watch. The means and appliances by which anything is kept in action.\u201d Worcester\u2019s definition is, \u201cAn artificial work which serves to apply or regulate moving power, or-to produce motion; an engine; a piece of mechanism.\u201d The contract is, \u201csaid machinery shall be the property of said Brewer.\u201d More than seven years later the plaintiff construed this clause by stating that the amounts paid had been <em>applied\u2014First, </em>on merchandise; <em>second, </em>on patterns; and, <em>third, </em>all surplus t.o apply in balance of their indebtedness. Ho indebtedness appears except for merchandise, patterns, and machinery. The pay ments made were therefore, naturally, .applied, in the extinguishment of those portions of the debt arising from the sale of property, the title to which passed; but .as to the machinery, the title to which was retained in the plaintiff, no applications were made until the rest of the indebtedness was paid. A pattern is a mere model which may be used to construct machinery and-create working implements, and such are the above definitions. But it cannot be said with any force or plausibility that a model or pattern is a \u201cmachine,\u201d within any known definition of that term. The contract itself makes a distinction between patterns and machinery. Where property is delivered under a contract of sale, no construction should be adopted retaining title in the vendor without clear and unambiguous language. It is generally true that delivery in pursuance of a contract of sale is presumed to vest title in the vendee, and, if for any reason it is retained in the vendor, this is so by virtue of the terms of the contract. In addition to this, the demand itself speaks of machinery and other personal property, and in the bill of items the machinery is given in detail, while the patterns are lumped up by the use of that word, and valued at $3,400. Besides, models or patterns are frequently changed or modified, as was the case in this manufacturing estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>lishment. To retain title in the vendor of those originally delivered would breed uncertainty and confusion. The contract limited the retention of title in the vendor to machinery, which in its nature is more permanent and traceable. <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>61 N. Y. 26, is entirely consistent with the above views. In that case a policy of fire insurance was issued upon a stock of materials for manufacturing paper, and on paper manufactured and in process of manufacture, and on machinery contained in a paper-mill at West Milton, Saratoga county. In the syllabus it is stated that the word \u201c\u2018machinery,\u2019 as used in the policy, included not only the machines, but the tools and implements used-therewith for the manufacture of paper.\u201d The case does not show what these tools or implements were, and the only reference made to the subject is at the close of the opinion, and is in the following language: \u201cThe loss upon machinery, as claimed by the plaintiff in his inventory, was $1,913.66. This was covered by insurance in this company for $500, and in two other companies, each for $500, making in all $1,500, which was upward of $400 less than the loss. Even if a few of the items contained in the inventory were not actually machinery, the value of such items was not $400; and hence the plaintiff was clearly entitled to recover the full amount of his insurance. \u201d It is obvious that the property was fairly included in the description; besides, the question was not passed upon, as the above quotation sufficiently shows. The verdict in the present case was not only for the value of the machinery, but also of the patterns, and to that extent was excessive. Without considering the other questions in the case, it follows that the judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
