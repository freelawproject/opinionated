That a deed of the land was executed by said heirs to defendant Amzi L. Fancher containing the same reservation and exception. That the widow of said Henry Fancher was dead. That Susan Fancher had married Charles Thompson, and died intestate, without issue, and that said Charles Thompson was duly appointed administrator of her estate. That Juliette Nanny, who was the wife of plaintiff, had died, leaving a will which was admitted to probate, and which was set forth, containing the following provision; \u201cI give and bequeath all my personal property of whatsoever name or kind I am possessed of, and also all I have in expectancy from my deceased father\u2019s estate, to my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>beloved husband, Oliver T.

The action is substantially fora specific performance of a written contract, and all persons interested are made parties. There is no difficulty in administering full relief to all, and it is a case where equity will decree a performance of the agreement. We think, also, the plaintiff may maintain the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
