The evidence was abundant to warrant the\" verdict, and the facts proved established defendant\u2019s liability beyond all question. So, also, the charge, proceeding partly upon the theory that to entitle plaintiff to a recovery he must establish defendant\u2019s negligence and absence of contributory negligence on his part, was more favorable to defendants than they had a right to ask. Wood, Nuis. \u00a7 295 et seq., and cases cited; <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>51 N. Y. 224; <em>Creed </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>29 N. Y. 591; <em>Congreve </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>18 N. Y. 79; <em>Congreve </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>Id. 84. The question addressed to and answered by plaintiff\u2019s medical witness, Dr. Palmer: \u201cWhat results will follow with reasonable certainty from the injuries which you observed?\u201d\u2014was competent and proper, and was in strict accord with the ruling in <em>Strohm </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>96 N. Y. 305. So, also, the testimony of John K. Forde, a witness for the plaintiff, as to the nature, appearance, and use of the structure claimed to be an encroachment upon the public highway, within a few hours after the injuries to the plaintiff, was relevant, and therefore competent, and properly allowed. The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
