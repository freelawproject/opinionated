Action to restrain the maintenance and operation of defendants\u2019 railway along the highway in front of plaintiff\u2019s premises, and to recover for past injuries to plaintiff\u2019s property from the presence and operation of said railway. The single error urged in impeachment of the judgment is the refusal of the referees by whom the case was tried to find, as a conclusion of law, that \u201cplaintiff is not entitled to recover damages for deterioration of the neighborhood caused by the construction and operation of defendants\u2019 road.\u201d So far as this refusal may be supposed to affect the amount to be paid by defendants in avoidance of the injunction, if error at all, it is not an error available for reversal of the judgment. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Railway Co., ante, </em>546, (now decided.) But the refusal of the finding is no error, even in respect of the recovery for past damages. It is a preposterous assumption that the learned referees allowed anything to plaintiff, as a substantive ground for recovery, for the deterioration of the neighborhood, <em>i. e., </em>for injury to other people\u2019s property; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>and a court cannot, with propriety, be called upon to negative an obviously atid indisputably absurd proposition. Besides, the conclusion of law propounded by defendants was utterly irrelevant to any claim of plaintiff apparent in the complaint or presented on the trial, and for that reason alone was properly rejected by the referees. But that the fact of the deterioration of the neighborhood caused by defendants\u2019 railroad was competent and relevant evidence on the issue as to the deterioration of plaintiff\u2019s property, is expressly-affirmed in <em>Drucker\u2019s Case, </em>106 N. Y. 157, 12 N. E. Rep. 568, where the court say: \u201cTo measure and appreciate the individual loss to plaintiff, the nature and extent of the general injury was properly and necessarily considered.\u201d We see no error in the record, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
