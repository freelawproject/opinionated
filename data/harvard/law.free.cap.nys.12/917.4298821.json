De Klyn, as assignee of the executors of Frank E. Bean, against the Silver Lake Ice Company, to recover damages for breach of a contract by defendant to deliver ice to said Bean. It appeared that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>contract was made on or about September 30, 1887; that, by its terms, Bean was to allow defendant the use of certain dock privileges, etc., for delivering the ice until April 1, 1888, and that all the ice agreed for was to be taken before May 1, 1888. Defendant offered in evidence a letter written by Bean to defendant\u2019s agent, Samuel W. Hash, Jr., as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b936-4\">\u201cHew York, Mch. 5th, 1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b936-5\"><em>\u201cS.

Nash, Jr., </em>Agt.\u2014Dear Sir: You are occupying my bridge, have broken contract with me, and from day to day for bridge scales, etc., shall charge you $10.00 per day, for each barge $5.00 per day, and each canal-boat $3.00 per day. Will take your ice at market price, but not as on contract with Silver Ice Co. My contract was for ice, not snow. If you desire to sell me any ice, please quote me price, and I will buy ice of you, not snow. See me at your earliest convenience. If I don\u2019t hear from you by to-morrow we shall notify S. Lake Ice Co. of same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b936-6\">\u201cResp\u2019y yours, F. E.

Please make out bill for us\u00e9 of same from the date of your notification that you would not continue contract with S. L.

J., and Freedman and Ingraham, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b936-13\"><em>Morrison &amp; Kennedy, (H. Morrison </em>and <em>L. J. Morrison, </em>of counsel,) for appellant. <em>Putnam &amp; Slocum, (Wallace Macfarlane, </em>of counsel,) for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b936-14\">Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANu\">The evidence given at the trial established that the contract, upon which this action was brought, had been rescinded by the letters of March 5th and March 15th, and consequently no action can be maintained upon it by either party. The claim of the plaintiff that the letter of March 5th should be treated as a mere <em>brutum fnlmen </em>cannot be sustained. There having been a rescission,\u2018proof of deliveries of ice subsequent to March 17th could not have the effect of reinstating the contract. Such deliveries may have been made at market rates as proposed by the letter of March 5tli, but it was not necessary to determine the precise point. The letters excluded are not printed in the case, and, consequently, it cannot be held that their exclusion on the ground of immateriality constituted error. Upon the whole case no sufficient reason appears for disturbing the judgment. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">Sedgwick, C.
