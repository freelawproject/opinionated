The application was opposed by Obed Wheeler, administrator of said Thomas Wheeler, who had deceased before the proceedings in insolvency. From an order directing the cancellation and discharge of the judgments, the administrator appealed. For opinion on a similar motion to vacate a judgment, see 7 N. Y.

There is no reason shown to suppose that at the time of making the application the petitioner was aware of the death of his creditor, which was then recent. Not every omission or error will make insolvent proceedings void. If honestly prosecuted, the inclination and duty of the court will be to disregard errors that have not caused injury. The brief of the appellant states that one of the judgments canceled by the special term order was entered in a justice\u2019s court, and that, being docketed in the county clerk\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>office, it became a judgment of the county court, and that the motion for discharge should be addressed to that tribunal. But the petition avers the judgment was entered in the supreme court on February 24,1876. The opposing affidavit does not deny that such a judgment was entered, and the order appealed from directs the cancellation of such judgment. If it be true that a judgment was entered on the 23d of February, 1876, in a justice\u2019s court, it is not aimed at or affected by this proceeding. It may well be that, to cancel that judgment, resort should be had to the county court. Order appealed from affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
