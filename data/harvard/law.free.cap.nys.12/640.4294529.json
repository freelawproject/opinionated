Bartholic. Decree for probate. Contestants appeal. Code Civil Proc. N. Y. \u00a7 2588, provides that, when the reversal or modification of a decree is founded upon a question of fact, the appellate court must, if the appeal was from a decree upon a petition to admit a will to-probate, or to revoke a probate, make an order directing a trial by jury upon the material questions of fact.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b658-13\">Argued before Dwight, P.

The objections to the testimony of this witness were overruled upon the ground that such transactions and communications were not personal to herself, but only in her presence. The law now seems to be settled that this testimony was inadmissible. <em>In re Eysaman's Will, </em>113 N. Y. 62, 20 N. E. Rep. 613; <em>In re Dunham, </em>121 N. Y. 575, 24 N. E. Rep. 932. Such being the case, we have felt called upon, in our consideration of this appeal, to reject the testimony of the witness (Lizzie Wiggins) referred to; and, in its absence, as already intimated, a case upon the facts is not made to our satisfaction for the admission of this will to probate. We have therefore reached the conclusion that the decree of the surrogate should be reversed upon a question of fact, and that a trial by jury should be had of the material questions of fact arising upon the issues between the parties. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 2588. So ordered. Order to be settled by the presiding justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
