J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXeK\">On the morning of November 11, 1887, plaintiff\u2019s intestate, Thomas Fitzgerald, then a brakeman in the employ of the defendant, .was passing over its road eastwardly from Syracuse, and between 5 and 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>o\u2019clock in the morning the train, in passing eastwardly from Greens Corners, and distant from the station of Greens Corners 5,153 feet, passed under a superstructure known as \u201cWheeler\u2019s Bridge. \u201d Just before the train reached the bridge, the intestate passed from the engine to the tender, and from thence up onto the first car, where he was last seen alive. Shortly after the train had passed from under the bridge he was discovered lying a little south of the walk-way near the center of the car, apparently dead. The train ran on down to Borne. He was at the time acting as head brakeman on the train. When passing Greens Corners he sat on the seat with the fireman, who had some conversation with him, and just east of Greens Corners he remarked to the fireman, \u201cWe are going down a grade out here, are we not?\u201d The fireman replied in the affirmative; the fireman told him that he \u201cneed not get on top, as it was not necessary to hold it going down that grade;\u201d he then went and \u201cstood in the gangway between the engine and the tank. \u201d The fireman testifies that he repeated to the deceased three times \u201cthat there was no necessity\u201d to \u201cgo on top;\u201d and the fireman further testifies: \u201cThe engineer was then sitting on his side, opposite me on the right-hand side, and watching in front.\u201d The fireman further testified: \u201cAfter I had called to him three times I saw him standing on the top of the car next to the tender. He was standing clear up on top of it. . 1 spoke to him three times in all,\u2014first before he got off the seat, and twice after. I called to him the third time when he was climbing up the ladder to get on the car. I called- him again to come back, that he shouldn\u2019t get up there; that there was no need of setting the brakes. When he commenced climbing up onto this car he was perhaps about \u25a0 halfway between the station and the bridge; -I should judge it was between five and six o\u2019clock a. m. After I saw him standing on top of that first car I did not notice him again until after we had passed the bridge. I then climbed up the ladder till I could see on this first car. 1 saw him lying down very near the center of the car. I went back and reported, and the engineer blew brakes.\u201d The fireman testifies: \u201cIt was a cold, disagreeable, cloudy morning. It was not fairly daylight yet. I won\u2019t say as to whether there was difficulty in seeing a great ways.\u201d The train had 32 ears, 29 of which were refrigerator cars. The refrigerator cars are 12 feet, 5 inches above' the tracks; ordinary cars are 10 feet, 9 inches. There was no evidence given upon the trial of the height of the deceased. Evidence was given tending to show that there were no \u201ctell-tales\u201d or warning signals erected or maintained\u2019 west of the bridge to give warning that the train was approaching a low bridge. It was therefore insisted in behalf of the plaintiff that the defendant had not complied with the provisions of chapter 439 of the Laws of 1884. By the second section of that act it is provided that every steam railroad shall \u201cerect, and thereafter maintain, such suitable warning signals at every low bridge or structure which crosses the railroad above the tracks, where such warning signals may be necessary for the protection of employes on top of cars from injury, \u201d and our attention is called to <em>Willy </em>v. <em>Mulledy, </em>78 N. Y. 314, where it was said that \u201c when a statute imposes a duty upon a public officer, it is well settled that any person having a special interest in the performance thereof may sue for a breach thereof, causing him damage, and the same is true of a duty imposed by statute upon any citizen;\u201d and it is insisted in behalf of the respondent that the deceased had a right to suppose that the defendant had complied with the provisions of the statute to which reference has been made. However, if the deceased had become aware of the fact that there had not been a compliance with the statute, that no \u201ctell-tales\u201d or signals or warnings had been erected west of the bridge, it was his duty to use care and caution in approaching the bridge to avoid receiving injuries therefrom. The case seems to be barren of any evidence indicative of any watchfulness or care on the part of - the deceased to avoid the injury which came to him. It therefore becomes important to inquire whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>was aware of the fact that the bridge was such an one as required him to, avoid an erect position in passing under it, he being upon the top of the car. It appears by the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witness Mitchell, who was a conductor upon the train, that \u201con the morning of November 11, 1887, the weather was somewhat stormy; it was dark.\u201d It snowed, and blew from the north-west. And it further appears: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s intestate went up the road westerly with me; at the Wheeler bridge we were in the caboose together in the evening. It was between daylight and dark, so you could see. Our lights were lit in the caboose.\u201d The witness further continues and testified as follows: \u201cWe passed Wheeler\u2019s bridge seven to ten minutes after leaving Home at 5:20. I understood this was Fitzgerald\u2019s first trip as a brakeman on through freight. While in the cupola I told him we were then going up Wheeler\u2019s grade. That commences just a little ways out of Borne. I told' him that it extended beyond the bridge. He said There is a bridge above here somewhere, isn\u2019t there? \u2019 I told him there was, and I would show it to him as soon as we got there. I showed him the bridge, the one spoken of on this trial. I told him to look out for all-bridges; that.I didn\u2019t know but that the bridge might clear him on an ordinary car, and on a higher car it might not; that I would not be positive as to either. He said he had been up at' Wheeler\u2019s bridge before. I asked him how, and he said he had been there on a work train. As we reached the bridge I spoke, of it to him, of its being the Wheeler bridge. The 10th was a pleasant day. The light was then so we could see the bridge very plainly. The look-out or cupola in the top of the caboose is higher than the highest cars. He stayed in the cupola with me until we reached De Witt. \u201d According to this witness\u2019 testimony the deceased had an opportunity to inspect, observe, and learn the condition of the bridge; and, according to this witness\u2019 testimony, the deceased, while engaged upon working trains on previous occasions in the employ of the defendant, had been in promixity with the bridge. If this evidence is accepted as it is stated, it seems to indicate that the deceased was aware, not only of the fact that the bridge was there, but that it was a low bridge, and that apparently he learned that there were no warnings or tell-tales to direct his attention when appreaching from the west. The evidence brings the case, if believed, within the principle laid down by the court of appeals, \u2022 second division, in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>116 N. Y. 632, 22 N. E. Rep. 1117. In the opinion-delivered in that case it was said: \u201cThe.only question which we shall consider in this case is as to whether or not the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, and this depends upon the question as to whether he knew,, or ought to have known, that this bridge was low, and that he could not pass under it while standing upon the top of the box car. \u201d The learned judge, after quoting the evidence in that case, proceeds to observe: \u201cIt is quite ev-. ident- from this testimony that he had, on numerous occasions, passed under this bridge whilst on top of the train, and if so, he must have known, had he exercised ordinary care and observation, that it was not of sufficient height to permit a person to pass under it whilst standing upon the top of a box-car of the company. * * * And inasmuch as such negligence appears from his own testimony, the exception to the refusal of the defendant\u2019s motion for a nonsuit was well taken.\u201d In <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>4 N. Y. Supp. 381, it was held that \u201cthe plaintiff is not entitled to recover, as it was shown that the deceased had passed these bridges for three months, and that it was fully understood by the employes- of the defendant\u201d the conditions of the signals or warnings which were placed, and the omissions of others which the plaintiff insisted were necessary; although that case is distinguishable from the one before us, in that the deceased had been for a greater length of time accustomed to pass and repass the bridges where the accident occurred; and, while there were some warning signals, and others were omitted, it was said \u201cthat the warning signals were apparent, and the deceased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>assumed the risk of the omission of any others.\u201d It was suggested by the learned counsel for the respondent upon the argument, that the jury had a right to reject and disbelieve the testimony of Mitchell, because he was a conductor in the employ of the defendant, but it appears the plaintiff called him as a witness and thereby vouched for his credibility, <em>(Hunt </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>4 Barb. 324,) and nothing is to be perceived in his testimony rendering the same improbable. Nor do the circumstances detailed by him give rise to the suspicion that he has stated anything other than the truth. While the learned judge carefully commented upon the evidence, yet, in speaking of the question we have been considering, he perhaps did not, with his usual accuracy and clearness, express to the jury the rule of law applicable to the evidence which has been adverted to. I-Ie said: \u201cThen there is another thing which is suggested why he was guilty of contributory negligence, and that is that he had been informed that there was a low bridge, and, therefore, he was negligent in not looking out for it and escaping. That is a question for you as the other is. Of course, if he did know and realize that, at that particular point, there was this low bridge, then you may say whether he exercised ordinary care or not in passing along, standing upright upon the car, without recollecting the bridge and getting out of the way. As has been suggested, merely forgetting what the condition of things was, forgetting that he was in a dangerous locality, will not do, because that is his negligence.\u201d Later on, the judge expressly refused to charge \u201cthat there is no proof in the case\u201d that the deceased \u201cdid not know the danger of the Wheeler bridge.\u201d These views lead us to the conclusion that a new trial should be ordered. Judgment and order reversed on the exceptions, and anew trial ordered, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
