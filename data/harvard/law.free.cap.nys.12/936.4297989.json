All of said materials were so sold and delivered after August 2, 1888, and all of said brushes after that date, except $1,263.39, in value of the same.\u201d He also found a payment had been made of $2,085.13. He also found the defendant indebted in $7.88, for moneys expended to the use of the defendant. As conclusions of law the referee found \u201cthat the counter-claim set up in the defendant\u2019s answer is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>available to the defendant, or allowable against the state in this action or court.\u201d In the defendant\u2019s answer it was stated that sundry orders had been delivered to the officers of the Hew York State Reformatory at Elmira, and that the same had been accepted by the superintendent; that the orders had not been filled, and that \u201cthe plaintiff herein had, for a good and valuable consideration, agreed to make, manufacture, and produce for the defendant, and deliver to him a large quantity of brushes, many thousand gross in number, and of various kinds and descriptions, which particular kinds and descriptions this defendant is now unable to designate; that of said orders, contracts, and agreements some, on the said 2d day of August, 1888, had been partially carried out, and kept by the said plaintiffs, and a partial number of the brushes so to be manufactured by the plaintiffs, and delivered to the defend.ant, only have been so manufactured and delivered, while others of said orders or agreements the said plaintiff had not even partially complied with, or carried out, on <em>the </em>said 2d day <em>of </em>August, 1888, and they had not manufactured or delivered to the defendants any of the brushes or goods which, under such orders or agreements, they had contracted to manufacture and deliver. * * * And defendant further alleges that, by reason aforesaid set forth in this second answer, and defense, all of which matters are herein set forth upon information and .belief, he, the said defendant, has been damaged in at least the sum of $10,000; and such sum this defendant asks this court to set off against any sum the plaintiffs may, upon the trial of this action, show themselves entitled to by reason of the matters set forth, in the said complaint; and defendant asks that such damages as said defendant may show himself entitled to by reason of the matters set forth in this second answer and defense upon the trial of this action may be used to cancel or offset to the extent thereof the damages which the plaintiffs may, upon the trial hereof, show themselves entitled to by reason of the matters set forth in their said complaint, and that plaintiffs\u2019 said complaint be dismissed, with costs, and for such other or further relief as to the court may seem just and proper.\u201d Defendant gave some evidence.tending to.establish the allegations of his answer. The case states: \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 counsel seasonably objected to all testimony offered by defendant tending to prove the counter-claim or cause of action alleged in the answer, on the ground that such claim was not available to the defendant, <em>or </em>allowable against the state in this action, and, at the close of all the evidence, duly requested the referee to so find and hold.\u201d The appellant requested the referee to find: \u201cThe defendant is entitled to recoup or counter-claim against the claim of the state, and the amount due from the defendant to the state in this action, the said sum of damages, or so much thereof as may be necessary.\u201d The referee refused so to find. An exception was taken to such refusal, and defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b955-5\">Argued before Hardin, P. J., and Martin and Merwin, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b955-6\"><em>Frederick Collin, </em>for appellant. <em>Chas. F. Tabor, </em>Atty. Gen., and <em>Erasing F.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyR\">Appellant\u2019s answer set up new matter, and, under the answer, he sought to establish new and' independent orders given to the plaintiff, accepted by the plaintiff; a failure to perform in accordance-with the orders and acceptances, and, by reason of the breach, to be allowed such prospective profits as would have come to him in the event of a fulfillment of the orders. Such new matter constituted a counter-claim. <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>63 Barb. 547. Assuming that such new matter constitutes a cause of action in favor of the defendant, and that equitably and justly he was entitled to recover, by reason of such new matter, damages from the state, the question here presented is whether or no such recovery or allowance can be had in this action. If the plaintiff had not commenced this action, it is very clear and well settled by an unbroken line of authorities that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>could not have brought and maintained an action against the state. In seeking redress for the injuries sustained by him, if any, by reason of a breach of the terms of the orders referred to in his answer, his remedy would necessarily have been sought - in a court of claims established by the state for ascertainment of damages in such and other eases. <em>People </em>v. <em>Denison, </em>59 How. Pr. 157; affirmed, 84 N. Y. 272. Judge Rapallo, in speaking of the counter-claim in the case just cited, says: \u201cAnother mode of redress is provided by statute in such cases, and if the defendants have any just claim against the state they must apply for relief to the board of audit, the tribunal instituted by the state for passing upon such claims. As this claim was not triable or recoverable in this action, the judgment rendered herein does not conclude the defendants in respect thereto. \u201d In <em>Reeside </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>11 How. 290, it was said: \u201cTo permit a demand in set-off against the government to be proceeded on to judgment against it would be equivalent to the permission of a suit to be prosecuted against it; and, however this may be tolerated between individuals, by a species of reconvention, when demands in set-off are sought to be recovered, it could not be as against the government except by a mere evasion, and must be as useless in the end, as it would be derogatory to judicial fairness.\u201d In <em>O'Hara </em>v. <em>State, </em>112 N. Y. 154,19 N. E. Rep. 659, it was said: \u201cThere is but little analogy between the position of a state in reference to the prosecution of claims against it and the condition of a citizen, subject at all times and in numerous tribunals to be brought into court and be prosecuted for his liabilities.. The state can be prosecuted, in a legal sen\u00e1e, only by its own consent, and after it has created a tribunal to hear and decide claims against it.\u201d In <em>Rexford </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 N. Y. 281,11 N. E. Rep. 514, it was said: \u201cThe state can only be sued by its own consent, and for liabilities which it chooses to assume. <em>People </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>84 N. Y. 272, 281. And this has been expressly held where the cause of action alleged rested upon some misfeasance or non-feasance. \u201d Appellant has called our attention to <em>Danolds </em>y. <em>State, </em>decided in this court in December, 1881, and affirmed by the court of appeals. 89 N. Y. 86. We find nothing in that case which sustains the contention of the appellant, it having been held in that case that, after a valid contract has been entered into by the state, it cannot \u201cdestroy or avoid the obligation of the contract. \u201d The case involved an inquiry into the force and validity of a contract, and the measure of damages for a breach of it. Those questions had been presented to the board of audit, and no question arose during the progress of that litigation akin to the one now before us: In <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>9 Cranch, 228, a somewhat similar question to the one now before us was under discussion, and in the course of the argument it was said: \u201cThis defendant could not maintan a suit against the United States. To give him the benefit of the set-off would be a violation of the prerogative of the United States.\u201d Thereupon \u201cthe court stopped the counsel for the United States upon this point, saying they were satisfied.\u201d In the course of the opinion delivered by Livingston, J.; it was said, at page 237: \u201cIf, then, in a suit against Giles himself, a claim for these credits, under existing circumstances, could not be sustained, neither can it in an action on this bond without permitting the defendants to do indirectly what the marshal could not have done directly, and, in this way, avail themselves of what the law seems to regard as a default, or at least a negligence on the part of their principal.\u201d Concurring, as we do, in the result reached by the learned referee, which he has fortified by an extensive opinion citing and reviewing numerous authorities, and the learned counsel for the appellant having conceded in the argument that he has \u201cbeen unable to find any New York state authorities squarely responding to the question, <em>\u201d </em>we may very appropriately omit further comment. We think the case was properly disposed of by the referee, and we therefore sustain his report. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
