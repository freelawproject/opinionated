Y. Supp. 211. The plaintiff has failed to comply with this requirement. Furthermore, it is apparent from the papers that the plaintiff\u2019s husband, who makes an affidavit in her behalf, is informed as to the matters concerning which she desires to examine the defendant, except such as the defendant would be obliged to disclose if an accounting were decreed, and as to- these an examination before trial cannot be necessary. We are satisfied that no examination' at this time is needed to enable the plaintiff to enforce such rights as she may have against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the defendant. The order appealed from is reversed, and the motion to vacate the order for the defendant\u2019s examination before trial is granted, with $10 costs and the disbursements of appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
