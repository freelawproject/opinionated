We deem the question litigated in this action, and determined by the general term, to be of sufficient importance to entitle the same to be finally settled by the court of appeals, inasmuch as there has been no decision directly upon the question involved, provided that within five days from the entry of an order on this decision the appellant perfect his appeal to said court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
