The law was so held in <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Society, </em>14 N. Y. 380, and <em>Marx </em>v. <em>McGlynn, </em>88 N. Y. 368, and the rule is recognized in <em>Shipman </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>98 N. Y. 311. The question then arises whether the devise vested at the death of the testator or at that of his wife, the life-tenant. The language of the will is: \u201cAt the death of my wife I give and devise, \u201d etc. The natural reading of this language would postpone the devise till the death of the wife; but it must be conceded that the law so favors the immediate vesting of estates that ordinarily, under a long line of decisions, the word \u201cat\u201d would be construed to refer to the time of enjoyment \u25a0of the estate, not of its vesting. We think that this case is taken out of the \u2022ordinary rule by the limitations imposed on the devise. By the will, it is provided that the land devised shall be used as a parsonage by the society and \u25a0church, and that, when the society ceases to use it as a parsonage, it shall revert to the testator\u2019s heirs at law. The devisee could therefore not alien or dispose of it. The testator never contemplated that the devisee should have any advantage of the devise till the death of his wife. The right of property and right of enjoyment were to go together, and, under the will, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>could be no right of property apart from the right of enjoyment. If the society had been incorporated at the time of the testator\u2019s death, and subsequently became extinct, the devise would have failed. It was thus necessary that the devisee should survive till the death of the life-tenant to receive the-devise, and thus the devise was necessarily contingent upon the existence of the devisee at the termination of the life-estate. We think, therefore, that we are justified in holding that the devise was not intended to vest till the-death of the wife, and, if that construction be correct, the incorporation and existence of the defendant at that period will, under <em>Shipman </em>v. <em>Rollins, supra, </em>render it a competent devisee. The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
