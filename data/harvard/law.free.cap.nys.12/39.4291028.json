Wilson against Debby Ann McGregor. At the trial, the jury found a verdict for plaintiff for $45. Costs of the action having been taxed by the clerk in favor of defendant, such taxation was, on motion of plaintiff, vacated, and costs taxed in favor of plaintiff for $45, the amount of her recovery. From the order entered thereon, defendant appeals. Code Civil Proc. N. Y. \u00a7 2863, provides: \u201cBut a justice of the peace cannot take cognizance of a civil action, in either of the following cases: * * * (3) Where the action is to recover damages for an assault, battery, false imprisonment, libel, slander, criminal conversation, seduction, or malicious prosecution,\u201d etc. And section 3228 provides: \u201cThe plaintiff is entitled to costs, of course, upon .the rendering of a final judgment in his favor, in either of the following actions: * * * (3) An action specified in subdivision first, third, fourth, or fifth, of section 2863, of this act. But if, in an action to recover damages for an assault, battery, false imprisonment, libel, slander, criminal conversation, seduction, or malicious prosecution, the plaintiff recovers less than fifty dollars damages, the amount of his costs cannot exceed the damages.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b57-13\">Argued before Dykman and Pratt, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-14\"><em>William D.

The complaint, therefore, states the facts constituting the cause of action. We may call it an action of slander, or one in the nature of seduction; the former, 1 think, more nearly describes it; but if it is either, it was one not proper to be brought before a justice of the peace, and hence the costs, as finally adjusted, were correct. This is clearly an action for a personal injury, and under section 3343, subd. 9, such an action includes \u201clibel, slander, seduction,\u201d etc., \u201cor any other actionable injury to the person of the plaintiff or of another.\u201d It seems to be clearly the intent of the Code that actions of this nature shall not be tried before a justice of the peace, and that, where the recovery is less than $50, the costs shall not exceed the 'recovery. We think the order is right, and must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
