Isham on a promissory note given for $1,200. Upon the hearing, the testimony of Byron E. Loomis was given in respect to a conversation betwen \u201cIsham and Stimpson in reference to Bundock\u2019s patent refrigerator and butter cooler, in San Francisco. \u201d Among other things, the witness testified: \u201c I said to Mr. Isham: \u2018 I suppose you have a real good thing.\u2019 He said: \u2022 There ain\u2019t money enough to buy it. We have an independent fortune out of it. Mr. Stimpson and I are going to have it.\u2019 I said: \u2018It will take plenty of money to run it.\u2019 He said: \u2018 We have plenty of money.\u2019 He said: \u2018We are going in as partners. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>We have the states of Louisiana and New York, and Mr. Stimpson is going there to sell territory of the places, and we have made arrangements with Mr. Bugby to that effect.\u2019 * * * They were in together, and in all his conversation he stated, \u2018We.\u2019 He was the most enthusiastic of the two.\u201d This evidence was repeated, in substance, on cross-examination. The witness added in his direct examination: \u201cThe whole conversation was that \u2018we\u2019 are going to make a fortune out of this business. In fact, I believe he told me that they had bought two states.\u201d In his cross-examination he stated: \u201c \u2018We\u2019 are going to do this. \u2018 We\u2019have bought the two states. He said: \u2018We are going in as partners.\u2019 This is the impression I got. The exact words it would be difficult for me to remember. \u201d The referee found as a matter of fact \u201c that the defendants were co-partners, as far as the plaintiffs are concerned, at the time of the execution of said note of $1,200, and prior thereto, and at the time of making the contract out of which the note grew. \u201d As a matter of law he found \u201cthat the plaintiffs, for the purposes of this action, are copartners; <em>second, </em>that the defendants Albert G. Stimpson and Alfred H. Isham became and were partners under the name of Stimpson &amp; Isham in the particular venture of the purchase of the patent for the states of New York and Louisiana, and the working of the same in said states.\u201d Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b892-5\">Argued before Hardin, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"APf\">When this case was before us on a former appeal, (46 Hun, 366,) among other things, we said: \u201cThe referee does not find that Isham &amp; Stimson were copartners, nor that Stimson, who made and signed and delivered the note to plaintiffs as a copartner or otherwise, was authorized by Isham to make the note in suit. * * * The plaintiffs planted themselves upon the averment that Isham was a partner. That was not proven, nor is it found by the referee.\u201d Upon the proofs given, and the findings made by the referee, found in the present appeal-book, the case differs quite essentially from the case found in the former appeal-hook. It may be observed that the evidence is slight tending to sustain the conclusion of fact found by the referee in the last trial. However, as there is some evidence to sustain the findings, we are not inclined to interfere with the same. The referee has carefully considered the evidence, and weighed it in the light of the discussion of the authorities bearing upon the question involved, and delivered an opinion reaching a conclusion upon the evidence, which we are not inclined to disturb.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">2. We have looked at the rulings made upon the trial, and we are of the opinion that they do not present such prejudicial error as requires us to disturb the report of the referee. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
