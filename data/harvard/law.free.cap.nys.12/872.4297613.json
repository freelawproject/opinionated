J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9ly\">Upon filing the referee\u2019s report with the clerk it was regular to enter a judgment in accordance therewith. Section 1228 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: \u201c Where the whole' issue is an issue of fact which was tried by the referee, the report stands as a decision of the court.\u201d And that section provides that, upon filing the report, judgment upon such report \u201cmaybe entered by the clerk as directed therein upon filing the decision or report. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-16\">2. The Syracuse Screw Company, on the 30th day of June, 1885, made, executed, and delivered a mortgage to the plaintiff to secure the sum of $10,000. It was acknowledged or proven on the 21st of July, 1885. Appended to the mortgage, and accompanying the same, was the consent of stockholders in the corporation, \u201cowners of more than two-thirds of the capital stock of said corporation,\u201d which consent was acknowledged on the 21st day of July, 1885, and recorded, in connection with the mortgage, December 28, 1885. We think the consent was valid. In <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Averell, </em>96 N. Y. 476, affirming 26 Hun, 643, it was said: \u201cThe consent of stockholders is the important and essential thing. * * * Would the corporation be heard to allege as a defense to a mortgage that, although assented to, the evidence of the assent was not recorded? We think not.\u201d Applying the doctrine of that case to the one in hand, we are of the opinion that the contention made by the receiver that the \u201cproper statutory steps were not taken in the execution of the mortgage, and that the assent of the stockholders must first be filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the proper county, \u201d must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-17\">3. The appellant contends that the mortgage in question was void at the time of its execution and delivery, and he relies in support of his position upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>section 4, tit. 4, c. 18, pt. 1, Rev. St. In <em>Brouwer </em>v. <em>Harbeck, </em>9 N. Y. 593, it was said, viz.: \u201cSo long as insolvency neither exists nor is contemplated, the corporation, like an individual, can appropriate its means to the payment of its debts in such order and in such amounts and proportions as the directors please.\u201d The referee has found \u201cthat, at the time of the making, execution, acknowledgment, delivery, and recording of said mortgage, the said defendant, the Syracuse Screw Company, was not insolvent, and that said mortgage was not made in contemplation of insolvency.\u201d Evidence was given upon the hearing tending to support the finding just quoted. That finding presents for our consideration a case quite unlike <em>Kingsley </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>31 Hun, 333, as in that case there was clear evidence of insolvency, and in the course of' the opinion it was said: \u201cThe purpose of all the parties participating in this transaction cannot be disguised.\u201d And it was further stated that the insolvency of the corporation was clearly made out. Again, it is found by the referee in the case before us that \u201cevery debt in existence against the defendant the Syracuse Screw Company was fully paid prior to the appointment of the defendant as receiver,\u201d and \u201cthat said receiver does not represent a single creditor whose debt was in existence when the said plaintiff\u2019s mortgage and the assent thereto was made, executed, acknowledged, delivered, and recorded.\u201d In <em>Sheldon, etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Eickemeyer, etc., Co., </em>90 N. Y. 618, where a somewhat similar question was before the court under the provisions of the Revised Statutes already referred to, it was said: \u201cHo creditor or person representing a creditor seeks to impeach such transfer. If the action has any application to this case, there are no findings or requests to find, which can raise the question.\u201d It maybe observed in passing that the mortgage in question as a lien had ceased to be operative, as the property covered by it had been sold and delivered by virtue of a decree in foreclosure upon prior mortgages, and the proceeds of the sale were apparently insufficient to satisfy those mortgages, and the beneficial effect of the judgment in favor of the plaintiff brought here by this appeal seems to rest in its provisions establishing a debt against the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">4. We see no occasion to disturb the order confirming the report of the referee. As already observed, the reference was of all the issues, and to the referee to hear and determine. As to this appellant the decision of the referee was the decision of the court. Ho question was made upon the argument as to the order granting an additional allowance to the plaintiff; hence we need spend no time in considering the propriety of that order. Judgment and order affirmed, with costs to the respondent payable out of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Martin, J., concurs. Merwin, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
