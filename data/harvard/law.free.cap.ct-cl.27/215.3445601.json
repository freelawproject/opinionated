The brig Caroline Wilmans sailed from Baltimore, Md., on the 6th of July, 1800, for Antigua. On the 29th July, 1800, she was captured on the high seas by the French privateer Les Trois Amis. After the capture her master, the mate, the supercargo, and a portion of her crew were taken on board of the capturing vessel and subsequently put ashore at Basseterre on the 18th August, 1800. On the 1st September, 1800, the master arrived at St. Kitts, and on the 2d September made a protest before a notary, in which he alleged in due form the capture of the Caroline Wilmans, and also that he \u201chad heard no tidings of his said brig\u201d and \u201cwas unacquainted with what had become of her.\u201d On the 16th January, 1801, the owner of the cargo satisfied the Maryland Insurance Company that the</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ahx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>vessel bad not been beard from since ber capture, and tbe company paid tbe insurance upon tbe cargo as for a total loss. It does not appear that tbe Caroline Wilmans was ever brought into port or comdemned or heard of after capture. Tbe court finds that she carried ber papers and was sailing upon a lawful voyage, laden with a cargo not contraband. Tbe reason for ber capture is unknown. At tbe time of capture it appeared by tbe bill of lading and invoice on board tbe vessel that tbe cargo was to be delivered at tbe port of Antigua (then being in tbe possession of tbe British), \u201cunto Edward L, Smith or bis assigns, be or they paying freight for tbe said goods.\u201d Tbe said Edward L. Smith was tbe supercargo of tbe brig, and on board at tbe time of capture, and was an American citizen. It does not appear whether tbe captors were informed that be was tbe supercargo and the consignee of tbe cargo, or that tbe cargo was consigned to and tbe property of an American owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-3\">II.
