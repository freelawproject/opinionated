He is then compelled to take pay in coffee at an exaggerated valuation. The price agreed to bo given is the reasonable value of the cargo, the injury complained of being delay of payment and underpayment by reason of the overvaluation of the coffee.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b240-7\">I. Though tho detention of a vessel by the French and the compulsory methods used to compel a sale of her cargo were unlawful, yet if the master subsequently agreed upon a price, which was the reasonable value of the cargo, the injury complained of being in fact delay of payment and underpayment, the owner\u2019s redress was that provided by the fifth article of tho treaty 1800. The claim was not one of those relinquished under the second article of the treaty 1800, and the United States are not liable therefor.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b240-9\">II. The seizure and detention of a vessel by the French in 1795 to compel a sale of the cargo were illegal, and the owner for the voyage had a valid claim for indemnity therefor, which was relinquished by the treaty 1800, and for which the United States are liable.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-11\"><em>The Reporters'\u2019 </em>statement of the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-12\">The following are the facts of this case as found by the court. I. The sloop Martha, of Fredericksburg, Ya., of'the burden of about 83 tons, sailed from Fredericksburg on the 15th day of February, 1795, bound for Fort Dauphin, in Hispaniola, and a market, under charter party to Edward Dunant. Being off Port \u00e1 Paix, on the 23d of March, the master went in his boat with intention to inquire the state of the market and of the trade there. While entering the port with his boat, the harbor boat came alongside and ordered him back to his vessel, and, being under the guns of the fort, obliged him to go with said sloop Martha into the harbor, threatening that the fort would fire on him if he did not go in, which he had refused to do. On entering the harbor at Port \u00e1 Paix they placed a guard of soldiers on board. He went on shore and applied to Gen. Lavaud, the commander in chief, for permission to proceed on his voyage for another port, but was by him refused, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>general insisted tliat Ms cargo, which consisted of 630 barrels of flour, should be delivered to the administration for the use of tbe Republic, and that be should be paid for the same $12 per barrel in coffee at 30 sols per pound, and other produce of the island in proportion, taking Ms turn after the other vessels then in port for payment. He refused those terms and persisted in Ms refusal for seventeen days, remaining there and soliciting permission to depart the port, but was constantly refused, as well by the general as by the administration, who insisted on having the cargo, declaring that the vessel should remain there, as they wanted the flour, and that it should then be taken from him by force, which was declared to him by the commissary-general, who also informed him that Gen. Lavaud had ordered his sails and rudder to be taken away if he did not comply. Having no remedy in his power and apprehending that his cargo would perish, wMch appeared to be the case on a survey by four American masters of vessels, he at length submitted to deliver his cargo, and was compelled, before they would receive his cargo or make any payment therefor, to sign an agreement which was tendered him by the administration. He was detained there for upwards of three months and compelled to take pay in coffee at 30 sols per pound for the first quality, and in that proportion for inferior. He could have sold his flour on his arrival at private sale at $10, and after-wards from $12 to $13 per barrel, and could have purchased coffee of the first quality from 13 to 15 sols per pound and other, qualities in proportion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-4\">II. On the 17th April, 1795, some dispute having arisen as to the quality of the flour, the master of the Martha addressed the following communication to the French authorities:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-5\"><em>u To the judge of the court of </em>admiralty, <em>Port de Paine:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\">\u2018\u2018Sir: In answer to your last summons I can only say that I did not agree with Mr. Perroud to deliver any particular quality of flour.
