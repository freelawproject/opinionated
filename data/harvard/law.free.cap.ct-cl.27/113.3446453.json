The stipulation is made and filed in pursuance of a proviso to the fourth section of said act, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\"><em>\u201cProvided, </em>That all unpaid claims which have heretofore been examined, approved, and allowed by the Secretary of the Interior, or under his direction, in pursuance of the act of Congress making appropriations for the current and contingent expenses of the Indian Department, and for fulfilling treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes, for the year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and eighty-six, and for other purposes, approved March third, eighteen hundred and eighty-five, and subsequent Indian appropriation acts, shall have priority of consideration by such court, and judgments for the amounts therein found due shall be rendered, unless either the claimant or the United States shall elect to reopen the case and try the same before the court, in which event the testimony in the case given by the witnesses and the documentary evidence, including reports of Department agents therein, may be read as depositions and proofs: <em>Provided, </em>That the party electing to reopen the case shall assume the burden of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Counsel representing both parties have, by the terms of the stipulation, signified the unwillingness of both to disturb the. finding of the Secretary of the Interior Department, and upon that condition, the court is by the terms of the statute compelled to render a judgment for the claimant in the sum adjudicated to be due by the action of the Secretary. The finding and allowance of the Interior Department, unless disputed by the claimant or the United States, becomes in this court an award, upon which it is the duty of the court to render a judgment, affirming to the claimant the amount allowed by the action of the Department. We determine no question of law applicable to the original controversy, all differences in fact and in law become merged in the determination of the Secretary in the allowance of the amount which he finds due the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The ninth section of the act, giving this court jurisdiction of the subject matter of this claim, provides \u201cthe allowance to the claimant\u2019s attorney shall be regulated and fixed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>court at tbe time of rendering judgment m eacb case, and entered of record as part of tbe findings thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In a case involving controverted questions (this being a new jurisdiction in tbe court) we will probably bave occasion to discuss in detail tbe principles of law which under tbe statue are applicable to tbe rights of tbe parties; but in this case, there being no issue to determine, nothing can be said beyond what we bave stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Under tbe provisions of tbe statute tbe following judgment is hereby entered:</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Tbe court, upon due consideration of tbe premises, find in favor of tbe claimant, and do OTder, adjudge, and decree that tbe said Mortimer Hyne bave and recover of and from tbe United States and tbe Chippewa tribe of Indians committing tbe wrong for which this judgment is rendered tbe sum of $85, of which sum there is allowed McG-rew &amp; Small, tbe claimant\u2019s attorneys, for prosecuting said claim, tbe sum of $17, fixed by tbe court according to tbe provisions of tbe act of March 3, 1891, chapter 538, section 9 (1 Supp. Rev.
