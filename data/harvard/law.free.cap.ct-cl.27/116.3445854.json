Tbe brig Yenus cleared from tbe port of Wells, in Massachusetts (now Maine) on tbe lOtb July, 1796, for Jeremie. Not finding a market there, she sailed for Port au Prince on tbe 8th August, 1796, where tbe cargo was sold, and tbe proceeds invested in a return cargo, consisting exclusively of molasses, laden with which she sailed from Port au Prince on tbe 10th September, bound for her home port. On the 12th September, 1796, she was captured by tbe French privateer La Republique Triomphante, and carried into tbe port of Gonaives. Subsequently tbe commission delegated by tbe French Government to tbe Windward Islands, sitting at Gape Franqois, on tbe 24th September, 1796, as a prize court, condemned tbe vessel as good prize for tbe benefit of her captors upon tbe following-grounds, as set forth in such decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">\u201cLiberty.

Tbe Venus at the time of ber capture bad on board all usual and proper papers except a passport or sea letter and an invoice of tbe cargo wbicb she had taken aboard at Port au Prince. Tbe reason why she did not have on board a passport was, that on ber owner applying for it in July before ber voyage began, at tbe office of tbe district of Biddeford and Pep-perelborougb (that being tbe office where bis vessel\u2019s clearance papers were issued), the officer in charge furnished him with all ber papers except a passport, as to wbicb he said that it was not usually called for and that be bad not one in tbe office. Tbe reason why tbe vessel did not have on board an invoice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>of ber borne cargo was because it was not the usage of American vessels trading as sbe did to obtain an invoice. But it does not appear that either of these reasons was made known to the prize court. The usage above referred to is narrated and described in the following certificates on file in the Department of State:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-3\">\u201cWe, the subscribers, merchants and citizens of Bo.ston, who have been conversant with and engaged in the trade from this State to the West Indies, do hereby certify whom it may concern, that the consignation of the vessels and cargoes being given almost universally to the captains, the owners furnish them with no documents relative to their voyages, but their general orders, as to the objects of them, and the invoices of their cargoes from hence; no bills of lading being taken for such cargoes, but receipts upon the copies of the invoices; nor is it usual, for the same reason, for the captains to have any bills of lading for their return cargoes from the West Indies, nor any other documents except the invoice of the cargo on board, made out by the captain himself, and ins account of sales of the outward cargo, and his account current with his owners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-4\">\u201cBoston, March 15th, \u201997.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\">\u201cStephen Higginson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\">\u201cJohn C.

On the 31st December following the court, in view of the novel questions and large amounts involved in this branch of its jurisdiction and out of abundant caution, remanded the case for argument upon the facts found. For reasons not knowfi to the court the hearing has been postponed until the present time, January, 1892.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Since the case was sent back for argument the legal question involved has been deliberately considered in many other cases, and repeatedly decided in favor of the claimants. The principle which governs it is now so well settled, that no extended discussion is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The twenty-fifth article of the <em>Treaty of Amity and Commerce </em>1778 (8 Stat. L., 12, 26), is in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">\u201cTo the end that all manner of dissentions and quarrels may be avoided and prevented on one side and the other, it is agreed that in case either of the parties hereto should be engaged in war, the ships and vessels belonging., to the subjects or people of the other ally must be furnished with sea letters or passports, expressing the name, property, and bulk of the ship, as also the name and place of habitation of the master or commander of the said ship, that it may appear thereby that the ship really and truly belongs to the subjects of one of the parties, which passport shall be made out and granted according to the form annexed to this treaty; they shall likewise be recalled every year; that is, if the ship happens to return home within the space of a year. It is likewise agreed that such ships, being laden, are to be provided not only with passports as above mentioned, but also with certificates containing the several particulars of the cargo, the place whence the ship sailed, and whither she is bound, that so it may be known whether any forbidden or contraband goods be on board the same; which certificates shall be made out by the officers of the place whence the ship set sail in the accustomed form; and if any one shall think it fit or advisable to express in the said certificates the person to whom the goods on board belong he may freely do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>It is manifest that tlie purpose of a treaty of amity and commerce between two friendly maritime powers must bave been to mitigate, and not to augment, the severities of international law. The article now under consideration, moreover, expressly declares that it has been adopted \u201cto the end that all manner of dissensions and quarrels may be avoided and prevented on one side and the other.\u201d The article then provides that when either power is engaged in war the ships of the other shall carry a sea letter or passport and a certificate or manifest. The former is to be not more than one year old, and the latter to be issued \u201c by the officers of the place whence the ship set sail,\u201d and to contain \u201cthe several particulars of the cargo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Armed with these two instruments, a ship upon the high seas, according to the twenty-seventh article, was free from search. A ship of war or privateer might send her \u201cboats aboard the merchant ship,\u201d but when the latter had exhibited ber \u201cpassport concerning the property of the ship,\u201d she should \u201cbe free and at liberty to pursue her voyage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The absence of these two papers, the sea letter or passport and the certificate or manifest, did not not render the merchant vessel liable to condemnation; it simply left her without the benefits of the twenty-seventh article, and in this particular subject to the rules and requirements of international law.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In the present ease the Venus did not carry the two prescribed papers, the passport and manifest, but she did have on board her register and crew list. The absence of the former papers may have rendered her liable to detention and search, but did not afford the slightest ground for capture and condemnation. As soon as the searching vessel ascertained the nationality of the Venus from an inspection of her register, and perhaps the innocence of her cargo by actual search, the right of detention was at an end, and the vessel free to pursue her voyage. For the captors then to carry her into a French port, and for a French tribunal to assume a right of condemnation, was clearly unauthorized by the terms of the treaty and in violation of our maritime rights as regulated by international law.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The order of the court is that the findings of fact, together with the conclusions of law now filed, and the opinion of the court, be reported to Congress.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
