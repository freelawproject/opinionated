L., p. 908, \u00a7 4), after appropriating money for the payment of French spoliation cases, contains this proviso: <em>\u201cProvided, That in all eases where the ordinal sufferers were adjudicated bankrupts, the award shall be made on behalf of the next of Ici/n, instead of to assignees in banlwuplay.\u201d </em>This means that in all future reports to Congress the court shall regard the administrator of the original sufferer representing his next of kin as the party entitled to relief.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-11\">II. A proviso is properly something engrafted upon a preceding enactment for the purpose of taking special cases out of the general enactment; 'but the term \u201cprovided\u201d does not necessarily mean that that which follows is a proviso in its technical sense; it is the matter and not the form which determines.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-12\">HI.

L., 19). The administrator of tfie surviving assignee in bankruptcy came in and presented tfie claim of Prager <em>&amp; </em>Co. for indemnity under tfie <em>Act of January 20, 1885, </em>chapter 25 (1 Supp. Rev. Stat., 2d ed., p. 471).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">Daniel L.

Stat., 2d ed., p. 925), which act, so far as it is material on this motion, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-14\">S \u00a3? p4 \u00a7 \u00ae \u00e1 2.3 <em>\u00f1 </em>2 g-4\u00e1 p-s pj'ti a3 ffl -rt d Cf \u00ae (\u00a773 \u00ae_ =\u00a7 g \u00ae I <em>\u00f1 </em>\u00ae s 2pi 3 -2 b'pi-g \u00b0 \u00b0 O O5 I $ 31 CD _ et- <em>G </em>! 2. o p b &amp; g. \u00ab= O V2 CC Hj3 S <em>02 m'\" </em>S <em>y. </em>C QP ^ 5 g \u00ae o a.\u00ae 02 e+- ^ &lt;r* O\u2019 hi a. o <em>H </em>B 02 S, ,\u00ae O ? c3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-2\"><em>* * # </em># * \u2022 # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\">\u201cSec. 4.

When technically and artistically employed, that is undoubtedly the common-law interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">.But there is abundant authority for a different interpretation in numerous classes of cases. Dwarris on Statutes (2d ed., p. 514) says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">' \u201cA proviso is something engrafted upon a preceding enactment, and is legitimately used for the purpose of taking special cases out of the general enactments and providing specially for them. In its abuse it contains all unconnected matters and disposes of whatever is incapable of combination with the rest of any clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">In <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>The State, </em>the Supreme Court of Alabama thus refers to the effect of a proviso:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">\u201cBecause the term <em>provided </em>is used in the law it does not necessarily follow that the matter which may succeed it is <em>&amp; proviso </em>in its technical sense; it is the matter of the succeeding words, and not the form, which determines whether it is or not a technical proviso.\u201d (50 Ala., 396.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">The long practice of Congress in enacting general legislation <em>by provisos </em>in appropriation acts is so well known to all persons familiar with the statutes of the United States, that the court can not avoid taking judicial notice of it, and, in interpreting appropriation acts, giving due consideration to that fact, so that the will of Congress shall be carried out in whatever form it may be expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">The ambiguity in the matter under consideration arises from the use of the word \u201caward\u201d in this sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>\u201cProvided, </em>That in all cases where the original sufferers were adjudicated bankrupts the <em>award </em>shall be made on behalf the next of kin instead of to assignees in bankruptcy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">There is nothing whatever in the preceding part of the act to which the word can legitimately or technically apply. An appropriation is not an award in any sense of the word and is never so called, popularly or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We must therefore look for some other meaning of the word as used by Congress in this connection, and we may take into consideration all the circumstances connected with the act in which it occurs, as well as previous legislation on the same subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">On January 20, 1885, Congress passed the \u201c act to provide for the ascertainment of claims of American citizens for spoliations committed by the French prior to the thirty-first day of July, eighteen hundred and one \u201d (Ch. 25; 1 Supp. Rev. Stat., 2d ed., p. 471).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Section 1 provides that citizens having such claims \u201cmay apply by petition to the Court of Claims within two years from the passage of this act, as hereinafter provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Section 3 enacts \u201cthat the court shall examine and determine the validity and amount of all the claims included within the description\u201d mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Section 6 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">\u201cThat on the first Monday of December in each year the court shall report to Congress, for final action, the facts found by it, and its conclusions in all cases which it has disposed of and not previously reported.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-12\">\u201cSuch finding and report of the court shall be taken to be merely advisory as to the law and facts found, and shall not conclude either the claimant or Congress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">In pursuance of this act the court proceeded to investigate such cases as were brought before it and reported to Congress their conclusions of fact and of law in each case. Among the claimants were several assignees, or representatives of assignees, of original sufferers who had been declared bankrupts, and the court reported in those cases that the assignees, or representatives of the assignees, were entitled to receive from the United States the sum found to be the amount of the losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">In Congress an appropriation bill was drawn and printed containing appropriations for all the persons named in the reports of the Court of Claims. From that bill were stricken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>oi.it all appropriations to assignees in bankruptcy so far as their representative character appeared in the language of the act. This is a decided indication that Congress did not .intend to pay assignees in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">To provide for future cases of like kind they added the proviso now under consideration. It was quite natural that they should designate the findings of the Court of Claims as \u201cawards.\u201d The reports in spoliation cases are not judgments, and are to be taken to be merely advisory as \u201cto the law and facts found.\u201d This is so by reason of the express provision of the spoliation act, and is not applicable to cases under the general jurisdiction of the court. The findings in spoliation cases are in the nature of awards and may be properly so designated. To them the word applies with more propriety than to anything in the act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">We hold that the proviso means that in all future reports to Congress the court shall regard the administrator of the original sufferer, representing the next of kin, as entitled to the amounts found, due instead of the assignees in bankruptcy wherever the original sufferers were declared bankrupts.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The court will, however, find the fact of adjudication in bankruptcy and the appointment of assignees, and will report the same for the information of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">If the administrator obtains the consent of the assignee in bankruptcy in this and other cases now pending, he may come in on motion and be substituted as claimant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-9\">Weldon, J., was absent when this case was decided and took no part in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
