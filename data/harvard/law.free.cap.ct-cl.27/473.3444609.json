The defendants\u2019 move to dismiss the first, and produce an affidavit of the claimant, in which he says he authorized the bringing of the first suit, but desires that his case shall be prosecuted by means of the second.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-10\">L When a party employs an attorney, who institutes a suit for him, the court acquires jurisdiction and the attorney a right to compensation. A client may then revoke the power and discharge the attorney, but only with permission of the court and on such terms as are prescribed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-11\">II. After bringing one suit a party can not institute another until the first is disposed of. It is in the first suit that the issue between the parties must be tried.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-12\">IH. A suit brought without authority may be dismissed on the motion of the plaintiff in person or on the motion of the defendants; but a suit brought with authority must stand until trial or until dismissed in ajegal manner.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-13\">IV. The claimant himself can not dismiss his own suit until he has dis- ' charged his attorney with permission of the court; and when he has wrongfully brought several actions for the same cause, he can not elect which one he will prosecute.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-14\">V. Where two attorneys have been duly authorized to bring suit upon the same cause of action in an Indian depredation case, the court will apportion the statutory costs upon the entry of judgment according to the actual services performed and their value to the claimant, without reference to any contract.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-15\">VI. The provision relating to costs in the <em>Indian Depredation Act 1891 </em>(26 Stat.

A few attorneys or other persons, desiring to represent claimants before the Court of Claims, offered inducements to claimants to discharge the former attorneys and to employ them, without regard to the contract relations between the claimants and their former attorneys or the difficulties and responsibilities in which the claimant might become involved ky a double attorneyship. In many cases these inducements succeeded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-11\">It is believed that the general rules of law as administered in courts and the authority granted by the statute will enable these controversies to be settled without serious injustice. Attorneys who have neglected the interests of their clients ought not to receive consideration, but attorneys who have attended to their clients\u2019 interests ought not to be displaced without proper regard of their services.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-12\">No case is before the court for adjudication in which the authors of this paper are interested; but in accordance with the permission of the' court they submit the following statement of established rules of law, with authorities, in the hope that it may be of assistance to the court. All authorities cited have been personally examined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-13\">(1) Contracts for contingent fees in Government claims are lawful. This principle is decided in the following cases by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Supreme Court: <em>Wylie </em>v. <em>Goxe </em>(15 How., 416); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Teh-hitts </em>(91 U.

Tbey say (p. 45):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-5\">\u201c It was decided in tbe case <em>Stantony. Fmbrey </em>(93 U. S. B., 548) tbat contracts by attorneys for compensation in prosecuting claims against tbe United States were not void because the amount of it was made contingent upon success or upon tbe sum recovered. And tbe well-known difficulties and delays in obtaining payment of just claims wbicb are not within tbe ordinary course of procedure of tbe auditing officers of tbe Government justifies a liberal compensation in successful cases, where none is to be received in case of failure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-6\">\u201cAny other rule would work sucb hardship in cases of creditors of small means, residing far from tbe seat of government, who can give neither money nor personal attention to securing tbeir rights.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-7\">Tbe legislation of Congress has also proceeded upon this theory. Wherever tbe subject of fees of attorneys in Government claims has been tbe subject of legislation, contingent fees have been provided for and recognized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-8\">Fees in claims prosecuted before tbe Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims.

Tbe pendency of tbe prior suit is cause for abatement of tbe second suit upon tbe defendant\u2019s motion. Tbe doctrine here stated is elemental. It appears in tbe text-books.

Tbe following are directly in point: <em>MoKinsey </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(4 Dana, 62); <em>Fish </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>v. <em>Atlcinson </em>(10 Pac.

Bussard </em>(1 Wheaton, 215), the question was whether a second suit could be pleaded in abatement of a prior suit. Mr. Justice Story says (p. 217):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-6\">\u201c It is very clear that it can not. A subsequent suit may be abated by an allegation of the pendency of a prior suit; but the converse of the proposition is, in personal actions, never true,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-7\">See also <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Jones. </em>(13 Wall, 679, 715.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-8\">(3) If an action is brought on behalf of the plaintiff without proper authority, it may be dismissed on motion either of the plaintiff himself or of the opposite party. (Weeks on Attorneys at Law, secs. 193, 214; Mechem on Agency, sec. 810; <em>MeKier-man </em>v.

C. C., 429.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-9\">(4) A revocation of a power of attorney is not valid until notice to the attorney. This is a general principle of the law of agency. (Story on Agency, sec. 470; Mechem on Agency, sec. 226; <em>Weile </em>v. <em>United States, </em>7 O. Cls. B., 535; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>JEodg-leins, </em>61 Maine, 483.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-10\">(5) If a cause has been filed by an attorney under proper authority, the client cannot appear himself in the cause to file motions or take other proceedings. This inhibition extends even to a motion to dismiss. (Weeks on Attorneys at Law, sec. 198, p. 348; sec. 220; Wharton on Agency, sec. 585; Mechem on Agency, sec. 811; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Caruthers, </em>17 Cal., 431; <em>Board of Commissioners </em>v. <em>Younger, </em>Cal., 147, 149; <em>Mott </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>45 Cal., 172; <em>Nightingale </em>v. <em>Oregon Cen.

Denny,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">\u201c Hardy Elliee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">This brings directly before tbe court for judicial consideration a reprehensible practice which has arisen under tbe <em>Indian depredation Act </em>(1 Supp. Rev. Stat., 2d ed., p. 913) of claimants\u2019 multiplying cases through different attorneys for tbe same cause of action, and, whether done through their own ignorance or through solicitations of attorneys, is to be discountenanced and condemned. In some instances as many as three or four separate petitions have been filed by several attorneys holding powers of attorney of different dates. The defendants are harassed with a multiplicity of suits to be defended, and the court is trifled with by having its docket encumbered with so many unnecessary petitions, and is subjected to the unpleasant duty of deciding upon unseemly controversies between attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">Members of the bar, belonging to an honorable profession, are bound to conduct themselves towards each ocher with the utmost fairness, openness, and consideration. Their duties to clients, as well as to their professional brethren and to the public at large, require that course of conduct, in order to preserve the high standard of the profession, to give no cause of complaints against them, and to avoid scandals, which injure their own reputation and bring discredit upon the whole body.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>When a client employs an attorney who brings snit for him the court acquires jurisdiction of the cause of action, the defendants come in to have their rights settled in that suit, and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney acquires a vested right to compensation for services performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The client may revoke his power of attorney upon notice duly given, but the acts of the attorney are binding until notice of revocation is received. He may discharge his attorney of record in a suit with permission of the court on such terms as the court may prescribe, but after bringing one suit he can not institute another until the first is disposed of. It is in the first suit that the issue between the parties must be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">A suit brought without authority may be dismissed on motion of the plaintiff in person or on motion of defendants, because a judgment recovered in such suit would not be binding on the parties. But a suit brought with authority of the prain-tiff must stand until tried on the issue raised or until dismissed in legal manner. The plaintiff himself can not dismiss his own suit until he has discharged his attorney with permission of the court, and when he has wrongfully brought several actions for the same cause he cannot elect which one he will prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Applying'these well-settled principles to the present case, it is clear what the court must do.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">It appears that Mr. B. F. Dowell, an attorney of this court, brought an action March 31, 1891 (No. 284) for the claimant by authority of the following power of attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">\u201cICnow all men that I, John W. Bedfield, of the county of Douglas and State of Oregon, by these presents do nominate, constitute, and appoint B. F. Dowell, and his daughter Annie B. Dowell, of Portland, Oregon, my true and lawful attorneys irrevocably, for me, and in my name, place, and stead, to appear before the legislature of Oregon, or in any of the departments of the State of Oregon, and in the Court of Claims, before Congress, and at any of the Deimrtments of the Government of the United States, and to prosecute to recovery, and to ask for and to demand from either said governments all sums due me, or to become due me, for my claim against the United States for the depredations of the Indians, and the receipt for the draft for the same, and particularly for depredation of the Bogue Biver Indians and Crow Creek Indians in Oct., 1855. Interlined with the words \u201c and his daughter, Anna E. Dowell,\u201d before signed. Commissioners No. 3190 for $3,180. To collect, file all necessary proof at my expense and charge, and in my name to receive and receipt for the same, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>and generally to do and perform everything necessary to be done, as fnlly and effectually, to all intents and purposes, as I myself could do if personally present, hereby ratifying and confirming allmy said attorney may lawfully do in the premises, with power of substitution, and revoking all other powers of attorney granted by me. Twenty-one words stricken out before signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201c Witness my hand and seal this 10th day of December, 1886.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u201cJohn W. Redeield.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\u201cWitness present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\u201c D. D. Blinn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">\u201c W. E. Aitch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">\n<em>\u201c[Duly acknowledged before a notary public.]\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">Subsequently the claimant gave another power of attorney to Messrs. Hughes <em>&amp; </em>Weller, also attorneys of this court, and they filed another petition for the same cause of action November 17,1891, No. 6787. Their power of attorney is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">\u201c Know all men by these presents, that I, John W. Redfield, of Glendale, in the county of Douglas and State of Oregon, have made, constituted, and appointed, and by these presents do make, constitute, and appoint, Hughes and Weller, general counsel for examiner bureau of claims, my true and lawful attorneys, for me and in my name, place, and stead, hereby annulling and revoking all former powers of attorney whatever in the premises, to prosecute before any Department, or any court of record, or any committee of Congress of the United States until final completion, for me, my claim under the act of Congress of March 3,1891, for losses suffered from Indian depredations, committed in the month of October, in the year 1866, and to from time to time furnish any further evidence necessary, or that may be demanded, giving and granting to my said attorney full power and authority to do and perform all and every act and thing whatsoever requisite and necessary to be done in and about the premises, including verification of petition in U. S. Court of Claims, as fully to all intent and purposes as I might or could do if personally present at the doing thereof, with full power of substitution and revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that my said attorneys or their substitute may or shall lawfully do or cause to be. done by Virtue hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\">\u201c My post-office address is Glendale, Douglas County, Oregon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">\u201c In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, etc., this 16th day of May, eighteen hundred and ninety-one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-15\">\u201cJohn W.

Roberts, notary public.\u201d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>It is proper to state that Mr. Dowell denies by affidavit tbe allegations of tbe claimant that be bas been paid bis fees and that be bas done any acts to give cause for dissatisfaction, and. we bave no reason to doubt tbe truth of bis statements. He bas long been a member of tbe bar in tbe State of Oregon, and be appears to have rendered valuable and faithful services for bis client.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Tbe circumstances under which tbe claimant was induced to give a new power of attorney to other attorneys after Mr.-Dowell bad nearly completed bis work by obtaining an award by tbe Secretary of tbe Interior, and bad brought bis action thereon, are not now for tbe court to consider, as we hold tbe second power, however obtained, to be inoperative to discharge tbe first suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Tbe motion of the defendants to dismiss cause No. 284 is denied. Tbe subsequent suit, No. 5787, will be disposed of when tbe subject is properly presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">As to attorney\u2019s fees, we may say that upon entry of judgment an allowance to attorneys will be made in proportion to tbe actual services performed and their value to claimants, without reference to any previous contracts between tbe parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Tbe statute provided that \u201c tbe allowances to tbe claimant\u2019s attorneys shall be regulated and fixed by tbe court at tbe time of rendering judgment in each case and entered of record as part of tbe findings thereof: but in no case shall tbe allowance exceed 15 per cent of tbe judgment recovered, except in case of claims of less amount than $500, or where unusual services bave been rendered qr expenses incurred by tbe claimant\u2019s attorney, in which case not to exceed 20 per cent of such judgment shall be allowed by tbe court (1 Supp. Rev. Stat., 2d ed., p. 916.) This we regard as like tbe taxable costs in actions at common law, which tbe parties themselves can not fix by contract. (Rev. Stat., \u00a7\u00a7 823, 824.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
