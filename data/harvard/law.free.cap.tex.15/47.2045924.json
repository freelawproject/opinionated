I. R. Lewis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-5\">The attorney for defendant, on the 23d of May, 1855, when the case was called, made affidavit that defendant was, several days since, unexpectedly called from home, on business, to Matagorda; that in consequence of the absence of defendant, he is unable to procure the exhibit which defendant refers to in Ms amended answer ; that defendant informed affiant, that he had a good and valid defence to the suit; that said note was given in consideration of a tract of land, pretended to be conveyed by plaintiff to defendant, and that the title to said land had failed; and that he verily believes, on the return of said defendant, he will be able to produce the exhibit referred to in defendant\u2019s amended answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-6\">The smt had been commenced on the 10th of April, 1855, and the answer filed on the 4th of May, 1855, apparently without citation. The defendant resided in Travis.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-7\"><em>J.

In such a case it ought very clearly to appear that the continuance was improperly refused to warrant this Court in reversing the judgment on that ground. It does not so appear to us in the present case. The affidavit of the defendant for a continuance appears to have been made eighteen days in advance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>calling of the cause for trial. It attempts to excuse the want of diligence to procure the attendance or testimony of the witness ; averring that the affiant \u201c did not know of the materiality and residence of the witness until the commencement of this Count(which was several days before the making of the affidavit) and that \u201c with all diligence he could not procure the testimony.\u201d We think the Court might well regard the affidavit as not accounting satisfactorly for the entire absence of diligence, on the part of the defendant, to procure the attendance or testimony of the witness. It might have been thought not wholly improbable, that, if active measures had been employed, even at the commencement of the term, (when the fact of the materiality and residence of the witness came to the knowledge of the defendant,) the testimony of the witness might have been obtained before the calling of the cause for trial. And in the absence of any explanatory statement, the Court, moreover, may not\u2019 have been satisfied that it was not for the want of due and proper diligence, that the defendant was not earlier informed of the materiality and residence of the witness. It is quite evident, that, if the defendant was really entitled to a continuance, it might have been made more satisfactorily to appear. The case presented by the affidavit is not a stronger one for a continuance, than others which have been held by this Court insufficient. (Hunter v. Waite, 11 Tex. R. 85 ; Hensley v. Lytle, 5 Id. 497 ; Williams v. Edwards, <em>supra.) </em>The affidavit of the attorney does not strengthen the appellant\u2019s case. It shows that, relying on Ms affidavit for a continuance, made so long in advance, he had left the Court without taking any steps to prepare for the trial. The defendant does not appear to have used the diligence which the law requires, nor to have so satisfactorily accounted for the want of it, as to warrant this Court in holding that the District Court improperly and erroneously refused a continuance. The judgment is, therefore, affirmed. \u00b0</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Judgment affirmed.\"</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
