Judgment by default was rendered jointly against all the plaintiffs in error, to-wit: Bird Saffold, Wm. Saffold, and Sarah B. Herring. The record showed service, duly perfected, on Wm.

On the writ issued for Bird Saffold, the Sheriff made the following return, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\">\u201c Came to hand the 24th day of April, 1855, and executed \u201c the same day by personally serving the defendant, Wm.

Their promise is that one or all will pay ; not that any two of them will pay. \u201c If three \u201c or more bind themselves jointly and severally, the obligee \u201c cannot sue two of them only, jointly.

(Hart. Dig., Art. 704.) Having erroneously taken judgment against the defendant not, served, no reason is perceived why the defendant in error may not confess errors and have the case dismissed as to him, without affecting the judgment as to the other defendants. They cannot have been prejudiced by the rendition of judgment against their co-defendant; and the error is not one of which they can complain. The judgment will be reversed and the cause dismissed, as to the defendant and plaintiff in error, Bird Saffold, at the cost of the def\u00e9nd- and in error, and affirmed as to the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Judgment re-formed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
