This is an action in assumpsit to recover upon a fire insurance policy issued to appellee by appellant.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-4\" pgmap=\"370\">The policy by its terms insured appellee from the 8th day of March, 1902, to the .8th day of March, 1903, at noon against all direct loss or damage by fire to property therein described, to an amount not exceeding $1,000. The policy contained a provision that it might be can-celled \u201c-by the company by giving five days\u2019 notice of such cancellation.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-5\" pgmap=\"370\">March 22, 1902, appellant concluded to cancel the policy and caused a registered letter to be deposited in the post office at Chicago, addressed to appellee at DeKalb, Illinois, giving notice of cancellation and stating that appellee would \u201c be allowed until the 27th day of March, 1902, at 12 o\u2019clock noon to replace the insurance elsewhere, after which time we shall cancel said policy on our books, and all liability of said company under said policy will then cease and determine, and we request you to return said policy to this office on or before the date mentioned.\u201d .</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-6\" pgmap=\"370\">The letter Was received at the post office in DeKalb Monday the 24th of March,' and a notice signed by the postmaster was addressed to appellee and placed in his post office box the morning of that day requesting him to \u201c appear in person or send written order for a registered letter of your address in this office.\u201d The letter not having been called for, the postmaster placed a second such notice in appellee\u2019s post office box April 1. The afternoon of that day appellee\u2019s wife called for the registered letter and gave it to her husband.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-7\" pgmap=\"370\">Appellee received the notice of cancellation, therefore, April 1, 1902. The following morning, April 2, at about 9 o\u2019clock his stock of merchandise covered by the policy in controversy was destroyed or damaged by fire. Appellee made proofs of loss in usual form.

It is argued that appellant had done all that could reasonably be required of it to effect cancellation. The policy contained the provision that it might be cancelled at any time \u201c by giving five days\u2019 notice of such cancellation.\u201d It is said this requirement was sufficiently complied with .when appellant undertook to give such notice by mailing to appellee a registered letter to that effect; that the policy did \u201c not provide for actual notice.\u201d It is no doubt true, as appellant suggests, that it was not its fault that appellee did not get his mail promptly. The fact, however, remains that until appellee received the registered letter he had no notice of the intention to cancel the policy. He did not in fact receive any such notice until five davs\u2019after the time therein fixed by appellant as the time when the policy would be cancelled. In the absence of any stipulation in the contract as to the manner in which notice shall be given, actual personal service must be had. N. W. Trav. Men\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Shauss, 148 Ill. 304-309; Ry. Pass. &amp; Ft. Conductors Ass\u2019n v. Leonard, 82 Ill. App. 214-218. The policy under consideration required \u201c five days\u2019 notice.\u201d . This language can be construed as meaning nothing more nor less than what it says. There is no modifying word or phrase, no condition, no limitation, nothing left to implication. It is \u201cnotice,\u201d that is, actual notice. As said in Pro. Life Ins. Co. v. Palmer, Adm\u2019r, 81 Ill. 88-94, \u201c the placing of a notice in the post office is no more the service of a notice than placing it in the hands of a messenger.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b371-6\" pgmap=\"371(54) 372(61)\">It is urged that the first count of the declaration does not state a cause of action because of the alleged absence of an averment that the property was located at the time of the fire as described in the policy. But the declaration avers appellee\u2019s ownership of the property as located and described in the policy. The latter-is set forth in the declaration and made a part thereof. It is averred that the property therein described was \u201c then and there \u201d lost by the fire. An averment, morever, contained in the second count expressly states that the property was lost \u201c while located and contained as described in said policy.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b372-5\" pgmap=\"372\">Appellant returned to appellee the proofs of loss furnished by the latter, with an express denial in writing of \u201c any liability under said policy whatever.\u201d This was a waiver of right under the policy to the sixty days\u2019 time allowed after proofs of loss were furnished, before suit should be brought. The' provision of the policy to that effect thereupon became nugatory. Williamsburg City Ins. Co. v. Cary, 83 Ill. 453-457. The suit was not in fact commenced until after the expiration of that period. It is insisted, however, by appellant, that the declaration should have contained an express averment that sixty days had elapsed after proofs of loss were received by the company before the action was commenced. The policy contains the provision that no suit shall be sustainable until after full compliance by the insured with its requirements. There is an averment in the declaration that the plaintiff has kept and performed all things in said policy mentioned on his part to be kept and performed, that the defendant has not paid the loss or damage, and that on the 24th day of April, A. D. 1902,- it informed plaintiff that it \u201c would not pay any loss whatever under said policy.\u201d That averment charges in effect a waiver of the sixty days\u2019 limitation and dispenses with any need of averring- that the time had elapsed. See Milwaukee Ins. Co. v. Schallman, 188 Ill. 213-220.</p> <p id=\"b372-6\" pgmap=\"372\">There is evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict, and finding no material error the judgment will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b372-7\" pgmap=\"372\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
