This is an action of trespass brought by appellant to recover damages for an alleged assault and battery. Appellee\u2019s own testimony tended to show that in the fall of 1900 he had some controversy with appellant about a stove which he was employed to repair; that in May of the following year, months after the original dispute, he went to the store where appellant was employed and gave an order for some iron; that while in the store he noticed appellant and told him he would like to speak with him concerning the stove deal; that appellant said he was through with that, but finally asked appellee to go out into the shipping room ; that appellee said to appellant that a man connected with the stove transaction had told him (appellee) to tell appellant that \u201c he was a damned liar,\u201d and he (appellee) thought so too; that appellant replied, \u201cYou' are a damned swindler and a scoundrel; \u201d that the parties grabbed each other, and blows were struck before they were separated. Appellee says he paid no attention to where he hit appellant, that all he saw in the way of bruises on appellant\u2019s face was a little blood around his mouth; that \u201c they stopped him too soon;\u201d that he \u201c thought the man that would get in first was the best,\u201d .and that he hit appellant a number of times; that \u201che simply wanted to go in there and tell plaintiff that he was a damned liar.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\" pgmap=\"238\">Appellant\u2019s testimony tends to show that he was dictating a letter to a stenographer, in his -usual place of business, when appellee approached and spoke to him, raising his voice so that appellant requested him to go out into the shipping room; that appellee took out a memorandum book, referring to something he said he had been told appellant had said, and after a few words told appellant, \u201c I think that you beat me and I am going to beat you now ; \u201d that thereupon he began striking appellant, who was hemmed in by boxes and could not get away.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-6\" pgmap=\"238\">There is evidence tending to show that appellant received a serious and perhaps permanent injury, and that he did no more than to endeavor to ward off appellee\u2019s blows. The case was submitted to a jury, who returned a verdict in favor of the defendant. This appeal is prosecuted from the judgment which was rendered in accordance with the verdict.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-3\" pgmap=\"239\">Ullmann &amp; Hacker, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-4\" pgmap=\"239\">Fred H. Atwood, Frank B. Pease, William S. Corbin and Charles O. Loucks, for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b239-5\" pgmap=\"239\">Mr. Justice Freeman</author> <p id=\"ASl\" pgmap=\"239\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b239-6\" pgmap=\"239\">Appellant contends that the verdict was clearly against the weight of the evidence. It appears from appellee\u2019s own testimony that he was the aggressor. He sought appellant in the place where the latter was employed. He began the altercation by telling appellant he thought he was \u201c a damned liar. \u201d Although denying that he struck the first blow he says that he intended to and did \u201c get in first. \u201d According to the other witnesses he apparently struck all the blows, and says that he \u201c was stopped too soon \u201d to enable him to inflict all the injury he would apparently have liked. The evidence conclusively preponderates in favor of appellant, tending to show that appellee provoked the quarrel, that he was the aggressor and that he intended to and endeavored to injure appellant. Even if his statement be accepted that he \u201c hit plaintiff after plaintiff caught hold of him,\u201d no other conclusion is possible, from this record, than that he used more force than was necessary for his alleged self defense. The evidence on both sides indicates that appellee was animated by a vindictive spirit of revenge, which he had cherished for a considerable time, and appellant\u2019s evidence, uncontradicted apparently in this respect, tends to show that he carried a memorandum to keep him in mind of his purpose. There is no evidence tending even remotely to show that there would have been any difficulty had not appellee provoked it. \u201c The law will not permit him to provoke or bring on a difficulty with the plaintiff and then avail himself of the plea of self defense.\u201d Hulse v. Tollman, 49 Ill. App. 490-495, and cases there cited.</p> <p id=\"b239-7\" pgmap=\"239(40) 240(100)\">The burden of proof was on appellee to maintain his plea of son assault demesne. Gizler v. Witzel, 82 Ill. 322-326. It is not important which party made the first assault, if it is apparent, as the preponderating evidence tends to show, that appellee used more force than was reasonably necessary, even if acting in defense of his own person. Abt v. Burgheim, 80 Ill. 92-95; Trogden v. Henn, 85 Ill. 237. If a man under such circumstances strikes \u201c a blow not necessary to his defense, or after all danger is past, or by way of revenge, he is guilty of an assault and battery.\u201d Ogden v. Claycomb, 52 Ill. 366 ; Gizler v. Witzel, supra. A charge of swindling is \u201c no justification for the beating and wounding.\u201d Sorgenfrei v. Schroeder, 75 Ill. 397-399.</p> <p id=\"b240-5\" pgmap=\"240\">The first instruction given at the request of appellee was in substance that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff and that the latter must make out his case by a preponderance of the evidence. This was erroneous in a case of this kind, where the burden of proof was on the defendant under his plea of son assault demesne, to which replication was filed. In effect that plea admits the assault but avers that it was committed in self defense, the defendant using no more force than was necessary for that purpose. The fact that a plea of not guilty was also filed does not change the situation in this respect. On the issue raised by the special plea the burden was still upon the defendant. Hulse v. Tollman, 49 Ill. App. 490-497. It was error to place it entirely upon the plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b240-6\" pgmap=\"240\">What is said in Boren v. Bartleson, 39 Ill. 43-45, is, we think, applicable in this case, and vve need not extend its consideration. The judgment of the Circuit Court will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b240-7\" pgmap=\"240\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
