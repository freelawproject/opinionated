The Supreme Court reversed our prior decision,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which we concluded that the doctrine of res judicata precluded defendant from applying the coordination of benefits provision of \u00a7 354 of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (WDCA), MCL 418.354; MSA 17.237(354). <em>Scheuneman v General Motors Corp, </em>461 Mich 906 (1999). On remand, we are asked to consider whether \u00a7 354 is preempted by subsection 1144(a), 29 USC 1144(a), of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (erisa), 29 USC 1001 <em>et seq. </em>We conclude that \u00a7 354 is not preempted by the ERISA and affirm the decision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission holding that defendant properly coordinated plaintiff\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Section 354 of the wdca provides for the coordination of worker\u2019s compensation benefits with pension or retirement benefits by requiring that the worker\u2019s compensation benefits be reduced by the amounts specified in \u00a7 354. In the instant case, plaintiff claims that his worker\u2019s compensation benefits were improperly coordinated with an employer-funded mutual pension, i.e., a pension agreed to by the parties when the employee is not eligible for a regular retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>pension and is deemed ineligible for a disability pension, pursuant to subsection 354(l)(d), which provides that worker\u2019s compensation payments be reduced by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">[t]he after-tax amount of the pension or retirement payments received or being received pursuant to a plan or program established or maintained by the same employer from whom benefits under section 351, 361, or 835 [of the wdca] are received, if the employee did not contribute directly to the pension or retirement plan or program. [MCL 4'18.354(l)(d); MSA 17.237(354)(l)(d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Plaintiff claims that the coordination of his benefits under subsection 354(l)(d) was improper because \u00a7 354 is preempted by the ERISA. Subsection 1144(a) of the ERISA, 29 USC 1144(a), provides that the ERISA \u201cshall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in section 1003(a) of this title and not exempt under section 1003(b) of this title.\u201d <em>American Medical Security, Inc v Allstate Ins Co, </em>235 Mich App 301, 305; 597 NW2d 244 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">To determine whether \u00a7 354 is preempted by the ERISA, the first inquiry is whether the mutual pension plaintiff receives is part of an \u201cemployee benefit plan\u201d as that phrase is defined in 29 USC 1003(a). Generally, an employee benefit plan is covered by the erisa if it is established or maintained by \u201cany employer engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce,\u201d or by \u201cany employee organization or organizations representing employees engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce.\u201d 29 USC 1003(a). The next inquiry is whether any of the exceptions in subsection 1003(b) apply to take the mutual pension outside the erisa\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>coverage. The erisa does not apply to an employee benefit plan if (1) the plan is a governmental plan,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) the plan is a church plan<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with respect to which no election has been made under subsection 410(d) of title 26, (3) the plan is maintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable worker\u2019s compensation laws or unemployment compensation or disability insurance laws, (4) the plan is maintained outside the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens, or (5) the plan is an excess benefit plan<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and is unfunded.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Plaintiff provided this Court with few details regarding the nature of the mutual pension at issue. Plaintiff merely states that \u201c[t]here can be no doubt that the mutual pension benefit paid to plaintiff is an \u2018employee benefit plan\u2019 \u201d under the erisa. Because it appears from the facts presented that the mutual pension at issue was part of an employee benefit plan as that phrase is defined in the erisa, and that none of the exceptions set forth in subsection 1003(b) are applicable, for the purposes of this opinion we will assume, without deciding, that the mutual pension at issue was part of a pension plan covered by the erisa.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Assuming that the mutual pension plaintiff receives is part of an employee benefit plan that is covered by the erisa, we must now determine whether \u00a7 354 \u201crelates to\u201d the employee benefit plan. A state law \u201crelates to\u201d an employee benefit plan if it \u201c \u2018has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u2019 \u201d <em>D'Avanzo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>v Wise &amp; Marsac, PC, </em>223 Mich App 314, 321; 565 NW2d 915 (1997), quoting <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co v McClendon, </em>498 US 133, 139; 111 S Ct 478; 112 L Ed 2d 474 (1990). A state law may \u201crelate to\u201d a benefit plan even if its effect on the plan is indirect and even if the law was not specifically designed to affect the plan. <em>Ingersoll-Rand, supra-, D\u2019Avanzo, supra. </em>Generally, the ERISA preempts a state law when the state law interferes with an ERISA plan by (1) altering the level of benefits that would be paid out under a given plan from state to state, (2) altering the terms of a plan, such as the requirements for eligibility, or (3) subjecting the fiduciaries of a plan to claims other than those provided for in the ERISA itself. <em>Teper v Park West Galleries, Inc, </em>431 Mich 202, 214; 427 NW2d 535 (1988). However, while the scope of the ERISA preemption provision is broad, it is not without limits. \u201cState laws or state-law claims whose effect on employee benefit plans is merely tenuous, remote, or peripheral are not preempted.\u201d <em>D'Avanzo, supra </em>at 321-322, citing <em>Shaw v Delta Air Lines, Inc, </em>463 US 85, 100, n 21; 103 S Ct 2890; 77 L Ed 2d 490 (1983). Moreover, it is presumed that, in enacting the ERISA, Congress did not intend to preempt areas of traditional state regulation. <em>Teper, supra </em>at 208. Worker\u2019s compensation traditionally is an area of state authority. <em>Saylor v Parker Seal Co, </em>975 F2d 252, 256 (CA 6, 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Applying these principles to the instant case leads us to the conclusion that \u00a7 354 is not preempted by the erisa. First, \u00a7 354 does not alter the level of benefits that would be paid out under a given employee benefit plan from state to state. <em>Teper, supra </em>at 214. The coordination provisions in \u00a7 354 have no effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>on the amount of benefits paid under the mutual pension. Rather, \u00a7 354 affects the amount of worker\u2019s compensation benefits paid to the employee. Second, plaintiff has not demonstrated that \u00a7 354 alters the terms of the pension plan. <em>Id. </em>Finally, plaintiff has not demonstrated that \u00a7 354 subjects the fiduciaries of the pension plan to claims other than those provided in the erisa. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Because \u00a7 354 does not affect the administration of the mutual pension plan, but only affects the amount of worker\u2019s compensation benefits paid, which is traditionally an area of state authority, we conclude that any effect of \u00a7 354 on the pension plan is too tenuous and remote to warrant preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Our conclusion is supported by the decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Saylor, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Saylor, supra </em>at 254, the court considered whether the erisa preempted Kentucky common law allowing employers to reduce the amount of worker\u2019s compensation payments an employee received by the amount of the payments the employee received under a disability pension plan covered by the erisa. Noting that the erisa plan did not prohibit the integration of pension and worker\u2019s compensation benefits and that the reduction in worker\u2019s compensation benefits did not affect the administration of the defendant\u2019s pension plan, the court concluded that the erisa did not preempt the Kentucky common law allowing the reduction in worker\u2019s compensation benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 256. Similarly, in the instant case, because \u00a7 354 alters only the amount of worker\u2019s compensation benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>paid to an employee and has no effect on the amount of pension benefits paid, \u00a7 354 is not preempted by the erisa.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Furthermore, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s argument, we find the United States Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Alessi v Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc, </em>451 US 504; 101 S Ct 1895; 68 L Ed 2d 402 (1981), to be inapplicable to the instant case. In <em>Alessi, </em>the Supreme Court considered a New Jersey statute that prohibited employee pension plans subject to ERISA regulation from reducing an employee\u2019s pension benefits by an amount equal to the worker\u2019s compensation payments for which the employee was eligible. <em>Id. </em>at 507-508. The Court held that the state statute was preempted by the erisa because it prohibited pension plan administrators from integrating pension benefits, which was a method of calculating pension benefits permitted by federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 524. Unlike the state statute at issue in <em>Alessi, </em>\u00a7 354 does not attempt to regulate the administration of the pension plan, but only regulates the amount of worker\u2019s compensation benefits paid to an employee. Thus, it is clear that <em>Alessi </em>is factually distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We therefore conclude that the erisa does not preempt \u00a7 354 of the wdca and we affirm the decision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission holding that defendant properly coordinated plaintiff\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-9\"> <em>Scheuneman v General Motors Corp, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued January 8, 1999 (Docket No. 199831).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\"> See 29 USC 1002(32) for the definition of a governmental plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\"> See 29 USC 1002(33) for the definition of a church plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\"> See 29 USC 1002(36) for the definition of an excess benefit plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\"> Although not binding on this Court, federal precedent may provide persuasive authority.
