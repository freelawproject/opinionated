The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the trial court improperly found that the plaintiff sustained its burden of proof on its lapse of time claim. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">The parties entered into a written lease agreement for one year on or about December 12,1994. The written lease terminated on December 31, 1995, by its terms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>After January 1, 1996, the defendant paid rent monthly to the plaintiff until May and June, 1997. On June 19, 1997, the plaintiff served the defendant a notice to quit possession on or before June 30, 1997. Because the defendant remained in possession after June 30, 1997, the plaintiff brought a summary process action against her, alleging that the tenancy had terminated by lapse of time and because of nonpayment of rent for the months of May and June, 1997. The defendant denied the allegations and filed two special defenses. The first special defense was that the subject premises contained numerous housing code violations. That defense was abandoned by the defendant at oral argument before this court. The second special defense alleged that the subject premises lacked a certificate of occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The trial court found that the plaintiff sustained its burden of proof on both lapse of time and nonpayment of rent. The trial court also found that the defendant did not sustain her burden of proof on either of her special defenses. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court incorrectly held that lapse of time was a proper basis for termination of this tenancy. We find no merit to this claim. The trial court correctly held that lapse of time was an adequate ground for termination under the facts of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>After the written lease expired by its terms, the plaintiff continued to accept the defendant\u2019s monthly rent payment, creating a month-to-month tenancy. See General Statutes \u00a7 47a-3b;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Apothecaries Hall Co., </em>80 Conn. 503, 507, 69 A. 12 (1908). A periodic tenancy may be terminated unilaterally by either landlord or tenant. <em>Hour Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Gorez, </em>5 Conn. Cir. Ct. 419, 421, 254 A.2d 919 (1968). \u201cIn the case of a rental on a month-to-month basis the tenancy is not regarded as a continuous one. The tenancy for each month is one separate from that of every other month.\u201d <em>Welk </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>136 Conn. 603, 606-607, 73 A.2d 295 (1950). The renewal of a month-to-month tenancy requires the payment of rent by the tenant and the acceptance of payment by the landlord or \u201cother circumstances showing an agreement to continue the lease.\u201d <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Ambler, </em>125 Conn. 543, 551, 7 A.2d 228 (1939). The mere act of holding over does not create a new tenancy. General Statutes \u00a7 47a-3d;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Ambler, </em>supra, 551. Instead, the holdover tenant becomes a tenant at sufferance with no legal right to possession. <em>Corthouts </em>v. <em>Connecticut Fire Safety Services Corp., 2 </em>Conn. Cir. Ct. 34, 36-37, 193 A.2d 909 (1963). A landlord may properly remove such a tenant at sufferance through a summary process action for lapse of time. General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23 (a);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Ambler, </em>supra, 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The defendant here did not pay rent after May, 1997, and the plaintiff did not accept rent after that date. Absent any other circumstances indicating an agreement to continue the lease after May, 1997, the lease terminated at that time. The defendant remained on the premises and continues to remain as of the hearing on this appeal. As we have noted, however, holding over by a lessee is not evidence of a new lease. The plaintiff provided the defendant with a notice to quit that gave the defendant more than ten days to quit possession of the premises. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to possession because of lapse of time. Because this issue is dispositive, we need not consider the other issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen the owner or lessor, or his legal representative, or his attorney-at-law, or in-fact, desires to obtain possession or occupancy of any land or building, any apartment in any building, any dwelling unit, any trailer, or any land upon which a trailer is used or stands, and (1) when a rental agreement or lease of such property, whether in writing or by parol, terminates for any of the following reasons: (A) By lapse of time . . .
