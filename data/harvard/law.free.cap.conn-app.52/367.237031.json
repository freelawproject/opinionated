We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff, as general contractor, entered into a contract (prime contract) with the state of Connecticut to construct barracks for Troop C of the state police in Tolland (project). The plaintiff subsequently entered into a subcontract with the defendant, who was to perform the site excavation for the project. Thereafter, disputes arose between the parties and the subcontract was terminated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, the defendant commenced an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the arbitration clause of the subcontract. The plaintiff filed a counterclaim. On June 5, 1996, the arbitrator awarded $96,837.80 to the defendant and $67,152 to the plaintiff on its counterclaim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff filed an application to vacate the award, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-420, and the defendant filed a cross application to confirm the award. The trial court denied the application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>to vacate the award and granted the defendant\u2019s cross application to confirm the award. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the trial court improperly confirmed the award because the form of the award does not conform with the arbitration clause in the subcontract,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which by reference incorporates the arbitration provision of the prime contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court, however, in ruling that the award conformed with the submission, determined that the original or a copy of the executed prime contract was not in evidence before the arbitrator and that the plaintiff failed to prove that the award did not comply with General Statutes \u00a7 4-61 (d) and (e).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201cThe [appellate] court may reverse or modify the decision of the trial court if it determines that the factual findings are clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record, or that the decision is otherwise erroneous in law. . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. \u201cThe scope of review by the court of an arbitrator\u2019s power to make an award is limited. Arbitration is a creature of contract between the parties and its autonomy requires a minimum of judicial intrusion. . . . The parties themselves, by the agreement of the submission, define the powers of the arbitrator. . . . The submission constitutes the charter of the entire arbitration proceedings and defines and limits the issues to be decided. . . . When the parties have agreed to a procedure and have delineated the authority of the arbitrator, they must be bound by those limits. . . . An application to vacate or correct an award should be granted when an arbitrator has exceeded his power. In deciding whether an arbitrator has exceeded his power, we need only examine the submission and the award to determine whether the award conforms to the submission.

App. 805, 811-12, 717 A.2d 258, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 920, 722 A.2d 809 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u201cIn determining whether a submission is unrestricted, we look at the authority of the arbitrator. The authority of the arbitrator to adjudicate the controversy is limited only if the agreement contains express language restricting the breadth of issues, reserving explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>rights, or conditioning the award on court review. In the absence of such qualifications, an agreement is unrestricted. . . . <em>Perkins &amp; Mario, P. C. </em>v. <em>Annunziata, </em>45 Conn. App. 237, 239-40, 694 A.2d 1388 (1997).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, Local 760, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The following additional facts and procedural histoiy are necessary for our resolution of this appeal. During the arbitration proceedings, the parties submitted joint exhibits to the arbitrator. Although one of the exhibits purported to be a copy of the prime contract, it was incomplete and not signed. After the arbitrator issued his award, the plaintiff asked that the arbitrator conform his award to \u00a7 4-61 (e). The arbitrator denied the request. The plaintiff then moved to vacate the award claiming that (1) the award did not conform to the contract requirement to follow \u00a7 4-61 (e), (2) the arbitrator was guilty of misconduct in accepting evidence after the close of the proceedings and (3) the arbitrator imperfectly executed his powers in not providing a mutual, final and definite award.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At oral argument, the plaintiff claimed that because the arbitrator failed to issue an award that conforms with \u00a7 4-61 (e), it cannot pursue its claims against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The trial court heard oral argument on the parties\u2019 motions on several days. On December 30, 1996, with the consent of the parties and with their agreement as to the language of the request, the trial court asked the arbitrator for an articulation of his award. The arbitrator responded to the trial court on March 14, 1997. The articulation consisted of several attachments or tabs; tab B sets forth how the defendant\u2019s award was computed and tab C sets forth how the plaintiffs award was computed. The plaintiff renewed its application to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>vacate the award, claiming that the articulation articulated only the damages without any conclusions of law or findings of fact as required by \u00a7 4-61 (e). The defendant renewed its objection to the application to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The trial court determined that the submission to the arbitrator was the subcontract between the parties and that article I of the subcontract provides that \u201cthe subcontract documents consist of . . . (2) the Prime Contract, consisting of the Agreement between the [state and the plaintiff] . . . .\u201d Article 6.1 of the subcontract provides that arbitration \u201cshall be conducted in the same manner and under the same procedure as provided in the Prime Contract with respect to claims between the [state and the plaintiff] .... If the Prime Contract does not provide for arbitration or fails to specify the manner and procedure for arbitration, it shall be conducted in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. . . .\u2019\u2019The trial court found that the prime contract between the state and the plaintiff was never in evidence before the arbitrator. In response to the plaintiffs claim that the prime contract was incorporated by reference, the trial court reasoned that, assuming the plaintiffs argument is correct, the original or a copy of the executed prime contract should have been submitted to the arbitrator to ensure its accuracy and to advise the arbitrator of its provisions. Without the provisions of the prime contract before him, the arbitrator properly concluded that the submission was made pursuant to the construction industry arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. The trial court, therefore, concluded that the submission to the arbitrator was unrestricted and that the award conformed with the submission. We agree with the trial court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">As we have stated, the parties determine the scope of the arbitration submission by the terms of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>agreement. See <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, Local 760, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 811-12. Section 6.1 of the subcontract provided for arbitration of the parties\u2019 differences. Assuming, without deciding whether the prime contract was incorporated by reference in the subcontract, we conclude that it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to put the prime contract in evidence before the arbitrator. The incomplete, unexecuted copy of the prime contract included in the joint exhibits submitted to the arbitrator is not evidence of the terms of the prime contract. See <em>Suffield Development Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Society for Savings, </em>243 Conn. 832, 843, 708 A.2d 1361 (1998); <em>Smallmill Brook Racing Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Realty Advisors, Inc., </em>39 Conn. App. 444, 453, 664 A.2d 819 (1995). Without evidence of the terms of the prime contract, the arbitrator could conclude only that the submission was to conform to the construction industry arbitration rules and that the arbitration was, therefore, unrestricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Because the submission was unrestricted, the trial court properly confirmed the arbitration award, and we need not consider the issues subsumed in the plaintiffs main claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\"> Some of the disputes allegedly arose due to changes requested by the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-10\"> The award also included the following language: \u201cIn accordance with the request of the parties, included in the [defendant\u2019s] award are the following: Tomlco Electric Company\u2019s claim $6625, MPH\u2019s claim $1325.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\"> The plaintiff framed the issue as follows: \u201cDid the trial court err in not finding that the arbitrator failed to perform his duties in failing to issue findings of fact pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-61?\u201d The following issues are subsumed in the plaintiffs primary claim: (1) the contract specified that the provisions of any submittal to arbitration would be pursuant to the same rules and procedures as set forth in \u00a7 4-61; (2) the rendition of the arbitration award was restricted to the terms of \u00a7 4-61 and thus findings of fact were mandated by these procedures; and (3) the arbitrator did not perform his duties as specified and in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-414.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\"><em> </em>Section 6.1 of the subcontract provides: \u201cAny controversy or claim between the Contractor and Subcontractor arising out of or related to this Subcontract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration, which shall be conducted in the same manner and under the same procedure as provided in the Prime Contract with respect to claims between the Owner and the Contractor, except that a decision by the Architect shall not be a condition precedent to arbitration. If the Prime Contract does not provide for arbitration or fails to specify the manner and procedure for arbitration, it shall be conducted in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association currently in effect unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\"> The plaintiff claims that the prime contract provides that, pursuant to state mandate, arbitration proceedings are to be controlled by subsections (d) and (e) of General Statutes \u00a7 4-61, which is entitled \u201cActions against the state on highway and public works contracts. Arbitration.\u201d The plaintiff claims that the arbitrator\u2019s factual determinations are necessary in order for it to present its claims against the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-61 provides in relevant part: \u201c(d) Hearings shall be scheduled for arbitration in a manner that shall ensure that each party shall have reasonable time and opportunity to prepare and present its case, taking into consideration the size and complexity of the claims presented. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"aue-dedup-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201c(e) The arbitrators shall conduct the hearing and shall hear evidence as to the facts, and arguments as to the interpretation and application of contractual provisions. After the hearing, the arbitrators shall issue in writing: (1) Findings of fact, (2) a decision in which the arbitrators interpret the contract and apply it to the facts found and (3) an award. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\"> These issues are subsumed in the plaintiffs appeal to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b395-5\"> The trial court also determined that to confirm the award it need not address the plaintiffs additional claims, but it did address them in its memorandum of decision. Even if we were to assume that \u00a7 4-61 applies to the proceedings, the trial court found in its memorandum of decision that the award was in compliance with the statute: \u201cThere is no question that a written award was made on June 5, 1996. Findings of fact were clearly set out in the award <em>and </em>in the arbitrator\u2019s articulation dated March 14, 1997, in which he broke down the amounts awarded and described them. The descriptions in tabs B and C, i.e., \u2018surveyor\u2019s mistakes, additional cost for protection due to project hold-up, cost to correct work not acceptable, cost to complete the Mizzy contract less Wilcox remaining,\u2019 clearly show to those in the construction industry the basis of the awards as they are applicable to the terms of the contract.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The trial court also found that the plaintiff did not sustain its burden of proof that the arbitrator accepted and used evidence from the defendant submitted after the close of evidence. The defendant claimed that what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>plaintiff terms \u201cnew evidence\u201d was merely a summary or comparison of evidence before the arbitrator. The trial court found that the defendant filed the \u201cnew evidence\u201d with its posttrial brief. The plaintiff filed a lengthy objection to the \u201cnew evidence\u201d dated March 16,1996. Although the arbitrator advised the parties that he was keeping the hearings open beyond the submission of briefs until April 30, 1996, the plaintiff never requested a hearing. The trial court found that the arbitrator clearly considered the objection by granting objections as to appendices four, seven and nine, and had them removed from his copy of the defendant\u2019s brief. The trial court then concluded that the plaintiff had not sustained its burden that it had been denied a full and fair hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
