O\u2019Neil Construction Company (O\u2019Neil) appeal from the judgment granting the motion for summary judgment filed by the intervening plaintiff, Peter Gisondi &amp; Company (Gisondi). On appeal, Boehringer and O\u2019Neil claim that the trial court improperly found that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to their three count counterclaim against Gisondi and that Gisondi was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-11\">The following facts are relevant to the disposition of this appeal. On August, 4, 1992, Gisondi and O\u2019Neil, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>which had entered into a construction contract with Boehringer, entered into a written contract pursuant to which Gisondi agreed to paint and perform related work at the Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceutical, Inc., facility at 900 Ridgebury Road in Ridgefield. The plaintiff, Fernand Harvey, was hired by Gisondi to work there as apainter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 31,1993, the plaintiff slipped and fell in the parking lot of the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff brought suit against Boeh-ringer, as the owner of the property at the time of the accident, and against O\u2019Neil and Turner Construction Company<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to their construction contracts with Boehringer, for alleged personal injuries arising from the slip and fall. On February 22, 1996, Gisondi, as the plaintiffs employer, filed an intervening complaint seeking recovery of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits that it had paid to the plaintiff. Subsequently, on April 11, 1996, Boehringer and O\u2019Neil filed an answer and a three count counterclaim against Gisondi. In the first count of the counterclaim, they seek contractual indemnification from Gisondi. The second and third counts of the counterclaim allege breach of contract claims for failure to provide additional insurance coverage and a safe workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">On May 7, 1997, Gisondi filed a motion for summary judgment as to Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s counterclaim, which was granted on July 23, 1997. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Before turning to the merits of this appeal, we note that our standard of review on appeal following a trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment is well established. \u201cThe judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 17-49. A \u201cmaterial fact\u201d is a fact that will make a difference in the result of the case. See <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>214 Conn. 573, 578, 573 A.2d 699 (1990). The facts at issue are those alleged in the pleadings. See <em>Plouffe </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., </em>160 Conn. 482, 489, 280 A.2d 359 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">The party seeking summary judgment \u201chas the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all material facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law. \u201dD.H.R. <em>Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980). Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 17-45 and 17-46, the party adverse to such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>214 Conn. 242, 246-47, 571 A.2d 116 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u201cWhile the court must view the inferences to be drawn from the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion ... a party may not rely on mere speculation or conjecture as to the true nature of the facts to overcome a motion for summary judgment. ... On appeal, however, the burden is on the opposing party to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the movant\u2019s summary judgment motion was clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Norse Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tingley Systems, Inc., </em>49 Conn. App. 582, 591, 715 A.2d 807 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>\u201cEqually well settled is that the trial court does not sit as the trier of fact when ruling on a motion for summary judgment. . . . [T]he trial court\u2019s function is not to decide issues of material fact, but rather to determine whether any such issues exist.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fleet Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Galluzzo, </em>33 Conn. App. 662, 666, 637 A.2d 803, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 910, 642 A.2d 1206 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">In support of their claim that summary judgment was improper, Boehringer and O\u2019Neil argue that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the plaintiffs injuries were caused by, resulted from, arose out of or occurred in connection with his work for Gisondi. We agree with Boehringer and O\u2019Neil and conclude that the summary judgment rendered by the trial court should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">In the first count of their counterclaim, Boehringer and O\u2019Neil seek indemnification from Gisondi pursuant to article XX of the contract. The contract between Gisondi and O\u2019Neil provided for indemnification of O\u2019Neil and others for harm suffered in connection with the execution of work at the facility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>In count one of their counterclaim, Boehringer and O\u2019Neil allege that \u201c[a]t the time of his fall, the plaintiff Harvey, was an employee of the intervening plaintiff, Gisondi, and Mr. Harvey was present on the [Boeh-ringer] premises on the day of his fall for the sole purpose of pursuing his employment responsibility to Gisondi. . . . Gisondi was, at all times relevant to this counterclaim, in control of both Mr. Harvey and the work area where Mr. Harvey allegedly fell, to the exclusion of the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">In granting Gisondi\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to the first count of the counterclaim, the trial court found that there was no allegation in the first party complaint that the injuries were occasioned by, or resulted from, Gisondi\u2019s work. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the allegations in the original complaint was misplaced. Instead, the allegations of Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s counterclaim are at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Moreover, in its motion for summary judgment, Gisondi did not establish through the pleadings, affidavits or any other proof that the plaintiffs injuries were not caused by, resulted from, arose out of or occurred in connection with his work for Gisondi and therefore that Gisondi was not obligated under the contract to indemnify Boehringer and O\u2019Neil. The issue remains whether the plaintiffs accident was sufficiently connected to Gisondi\u2019s work so that the contractual indemnification provisions would apply. This is a genuine issue of material fact; therefore, we conclude that summary judgment was improperly granted as to count one of the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">In granting the motion for summary judgment, the trial court also found that no material fact existed as to Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s claim for contractual indemnification, as they are barred from recovering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>because of their own negligence. The trial court articulated that \u201cHarvey can only recover based on the allegations of his complaint. The complaint alleges negligence on the part of O\u2019Neil and Boehringer by allowing snow to accumulate on the parking lot. As stated <em>in Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Gilbertie, </em>33 Conn. Sup. 582, 584-85, 363 A.2d 759 (1976), \u2018[the contractual] provision is of no avail in insulating the defendants from the consequences of their own negligence, however, since a party cannot by contract relieve himself of such liability.\u2019 Therefore, a party cannot be indemnified for his own negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The trial court relied solely on the allegations of the plaintiffs original complaint in discerning the validity of Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s counterclaim. The trial court determined that the failure of the plaintiff to make allegations in his original complaint pertaining to Gisondi\u2019s negligence barred Boehringer and O\u2019Neil from seeking contractual indemnification, as the only allegations were based on their own negligence. The trial court\u2019s reliance on the original complaint, however, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">In their counterclaim, Boehringer and O\u2019Neil allege that Gisondi was negligent, as the subcontractor in control, to the exclusion of Boehringer and O\u2019Neil, of the work area where the plaintiff fell. It is the alleged negligence of Gisondi for which Boehringer and O\u2019Neil seek to be indemnified and not their own alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Moreover, the plaintiff, as an employee of Gisondi, was entitled to receive and did receive benefits pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. Consequently, he has no cause of action against his employer, Gisondi. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-284 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiff was barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>from bringing a negligence claim against Gisondi in his original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">We conclude that count one of Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s counterclaim does not seek contractual indemnification for Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s own alleged negligence, but rather, the indemnification sought by Boehringer and O\u2019Neil in their counterclaim is for the alleged negligence of Gisondi.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">We also address Gisondi\u2019s argument in support of the trial court\u2019s granting of the motion for summary judgment, as to the first count of Boehringer and O\u2019Neil\u2019s counterclaim, that their failure to file an affidavit in support of their objection to summary judgment was a fatal flaw. Boehringer\u2019s and 0\u2018Neil assert that the motion for summary judgment was not sufficiently supported by affidavits and, thus, the burden of proof did not shift to them, the nonmoving parties. We agree and conclude that Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s failure to file supporting affidavits was not a fatal flaw to their objection to the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u201cWhen a motion for summary judgment is supported by affidavits and other documents, an adverse party, by affidavit or as otherwise provided by [Practice Book \u00a7 17-45], must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial, and if he does not so respond, the court is entitled to rely upon <em>the facts stated in the affidavit of the movant. Kakadelis </em>v. <em>DeFabritis, </em>191 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Conn. 276, 280-81, 464 A.2d 57 (1983).\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Desnoyers </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>4 Conn. App. 666, 667-68, 496 A.2d 237 (1985). In the present case, Gisondi filed only the affidavit of its executive vice president, Tony Gisondi, and attached, as an exhibit, the contract between Gisondi and O\u2019Neil. The affidavit submitted by Gisondi merely verified that the contract was the one entered into by Gisondi and O\u2019Neil. Additionally, the affidavit provided that the contract was drafted and prepared by O\u2019Neil, and not Gisondi.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Thus, Gisondi\u2019s affidavit did not dispense with any genuine issues of material fact raised in Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s counterclaim or raised by the attached contract. As such, Boehringer and O\u2019Neil were not required to set forth the existence of any genuine issue of material fact with supporting affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Additionally, even if we assume arguendo that Gisondi sufficiently supported its motion for summary judgment with Tony Gisondi\u2019s affidavit, Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s failure to file an affidavit in support of their objection to the motion for summary judgment does not automatically mean that the motion will be granted. Rather, the trial court is entitled to rely on those facts set forth in Gisondi\u2019s affidavit. See id. Here, those facts that can be relied on do not dispose of any genuine issue of material fact raised by Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s counterclaim or those raised by the contract. Thus, Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s failure to file an affidavit in support of their objection to summary judgment was not a fatal flaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Boehringer and O\u2019Neil alleged in the second count of their counterclaim that Gisondi breached the contract in failing to provide additional insurance coverage. The contract expressly provided for Gisondi, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>subcontractor, to purchase a commercial general liability insurance policy to cover the indemnification agreement set forth in the contract and to provide coverage for O\u2019Neil and O\u2019Neil Industries, Inc., as additional insureds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In their counterclaim, Boehringer and O\u2019Neil allege that \u201cGisondi failed to provide the insurance coverage required under Article XXI of the contract in breach of such agreement.\u201d On appeal, Boehringer and O\u2019Neil argue that summary judgment was improperly granted as to count two of their counterclaim because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to this breach of contract claim. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The trial court articulated with regard to its granting of Gisondi\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to this count of Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s counterclaim that, \u201csince the plaintiffs allegations of negligence against Boehringer and O\u2019Neil do not allege any operations performed or incidents relating to Gisondi or arising out of [its] work, this provision is inapplicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Again, we find that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the allegations in the plaintiffs original complaint is misplaced. Instead, the genuine issue of material fact raised by this breach of contract claim is whether insurance was provided by Gisondi as required by the contract. This issue is not resolved by Gisondi in its motion for summary judgment. Further, the trial court does not address this issue. Thus, we find that a genuine issue of material fact as to Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s second count of their counterclaim remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s third count of their counterclaim asserts a breach of contract claim against Gisondi for failure to provide a safe workplace. The contract provides that Gisondi will be responsible for providing a safe workplace for all employees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">In count three of their counterclaim, Boehringer and O\u2019Neil allege that, pursuant to article XV of the contract, \u201cGisondi failed to take all reasonable precautions to protect its employee from injury during the performance of its work on the project by failing to provide a safe and secure path for entry and exit to [Boehringer\u2019s] building during the performance of Gisondi\u2019s work.\u201d On appeal, Boehringer and O\u2019Neil argue that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Gisondi breached the contract. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">As to the third count of Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s counterclaim, the trial court stated that \u201c[t]here is no allegation that this injury was occasioned by Gisondi\u2019s work.\u201d Again, we find the trial court\u2019s focus on the allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s original complaint misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s claim that Gisondi breached the contract is not resolved by looking to the allegations of the plaintiffs complaint. The terms of the contract and facts concerning Gisondi\u2019s performance of that contract are at issue here, and, thus, we find that a genuine issue of material fact remained concerning Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s claim that Gisondi breached the contractual provision requiring him to provide a safe workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Accordingly, because factual issues exist as to all three counts of Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s counterclaim, we find that the trial court improperly granted Gisondi\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s granting of Gisondi\u2019s motion for summary judgment because the trial court improperly found that no genuine issues of material fact existed as to each count of Boehringer\u2019s and O\u2019Neil\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the intervening plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-8\"> Fernand Harvey is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b25-9\"> Turner Construction Company is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b27-8\"> Article XX of the contract provides in relevant part: \u201cTo the fullest extent permitted by law, the Subcontractor assumes the entire responsibility and liability for any and all liability and damage or injury of any kind or nature whatever (including death resulting therefrom) to all persons, whether employees of the Subcontractor or otherwise, and to all property caused by, resulting from, arising out of, or occurring in connection with the Subcontractor\u2019s (or sub-subcontractor\u2019s) execution of the Work.
