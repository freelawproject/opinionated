On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>trial court improperly (1) denied their motion for permission to file a motion for summary judgment, (2) precluded evidence concerning a collateral case, (3) denied their motion to set aside the verdict as it was against the weight of the evidence, (4) instructed the jury on their claim of invasion of privacy and (5) denied their motion for a new trial, which was based on the purported misconduct of both the trial court judge and defense counsel. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. The plaintiffs in this case are William H. Honan and his three children. In April of 1990, Milton Burton and June Burton, the maternal grandparents of the Honan children, retained the defendants, attorney Joseph Dimyan and his Dan-bury law partnership, Coury &amp; Dimyan, to file a visitation petition pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-59.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petition alleged that Honan and his wife, Nancy Burton,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had denied the Burtons reasonable visitation with respect to the Honan children and, accordingly, sought reasonable visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In response to the visitation petition brought by the Burtons, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>against the defendants dated July 5,1990, alleging, inter alia, abuse of process, intentional infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy. On January 8, 1997, prior to the start of trial, the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on their abuse of process count. The case had been assigned for trial, however, and the trial court refused to entertain the motion because the plaintiffs had failed to obtain the trial court\u2019s permission to file that motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On January 9, 1997, the day before the trial began, the plaintiffs filed a motion for permission to file their motion for summary judgment, which was denied by the trial court. The case was tried and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants on all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Following the jury\u2019s verdict, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial and a motion to set aside the verdict. The trial court denied both motions and rendered judgment in favor of the defendants. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The plaintiffs first claim that the trial court improperly denied their motion for permission to file a motion for summary judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Practice Book \u00a7 17-44 provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any action . . . any party may move for a summary judgment at any time, <em>except that the party must obtain the judicial authority\u2019s permission to file a motion for summary judgment after the case has been assigned for trial. . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It is well established that the duty to provide this court with a record adequate for review rests with the appellant. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>48 Conn. App. 545, 547, 711 A.2d 746, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>cert. denied, 245 Conn. 923, 717 A.2d 239 (1998). In this case, we have not been provided with either a written memorandum of decision or a transcribed copy of an oral decision, signed by the trial court, stating its reasons for refusing to grant the plaintiffs permission to file their motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs, therefore, have failed to provide us with an adequate record with which to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. Accordingly, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The plaintiffs next claim that the trial court improperly precluded evidence concerning a collateral case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">It is axiomatic that \u201c[ejvidence is admissible only if it is relevant. . . . The trial court is given broad discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence and its decision will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of that discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Williams Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>232 Conn. 559, 569, 657 A.2d 212 (1995). \u201cMoreover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there [is] ... a showing ... of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Paige </em>v. <em>St. Andrew\u2019s Roman Catholic Church Corp., </em>247 Conn. 24, 37, 718 A.2d 425 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The cornerstone of the plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process claim is <em>Caslagno </em>v. <em>Wholean, </em>239 Conn. 336, 684 A.2d 1181 (1996), in which our Supreme Court concluded that to bring a visitation petition pursuant to \u00a7 46b-59, the party seeking visitation must demonstrate, as a threshold matter, a \u201cdisruption of the family sufficient to justify state intervention.\u201d Id., 338. The plaintiffs claim that because their family was \u201cintact\u201d at the time the Burtons\u2019 visitation petition was filed, \u00a7 46b-59 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>inapplicable and could not provide the basis for a visitation petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">At trial, the plaintiffs attempted to call Thomas Cloutier, the attorney for the defendant family in <em>Cas-tagno. </em>Additionally, the plaintiffs attempted to introduce into evidence the pleadings from the <em>Castagno </em>case, which were, according to the plaintiffs, \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from the pleadings in their case. The plaintiffs argue that had the <em>Castagno </em>pleadings been introduced, and \u201chad attorney Cloutier been permitted to testify, the jury would have had to conclude as a matter of law that <em>Castagno </em>controls this case and \u00a7 46b-59 has no application to the [plaintiffs].\u201d The plaintiffs assert that with the introduction of this evidence, \u201cthe jury could have only concluded that [the defendants] wilfully abused [the judicial process] by instituting a lawsuit against [the plaintiffs] pursuant to a statute which had no application to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In ruling that Cloutier\u2019s testimony, as well as the <em>Castagno </em>pleadings, were inadmissible, the trial court determined that such evidence concerned a \u201ccollateral case\u201d and, therefore, was irrelevant. We agree. The interjection of facts from a wholly unrelated case could have confused the jury. Additionally, we are not convinced that allowing Cloutier to \u201ctestify as to the fact of the pleadings in <em>Castagno''\u20191 </em>would have established, as a matter of law, that \u00a7 46b-59 had no application to the Honan family and that, as a result, the jury would have had to conclude that Dimyan wilfully abused the judicial process. We cannot say, therefore, that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In addition, the plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that they suffered substantial prejudice or injustice because of the trial court\u2019s ruling. The record discloses that the trial court admitted into evidence the headnote of our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Castagno, </em>as well as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>copy of \u00a7 46b-59. In fact, during the charge to the jury on the plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process claim, the trial court stated: \u201cOf course, you have a copy of the statute which was the basis of bringing [the Burtons\u2019] petition. You also have a copy of the <em>[Castagno] </em>headnote that indicated that . . . <em>there was an interpretation that the statute did not apply to intact families.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">It is clear that the juiy had before it sufficient evidence to determine that \u00a7 46b-59 did not apply to intact families. It had before it the headnote from the <em>Castagno </em>case, as well as the trial court\u2019s statement that <em>Castagno </em>\u201cindicated\u201d that \u00a7 46b-59 \u201cdid not apply to intact families.\u201d We cannot say that Cloutier\u2019s testimony or the <em>Castagno </em>pleadings were necessary for the prosecution of the plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The plaintiffs next claim that the trial court improperly denied their motion to set aside the verdict because it was against the weight of the evidence. The plaintiffs argue that they presented enough evidence to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, their claims of abuse of process, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u201cOur standard of review, where the trial court\u2019s action on a motion to set aside a verdict is challenged, is whether the trial court clearly abused its discretion. . . . The decision to set aside a verdict is a matter within the broad legal discretion of the trial court and it will not be disturbed unless there has been a clear abuse of that discretion. . . . The trial court may set aside a jury\u2019s verdict only if it finds that the jury could not reasonably and legally have reached its conclusion. \u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mezes </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>48 Conn. App. 323, 328, 709 A.2d 597 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The plaintiffs assert that they presented enough evidence to prove their claim of abuse of process. \u201cAn action for abuse of process lies against any person using a legal process against another in an improper manner or to accomplish a purpose for which it was not designed. <em>Varga </em>v. Pareles, [137 Conn. 663, 667, 81 A.2d 112 (1951)]; <em>Schaefer </em>v. O. <em>K. Tool Co., </em>110 Conn. 528, 532-33, 148 A. 330 (1930). Because the tort arises out of the accomplishment of a result that could not be achieved by the proper and successful use of process, the Restatement Second (1977) of Torts, \u00a7 682, emphasizes that the gravamen of the action for abuse of process is the use of a legal process . . . against another <em>primarily </em>to accomplish a purpose for which it is not designed .... Comment b to \u00a7 682 explains that the addition of primarily is meant to exclude liability when the process is used for the purpose for which it is intended, but there is an incidental motive of spite or an ulterior purpose of benefit to the defendant. See also 1 F. Harper, F. James &amp; O. Gray, Torts (2d Ed. 1986) \u00a7 4.9; R. Mallen &amp; V. Levit, Legal Malpractice (2d Ed. 1981) \u00a7 61; W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 121.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mozzochi </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>204 Conn. 490, 494, 529 A.2d 171 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">As stated previously, the underlying visitation petition instituted by the Burtons was based on \u00a7 46b-59, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he Superior Court may grant the right of visitation with respect to any minor child or children to any person, upon an application of such person. ...\u201d The plaintiffs assert that the Burtons\u2019 visitation petition was brought \u201cknowingly pursuant to a statute which did not apply to them.\u201d They claim, therefore, that \u201c[o]n its face, the fact of the suit is an abuse of process.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Again, the crux of the plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process claim is <em>Castagno </em>v. <em>Wholean, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 336. The plaintiffs, however, overlook that the Burtons\u2019 visitation petition was filed in April, 1990, and then withdrawn in September, 1993. The <em>Castagno </em>decision, on the other hand, was not released until November, 1996. Accordingly, even if bringing a visitation petition against an intact family pursuant to \u00a7 46b-59, as that statute has been interpreted by <em>Castagno, </em>can provide the basis for an abuse of process claim, it cannot do so in this case because the defendants could not have <em>known </em>of the statute\u2019s nonapplicability until after the <em>Castagno </em>decision was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Further, \u00a7 46b-59 does not, on its face, state that a person bringing a visitation petition must establish the \u201cdisruption of the family sufficient to justify state intervention.\u201d Id., 338. This was the interpretation given the statute by our Supreme Court after a thorough examination of the common law and the \u201ccontextual interplay\u201d of \u00a7 46b-59 with other statutes, as well as the statute\u2019s legislative history. Id., 340-47. It does not appear, therefore, that filing the visitation petition prior to the <em>Cas-tagno </em>decision, in and of itself, necessarily evidences that the defendants filed that petition \u201cknowingly pursuant to a statute which did not apply\u201d to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In addition to the mere fact of the petition itself, the plaintiffs point to several facts that they maintain establish that the defendants abused the legal process. First, the plaintiffs assert that Dimyan \u201cmade false representations to judicial authorities\u201d in his visitation petition. The plaintiffs assert further that Dimyan \u201cwent on to exploit his abuse of the process by peddling lies and smears [about the plaintiffs] to news media.\u201d Finally, the plaintiffs assert that Dimyan refused to accept mail from the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney during the pendency of the visitation suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>It does not necessarily follow from the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, however, that the defendants abused the legal process. Even if the jury believed the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, it reasonably could have concluded that the defendants, in bringing the visitation petition, legitimately sought to secure visitation rights for the Burtons.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The plaintiffs next assert that they presented sufficient evidence to prove their claim of invasion of privacy. Our Supreme Court has described the four types of invasion of privacy: \u201c(1) appropriation, for the defendant\u2019s benefit or advantage, of the plaintiff\u2019s name or likeness; (2) intrusion upon the plaintiffs physical solitude or seclusion; (3) publicity, of a highly objectionable kind, given to private information about the plaintiff even though it is true and no action would lie for defamation; and (4) publicity which places the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye.\u201d <em>Venturi </em>v. <em>Savitt, Inc., </em>191 Conn. 588, 591 n.1, 468 A.2d 933 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">While the plaintiffs\u2019 brief mentions three of the four types of invasion of privacy claims, their brief adequately addresses only one, i.e., that the jury could not have reasonably found that the plaintiffs failed to prove that they were placed in a false light by the defendants. The plaintiffs maintain that after bringing the visitation petition, the defendants publicized the suit and reported that the Burtons had not seen their grandchildren for more than a year and were simply seeking a chance to visit them before they \u201cpassed away.\u201d This is an apparent reference to an article that appeared in the <em>Danbury News-Times </em>on May 18, 1990. The plaintiffs claim that these statements placed them in a false light and that the defendants attempted to \u201ccreate the impression that the Honan family was mean and wicked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">To establish invasion of privacy by false light, the plaintiffs were required to show that \u201c \u2018(a) the false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>light in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) the actor had knowledge of or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.\u2019 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652E; see <em>Goodrich v. Waterbury Republican-American, Inc., </em>[188 Conn. 107, 127, 448 A.2d 1317 (1982)].\u201d <em>Jonap </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>1 Conn. App. 550, 557-58, 474 A.2d 800 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">At trial, the plaintiffs introduced evidence, through the testimony of one of the children, that the Burtons had, in fact, visited the Honan children during the year preceding the visitation petition. This evidence contradicts directly the statement purportedly made by the defendants that the Burtons had not seen their grandchildren for more than a year. The plaintiffs, however, have pointed to nothing in the record that supports a finding that the plaintiffs were portrayed in a manner that was highly offensive to an ordinary person, or that the defendants had knowledge of or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the statement made. Absent such evidence, we cannot say that the jury could not reasonably and legally have reached its conclusion that the plaintiffs had failed to prove their claim of invasion or privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The plaintiffs finally assert that they presented enough evidence to prove their claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. To prevail on a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, four elements must be established. \u201cIt must be shown: (1) that the actor intended to inflict emotional distress; or that he knew or should have known that emotional distress was a likely result of his conduct; (2) that the conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) that the defendant\u2019s conduct was the cause of the plaintiffs distress; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>(4) that the emotional distress sustained by the plaintiff was severe.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DeLaurentis </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>220 Conn. 225, 266-67, 597 A.2d 807 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In support of this final sufficiency claim, the plaintiffs state that in filing the visitation petition, which, according to the plaintiffs, was based on an inapplicable statute and \u201cpremised on a he,\u201d the defendants \u201ccould have had no purpose <em>other </em>than to create havoc in the lives of the plaintiffs and inflict emotional torture on them.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Aside from this conclu-sory statement, however, the plaintiffs have directed us to little evidence that would otherwise support the elements of a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Absent such evidence, we cannot say that the jury could not reasonably and legally have reached its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The plaintiffs next claim that the trial court improperly charged the jury on invasion of privacy by instructing the jury to find for the defendants if invasion of privacy occurred based on comments <em>related </em>to court proceedings, although made out of court. The plaintiffs rightly argue that statements made by attorneys in court generally would be privileged, while statements made outside of court might not be. See, e.g., <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Bitonti, </em>34 Conn. Sup. 643, 647, 382 A.2d 841 (1977) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>(absolute privilege that protects witnesses, parties and attorneys from liability for defamation occurring in conduct of judicial proceeding would apply also to infraction of right of privacy in course of such proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">An examination of the charge, however, discloses that the trial court properly instructed the jury and did not explain that statements made by the defendants \u201cout of court\u201d would be privileged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In reviewing this claim, we are mindful that \u201cthe test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Casazza, </em>204 Conn. 336, 351-52, 528 A.2d 774 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1006, 108 S. Ct. 699, 98 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1988). The jury charge, as a whole, was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that the trial court improperly denied their motion for a new trial, which they based on the purported misconduct of both the trial court judge and defense counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u201c \u2018It is [the judge\u2019s] responsibility to have the trial conducted in a manner which approaches an \u201catmosphere of perfect impartiality which is so much to be desired in a judicial proceeding.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Echols, </em>170 Conn. 11, 13, 364 A.2d 225 (1975), quoting <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 82, 62 S. Ct. 457, 86 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>680 (1942).\u201d Cameron, v. <em>Cameron, 187 </em>Conn. 163, 169, 444 A.2d 915 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In their appellate brief, the plaintiffs recite a hodgepodge of at least twelve specific instances of purported misconduct and procedural irregularity. These claims are largely unsupported by analysis or legal authority. In fact, while many of the specific instances cited occurred outside the presence of the jury, some occurred outside the courthouse itself. The plaintiffs claim that this conduct \u201cwas so prejudicial as to have deprived [them] of a fair trial.\u201d After an examination of the specific instances cited, however, we cannot say that the plaintiffs were denied a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-59 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Superior Court may grant the right of visitation with respect to any minor child or children to any person, upon an application of such person. Such order shall be according to the court\u2019s best judgment upon the facts of the case and subject to such conditions and limitations as it deems equitable, provided the grant of such visitation rights shall not be contingent upon any order of financial support by the court. In making, modifying or terminating such an order, the court shall be guided by the best interest of the child, giving consideration to the wishes of such child if he is of sufficient age and capable of forming an intelligent opinion. Visitation rights granted in accordance with this section shall not be deemed to have created parental rights in the person or persons to whom such visitation rights are granted. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\"> Although Nancy Burton was a party to the underlying visitation petition brought by the Burtons, she was not a party to the suit that gave rise to this appeal. As a member of the Connecticut bar, however, she acted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>both trial counsel and appellate counsel to the plaintiffs, her husband and three children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\"> The plaintiffs do cite testimony given at trial that appears to suggest that they were at least upset by the filing of the visitation petition. For example, one of the children testified that as a result of the suit, he had experienced emotional pain. Whether the jury determined that this pain did not rise to the level of \u201csevere\u201d emotional distress, or simply disbelieved that testimony, we cannot say. \u201cIt is without question that the jury is the ultimate arbiter of fact and credibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>217 Conn. 498, 506, 586 A.2d 610 (1991). As such, it may believe or disbelieve all or any portion of the testimony offered.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>221 Conn. 595, 604, 605 A.2d 1366 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> The trial court charged the jury as follows: \u201cIf you find the substance of any communication was related to the grandparents\u2019 petition for visitation which was a pending court action at the time of the communication, then you must find for the defendant <em>because of any such communications falten from the court proceedings and not outside the court, </em>because they are privileged communications that cannot subject... a defendant to liability. So, those would be any communications <em>within the\u2014the courthouse, </em>so to speak.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
