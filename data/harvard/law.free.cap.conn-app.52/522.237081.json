The dispositive issue on appeal arises from the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for recu-sal. We must decide whether, under the circumstances of this case, the trial judge\u2019s continuing to preside at the hearing created an appearance of impropriety, which required his recusal. We conclude that it did. Because our resolution of this issue is dispositive, it is unnecessary to consider the other issues raised on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The following facts and procedural posture are necessary for the resolution of this appeal. On September 6, 1996, at a contempt hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>counsel, Joseph Chiarelli, testified that he had an agreement with plaintiffs counsel some years prior to the contempt proceeding regarding the suspension of alimony payments, which were the subject of the contempt hearing. The hearing was continued and the trial court heard additional testimony on October 17, 1996, and again on October 21, 1996. The plaintiffs former counsel, Louis Parley, testified at the October 21, 1996 hearing that he could not recall whether he had an agreement with Chiarelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Following the September 6, 1996 hearing, the trial court, <em>Skolnick, J., </em>and Chiarelli were involved in an unrelated matter. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. 387386 (September 10, 1996). In <em>Gordon, </em>the trial court granted Chiarelli\u2019s motion for recusal, stating, \u201cI\u2019m going to recuse myself from all of your matters . . . [bjecause I do not approve of the way you handle yourself.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the present case, on October 17, 1996, the defendant filed a motion for recusal of the trial judge, arguing that on the basis of the exchange between Chiarelli and the trial judge in <em>Gordon, </em>the judge was biased. The trial court denied the motion on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found the defendant in contempt and found that an arrearage existed toward which the defendant should pay an additional sum each week. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">This action is not the first instance in which this trial judge and this attorney have been the principal players. See <em>Consiglio </em>v. <em>Consiglio, </em>48 Conn. App. 654, 711 A.2d 765 (1998), and <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. 387386. In both prior instances, however, Chiarelli appeared before the trial court as an attorney; in this instance, he appeared as a witness. The defendant claims that the prior conversations between the trial judge and Chiarelli and Chiarelli\u2019s role as the defendant\u2019s chief witness in this action constitute a strong appearance of conflict of interest and partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The plaintiff responds that the only evidence of unfairness to which the defendant can point occurred in an unrelated matter in which Chiarelli acted as an attorney and not as a witness. Furthermore, the prior recusal was based on Chiarelli\u2019s actions as an attorney, not on his credibility. The plaintiff also asserts that even if the trial judge was biased against Chiarelli, the finding of contempt does not constitute reversible error because no legal authority exists to support a defense in a contempt proceeding that alleges that the action is excused or justified because an attorney instructed his client to violate a court order. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">\u201cNo more elementary statement concerning the judiciary can be made than that the conduct of the trial judge must be characterized by the highest degree of impartiality. If he departs from this standard, he casts serious reflection upon the system of which he is a part. A judge is not an umpire in a forensic encounter. . . . He is a minister of justice. . . . He may, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>take all reasonable steps necessary for the orderly progress of the trial. ... In whatever he does, however, the trial judge should be cautious and circumspect in his language and conduct. A judge should be scrupulous to refrain from hearing matters which he feels he cannot approach in the utmost spirit of fairness and to avoid the appearance of prejudice as regards either the parties or the issues before him. . . . <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>187 Conn. 163, 168-69, 444 A.2d 915 (1982). Moreover, disqualification of a trial judge is not dependent upon proof of actual bias. The appearance and the existence of impartiality are both essential elements of a fair trial. Id. Canon 3 (c) (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge to disqualify himself in any proceeding in which judicial impartiality might reasonably be doubted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Any conduct that would lead a reasonable [person] knowing all the circumstances to the conclusion that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned is a basis for the judge\u2019s disqualification. . . . <em>Postemski </em>v. <em>Landon, </em>9 Conn. App. 320, 322, 518 A.2d 674 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u201cIt is [the judge\u2019s] responsibility to have the trial conducted in a manner which approaches an atmosphere of perfect impartiality which is so much to be desired in a judicial proceeding. <em>State v. Echols, </em>170 Conn. 11, 13, 364 A.2d 225 (1975), quoting <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 82, 62 S. Ct. 457, 86 L. Ed. 680 (1942). . . . <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>supra, 187 Conn. 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">\u201c[E]very litigant is entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge. It is the duty of [c]ourts to scrupulously guard this right and to refrain from attempting to exercise jurisdiction in any matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>where his qualification to do so is seriously brought in question. The exercise of any other policy tends to discredit the judiciary and shadow the administration ofjusti.ee. It is not enough for a judge to assert that he is free from prejudice. His mien and the reflex from his court room speak louder than he can declaim on this point. If he fails through these avenues to reflect justice and square dealing, his usefulness is destroyed. The attitude of the judge and the atmosphere of the court room should indeed be such that no matter what charge is lodged against a litigant or what cause he is called on to litigate, he can approach the bar with every assurance that he is in a forum where the judicial ermine is everything that it typifies \u2014 purity and justice. The guaranty of a fair and impartial trial can mean nothing less than this. <em>Hayslip </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>400 So. 2d 553, 557 (Fla. App. 1981), quoting <em>State ex rel. Davis </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>141 Fla. 516, 519-20, 194 So. 613 (1939).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Consiglio </em>v. <em>Consiglio, </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 659-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Furthermore, \u201can inquiry into disqualification of a judge requires a sensitive evaluation of all the facts and circumstances in order to determine whether a failure to disqualify the judge was an abuse of sound judicial discretion.\u201d <em>Abington Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Heublein, </em>246 Conn. 815, 823, 717 A.2d 1232 (1998). \u201cAccordingly, our review ordinarily is limited to the question of whether a trial judge has abused his discretion.\u201d Id., 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The plaintiff first asserts that the prior recusal of the trial judge involved Chiarefli\u2019s status as an attorney and that in this action he was a witness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>circumstances, this is a distinction without a difference. \u201cOnce [a judge] declares that he believes a party or a witness has been deceitful ... he cannot continue to preside in his role of impartial arbiter.\u201d <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>supra, 187 Conn. 170. While the trial judge, in prior proceedings, did not characterize Chiarelli as \u201cdeceitful,\u201d he did state, \u201cI do not approve of the way you handle yourself\u2019 and recused himself from <em>all matters involving </em>Chiarelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The plaintiff also maintains that Chiarelli\u2019s testimony was not material and that his credibility, therefore, was not really at issue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u201cIn order to constitute contempt, a party\u2019s conduct must be wilful. <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>191 Conn. 468, 483, 464 A.2d 837 (1983). The contempt remedy is particularly harsh . . . and may be founded solely upon some clear and express direction of the court. . . . <em>Blaydes </em>v. <em>Blaydes, </em>187 Conn. 464, 467, 446 A.2d 825 (1982). A good faith dispute or legitimate misunderstanding of the terms of an alimony or support obligation may prevent a finding that the payor\u2019s nonpayment was wilful. This does not mean, however, that such a dispute or misunderstanding will preclude a finding of wilfulness as a predicate to a judgment of contempt. Whether it will preclude such a finding is ultimately within the trial court\u2019s discretion. It is within the sound discretion of the court to deny a claim for contempt when there is an adequate factual basis to explain the failure to honor the court\u2019s order. <em>Marcil </em>v. <em>Marcil, 4 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Conn. App. 403, 405, 494 A.2d 620 (1985).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>244 Conn. 523, 529, 710 A.2d 757 (1998). The contempt remedy is particularly drastic. \u201cIn the summer of 1631 at the Salisbury assizes, a prisoner aggravated at his sentence \u2018ject un Brickbat a le dit Justice que narrowly mist . . . .\u2019 An indictment was immediately drawn and \u2018son dexter manus ampute &amp; fix al Gibbet sur que luy mesme immediatement hange in presence de Court.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While a misunderstanding or good faith dispute regarding the failure to honor a court order is ultimately within the trial court\u2019s discretion; <em>Marcil </em>v. <em>Marcil, </em>supra, 405; the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion must be surrounded by a pureness and chastity untainted by the appearance of partiality.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Undertaking the necessary review, we must decide whether the circumstances in this case would have led an objective observer reasonably to question the trial judge\u2019s impartiality. Following the September 6, 1996 hearing, the contempt proceeding was continued until October 17, 1996. Thereafter, on September 10, 1996, the trial judge in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. 387386, recused himself from all of Chiarelli\u2019s matters. Approximately one month later, the defendant in the present case filed a motion for recusal on the basis of the conversation between the trial judge and Chiarelli in <em>Gordon. </em>The trial court denied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>motion. Those actions can hardly be said to preclude the defendant\u2019s questioning of the trial judge\u2019s impartiality, as he is now aware of prior instances that he believes indicate that the trial judge dislikes his chief witness, Chiarelli. Rather, actions such as these \u201cinevitably [raise] in the minds of litigants ... a suspicion as to the fairness of the court\u2019s administration of justice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>supra, 187 Conn. 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">On the basis of the record before us, we are persuaded that a reasonable person knowing all of the circumstances might be apprehensive and concerned on learning that the trial judge, who must fashion a discretionary decision, has had critical and adverse feelings concerning a significant witness and had recused himself as a result of his experience with the individual in a prior proceeding. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial judge improperly exercised his discretion when he failed to grant the motion for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-11\"> The defendant also claims on appeal that the trial court improperly (1) sustained an objection to a question posed to the defendant\u2019s former attorney and chief defense witness, Joseph Chiarelli, regarding whether Chiarelli instructed the defendant not to comply with the alimony order, (2) found that there was sufficient evidence to support its finding of wilful contempt and (3) exercised its discretion in ordering the defendant to resume payments and to increase his alimony obligations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\"> At oral argument before this court, the plaintiff asserted that she originally filed an application for a rule to show cause primarily seeking a determination as to whether in fact there was an arrearage in this case. The plaintiff also argued that the contempt issue was almost immaterial but conceded that the issue was before the trial court. The defendant filed an objection to what he described as the plaintiffs motion for contempt. The trial court, in its memorandum of decision, refers to the plaintiffs motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>for contempt and rule to show cause. Because the parties treated the application as a motion for contempt, and neither party objected to the trial court\u2019s treating it as a motion for contempt, we will do likewise. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>38 Conn. App. 360, 363-64, 660 A.2d 871 (1995), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 236 Conn. 845, 675 A.2d 835 (1996), citing <em>Crozier </em>v. <em>Zaboori, </em>14 Conn. App. 457, 463, 541 A.2d 531 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\"> The following colloquy occurred during the trial in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. 387386:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Okay, Judge, as I\u2019m sitting here it occurs to me that I should make a motion to disqualify you in the hearing of any case that I\u2019m involved in. You are\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">\u201cThe Court: Well, if it occurs to you, are you making that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Well, I\u2019d like to address to you\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">\u201cThe Court: Are you making that motion?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: I\u2019m making that motion now, Judge. And the reason is that we had very hard feelings against one another in my recollection while you were practicing law. And I thought that when you got on the bench that your attitude toward me changed. But, now I\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Chiarelli, from my own\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Can I finish, Judge?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">\u201cThe Court: Yes. [For my] own curiosity, would you refer to when that was because you and I didn\u2019t practice the same type of law and unless you were defending malpractice cases I can\u2019t imagine ever having a case with you\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u201c[Chiarelli]: No, no, no, no, that isn\u2019t how.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u201cThe Court: Oh.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: It was our reaction to one another when we saw one another. And you were associated with Miss Daskal Rubin. Am I correct, Judge?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Yes. Okay. And I think because of the way you have been so critical of me for nothing here. This woman has come here and complained about nothing. You picked up on it right away. And you started letting me have it for what I think is no cause. So, I think that these hard feelings that you have against me for when I practiced law and when you practiced law at the same time have carried over to while you\u2019re a judge\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Chiarelli\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">\u201cThe Court: Did you and I ever have a matter together in all the years that I practiced?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: I can\u2019t think of one off the top of my head, Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">\u201cThe Court.: And the reason you can\u2019t is I don\u2019t think we ever did.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Yes. But, you have a dislike for me and I had a dislike for you. But, I got over my dislike for you. It\u2019s obvious to me that you didn\u2019t get over your dislike for me, making these comments to me. Being critical of what I said to this woman on a telephone answering machine\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">\u201cThe Court: Mr.\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: It seems that you seize on every opportunity to insult me. And I don\u2019t like it and I don\u2019t want to practice law\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">\u201cThe Court: And I don\u2019t want you raising your voice in my courtroom, Mr. Chiarelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry if I raised my voice. I apologize to you, Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-19\">\u201cThe Court: Because in one second I\u2019m going to tell the sheriff to escort you right through that door.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-20\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Okay\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b547-21\">\u201cThe Court,: Now, sit down.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-22\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Sure, Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-23\">\u201cThe Court: And I will tell you that the only thing that is keeping me from doing exactly what you said was that I have some feeling for my brethren.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-24\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Yes, thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-25\">\u201cThe Court: But, I\u2019m going to grant your request.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-26\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Thank you, Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-27\">\u201cThe Court: And I\u2019m going to recuse myself from all of your matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-28\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Okay, thank you very much, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-29\">\u201cThe Court: Because I do not approve of the way you handle yourself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\"> Canon 3 (c) (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides in relevant part: \u201cA judge should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where: (A) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\"> The only authority on which the defendant relies in support of this argument is <em>Perlmutter </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>6 Conn. App. 292, 295, 505 A.2d 13, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 801, 509 A.2d 517 (1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1035, 107 S. Ct. 886, 93 L. Ed. 2d 839 (1987). The defendant\u2019s reliance on that case, however, is misplaced. In <em>Perlmutter, </em>the court noted that the prior appearance of a party before a trial judge does not, in itself, reflect on the judge\u2019s impartiality in a subsequent action involving that party. The defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>this action, however, does not claim that the fact that Chiarelli appeared before Judge Skolnick in prior cases mandates his disqualification in this case. Rather, the defendant claims that based on what transpired in the prior cases involving Chiarelli, he reasonably could believe that he was unable to receive a fair hearing before this trial judge. See, e.g., <em>Consiglio </em>v. <em>Consiglio, </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 660-61 (on the basis of discussion regarding trial judge\u2019s recusal on all matters involving Chiarelli, plaintiff reasonably could have believed that he would be unable to receive fair trial before trial judge).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\"> D.
