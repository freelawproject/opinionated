We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The commissioner held a hearing on July 25,1995, and found the following facts. The plaintiff was, at all relevant times, an employee of the defendant, Mystic Seaport Museum, Inc. (Mystic).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 2, 1991, the plaintiff was working as an engineer aboard the steamboat Sabino. On that day, the plaintiff was reassembling a valve that had been taken apart. To get a better grip on the valve assembly, he changed his position and then fell approximately four and one-half feet to the deck plating. As he fell, he hit his left elbow on a pipe, shoving his left arm behind his head and dislocating his shoulder. After he landed, the plaintiff reduced the dislocation himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">After the accident, the plaintiff submitted an employee incident report and continued working the rest of his shift. The plaintiff did not seek medical treatment or miss any time from work because of the injury. Mystic completed an employer\u2019s first report of occupational injury or disease on May 8, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The plaintiffs typical workday included ten to twelve hour shifts during which he was responsible for the regular maintenance of the Sabino and stoking the ship\u2019s coal burning boiler. Additionally, he spent approximately one half of his workday turning valves, including some above his head, requiring full extension of his arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The plaintiff had suffered between twenty to thirty partial and full dislocations of his left shoulder between the time of the accident and October, 1994, some of which happened while he was working. The plaintiff first notified his supervisor, Dick Lotz, and the director of human resources, Mark Duland, in September, 1993, that he was having trouble with his shoulder. The plaintiff informed Duland of the May, 1991 fall and Duland told him to see a physician and to submit the bills to Mystic. The plaintiff saw his personal physician, Job Sandoval, on September 24, 1993. Sandoval prescribed strengthening exercises for the plaintiff. In November, 1993, the plaintiff informed Duland that he was not improving and returned to Sandoval, who referred him to an orthopedic surgeon, J. A. Hallberg. On April 19, 1994, Hallberg suggested that the plaintiff undergo corrective shoulder surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The plaintiff first informed Mystic that he wanted to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim for the May, 1991 fall in October, 1994. The plaintiff decided to have the corrective surgery on October 24, 1994. His last day at work prior to the surgery was October 21, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The plaintiff filed a notice of claim, and the commissioner held a hearing on July 25, 1995. The commissioner denied his motion to preclude and determined that the plaintiff did not suffer a compensable injury. The plaintiff then appealed from the commissioner\u2019s decision to the board. The board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision in an opinion dated October 24, 1997. The plaintiff appeals from that decision. Additional facts will be set forth as they become necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">The plaintiff claims first that his motion to preclude the defendant from contesting his claim was improperly denied. The plaintiff claims that (1) the commissioner improperly concluded that his notice of claim failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>comply substantially with the notice requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in that the notice did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>not state <em>any </em>date of injury and (2) the defendant\u2019s notice contesting compensability was insufficient because it (a) failed to list the correct date of injury and (b) failed to state substantially the specific grounds on which the defendant was denying compensability. We disagree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We begin by addressing the appropriate standard of review. The board \u201c \u2018hear[s] the appeal on the record of the hearing before the commissioner\u2019 unless it determines, under the statute, to take \u2018additional evidence or testimony.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (a).\u201d <em>Castro v. Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 440, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988). \u201cThe decision of the compensation review [board] must stand unless it results from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The plaintiff filed a notice of claim for a repetitive trauma injury occurring \u201cprior to [September 23,1994].\u201d The notice was received by the defendant on December 2, 1994. The notice of claim states: \u201cNotice is hereby given that the undersigned [the plaintiff], who while in the employ of Mystic Seaport Museum at Mystic prior to [September 23, 1994], sustained injuries arising out of and in the course of his/her employment as follows: \u2018Repetitive trauma to left (non-master) shoulder while working as an engineer.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Section 31-294c sets forth the prerequisites for succeeding on a motion to preclude. For an injured employee to succeed on a motion to preclude, the employee must file a notice of claim within one year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>from the date of the injury. General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a). The employer also must file a notice contesting compensability within twenty-eight days after it receives the notice of claim from the employee. General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The purpose of the preclusion statute was thoroughly discussed by our Supreme Court in <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>165 Conn. 338, 334 A.2d 452 (1973). The Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe object which the legislature sought to accomplish is plain. Section 31-297 (b) [the predecessor to \u00a7 31-294c] was amended to ensure (1) that employers would bear the burden of investigating a claim promptly and (2) that employees would be timely apprised of the specific reasons for the denial of their claim. These effects would, in turn, diminish delays in the proceedings, discourage arbitrary refusal of bona fide claims and narrow the legal issues which were to be contested. To narrow the scope of the controversy would lighten the burden on the claimant in terms of legal expenses, a result which the legislature plainly desired to accomplish by its 1967 amendments. See 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1967 Sess., pp. 4037-38 . . . .\u201d <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>supra, 343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The criteria of \u00a7 31-294c need not be perfectly met for a claimant\u2019s notice of claim to be sufficient. <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>State, </em>228 Conn. 535, 542-43 n.8, 637 A.2d 392 (1994). Minor defects will be overlooked as long as the employer will not be unduly prejudiced. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In the present case, the plaintiff filed his notice of claim listing the date of injury as \u201cprior to [September 23, 1994].\u201d This date, however, is not the proper date of injury for the purposes of \u00a7 31-294c (a). The review board has consistently taken the position that, as a matter of law, the date of injury of a repetitive trauma is the last day of exposure\u2014most commonly the last date of employment; see <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Clinton Public </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>Schools, </em>03446 CRB-03-96-10 (March 5, 1998); <em>Carvalko </em>v. <em>Bassick Co., </em>9 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 258 (1991); <em>Dorsett </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>8 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 77, aff'd, 23 Conn. App. 827, 584 A.2d 484 (1990), cert. denied, 218 Conn. 901, 588 A.2d 1076 (1991); our courts have endorsed this position. See <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>242 Conn. 570, 581, 698 A.2d 873 (1997); <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 354, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993); <em>Borent </em>v. <em>State, </em>33 Conn. App. 495, 499, 636 A.2d 392 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In the present case, the plaintiffs last day at work was October 21, 1994, the Friday before his shoulder surgery. As a matter of law, October 21, 1994, was the date of the plaintiffs injury because that was the last day of exposure. September 23,1994, has no legal significance. Although the plaintiff claims that September 23, 1994, was a proper date because it encompassed all injuries that he sustained as of that date, we disagree. The case law is clear on when the legal date of injury occurs. Additionally, \u00a7 31-294c (a) requires that the claimant file a notice of claim within one year of <em>uthe date of the </em>accident.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The plaintiff claims that listing October 21, 1994, as the date of injury would not have provided the defendants with any additional information with which to investigate the plaintiffs claim. If we were to hold that listing a date nearly one month prior to the date of injury was sufficient notice, numerous problems would result. Future employers would be faced with the situation in which an employee who was suffering from a repetitive trauma injury could file a claim with a date prior to his date of injury, then suffer additional repetitive injuries. The employer would not be able to investigate the employee\u2019s claim fully and accordingly would be unable to state sufficiently any reasons for denying compensability for any additional injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>While this court held in <em>Chase </em>v. <em>State, </em>45 Conn. App. 499, 506, 696 A.2d 1299 (1997), that a notice of claim using the language \u201con or before July 19, 1989,\u201d did not invalidate that notice, we did state that \u201c[i]f the results of the defendant\u2019s investigation did not reveal an accidental injuiy on the precise date given in the notice, or in the <em>several days </em>prior thereto, the defendant reasonably could have disclaimed liability . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Clearly, one month exceeds the several days in which we held that an employer reasonably could discover an employee\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The plaintiff cites <em>Borent </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 495, for the proposition that listing the last day of exposure as the date of injury in a repetitive trauma injury does not give the employer any additional information with which to investigate the employee\u2019s claim. His reliance on <em>Borent </em>is misplaced. <em>Borent </em>involved the issue of whether the claimant\u2019s notice of claim was timely. In <em>Borent, </em>we merely affirmed the board\u2019s decision reversing the trial commissioner\u2019s finding of a date of injury. Id., 500. While <em>Borent </em>did list a date of injuiy in a repetitive trauma case different from the last day of exposure, neither this court nor the board discussed the possibility that an employer would be unable to investigate the claim properly because of an incorrect date of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u201c \u2018We accord great deference to the construction given to [\u00a7 31-294c] by the commissioner and the [board] because they are both charged with its enforcement. <em>Police Department </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>225 Conn. 297, 300, 622 A.2d 1005 (1993); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>217 Conn. 110, 119-20, 584 A.2d 1172 (1991).\u2019 <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>[supra, 227 Conn. 354].\u201d <em>Borent </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 499. The board has previously construed small deviations in date of injury as de minimis errors and, therefore, in compliance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u00a7 31-294c, or its predecessor. See <em>Bonin </em>v. <em>Thames Valley Steel, </em>1492 CRB-2-92-8 (February 14, 1997) (stated date of injury five days after employment ended sufficient to sustain motion to preclude); <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Standard Knapp, </em>12 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 334, 335 (1994), appeal dismissed, 40 Conn. App. 446, 671 A.2d 1333 (1996) (listing date only one day after last day worked as de minimis); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Dow Corning STI, Inc., </em>13 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 109, 110 (1995) (five day discrepancy within range of de minimis error); but see <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>New Haven Register, </em>14 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 263, 265 (1995) (injury date two months prior to last day of trauma insufficient to support motion to preclude).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The commissioner found that the plaintiffs use of prior to September 23, 1994 was \u201cnot de minimis but is essentially no date at all.\u201d Although we do not agree that the date chosen by the plaintiff in his notice of claim is no date at all, given the board\u2019s prior decisions on this issue and the great deference we give to the board and the commissioner, we agree that the plaintiffs stated date of injury was statutorily insufficient to support a motion to preclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">We recognize that the mandate in <em>Pereira </em>requires a liberal interpretation of \u00a7 31-294c to ensure that it accomplishes its humanitarian purpose. We do not think, however, that <em>Pereira </em>encompasses a situation where the claimant\u2019s error is more than de minimis. The commissioner properly found that the date in the plaintiffs notice of claim constitutes more than a de minimis error, and the board properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision denying the plaintiffs motion to preclude. Accordingly, the plaintiffs notice of claim is insufficient to support a motion to preclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The plaintiff asks us to review the sufficiency of the defendants\u2019 notice contesting compensability. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>claims that the defendants\u2019 notice is deficient because it (1) does not state correctly the date of injury and (2) does not state the defendants\u2019 reasons for denying compensability with the specificity required by \u00a7 31-294c (b). Because we conclude that the plaintiffs notice of claim is insufficient to support a motion to preclude, we need not reach the issue of whether the defendants\u2019 notice contesting compensability was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the board improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision holding that the plaintiff did not sustain a repetitive trauma injury. We disagree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">This court adopted the board\u2019s description of repetitive trauma injuries in <em>Quinn v. Standard Knapp, </em>supra, 12 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 334, in <em>Chase </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 506. \u201cA repetitive trauma, by definition, necessarily occurs over a period of time.\u201d Id. Nonetheless, \u201c[i]t is well settled in workers\u2019 compensation cases that the injured employee bears the burden of proof. . . . <em>Murchison </em>v. <em>Skinner Precision Industries, Inc., </em>162 Conn. 142, 151, 291 A.2d 743 (1972). Further \u2018[t]he power and duty of determining the facts rests on the commissioner, the trier of facts. . . . The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u2019 . . . <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>207 Conn. 535, 539, 542 A.2d 1118 (1988); <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Laidlaw Transit, Inc., </em>45 Conn. App. 204, 206, 695 A.2d 1071 (1997).\u201d <em>Keenan </em>v. <em>Union Camp Corp., </em>49 Conn. App. 280, 282-83, 714 A.2d 60 (1998). Furthermore, whether an employee has suffered a repetitive trauma injury or an accidental injury is a question of fact to be determined by the commissioner. <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Echlin, Inc., </em>14 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 191, 193 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>The plaintiff testified that his shoulder dislocations occurred in a wide variety of situations, from carrying heavy pipes at work to turning off the alarm clock. The plaintiff presented no medical witnesses on his behalf. The only medical evidence was a report by Hallberg that stated, \u201cI think there is little question but that the <em>initial injury </em>was a work related event\u201d (emphasis added) and a letter from Hallberg to the plaintiffs attorney stating, \u201cThe fact that [Russell] lived with this condition for [three] years and suffered some [twenty to thirty] dislocations probably has produced some wear and tear on the shoulder. <em>There is no way to quantify this at this point, </em>but he certainly would be at risk of developing shoulder problems in the future . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">On the basis of the report and letter from Hallberg, the commissioner found that (1) the plaintiff sustained a specific injury to his left shoulder on May 2, 1991, (2) the plaintiffs shoulder injury was not a result of repetitive trauma and (3) the plaintiffs dislocations subsequent to the May 2, 1991 fall were a recurrence of the May 2, 1991 specific injury. The board determined that the commissioner reasonably could have found that the \u201cthe subsequent dislocations were merely flareups of a condition caused by the initial May 2, 1991 injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u201cThe [commissioner] must necessarily draw an inference from what he has found to be the basic facts. The propriety of that inference, of course, is vital to the validity of the order subsequently entered. But the scope of judicial review of that inference is <em>sharply limited </em>by the foregoing statutory provisions. If supported by evidence and not inconsistent with the law, the [commissioner\u2019s] inference ... is conclusive. <em>No reviewing court can then set aside that inference because the opposite one is thought to be more reasonable; nor can the opposite inference be substituted by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>the court because of a belief that the one chosen by the [commissioner] is factually questionable.\" </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 539-40. \u201cEven if such an inference be considered more legal than factual in nature, the reviewing court\u2019s function is exhausted when it becomes evident that the [commissioner\u2019s] choice has substantial roots in the evidence and is not forbidden by the law.\u201d Id., 540-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The commissioner had before her a medical report and opinion and the testimony of the plaintiff from which she could properly determine whether Russell\u2019s subsequent dislocations were the result of repetitive trauma or a result of the initial May 2,1991 dislocation. The board could not go back and make different inferences from the facts presented to the commissioner and neither can we. We conclude that the board properly determined that the commissioner\u2019s findings were reasonable, supported by the evidence and not contrary to law. The board properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The plaintiff claims finally that the incident report that he filed with Mystic on May 2, 1991, when considered with the other circumstances surrounding his claim, satisfies the notice of claim requirements of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-294 (repealed by Public Acts 1991, No. 91-32, \u00a7 40).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">We note again that the technical requirements of the notice statute need not be perfectly met to satisfy the intent of the statute. See <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 542-43 n.8. There must, however, be substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>compliance to satisfy the notice requirement. \u201cThe legislature designed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to further a remedial purpose. <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>General Dynamics </em>Corporation, 222 Conn. 62, 67, 607 A.2d 431 (1992). The act\u2019s provisions, therefore, should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose. . . . <em>Hansen v. Gordon, </em>221 Conn. 29, 33, 602 A.2d 560 (1992). The purpose of \u00a7 31-294, in particular, is to alert the employer to the fact that a person has sustained an injury that may be compensable; <em>Gesmundo </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>133 Conn. 607, 612, 53 A.2d 392 (1947) ... and that such person is claiming <em>or proposes to claim </em>compensation under the Act. . . . <em>Rehtarchik </em>v. <em>Hoyt-Messinger Corporation, </em>118 Conn. 315, 317, 172 A. 353 (1934) . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Black </em>v. <em>London &amp; Egazarian Associates, Inc., </em>30 Conn. App. 295, 302-303, 620 A.2d 176, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 916, 623 A.2d 1024 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">We recently held in <em>Funaioli </em>v. <em>New London, </em>52 Conn. App. 194, 726 A.2d 626 (1999), in which we reversed the board, that an employee\u2019s first report of injury coupled with an attorney\u2019s letter to the commission met the statutory requirements for a notice of claim. The plaintiff, in both his brief and at oral argument, claimed that <em>Funaioli </em>applied to his case. We conclude that <em>Funaioli </em>is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Funaioli, </em>we concluded that the board properly determined that an employer\u2019s first report of injury alone would not meet the notice requirements of \u00a7 31-294c. <em>Funaioli </em>rested on the factual issues in that case. We do not expand the holding in that case to state that all first reports of injury satisfy the notice of claim requirements in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff did nothing more than file an employee incident form stating that he had injured his shoulder on May 21,1991. He took no further action for over two years when he told his employer that he was having problems with his shoulder. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>at this point, the plaintiff did not inform Mystic that he was considering filing for workers\u2019 compensation benefits as a result of his fall. The plaintiff did not tell Mystic that he was considering filing for benefits until nearly three and one-half years after the initial accident, well after the one year limitation period had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The plaintiff further claims that \u201cthe employer clearly construed the report as a notice of claim for compensation since the employer immediately filed an employer\u2019s first report of occupational injury or disease with the workers\u2019 compensation commission in compliance with \u00a7 31-294 (b), which it is required to do when it receives a notice of claim. The filing of the form by the employer confirms both knowledge of the injury and an expectation that compensation would be claimed.\u201d We find no merit in the plaintiffs argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-294 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cWithin one week after receipt by an employer of such notice of claim for compensation, he shall report the substantial facts of such notice to the commissioner. . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-316<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requires employers to forward a report of injury to the commissioner when any employee is injured and misses a day or more of work. While the plaintiff argues that Mystic\u2019s filing of the first report of injury with the commissioner constitutes acknowledgement of the plaintiffs \u201cnotice of claim,\u201d there is no evidence to support the contention that the employer was taking such action for that purpose. The fact that Duland told the plaintiff, over two years after the initial accident, to submit the medical bills for his visits to Sandoval does not indicate that Mystic accepted the plaintiffs incident report as a notice of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The board, in affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision, properly applied the law to the facts, and we adopt the following portion of that opinion as our own. \u201c[A] first report of injury does not inform its recipient that a workers\u2019 compensation claim is or will be filed, and will not be construed otherwise <em>absent very unusual circumstances. </em>See e.g. <em>Hayden-Leblanc </em>v. <em>New London Broadcasting, </em>12 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 3, 5 (1994) (trier found sufficient notice where insurer denied workers\u2019 compensation coverage and employer incorrectly told claimant that she was too late to file claim). That is the purpose of a form 30C notice of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u201cThere is no indication in this case that [Mystic] had any idea that [Russell] intended to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim from either his own incident report or the injury report filed by the employer. All those documents do is report that an injury occurred. In hindsight, it appears that the lack of intent to file a claim was borne out by [the plaintiffs] inaction for over two years after the May, 1991 shoulder injury. Now that the statute of limitations to file a claim has lapsed, we cannot go back and say that those reports of injury demonstrated anything more than compliance with a procedure designed to ensure compliance with \u00a7 31-316. . . . [T]he fact that the [plaintiff] reported his injuries to his employer is not by itself enough to constitute substantial compliance with \u00a7 31-294.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs filing of the incident report and the defendants\u2019 subsequent filing of the first report of injury do not rise to the level of a filing of a statutory notice of claim, which we concluded did exist in <em>Funaioli </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Furthermore, the plaintiff admitted that his incident report did not state that he or any other person was claiming compensation benefits. Section 31-294c (a) states that a notice of claim must contain \u201cthe name and address of the employee and of the person in whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>interest compensation is claimed.\u201d Without such a notice, we fail to see how the plaintiffs incident report rose to the level of a notice of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The decision of the compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In this opinion LANDAU, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\"> Mystic\u2019s compensation insurance carrier, ITT Hartford, is also a defendant in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No proceedings for compensation under the provisions of this chapter shall be maintained unless a written notice of claim for compensation is given within one year from the date of the accident or within three years from the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease ....

As used in this section, \u2018manifestation of a symptom\u2019 means manifestation to an employee claiming compensation, or to some other person standing in such relation to him that the knowledge of the person would be imputed to him, in a manner that is or should be recognized by him as symptomatic of the occupational disease for which compensation is claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u201c(b) Whenever liability to pay compensation is contested by the employer, he shall file with the commissioner, on or before the twenty-eighth day after he has received a written notice of claim, a notice in accord with a form prescribed by the chairman of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission stating that the right to compensation is contested, the name of the claimant, the name of the employer, the date of the alleged injury or death and the specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested.

I respectfully dissent. The primary issue in this appeal is whether the plaintiffs notice of claim for workers\u2019 compensation complied with General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a). That notice, dated November 30, 1994, sought compensation for \u201crepetitive trauma to left (non-master) shoulder while working as an engineer,\u201d and stated that the date of injury was \u201cprior to 9/23/94.\u201d The purpose of such a notice is to allow an employer to investigate a worker\u2019s claim for compensation promptly to avoid unnecessary delay in an adjudication of a worker\u2019s claim. Whether a particular notice of claim is sufficient to allow such a timely investigation is a question of law. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>State, </em>45 Conn. App. 499, 508, 696 A.2d 1299 (1997). I conclude that the notice was sufficient for that purpose and would therefore hold that the commissioner should not have denied the plaintiffs motion to preclude, and that the board should not have affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The plaintiff, in his notice of claim, does not assert a claim for compensation for the accidental injury that occurred on May 2, 1991. He claims instead compensation for a repetitive trauma, for which no precise date is possible. See <em>Chase </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 507. In this case, despite the plaintiffs claim for compensation for a repetitive trauma, the defendant has consistently treated the plaintiffs notice of claim as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>one for an accidental injury occurring on a specific date for both the purpose of testing the timeliness of the notice and testing its sufficiency to allow a timely investigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The \u201ctype of injury alleged in the notice of claim\u201d of an employee is considered \u201caccurate for the purpose of reviewing the timeliness\u201d of a plaintiff s claim. <em>Borent </em>v. <em>State, </em>33 Conn. App. 495, 499, 636 A.2d 392 (1994). Because the plaintiffs claim is one for repetitive trauma, it should have been filed within one year of the last date of exposure to the act or trauma, which is usually, but not always, the date on which the claimant last worked. <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>242 Conn. 570, 581, 698 A.2d 873 (1997); <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 353-54, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993). The plaintiffs claim for compensation for repetitive trauma met the statute of limitations prescribed by \u00a7 31-294c (a) because it was filed within one year of the last date of exposure to the trauma.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The next question to decide is whether the words, \u201cprior to 9/23/94,\u201d gave sufficient information to the employer to investigate the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The commissioner found that \u201c[subsequent to May 2, 1991, and until the fall of 1994 the plaintiff experienced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>numerous total and/or partial dislocations of his left shoulder. These dislocations occurred at work when the claimant was carrying lumber or heavy pipes on his shoulder or when he was manipulating steam valves,\u201d and that he \u201csuffered a partial dislocation in July, 1994, while turning a valve during a test of the steam generator at work,\u201d and that the plaintiffs \u201clast full dislocation at work occurred in August, 1994, while manipulating the main steam valve.\u201d The commissioner also found that the plaintiff had filed an employee incident report immediately following his May 2, 1991 fall, and that he had made his employer\u2019s director of human resources and his immediate supervisor aware of problems with his shoulder in September, 1993. On the basis of these facts, the commissioner, nevertheless, found that all of the left shoulder dislocations were a \u201crecurrence of the May 2, 1991 specific injury,\u201d rather than a result of repetitive trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The words, \u201cprior to 9/23/94,\u201d gave the employer notice that the repetitive trauma injury occurred over time, prior to September 23,1994, and after May 2,1991. The nature of a repetitive trauma injury is such that it is often impossible to ascertain a specific date of injury. Such an injury consists of repetitive trauma that begins with an initial trauma and is ongoing until the last instance of trauma. <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 581 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Here, the employer was aware of new, separate, identifiable, work-related occurrences of trauma, in addition to the initial trauma of the fall on May 2, 1991. It paid for medical treatment of the plaintiffs shoulder after September, 1993. There were separate, subsequent intervening acts or trauma, while the plaintiff was working, to the same shoulder after the plaintiffs initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>injury, as found by the commissioner. This is not a case of a recurrence of the initial dislocation of the plaintiffs shoulder independent of any subsequent trauma. It was not necessary for the plaintiff to allege a specific date for his repetitive trauma injury. It was sufficient to allege, given the facts of this case, that he incurred the injury \u201con or before\u201d a specific date. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 506. The defendant could focus its investigation on a particular period of time, and had the requisite information to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In my opinion, the conclusions of the board resulted from an incorrect application of the law, and I would grant the plaintiffs motion to preclude the defendants from contesting the claim because the plaintiffs notice of claim for compensation for his repetitive trauma injury was timely and gave the defendant an opportunity to investigate the claim. Also, I would conclude that the plaintiffs injury was causally related to repetitive trauma based on the subsidiary facts found by the commissioner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\"> In view of my conclusion that the notice of claim complied with \u00a7 3 l-294c, the issue discussed in part III of the majority opinion becomes irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\"> The defendants filed three notices contesting liability for the plaintiffs recommended surgery performed on October 24,1994. Two of the disclaimer notices predated the plaintiffs notice of claim for compensation and all of the defendants\u2019 disclaimers referenced the May 2,1991 accident, rather than the plaintiffs repetitive trauma claim relating to an injury prior to September 23, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\"> Because the commissioner found that the plaintiffs injury was not due to a repetitive trauma, she made no finding as to the last date of exposure to the repetitive trauma. Although October 21, 1994, was the last day the plaintiff worked, it is not known whether September 23, 1994, was the last time the plaintiff was exposed to a repetitive trauma at work. The plaintiff may not have been assigned to his usual duties between September 23 and October 21, making it possible that the last day worked was not the last day he was exposed to the trauma. The last date of exposure might also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>have been sometime in August, 1994, which was when the commissioner found (hat the plaintiffs \u201clast full dislocation at work occurred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
