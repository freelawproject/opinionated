The petitioner, Debra Stanley, initiated a petition in Michigan to establish the paternity of a child, bom to her on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>December 10, 1994. This petition was initiated under Michigan\u2019s Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act and then forwarded to Connecticut. On October 16, 1995, the respondent, Mark Taravella, appeared<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> through counsel in Connecticut and filed a denial of paternity. He also requested that the court order genetic testing of the petitioner, the minor child and himself to assist in the resolution of the issue of paternity. The results of the genetic testing indicated that the probability of paternity was 99.75 percent that the respondent was the child\u2019s biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">After reviewing the genetic test results, the respondent filed a motion for disclosure of facts, production of records and interrogatories on February 26, 1996. The petitioner complied with this requested discovery on March 1, 1996. On April 16, 1996, the respondent\u2019s counsel went to Michigan to take the petitioner\u2019s deposition. The petitioner appeared for the deposition and has consistently complied with every request for discovery that the respondent has made.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Thereafter, on August 1, 1996, the respondent moved for trial by jury. That motion was denied by a family support magistrate. On October 28, 1994, after a trial of the issues to the magistrate, a determination of paternity was entered against the respondent. The respondent then appealed to the Superior Court. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 46b-231 (n). The Superior Court, <em>Shortall, </em>J., affirmed the decision of the magistrate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>On appeal to this court, the respondent claims that the fact that an action is brought under the URESA statute does not preclude a respondent from his right to a jury trial under \u00a7 46b-164. The respondent\u2019s claim involves a number of subissues, which we discuss in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Initially, we note certain relevant principles that we will supplement during our discussion. \u201cIn 1950, the Commissioners of Uniform State Law enacted the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act ... in an attempt to aid the enforcement of support obligations between persons residing in separate states. This act, currently law in every state of the United States, provides an inexpensive and efficient enforcement mechanism for the \u2018interstate\u2019 collection of child support.\u201d 2 N. Vitek, Disputed Paternity Proceedings (5th Ed. 1998) \u00a7 31.01. The primary purpose of URESA is to provide a simple two state procedure by which the obligor\u2019s (respondent\u2019s) duty to support an obligee (petitioner) may be enforced expeditiously and with a minimum of expense to the obligee. See <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Sachner, </em>143 Conn. 9, 12, 118 A.2d 621 (1955); <em>Koon </em>v. <em>Boulder County Dept. of Social Services, </em>494 So. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>1126, 1129 (Fla. 1986); <em>Dept. of Human Resources </em>v. Westmoreland, 210 Ga. App. 603, 436 S.E.2d 706, cert. denied, 210 Ga. App. 901 (1993); <em>Paton </em>v. <em>Brill, </em>104 Ohio App. 3d 826, 829, 663 N.E.2d 421 (1995); <em>Clarkston </em>v. <em>Bridge, </em>273 Or. 68, 71, 539 P.2d 1094 (1975); <em>Bushway </em>v. <em>Riendeau, </em>137 Vt. 455, 459, 407 A.2d 178 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenley, </em>78 Wash. App. 864, 867, 899 P.2d 830 (1995). \u201cURESA creates no duty of support itself, but instead simply provides a means to enforce a duty of support as it may exist under the law of the responding state.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>264 Ill. App. 3d 662, 664, 636 N.E.2d 1013 (1994); see <em>Esteb </em>v. <em>Enright, </em>563 N.E.2d 139, 141 (Ind. App. 1990); <em>Horch </em>v. <em>Ponik, </em>132 Wis. 2d 373, 378, 392 N.W.2d 123, rev. denied, 132 Wis. 2d 484, 393 N.W.2d 544 (1986). The remedies provided under URESA are \u201cin addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 46b-181; see, e.g., <em>Dept. of Human Resources </em>v. <em>Westmoreland, </em>supra, 603; <em>Daniel-Nordin </em>v. <em>Nordin, </em>173 Wis. 2d 635, 648, 495 N.W.2d 318 (1993). This court has said that \u201c[i]n URESA cases, this court gives great weight to decisions from other jurisdictions in compliance with the mandate of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-209, which provides that \u2018[tjhis part shall be [so interpreted and] construed as to [effectuate] its general purpose to make uniform the laws of the states which enact it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fischer </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>14 Conn. App. 487, 492 n.6, 542 A.2d 731, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 814, 546 A.2d 280 (1988). URESA is a remedial statute and is to be liberally construed. See, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Ryall, </em>154 Cal. App. 3d 743, 751, 201 Cal. Rptr. 504 (1984); <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>248 Minn. 266, 274, 80 N.W.2d 13 (1956); <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>220 Va. 182, 185, 257 S.E.2d 774 (1979), on appeal after remand, 225 Va. 304, 302 S.E.2d 30, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 961, 104 S. Ct. 395, 78 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1983); <em>Yetter </em>v. <em>Commeau, </em>84 Wash. 2d 155, 159, 524 P.2d 901 (1974); 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statutes \u00a7 338 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Although the 1958 revision of URESA is silent concerning a court\u2019s authority to adjudicate paternity in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>interstate proceeding, neither party to this case claims that the court here lacked such authority and the majority of courts<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> addressing this question appear to have taken \u201ca more desirable approach\u201d and \u201c[t]hese better reasoned decisions take a broader, less restrictive view of section 7<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> [URESA] and conclude that adjudication of paternity is well within the scope of the URESA support proceeding.\u201d 2 N. Vitek, supra, \u00a7 31.06. The Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Clarkston </em>v. <em>Bridge, </em>supra, 273 Or. 68, exemplifies that view. In <em>Clarkston, </em>the court said, \u201cURESA authorizes both the finding and the enforcement of duties of support which have not been previously established in another proceeding.\u201d Id., 72. The <em>Clarkston </em>court reasoned that, in determining whether the respondent owed a duty of support to the child involved, the court first had to decide whether the respondent was the father of the child. Therefore, it observed that since the order of support portion of its URESA statute authorized its circuit court to find and enforce a duty of support in a URESA proceeding, \u201cthe statutory authority to establish paternity . . . seems clearly implied.\u201d Id., 73. In <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>supra, 14 Conn. App. 490, this court said: \u201cThe fact that this is a URESA action and not a traditional paternity proceeding is no impediment to the trial court\u2019s finding of paternity. It is well established that a court sitting in a URESA proceeding has jurisdiction to determine paternity. See annot., 81 A.L.R.3d 1175 [1977], Determination of Paternity of Child as Within Scope of Proceeding Under [URESA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The respondent raises a number of issues in support of his basic claim that he is not precluded in this URESA proceeding from electing a trial by jury under \u00a7 46b-164. He claims that there is nothing in URESA that takes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>away his right to a jury trial set out in \u00a7 46b-164 even though \u00a7 46b-164 is set out in another chapter of our statutes, i.e., chapter 815y. In doing so, he points to \u00a7 46b-181 in URESA, which is entitled \u201cRemedies additional to existing remedies\u201d and which states that \u201c[t]he remedies herein provided are in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies.\u201d Going on, the respondent claims that under \u00a7 46b-197,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which provides that the proceedings are to be conducted \u201cin the manner prescribed by law for an action for the enforcement of the type of duty of support claimed . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">According to the respondent, because URESA is silent as to a jury trial, \u00a7 46b-181 entitles him to elect a jury trial under \u00a7 46b-164, even though this latter stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ute is found in a different chapter of our General Statutes than the URESA statute. Furthermore, in oral argument before us, the respondent specifically claimed that the \u201cin addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies for\u201d language of \u00a7 46b-181 overrides the language of \u00a7 46b-164 confining it to chapter 815y, despite the fact that the legislature, in enacting our URESA statute, left the language of \u00a7 46b-164 totally untouched. The respondent also maintains that the legislature\u2019s failure expressly to override \u00a7 46b-164 does not preclude this entitlement to a jury trial under \u00a7 46b-164 because \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (5)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> makes the jury trial option available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In countering the respondent\u2019s claims, the petitioner argues that \u00a7 46b-164 is contained in chapter 815y of the General Statutes, whereas the URESA court\u2019s ability to determine the support obligation is authorized by General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7\u00a7 46b-198<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 46b-180 (4),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which are contained in chapter 816. The petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>also argues that the legislature intended to exclude URESA fathers from the scope of \u00a7 46b~164 because the clear language of \u00a7 46b-164 limits that statute to \u201cprosecutions\u201d encompassed by chapter 815y and, accordingly, absent legislation to the contrary, this court \u201cmust\u201d not apply \u00a7 46b-164 to this URESA proceeding. The petitioner, therefore, argues that because the URESA court\u2019s ability to determine paternity under URESA is not a \u201cprosecution\u201d under the provisions of chapter 815y, the respondent does not have a statutory right to a jury trial. We agree with the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u201cAs with any issue of statutory interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the statute itself.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P. C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 756, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996); see <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; MacLean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 349, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996). \u201cIf the words of a statute are clear, the duty of a reviewing court is to apply the legislature\u2019s directive since where the wording is plain, courts will not speculate as to any supposed intention because the question before a court then is not what the legislature actually intended, but what intention it expressed by the words that it used.\u201d <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>191 Conn. 222, 228, 464 A.2d 45 (1983); see also <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 571, 512 A.2d 893 (1986); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Singer 1992) \u00a7 46.01. \u201cCourts may not read into clearly expressed legislation provisions which do not find expression in its words. <em>Brunswick Corporation </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>184 Conn. 75, 81, 440 A.2d 792 (1981), quoting <em>International Business Machines Corporation </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 134, 355 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>236 (1974).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Struckman </em>v. Burns, 205 Conn. 542, 546, 534 A.2d 888 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We turn first to the respondent\u2019s claim that he is entitled to a jury trial because there is nothing in URESA that takes away his \u201cright\u201d to a jury trial under \u00a7 46b-164. In advancing this position, he does not, however, appropriately confront the plain language of \u00a7 46b-164. That section starts with the following words of limitation: \u201cIn any prosecution under the provisions of this chapter . . . .\u201d This statute is found in chapter 815y of the General Statutes captioned \u201cPaternity Matters,\u201d whereas the URESA statute is found in chapter 816, where it is set out as the \u201cUniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act.\u201d The plain language of \u00a7 46b-164 embodies the legislative intent that, inter alia, \u201cthe trial of the question of fact as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant\u201d in a paternity action under chapter 815y is a \u201cprosecution under the provisions of chapter 815y.\u201d The unambiguous language of this statute demonstrates the legislative intent to confine the entitlement to a jury trial to \u201cany prosecution under the provisions of [chapter 815y].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">There is no question that the legislature may, by the language it uses in a statute or a section of a statute, demonstrate its intent that it be limited or restricted. See <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Dept. of Correction, </em>221 Conn. 41, 45, 601 A.2d 539 (1992); <em>Public Service Commission </em>v. <em>Diamond State Telephone Co., </em>468 A.2d 1285, 1300 (Del. 1983); see 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statutes \u00a7 199 (1974). The legislature\u2019s use of words, such as those used in \u00a7 46b-164, limiting that section to chapter 815y, can and does set out the intended situations that bring that statute into play and \u201cconnotes the legislative intent to exclude that which is not included.\u201d <em>McNulty </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>37 Conn. App. 835, 840, 657 A.2d 1126 (1995). The authority of a court in a URESA proceeding to determine a \u201cduty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>of support\u201d is authorized by statute set out in a different chapter of the General Statutes than that containing \u00a7 46b-164. Had the legislature intended to afford URESA respondents a jury trial, it could have so stated in the URESA statute, just as it did in \u00a7 46b-164. We simply cannot import into chapter 816 that which the legislature clearly confined to chapter 815y.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Moreover, the respondent\u2019s claim is not supported by his invocation of the \u201cin addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies\u201d language of \u00a7 46b-181. He claims that this language, given the silence of URESA on the availability of a jury trial, entitles him to the benefit of the jury trial election in \u00a7 46b-164. This claim fails for two reasons. First, the plain language of \u00a7 46b-164, confining that statute to chapter 815y, bars drawing on the language of \u00a7 46b-181 in chapter 816 to support this argument. Second, the option of a defendant in a \u201cprosecution\u201d under \u00a7 46b-164 does not constitute a \u201cremedy,\u201d in and of itself, within the purview of \u00a7 46b-181. Rather, \u00a7 46b-164<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was a portion of the statutory scheme in chapter 815y that afforded a \u201cremedy\u201d for the rights created by and to be enforced by chapter 815y. It has been stated that \u201c[ejvery action is brought in order to obtain some particular result which is termed the remedy. This final result is not the \u2018cause of action;\u2019 it is rather the \u2018object of the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wildman </em>v. <em>Wildman, </em>70 Conn. 700, 707, 41 A. 1 (1898). The United States Supreme Court quoted with approval Bouvier\u2019s<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> definition of \u201cremedy\u201d as \u201cthe means employed to enforce aright, or redress an injury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>The Knapp, Stout &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, 177 </em>U.S. 638, 644, 20 S. Ct. 824, 44 L. Ed. 921 (1900). Courts speak of a \u201ccause of action\u201d as a set of facts on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>which a recovery (or a specific result) may be had and the cause of action is distinct from the remedy in that the remedy is the means by which that cause may be satisfied or its results effectuated. <em>Ex Parte Southern Building Code </em>Congress, 282 Ala. 523, 528, 213 So. 2d 365 (1968); <em>Venuto </em>v. <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>22 Cal. App. 3d 116, 122, 99 Cal. Rptr. 350 (1971); <em>World Radio Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand, </em>2 Neb. App. 747, 753, 514 N.W.2d 351 (1994); 1 Am. Jur. 2d, Actions \u00a7 2 (1994). The provision in \u00a7 46b-164 for a trial by court or by jury is simply a description of the mode of the trial that a defendant may elect in a chapter 815y proceeding. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>700 So. 2d 1005, 1015 (La. App. 1997). It is not per se a \u201cremedy\u201d; the entire statutory scheme of chapter 815y prescribes the steps required to be undertaken to obtain the remedy provided by the provisions of that chapter. In enacting legislation, lawmakers are deemed to have had a definite purpose in mind, and to have included the component parts, which were intended to accomplish the legislative purpose of that statutory scheme. See <em>Denbo </em>v. <em>Moorestown Township, </em>23 N.J. 476, 481, 129 A.2d 710 (1957). Section 46b-164 is but one of these component parts within the statutory scheme of chapter 815y that, in combination with other components, affords the remedy. Section 46b-164, therefore, does not fall within the scope of \u00a7 46b-181. The \u201cin addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies\u201d language in \u00a7 46b-181 means that our URESA provision, which comes from the uniform act, is separate and apart and additional to other remedies for the enforcement of child support obligations that exist under our law. See, e.g., <em>People ex rel. Oetjen </em>v. <em>Oetjen, </em>92 Ill. App. 3d 699, 703, 416 N.E.2d 278 (1980); <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Messier, </em>602 A.2d 1155, 1156 (Me. 1992); <em>Rood </em>v. <em>Rood, 4 </em>Neb. App. 455, 461, 545 N.W.2d 138 (1996); <em>San Diego </em>v. <em>Elavsky, </em>58 Ohio St. 2d 81, 84, 388 N.E.2d 1229 (1979); <em>Horch </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>Ponik, </em>supra, 132 Wis. 2d 379. For example, it is \u201cin addition to and not in substitution for\u201d such child support obligations as may be created by a paternity proceeding under chapter 815y<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or such an order created by a dissolution of marriage decree. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 46b-204. We reject the respondent\u2019s claim as to \u00a7 46b-164 because, as we have shown, \u00a7 46b-164 specifically and URESA as a whole provide a petitioner with an additional or alternative civil <em>remedy </em>that does not in any way impair or affect any other <em>remedy </em>available to a petitioner with reference to the enforcement of child support orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Finally, in arguing his entitlement to a jury trial under \u00a7 46b-181, the respondent, while conceding that URESA itself is silent on that issue and has never been amended to include a jury trial option, claims that he is entitled to one under the provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (5).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Section 46b-231 (m) enumerates the \u201cpowers and duties\u201d of family support magistrates. Subdivision (5) of \u00a7 46b-231 (m), by its clear language, is confined to \u201c[proceedings to establish paternity in IV-D support cases . . . .\u201d Section 46b-231 (b) (14), as we have noted,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> defines \u201cIV-D support cases.\u201d The respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>apparently claims that his jury trial claim is supported by the language of \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (5), which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe matter shall be heard and determined by the family support magistrate in accordance with the provisions of chapter 815y, except that if a party to the action demands trial by jury pursuant to section 46b-164, the matter shall be referred for trial to the superior court for the judicial district where the case was filed.\u201d The record does not contain anything that would support his claim that the proceeding below was a \u201cIV-D support proceeding\u201d within the ambit of \u00a7 46b-231 (m) (5). On this aspect of the matter, he is therefore left outside the reach of that definition and is given no support by the last sentence of subdivision (5) of subsection (m) containing the reference to chapter 815y<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-11\"> Our URESA statute became effective on June 18, 1953.

In enacting, in 1986, part III of chapter 816, which is the Family Support Magistrate\u2019s Act, the legislature obviously revisited and considered \u00a7 46b-164, which was enacted years before both our Family Support Magistrate\u2019s Act, \u00a7 46b-231 et seq. and our URESA statute. Yet it did nothing about enacting any jury trial entitlement, as set out in \u00a7 46b-164 into the URESA statute, also a part of chapter 816. Courts presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes and \u201c[statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>M.
