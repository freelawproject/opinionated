Kane alleges that the accident was caused by a hit-and-run vehicle, although the defendant, American Insurance Company, contends that the accident arose from a slip and fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Kane had been insured by the defendant, which had issued to her a series of six month insurance policies. Sometime within forty-five days of July 8, 1995, the expiration date of one of those policies, the defendant sent a letter to Kane, along with personal automobile policy summary and declaration sheets and a policy premium billing statement. Kane did not pay the premium by the July 8, 1995 due date, or at any time thereafter. Subsequently, the defendant sent Kane, by regular mail, a final lapse notice on or about July 24, 1995. At no time did the defendant mail Kane a cancellation notice pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 38a-343.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Kane alleges that pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 \u00a7 38a-340 and 38a-341 (2), the mailing of the automobile renewal policy by the defendant constituted the issu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>anee of a six month renewal policy requiring the defendant to issue a cancellation notice in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 38a-343. The defendant contends that the mailing of the automobile renewal policy did not constitute the issuance of a new six month policy. Instead, the defendant argues that this \u201cpacket of documentation\u201d amounted to an offer by the defendant to Kane for automobile insurance. The defendant argues, therefore, that this is simply a case of the nonrenewal of an insurance policy that had expired and, consequently, the cancellation provisions of \u00a7 38a-343 do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The parties agree that, should this court decide that the defendant was required to send Kane a notice of cancellation in accordance with \u00a7 38a-343 before terminating her policy, then the policy would have been in effect on October 13, 1995, the date of Kane\u2019s accident. The parties further agree that should this court decide that a policy was in effect at the time of Kane\u2019s accident, they will submit this case to arbitration on the issue of the mechanism of the accident and the extent of Kane\u2019s injuries. The parties maintain, therefore, that the determination of the legal effect of \u00a7 38a-341 (2) by this court would be in the interest of judicial economy and would simplify the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The question reserved to this court is: \u201cDid \u00a7\u00a7 38a-340 and 38a-341 (2) require the defendant, American Insurance Company, to issue a cancellation notice in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 38a-343 before terminating the plaintiff, Bertha Kane\u2019s, automobile insurance coverage?\u201d Our answer to the reserved question is No.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38a-341 through 38a-344 govern the procedures for the cancellation of an automobile insurance policy by an insurer. Under \u00a7 38a-342, an insurer can choose to cancel a policy due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>insured\u2019s failure to pay the premium, or because of the revocation of the insured\u2019s driver\u2019s license or motor vehicle registration or that belonging to any operator living with the insured. Section 38a-343 (a) provides that \u2018[n]o notice of cancellation of policy to which section 38a-342 applies may be effective unless sent, by registered or certified mail or by mail evidenced by a certificate of mailing, or delivered by the insurer to the named insured at least forty-five days before the effective date of cancellation, provided where cancellation is for nonpayment of premium at least ten days\u2019 notice of cancellation accompanied by the reason therefor shall be given.\u2019 \u201d <em>Majernicek </em>v. <em>Hartford Casualty Ins. Co., </em>240 Conn. 86, 92-93, 688 A.2d 1330 (1997). Prior to determining whether a written notice of cancellation was required pursuant to \u00a7 38a-343, we must determine whether, under the facts as stipulated and the exhibits as furnished, there was a renewal of the contract of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">A policy of insurance is a contract between the parties; a renewal of the original policy is a separate and distinct contract providing coverage for a specific term or period. See <em>Stenson </em>v. <em>Northland Ins. Co., </em>42 Conn. App. 177, 185, 678 A.2d 1000 (1996). In this case, the contract between the parties, i.e., the underlying policy of insurance, expired on July 8,1995. Prior to that expiration date, the defendant sent Kane a letter, along with a personal automobile policy summary, declaration sheets and a policy premium billing statement. We have examined those exhibits and conclude that, absent an automatic renewal clause in the contract of insurance, what Kane received from the defendant was an offer to renew the contract of insurance, which was to be automatically terminated on July 8, 1995, unless Kane paid the required premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The premium statement, in a separate paragraph and in capital letters, set forth the following: \u201cIMPORTANT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>NOTICE: THE MINIMUM PREMIUM SHOWN MUST BE RECEIVED IN OUR OFFICE BY THE DUE DATE. IF YOUR PREMIUM IS NOT RECEIVED BY THAT DATE, COVERAGE UNDER YOUR POLICY SHALL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE ON THE RENEWAL DATE WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE.\u201d This offer to enter into a renewal of the contract of insurance was not accepted by Kane, acceptance being conditioned on payment of the premium on or before July 8, 1995. Thereafter, the defendant informed Kane by a final lapse notice, again in capital letters: \u201cIMPORTANT NOTICE: AS STATED IN YOUR PREVIOUS BILLING NOTICE, COVERAGE UNDER YOUR POLICY TERMINATED ON THE RENEWAL DATE FOR NONPAYMENT OF PREMIUM. IF PAYMENT IS RECEIVED IN OUR OFFICE BY THE DATE SHOWN, YOUR COVERAGE WILL BE REINSTATED.\u201d The due date for the premium payment that would have reinstated Kane\u2019s policy was July 24, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The purpose of \u00a7 38a-343 \u201cis to assure that before an automobile insurance policy is cancelled the insured has a clear and unambiguous notice of the cancellation.\u201d <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>25 Conn. App. 95, 97-98, 592 A.2d 975 (1991). Kane relies on <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hendrickson, </em>1 Conn. App. 409, 472 A.2d 356 (1984), to argue that under this set of facts, the correspondence that she received from the defendant operated as a renewal of her insurance policy that could not be canceled without following the applicable cancellation requirements of \u00a7 38a-343. Under the particular facts in <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hendrickson, </em>supra, 410, however, a partial payment was accepted by the insurer and credited toward the total premium due. There, the court indicated that \u201cthe [insurer] sent a premium notice to the [insured] which indicated that the [insured\u2019s partial] payment would be applied as a credit to the total premium due. This notice was of special importance because it could have reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>led the [insured] to believe that the policy was in effect as of that date.\u201d Id., 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In the present case, no such situation exists. Kane never sent the defendant a payment, partial or otherwise. Therefore, since Kane\u2019s contract of insurance terminated on July 8, 1995, and since she did not accept the defendant\u2019s offer of renewal by paying the premium, the defendant was not required to cancel the policy. In other words, because no renewal was in effect, no written notice of cancellation was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">To the reserved question\u2014\u201cDid \u00a7\u00a7 38a-340 and 38a-341 (2) require the defendant, American Insurance Company, to issue a cancellation notice in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 38a-343 before terminating the plaintiff, Bertha Kane\u2019s, automobile insurance coverage?\u201d\u2014 our answer is No.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">No costs will be taxed to either party.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 73-1 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any reservation shall be taken ... to the appellate court from those cases in which an appeal could have been taken directly ... to the appellate court . . . had judgment been rendered ....</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">\u201c(b) All questions presented for advice shall be specific and shall be phrased so as to require a Yes or No answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">* sfc *</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">\u201c(e) The court will not entertain a reservation for its advice upon questions of law arising in any action unless the question or questions presented are such as are, in the opinion of the court, reasonably certain to enter into the decision of the case, and it appears that their present determination would be in the interest of simplicity, directness and economy of judicial action. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-341 provides in relevant part: \u201cCancellation of motor vehicle liability policy: Definitions.
