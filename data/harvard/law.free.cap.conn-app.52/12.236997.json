The plaintiff sought a review of the commission\u2019s decision ordering the plaintiff to disclose documents relating to an internal affairs investigation. We affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The following facts are undisputed. On February 9, 1995, attorney Terence P. Sexton made a request under the Freedom of Information Act (act); General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 1-7 et seq.; that required the plaintiff to disclose \u201call documents, reports and memoranda concerning any Internal Affairs or Patrol Operations Division investigations relating to Officer Raymondo Diaz.\u201d That request was denied. On February 24, 1995, Sexton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>filed an action in the United States District Court on behalf of Carmen Delia Soto against the city of Hartford and Diaz for alleged violations of her civil rights. During the course of the federal action, Sexton sought the same information as requested from the plaintiff through discovery proceedings in the federal court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Following a hearing on the merits, the commission issued its final decision on May 17,1996, ordering disclosure of all of the documents in question. In particular, the commission ordered that the plaintiff \u201cstrictly comply with the public records requirements set forth in [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 1-15 and 1-19 (a).\u201d Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 l-21i (d) and 4-183, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the commission\u2019s decision. While the appeal was pending, the underlying federal action was settled and withdrawn. The trial court, nevertheless, addressed the issues raised by the parties and, concluding that \u00a7 l-19b (b) (1) did not bar access to public records under the facts in the present case, dismissed the appeal. From that dismissal, the plaintiff has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">As a preliminary matter, we must address the question of whether the issue before us is moot. The underlying action in federal court has been settled and withdrawn, and, in addition, the plaintiff has produced all documents originally requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Mootness implicates the jurisdiction of this court to hear an appeal. <em>Domestic Violence Services of Greater New Haven, Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>240 Conn. 1, 6, 688 A.2d 314 (1997). Our Supreme Court has stated, however, that when an order of the commission is prospective in nature and involves a continuing obligation to comply, an appeal is not moot, even though the underlying action may have been settled or -withdrawn. Id., 8-9. The present case involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>just such a prospective order, which stated that the plaintiff \u201cshall strictly comply with the public records requirements set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1-15 and 1-19 (a).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the plaintiff is subject to a prospective order of the commission, we conclude that the case before us is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Turning to the merits of the appeal, the plaintiff claims that \u00a7 l-19b (b) (1) provides an exemption from disclosure under the act if the same records have also been sought through the use of the discovery process in civil litigation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Our analysis is guided by our Supreme Court\u2019s consistent interpretation of the act to favor disclosure and to construe exceptions to disclosure narrowly. See, e.g., <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>240 Conn. 835, 840, 694 A.2d 1241 (1997); <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 641, 651, 631 A.2d 252 (1993); <em>Superintendent of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>222 Conn. 621, 626, 609 A.2d 998 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 l-19b (b) provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]othing in sections 1-15, l-18a, 1-19 to l-19b . . . shall be deemed in any manner to (1) . . . limit the rights of litigants, including parties to administrative proceedings, under the laws of discovery of this state . . . .\u201d The plaintiff claims that allowing the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>or others in a similar situation to obtain documents not otherwise discoverable in a civil action would effectively limit <em>his </em>rights as a litigant to the protections found in the laws of discovery of this state. In essence, the plaintiff argues that the laws of discovery should limit the rights of litigants under the act. We decline to adopt this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The right of a litigant to discovery is primarily the right to obtain information. Practice Book \u00a7 13-2 provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any civil action . . . where the judicial authority finds it reasonably probable that evidence outside the record will be required, a party may obtain in accordance with the provisions of this chapter discovery of information or disclosure, production and inspection of papers, books or documents material to the subject matter involved in the pending action, which are not privileged, whether the discovery or disclosure relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, and which are within the knowledge, possession or power of the party or person to whom the discovery is addressed. . . .\u201d The discovery rules are designed to facilitate trial proceedings and to \u201cmake a trial less a game of blindman\u2019s buff and more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practicable extent.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Procter &amp; Gamble, </em>356 U.S. 677, 682, 78 S. Ct. 983, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1077 (1958); <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hospital of St. Raphael, </em>17 Conn. App. 121, 123, 550 A.2d 645 (1988); <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>7 Conn. App. 514, 519, 509 A.2d 552 (1986). A successful objection to a discovery request does not create an independent right in the objecting party to withhold information. It is merely a limit on the <em>requesting party\u2019s right to obtain the information </em>in that court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Our Supreme Court previously analyzed an earlier version of \u00a7 l-19b (b) (1) that precluded any disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>pursuant to the act that would affect the discovery rights of litigants. In <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 663-65, our Supreme Court held that an arrest report did not have to be disclosed to the public, pursuant to the act, while criminal prosecution relating to that arrest report was pending. It found that disclosure of the arrest report would expand the rights of the defendant under the laws of discovery and thereby \u201cwould <em>affect </em>the rights of litigants under the laws of discovery . ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 663-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The term \u201caffect\u201d was changed to \u201climit\u201d in \u00a7 l-19b (b) (1) in 1994 by the enactment of No. 94-26 of the 1994 Public Acts. The revised statute precludes disclosure pursuant to the act that would \u201climit the rights of litigants . . . under the laws of discovery of this state.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-19b (b) (1). The prior term, affect, is derived from the Latin word affectus meaning \u201cacted upon or subjected to.\u201d Random House Unabridged Dictionary (2d Ed. 1993). It means \u201cto act on; produce an effect or change in.\u201d Id. As our Supreme Court explained in <em>Gifford, </em>a disclosure pursuant to the act then in effect could expand discovery rights and could reasonably be interpreted as affecting the rights of litigants under the laws of discovery of the state. The term limit, however, is not susceptible to the same interpretation. Limit is derived from the middle English word lymyt, which has its roots in the Latin word limes, meaning boundary. Id. It means \u201cto restrict\u201d or \u201cto confine.\u201d Id. Where more information is available to a litigant by way of a request pursuant to the act than by discovery, that litigant\u2019s discovery rights have been expanded rather than limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">We conclude that \u201cto limit the rights of litigants . . . under the laws of discovery of this state\u201d should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>interpreted as prohibiting the use of the act to restrict the rights of parties seeking information through discovery. Similarly, an exemption from production under the act, in and of itself, does not preclude a litigant from obtaining the same documents through discovery. See <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>190 Conn. 235, 245, 460 A.2d 1255 (1983). The act and our rules of discovery provide independent methods for obtaining information, except where disclosure pursuant to the act would limit the discovery rights of litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-15 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person applying in writing shall receive, promptly upon request, a plain or certified copy of any public record. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a) provides in relevantpart: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute, all records maintained or kept on file by any public agency, whether or not such records are required by any law or by any rule or regulation, shall be public records and every person shall have the right to inspect such records promptly during regular office or business hours or to receive a copy of such records in accordance with the provisions of section 1-15. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
