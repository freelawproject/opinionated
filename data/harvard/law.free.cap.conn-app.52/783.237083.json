We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">The plaintiffs business consists of the placement of health care personnel with health care facilities and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>with individual clients. The individual defendant, Harriet Franklin, was employed by the plaintiff as a coordinator of health care services. The corporate defendant, Superlative Home Care, Inc., is a Connecticut corporation formed and controlled by Franklin. The individual defendant, in a counterclaim, alleged claims for defamation, violations of CUTPA and vexatious litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The case was tried to the court, which found the facts that follow. Franklin, while employed by the plaintiff, arranged for the care of ill and elderly clients by health care personnel. As staffing director, she assigned aides to clients as needed. While in the plaintiffs employ, Franklin secretly formed the defendant corporation, Superlative Home Care, Inc. Franklin worked in the business office of the plaintiff, received weekly compensation and had contact with the payors of home care personnel. She was the only employee who sent out service agreements and placed nurse\u2019s aides with clients of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In her capacity as staffing director for the plaintiff, Franklin had supplied nurse\u2019s aides for Marion Lewis, an elderly client of the plaintiff. Franklin successfully solicited the trust department of the Hartford National Bank and Trust Company, which administered Lewis\u2019 affairs, to retain her new corporation to supply nurse\u2019s aides to Lewis. Franklin also successfully solicited two nurse\u2019s aides who had been employed by the plaintiff to assist in the care of Lewis as employees of the defendant corporation. She recruited other nurse\u2019s aides from the plaintiff as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Franklin\u2019s actions caused the plaintiff to lose the lucrative business of caring for Lewis, which provided gross income of approximately $234,000. The trial court found $55,000 to be a reasonable estimate of the plaintiffs loss. The trial court established the same amount of damages for all three causes of action alleged by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>plaintiff in its complaint and rendered judgment for all three in the total amount of $55,000, together with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs as to the plaintiffs CUTPA cause of action. In a supplemental judgment, the trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees of $21,293 and set costs of $972.82. The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff on the individual defendant\u2019s counterclaim because \u201cthere was no credible evidence introduced to substantiate any of the three counts in the counterclaim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The individual defendant does not attack the judgment for the plaintiff on her counterclaim, nor do either of the defendants claim that the trial court improperly found them to be hable on the three counts of the plaintiffs complaint. The only issues raised by the defendants on appeal are whether (1) the amount of the trial court\u2019s award of damages was supported by the evidence and (2) the attorney\u2019s fees for the plaintiff were properly found.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The defendants claim that the plaintiff did not prove its damages with reasonable certainty and that the plaintiff did not prove its damages for the CUTPA violations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The principal owner of the plaintiff corporation, Joanne Smith, testified about the billings of the Lewis account and the promptness with which those billings were paid. The defendants\u2019 billing records showed gross billings of $237,240 during the period the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>had supplied nurse\u2019s aides to Lewis. A net profit of $55,952, as calculated by Smith, was based on deducting a sales tax of 6 percent, amounting to $13,428, and applying a 25 percent rate to the balance. The trial court found that the amount of damages awarded was a \u201cfair and reasonable estimate of compensatory damages under the circumstances based upon actual experience . . . .\u201d The transcript indicates that the Lewis billings equaled about $3000 per week and that the common practice in the industry was to mark up accounts 55 to 60 percent and that the industry standard net profit was 25 percent. Thus, the damages awarded by the trial court were based on the evidence. The defendants claim, however, that damages could not be established by industry standards but only by the actual profit lost by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">The testimony of the plaintiffs principal shareholder was that the 25 percent calculation was accurate as to 1991, 1992 and 1993 \u201cin the business here in Hartford,\u201d and that on private duty aides, \u201cwe did a little bit better than that.\u201d Thus, there was evidence of both the industry standard net profit and this particular plaintiffs net profit. We conclude that the plaintiff established the compensatory damages of $55,000 with reasonable certainty. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Nationwide Moving &amp; Storage Co., </em>187 Conn. 405, 423, 446 A.2d 799 (1982). The trial court\u2019s determination of damages was a question of fact that should not be disturbed unless it is unsupported by the evidence. <em>Beckman </em>v. <em>Jalich Homes, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 299, 309-10, 460 A.2d 488 (1983); see also <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 28, 664 A.2d 719 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The defendants also claim that the plaintiff did not prove damages for its CUTPA claims. This claim is based on the same argument that the defendants make in arguing that damages for the other counts were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>supported by the evidence. The same previously cited testimony rebuts this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\"> The defendants\u2019 second claim does not concern the reasonableness of the attorney\u2019s fees, but, rather, that no evidentiary hearing as to the fees was held. That claim may be disposed of summarily because it has no basis given the facts of this case. The trial court gave the defendants\u2019 counsel two weeks from the time the plaintiffs attorney furnished time sheets and a fee schedule to the court and to the defendants to comment on them and stated that the court would \u201chold a hearing if necessary.\u201d The defendants did not oppose the amounts, comment on the time sheets or seek the hearing the trial court had indicated it would hold.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
