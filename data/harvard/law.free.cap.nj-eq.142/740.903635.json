Adolf obtained a divorce from his wife Anna in or about March, 1944. The complainant and the defendant Adolf were married on July 23d, 1944. Prior to that time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>they had been living together as man and wife, while Adolf was the husband of Anna Haimerl and not divorced from her. When they married complainant requested John to convey the premises to her and Adolf. He refused her request.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b781-4\">\u201cThere are two causes of action in the bill. In the first one the complainant seeks separate maintenance from her husband Adolf. It being a matrimonial cause, which under the Chancery rules should be heard by an advisory master, counsel was granted a severance thereof. The second cause of action is directed against the complainant\u2019s husband, Adolf, his father, John Haimerl, and his mother, Margaret Haimerl.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b781-5\">\u201cThe defendants deny that any moneys were received from the complainant on account of the purchase of the premises, or that any understanding as aforesaid was given or entered into.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b781-6\">\u201cThe evidence indicates that complainant paid $1,000 towards the purchase price of the premises immediately prior to, or contemporaneously with, the time the title was taken in the name of John Haimerl as aforesaid, which effected a resulting trust. All the expenses of the premises arising subsequently were shared equally between the complainant and the defendant. The complainant maintains that she contributed $1,900 as her share of the expenses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b781-7\">\u201cAdditional contributions were evidence of interest. Certainly, acts of ownership, and statements made against interest, are indicative of intent. The acts of ownership, and the statements against interest made by the parties herein, somewhat substantiate the complainant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b781-8\">\u201cThe evidence submitted on the complainant\u2019s behalf is to the effect that the title was taken in the name of John Haimerl to avoid any marital rights that Anna Haimerl could have in the premises as the then wife of the defendant Adolf; and that it was the intention of the parties that the title be held by John pending the outcome of Adolf\u2019s divorce suit against Anna, and that in the event that Adolf and the complainant subsequently became husband and wife, John then would convey the title to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b781-9\">See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Dougherty, 18 N.
