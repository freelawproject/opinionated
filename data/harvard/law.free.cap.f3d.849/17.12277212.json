KOELTL, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">This is a case about unconstitutional conditions of confinement for pretrial detainees. Twenty state pretrial detainees (\u201cthe plaintiffs\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arrested on separate dates between July 10, 2011, and July 23, 2013, brought individual \u00a7 1983 claims in the same complaint against the City of New York (the \u201cCity\u201d), New York City Police Department (\u201cNYPD\u201d) Captain Kenneth Kobetitsch, and NYPD Captain William Tobin (the \u201cindividual defendants\u201d) (collectively, \u201cthe defendants\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs alleged that they were each subjected to appalling conditions of confinement while held pre-arraignment at Brooklyn Central Booking (\u201cBCB\u201d) with deliberate indifference to the deprivation of their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. Because BCB was only a pre-arraignment holding facility, no plaintiff was held at BCB for more than twenty-four hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Kuntz, J.) granted summary judgment to the defendants, reasoning that the plaintiffs failed to meet both the objective and subjective requirements for a claim of unconstitutional conditions of confinement based on a theory of deliberate indifference. The District Court concluded that, with respect to the \u201cobjective prong,\u201d no plaintiff could establish an objectively substantial deprivation of any constitutional rights because no plaintiff actually suffered a serious injury, or was \u201cregularly denied his or her basic human needs or was exposed to conditions that posed an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his or her future health\u201d for more than twenty-four hours; nor could any plaintiff establish the \u201csubjective prong\u201d of a deliberate indifference claim by proving that the individual defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>were actually aware of any dangerous conditions, or that the individual defendants acted unreasonably in responding to any such conditions; nor, for similar reasons, could the plaintiffs establish that the individual defendants acted with punitive intent. See Cano v. City of New York, 119 F.Supp.3d 65, 74, 82, 85-86 (E.D.N.Y. 2015). Because no plaintiff could prove a constitutional deprivation, the District Court also held that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity, and that the plaintiffs could not establish that the City was liable pursuant to Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). See Cano, 119 F.Supp.3d at 86-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The District Court issued its opinion shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kingsley v. Hendrickson, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2466, 192 L.Ed.2d 416 (2015), in which the Supreme Court held that, for excessive force claims brought under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \u201ca pretrial detainee must show only that the force purposely or knowingly used against him was objectively unreasonable.\u201d Id. at 2473. The Court rejected the requirement that, for such claims, a pretrial detainee establish a state of mind component to the effect that the official applied the force against the pretrial detainee \u201cmaliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d Id. at 2475 (citation omitted). The District Court\u2019s opinion was also issued two weeks before this Court\u2019s decision in Willey v. Kirkpatrick, 801 F.3d 51, 66-68 (2d Cir. 2015), in which this Court held that while the proper inquiry for a conditions of confinement claim is by reference to the duration and severity of the conditions, the claim did not require a \u201cminimum duration\u201d or \u201cminimum severity\u201d to reach the level of a constitutional violation. This Court further made clear that a \u201cserious injury is unequivocally not a necessary element of an Eighth Amendment [conditions of confinement] claim.\u201d Id. at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">The District Court did not analyze the implications of Kingsley in its opinion. Moreover, the District Court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration based on Willey, as well as the plaintiffs\u2019 later motion for reconsideration of the order denying the first motion for reconsideration, because the District Court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the summary judgment order divested it of jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">Among other issues, this case requires us to consider whether, consistent with Willey, and the precedents on which it is based, appalling conditions of confinement cannot rise to an objective violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause so long as the detainee is subjected to those conditions for no more than twenty-four hours, and the detainee does not suffer an actual, serious injury during that time. This case also requires us to consider whether Kingsley altered the standard for conditions of confinement claims under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>For the reasons explained below, we affirm. in part, and vacate in part, the District Court\u2019s judgment, and remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In reviewing the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, \u201cwe construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in their favor.\u201d CILP Assocs., L.P. v. PriceWaterhouse Coopers LLP, 735 F.3d 114, 118 (2d Cir. 2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We affirm the grant of summary judgment only where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Our review is <em>de novo. </em>Ruggiero v. County of Orange, 467 F.3d 170, 173 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">This is a lawsuit on behalf of twenty individual plaintiffs rather than a class action. As such, this is a review of a judgment dismissing the separate claims of twenty plaintiffs that were filed in a single complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">In its analysis, the District Court did not perform individualized assessments of each plaintiffs claims, reasoning instead that, because no plaintiffs confinement at BCB exceeded twenty-four hours, and no plaintiff suffered an actual, serious physical injury, no plaintiff could establish a violation. As discussed below, the District Courted erred in its analysis. Although the evidence differed with respect to the conditions that each plaintiff was subjected to, we summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs as a group to explain the error in the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing the Second Amended Complaint. On remand, however, 'it will be necessary for the District Court to analyze each plaintiffs claims, both with respect to the conditions of confinement experienced by each plaintiff, and the personal involvement of the individual defendants with respect to the claims of each plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">During the relevant period, BCB was a temporary holding facility located at 275 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, New York, that held recently arrested pretrial detainees awaiting arraignment. BCB has since been relocated to a different facility in Brooklyn. The facility at issue in this dispute is no longer used to hold pretrial detainees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">Individual defendant Captain Kenneth Kobetitsch was the commanding officer at BCB through July 2011, and his tenure only overlapped with the detention of plaintiff Glenn.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, beginning on August 29, 2011, individual defendant Captain William Tobin became BCB\u2019s commanding officer, a position he still holds, and his tenure overlapped with the detention of the other plaintiffs. During their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>respective tenures, Captain Kobetitsch and Captain Tobin supervised the officers and the staff at BCB. Captain Kobetitsch and Captain Tobin toured and inspected BCB daily, including its holding cells. Captain Tobin testified that he monitored BCB for \u201ccleanliness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">BCB had eight holding cells, six designated for use by men and two by women. Subordinate officers guarded detainees and also purportedly received \u201ctraining and instructions with respect to, among other things, transferring detainees between cells, ensuring that there [was] an appropriate number of detainees in individual cells, so as to avoid overcrowding, handling and providing food and beverages to detainees, proper sanitation procedures, and the proper method for handling and disposing of human excrement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">On separate dates between July 10, 2011, and July 23, 2013, each plaintiff was arrested and detained in holding cells at BCB.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because BCB is a temporary holding facility, each plaintiff was held in custody at BCB from between ten to twenty-four hours. While detained at BCB during the two-year period, each plaintiff was allegedly subjected to one or more degrading conditions of confinement that purportedly constitute nine types of constitutional deprivations: (1) Overcrowding; (2) Unusable Toilets; (3) Garbage and Inadequate Sanitation; (4) Infestation; (5) Lack of Toiletries and Other Hygienic Items; (6) Inadequate Nutrition; (7) Extreme Temperatures and Poor Ventilation; (8) Deprivation of Sleep; and (9) Crime and Intimidation. The evidence adduced related to each condition, construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, is discussed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">1. Overcrowding. The plaintiffs consistently testified that, for the majority of their respective confinements at BCB, they and other detainees were packed into overcrowded cells designed for, at best, one-half to one-third the actual capacity. For example, one plaintiff testified that his holding cell was so crowded that he could not determine if it had a toilet. Another plaintiff described his cell as \u201chaving no room to even stand\u201d because it was \u201cstuffed ... like a can of sardines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">The plaintiffs testified that, because the cells were so full, there was often only space to stand for hours at a time, and that being forced to stand for hours continuously was painful and degrading. Even when there was space in the cells, the plaintiffs were reluctant to sit or lie down because the floors were filthy. As one plaintiff testified, he only sat down \u201cout of extreme necessity\u201d because he was \u201cexhausted\u201d and \u201cdehydrated.\u201d While cells contained hard benches, there were not nearly enough benches in any given cell to accommodate its numerous occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-15\">2. Unusable Toilets. Each cell at BCB contained, at best, one exposed toilet that lacked a seat, lid, toilet paper, or sufficient privacy partitions to conceal a toilet user from his or her fellow holding mates. One plaintiff, who was too tired to remain standing, testified that he curled up in a fetal position next to the toilet, the only place he could find room to do so in the cell. Some plaintiffs testified that they were kept for stretches in cells that did not have any toilet at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-16\">Captain Tobin testified that, as a general practice, toilets were cleaned and main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>tained regularly. Captain Tobin also swore that \u201c[djetainees are never placed in a cell with a non-functioning toilet\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is always at least one roll of toilet paper provided in each cell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">But the plaintiffs consistently testified that, for any cell that did have a toilet, the toilet rim and bovkl, along with the surrounding floor and walls, were covered with some combination of feces, maggots, urine, vomit, and rotten milk. The toilets were frequently clogged and would overflow, spilling their contents. The smell was horrific, with one plaintiff describing the odor in the cells as \u201coverbearing.\u201d The plaintiffs testified that roaches, mice, and other insects and vermin were commonplace in the area around the toilets.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Under these circumstances, the plaintiffs testified that, to varying degrees and for varying reasons, they found the toilets unusable. Some testified that they had the tolerance to urinate in the toilets, while others could not bring themselves to use the toilets even for urination. Some plaintiffs testified that they did not use the toilet for the eminently practical reason that it was clogged or overflowing, leading those plaintiffs to fear that any overflow would spill into the cell and even land on other detainees standing, sitting, or lying next to the toilet; while others found the toilet and surrounding area simply too sickening and unsanitary to use. As one plaintiff testified, \u201cyou would have to be really out of your mind to use\u201d the toilet.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">One plaintiff testified that he defecated in his pants because he could no longer control his bowels. Another plaintiff testified that he used a toilet to defecate without any toilet paper. That plaintiff was later given an almost depleted roll of toilet paper, which did not have enough paper for him to clean himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Some of the plaintiffs testified that they asked officers to take them to other cells with less filthy toilets, requests the officers almost invariably denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">3. Garbage and Inadequate Sanitation. Given that many of the toilets were clogged and overflowing, the plaintiffs unsurprisingly testified that the holding cells themselves were filthy. The cells had feces and dried urine caked to the floors. The stench from the toilets drifted through the holding cells, and caused one plaintiff to \u201cdry heav[e] ... yellow bile.\u201d The plaintiffs consistently testified that the floors were sticky and covered with garbage and other unsanitary items, such as vomit, dead roaches, decaying apple cores, old milk cartons, and rotting sandwiches. One plaintiff testified that he could not \u201crecall a time [the cells were] sanitary for a human being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">Pursuant to prison policy, the cells did not contain trash cans and detainees were expected to throw their trash on the floor. Captain Tobin swore that BCB\u2019s cells were cleaned by BCB custodial staff three times a day. However, the plaintiffs did not testify to witnessing any BCB staff cleaning or maintaining the cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">4. Infestation. The plaintiffs consistently testified that the holding cells were infested with rats, mice, cockroaches, flies, and other insects and vermin. One plaintiff testified that he saw mice and roaches coming out of a radiator; another testified that he saw water bugs emerging from the toilet and nearby exposed pipes; while another described seeing roaches in the area where the food was stored, and under a sink. Yet another plaintiff testified that he observed roaches climbing on his sneaker. Finally, some plaintiffs testified that they watched as rats and insects crawled into, out-of, and around the boxes where food was stored.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">5. Lack of Toiletries and Other Hygienic Items. The plaintiffs generally tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>tified that they were not provided with basic toiletries, such as soap, tissues, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and toilet paper, and that the officers generally refused to provide these items even when explicitly requested. One plaintiff, who was menstruating at the time of her detention, began \u201cbleeding all over [her]self.\u201d She testified that the officers were dismissive of her repeated requests for sanitary napkins, and that she stopped asking for sanitary napkins only when she heard an officer reprimand another detainee for making similar requests. Likewise, another plaintiff testified that he and his fellow detainees took turns asking the officers for toilet paper. The officers responded by threatening to delay arraignment if the detainees kept \u201charassing [them].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">6. Inadequate Nutrition. The plaintiffs generally found the food and water provisions nutritionally inadequate. The plaintiffs testified that the sandwiches, and much of the other food, were moldy, rotten, stale, or otherwise inedible. Some plaintiffs described seeing vermin and insects crawling in and around the food boxes, which caused those plaintiffs to avoid the food. One plaintiff testified that he saw another detainee receive a sandwich that had rat bite marks in it. Another plaintiff, a practicing Jewish Rabbi, refused to. eat any food because it was not Kosher. When the plaintiff complained to an officer, the officer replied, \u201c[b]eggars can\u2019t be choosy.\u201d Under these circumstances, some of the plaintiffs refused to eat any food at BCB.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Many plaintiffs also testified that they did not trust that the \u201cdrinking water\u201d at BCB was potable because it was only accessible from a grimy cooler on the floor, a filthy fountain, or a dirty sink adjacent to the toilet. Some plaintiffs testified that the water from those sources looked rusty and otherwise foul.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Other plaintiffs testified that they did not have access to any water or food, in any condition, for long periods of time. One plaintiff testified that he asked for water, but that BCB ran out of water. Another plaintiff testified that he did not ask the officers for water or food after he witnessed the officers ridiculing another detainee who had made the same request.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Under these circumstances, many of the plaintiffs refused to drink water and became dehydrated. Some plaintiffs were given milk, but most refused to drink it because it was inexplicably hot. The plaintiffs testified that the officers ignored the plaintiffs\u2019 concerns with respect to the milk and water.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">7. Extreme Temperatures and Poor Ventilation. The holding cells were located in areas of BCB that suffered from poor ventilation, which exacerbated odor problems. In addition, the plaintiffs testified that they were subjected to extreme temperatures depending on the season and the location at BCB \u2014 as such, a plaintiff might experience extreme heat and extreme cold on the same day while moving through BCB. Some plaintiffs testified that they found BCB unbearably hot while others testified that they found it unbearably cold. One plaintiff arrested in January 2012 testified that she removed her socks and shoes due to the \u201cridiculous[ ] heat\u201d even though she found the cells, including the cell floors, disgusting and repulsive.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">8. Deprivation of Sleep. The plaintiffs testified that they generally could not sleep while at BCB for a variety of reasons. The filthy state of the holding cells, coupled with the sheer number of detainees housed in any given cell, made it difficult to find enough room to lie down\u2014 many plaintiffs refused to sit or lie down on the floors at all. While BCB apparently had mats that it would provide detainees upon request, many plaintiffs testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>they were unaware of their availability and, regardless, did not see any provided in the cells. To explain why she did not think to request a mat, one plaintiff mused that, \u201cif [the officers] would not give somebody toilet paper, I didn\u2019t think they\u201d would give us mats. The plaintiffs who were given mats testified that the mats were filthy and, in any event, that there was no room in the cells to lie down on them because of the overcrowding.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">9. Crime and Intimidation. The plaintiffs witnessed other detainees fight each other. Some plaintiffs testified that officers did not monitor the cells to break up altercations. One plaintiff testified that she was kicked, pushed, and verbally abused by other detainees, and that there was no officer nearby to intervene. Another plaintiff testified that he was verbally accosted by two other detainees for about ten hours, but that the officers ignored his requests to be transferred to another cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">(Hi)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The plaintiffs paint a picture of BCB that is alarming and appalling. The plaintiffs testified that they found the conditions at BCB degrading, humiliating, and emotionally scarring. One plaintiff testified: \u201cI was not treated in a humane manner. I believe if I were a dog, and that if the A.S.P.C.A. was brought in and there was a dog in that cell, that the police officers, whoever were responsible for the treatment of that dog in that cell, that they would be brought up on charges.\u201d Another plaintiff had an anxiety attack that required hospitalization, which he explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3O\">[SJtarted because of the deplorable conditions. I tried holding my bowel for about four hours. I wasn\u2019t able to use the bathroom or any form of the bathroom and I found it very hard to breathe. My chest was very heavy and I tried to alert the guard. One guard just walked by and when they were letting in more people I told the guard I have to go to the hospital. I\u2019m having chest pains and it was maybe 30 minutes after that they took me to the medical cell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Another plaintiff testified that the experience \u201cstay[ed]\u201d with him, explaining that it was something that was difficult to forget.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">However, the plaintiffs did not generally testify that they suffered serious long term physical injuries or illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">The plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on June 26, 2013, which they amended on August 7, 2013, and again on September 12, 2013. The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion the District Court denied in an Opinion and Order dated September 12, 2014. See Cano v. City of New York, 44 F.Supp.3d 324 (E.D.N.Y. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">Although not the subject of the current appeal, this prior opinion by the District Court provides helpful background. In that opinion, the District Court noted that the defendants had argued for a nearly <em>\u201cper se </em>rule that no matter the conditions, if a' detainee is only exposed to them for less than twenty-four hours, there can be no objective constitutional violation.\u201d Id. at 333. The District Court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument, reasoning that even temporary deprivations could be objectively unconstitutional so long as those conditions were sufficiently serious. See id. The District Court accordingly held that the plaintiffs had \u201cplausibly alleged that the conditions of confinement at BCB deprived them of the minimal civilized measures of life\u2019s necessities and subjected them to unreasonable health and safety risks.\u201d Id. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>(citing Walker v. Schult, 717 F.3d 119, 126 (2d Cir. 2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In addition, relying on this Court\u2019s decision in Caiozzo v. Koreman, 581 F.3d 63, 70 (2d Cir. 2009), the District Court concluded that, to state a claim for unconstitutional conditions of confinement, the plaintiffs were required to allege that the individual defendants had acted with deliberate indifference in a subjective sense, namely that the defendants knew and disregarded excessive risks to the plaintiffs\u2019 health and safety. Cano, 44 F.Supp.3d at 332-34. The District Court held that the plaintiffs had met this threshold, ruling that it was plausible that the individual defendants were aware of the challenged conditions based on, among other things, \u201ctheir own observations ... external reports and complaints; complaints filed by detainees; reports by the media; and prior lawsuits.\u201d Id. at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The District Court also held that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged punitive intent and personal involvement by the individual defendants. See id. at 334-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">At the close of extensive discovery\u2014 which included, among other things, the often uncontroverted deposition testimony of each plaintiff \u2014 the defendants moved for summary judgment, which the District Court granted in an Opinion and Order dated August 13, 2015. Cano v. City of New York, 119 F.Supp.3d 65 (E.D.N.Y. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">The District Court began by stating that it would describe the facts of the case \u201cin the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the non-moving party.\u201d Id. at 70 (citation omitted). However, the District Court never described the evidence of the conditions that each individual plaintiff faced. Instead, the District Court summarized the case by quoting allegations from the Second Amended Complaint before proceeding to its discussion of the case. See id. at 70-71. The District Court ultimately held that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment for several reasons. Id. at 72-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">First, the District Court found that no jury could conclude that any of the evidence of the challenged conditions of confinement, \u201ceither taken in the aggregate or taken as a whole,\u201d objectively deprived any of the plaintiffs of their due process rights. Id. at 81. In contrast to the state of law described in its opinion denying the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the District Court concluded that, \u201c[t]he Second Circuit and her constituent District Courts have routinely held that occasional and temporary deprivations of sanitary and temperate conditions, <em>without more, </em>do not constitute a sufficiently serious deprivation under the Eighth Amendment to constitute punishment.\u201d Id. at 74. Accordingly, the District Court held that, \u201cwhile certain conditions may have been uncomfortable for Plaintiffs, the evidence fails to establish any Plaintiff was <em>regularly </em>denied his or her basic human needs or was exposed to conditions that posed an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his or her future health.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). In particular, the District Court reasoned that no plaintiff could establish an objective constitutional deprivation because no plaintiff could link any condition of confinement to any actual serious injury, and because the period of confinement did not exceed twenty-four hours for any plaintiff. See, e.g., id. (\u201cPlaintiffs fail to show any of them were subjected to overcrowding for an extended period of time and further fail to establish any of them were injured in any way from the overcrowding.\u201d); id. at 82 (\u201cMost Plaintiffs did not seek any sort of medical treatment and none of the Plaintiffs provide evidence of haying suffered any long term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>physical or emotional harm due to time spent in the BOB.\u201d); see also id. at 74-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Second, the District Court concluded that no reasonable jury could find that the plaintiffs had satisfied the subjective prong of a deliberate indifference claim, namely that the officers knew about conditions that posed excessive risks to the plaintiffs\u2019 safety and health. The Court found that the evidence for the individual defendants \u2014 especially BCB\u2019s log book entries, which documented sporadic cleaning and maintenance efforts, and Captain Tobin\u2019s deposition testimony \u2014 established that the individual defendants had reasonable practices in place to ensure that the officers under their supervision acted reasonably in response to any risks. Id. at 84-85. The District Court found that the individual defendants had acted with, at most, mere negligence. Id. at 84. Moreover, the District Court found that none of the individual defendants could have known about the allegedly unconstitutional conditions because there was no evidence that the subordinate officers who actually guarded the detainees informed the individual defendants of any of the challenged conditions, which were not unconstitutional in any event. See id. at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Third, for substantially the same reasons, the District Court concluded that there was no triable issue of fact as to whether any individual defendant had acted with punitive intent. See M at 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Finally, because the plaintiffs had failed to establish a triable issue of fact that any of them had suffered an objective deprivation (and therefore failed to establish an underlying constitutional violation), the District Court concluded that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity, and that the plaintiffs could not prove that the City had any Monell liability. See id. at 86-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">On August 14, 2015, the District Court entered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 Second Amended Complaint. On August 28, 2015, this Court issued its decision in Willey. On the same day, the plaintiffs informed the District Court of their intention to move for reconsideration based on Willey, and the District Court later set a briefing schedule whereby the motion for reconsideration would be fully briefed by October 23, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">On September 11, 2015, the plaintiffs timely filed a Notice of Appeal challenging the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Later that day, the plaintiffs filed with the District Court their motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rules 59(e) and 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Local Rule 6.3(e) of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On the same day, in a minute order (the \u201cFirst Minute Order\u201d), the District Court denied the motion for reconsideration, stating that the appeal divested it of jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">The plaintiffs promptly moved for reconsideration of the First Minute Order, arguing that, pursuant to Rule 4(a)(4)(B)\u00ae of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the appeal did not divest the District Court of jurisdiction to reconsider the judgment. On September 12, 2015, in another minute order (the \u201cSecond Minute Order\u201d), the District Court denied without elaboration the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration of the First Minute Order. On October 5, 2015, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Notice of Appeal challenging, in addition to the grant of summary judgment, the First and Second Minute Orders.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">A pretrial detainee\u2019s claims of unconstitutional conditions of confinement are governed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, rather than the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eight Amendment. Benjamin v. Fraser, 343 F.3d 35, 49 (2d Cir. 2003), overruled on other grounds by Caiozzo v. Koreman, 581 F.3d 63, 70 (2d Cir. 2009); see also City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 244, 103 S.Ct. 2979, 77 L.Ed.2d 605 (1983). A pretrial detainee\u2019s claims are evaluated under the Due Process Clause because, \u201c[p]retrial detainees have not been convicted of a crime and thus \u2018may not be punished in any manner \u2014 neither cruelly and unusually nor otherwise.\u2019 \u201d Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 168 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Benjamin, 343 F.3d at 49-50), rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom., Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). A detainee\u2019s rights are \u201cat least as great as the Eighth Amendment protections available to a convicted prisoner.\u201d City of Revere, 463 U.S. at 244, 103 S.Ct. 2979.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">A pretrial detainee may establish a \u00a7 1983 claim for allegedly unconstitutional conditions of confinement by showing that the officers acted with deliberate indifference to the challenged conditions. See Benjamin, 343 F.3d at 50. This means that a pretrial detainee must satisfy two prongs to prove a claim, an \u201cobjective prong\u201d showing that the challenged conditions were sufficiently serious to constitute objective deprivations of the right to due process, and a \u201csubjective prong\u201d \u2014 perhaps better classified as a <em>\u201cmens rea </em>prong\u201d or \u201cmental element prong\u201d \u2014 showing that the officer acted with at least deliberate indifference to the challenged conditions. The reason that the term \u201csubjective prong\u201d might be a misleading description is that, as discussed below, the Supreme Court has instructed that \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d roughly means \u201crecklessness,\u201d but \u201crecklessness\u201d can be defined subjectively (what a person actually knew, and disregarded), or objectively (what a reasonable person knew, or should have known). See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 836-37, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in Caiozzo v. Koreman, 581 F.3d 63, 72 (2d Cir. 2009), the District Court concluded that the elements for establishing deliberate indifference under the Fourteenth Amendment were the same as under the Eighth Amendment. Cano, 119 F.Supp.3d at 72 (citing Caiozzo, 581 F.3d at 72). Therefore, the District Court required the plaintiffs to prove that, \u201c(1) objectively, the deprivation the [detainee] suffered was \u2018sufficiently serious that he was denied the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities,\u2019 and (2) subjectively, the defendant official acted with \u2018a sufficiently culpable state of mind ..., such as deliberate indifference to [detainee] health or safety.\u2019 \u201d Id at 73 (quoting Walker, 717 F.3d at 125).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>In applying this test, the District Court erred in two respects. First, the District Court misapplied this Court\u2019s precedents in assessing whether the plaintiffs had established an objectively serious deprivation. Second, we conclude that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kingsley altered the standard for deliberate indifference claims under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Under both the Eighth and \u2022 Fourteenth Amendments, to establish an objective deprivation, \u201cthe inmate must show that the conditions, either alone or in combination, pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his health,\u201d Walker, 717 F.3d at 125, which includes the risk of serious damage to \u201cphysical and mental soundness,\u201d LaReau v. MacDougall, 473 F.2d 974, 978 (2d Cir. 1972). There is no \u201cstatic test\u201d to determine whether a deprivation is sufficiently serious; instead, \u201cthe conditions themselves must be evaluated in light of contemporary standards of decency.\u201d Blissett v. Coughlin, 66 F.3d 531, 537 (2d Cir. 1995) (citing Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 346, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981)). For example, \u201c[w]e have held that prisoners may not be deprived of their basic human <em>needs </em>\u2014 e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care,'and reasonable safety \u2014 and they may not be exposed to conditions that pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to [their] future health.\u201d Jabbar v. Fischer, 683 F.3d 54, 57 (2d Cir. 2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u201c[CJonditions of confinement may be aggregated to rise to the level of a constitutional violation, but \u2018only when they have a mutually enforcing effect that produces the deprivation of a single, identifiable human need such as food, warmth, or exercise.\u2019\u201d Walker, 717 F.3d at 125 (quoting Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 304, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991)). Unsanitary conditions, especially when coupled with other mutually enforcing conditions, such as poor ventilation and lack of hygienic items (in particular, toilet paper), can rise to the level of an objective deprivation. See id. at 127-28 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">In Willey v. Kirkpatrick, 801 F.3d 51, 68 (2d Cir. 2015), this Court recently reiterated that the proper lens through which to analyze allegedly unconstitutional unsanitary conditions of confinement is with reference to their- severity and duration, not the detainee\u2019s resulting injury. In Willey, a convicted prisoner brought, among other claims, a claim under the Eighth Amendment against officers at a prison who allegedly exposed him to unsanitary conditions by confining him alone in a cell with little airflow, and then incapacitating his toilet for a period of* at a minimum, seven days \u201cso that he was reduced to breathing a miasma of his own waste.\u201d Id at 55. In addition, on two separate occasions (during one of which the prisoner was kept naked), the officers confined the prisoner to an observation cell smeared with feces and urine. See id. at 55, 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">In reinstating the prisoner\u2019s claim, Wil-ley reviewed Second Circuit case law involving exposure to unsanitary conditions, and, consistent with this Court\u2019s precedents, made clear that unsanitary conditions of confinement must be assessed according to two components, severity and duration, on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id at 66-68 (citing Gaston v. Coughlin, 249 F.3d 156 (2d Cir. 2001); LaReau v. MacDougall, 473 F.2d 974 (2d Cir. 1972)). While Willey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>acknowledged that \u201cthere are many exposures of inmates to unsanitary conditions that do not amount to a constitutional violation,\u201d the Court rejected a \u201cbright-line durational requirement for a viable unsanitary-conditions claim\u201d or a \u201cminimal level of grotesquerie required\u201d before such a claim could be brought. Id, at 68. As this Court explained, \u201c[t]he severity of an exposure may be less quantifiable than its duration, but its qualitative offense to a prisoner\u2019s dignity should be given due consideration.\u201d Id. Finally, the Court noted that \u201cserious injury is unequivocally not a necessary element of an Eighth Amendment claim,\u201d although \u201cthe seriousness of the harms suffered is relevant to calculating damages and may shed light'on the severity of an exposure.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Willey also reinstated the prisoner\u2019s claim based on the provision of nutritionally inadequate food, concluding that the prisoner\u2019s allegations that he was usually served stale bread and rotten cabbage for one week were sufficient to allege an objective deprivation. Id at 69. This Court again rejected the imposition of bright-line limits on inadequate nutrition claims, noting that the prisoner\u2019s \u201cclaim is not that all restricted diets are unconstitutional, but that.... <em>his </em>restricted diet was unusually unhealthy.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Some of the challenged conditions in this case, such as inadequate nutrition, and unsanitary conditions \u2014 including inoperable toilets and filthy cells \u2014 are clearly, covered by Willey. Other conditions at issue, such as overcrowding, do not necessarily fall under Willey\u2019s express ambit. However, Willey was not breaking new ground, but rather reaffirming the law in this Circuit, and its reasoning applies to the other challenged conditions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">While the claims before the Court in Willey related to unsanitary conditions and inadequate nutrition, this Court has been reluctant to impose bright-line durational or severity limits in conditions of confinement cases, and has never imposed a requirement that pretrial detainees show that they actually suffered from serious injuries. See Walker, 717 F.3d at 129 (distinguishing Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981), by reasoning that the Supreme Court did not hold, as a matter of law, that the provision of a cell sufficient to afford a pretrial detainee thirty-one square feet of space could not be an unconstitutional deprivation of living space). Even in the rare case where the Court has imposed bright-line limits, those limits have been flexible and dependent upon the circumstances. See Jabbar, 683 F.3d at 57 (\u201cWe hold that the failure of prison officials to provide inmates with seatbelts on prison transport buses does not, <em>standing alone, </em>violate the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Bright-line limits are generally incompatible with Fourteenth Amendment teaching that there is no \u201cstatic\u201d definition of a deprivation, see Blissett, 66 F.3d at 537 (citing Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 346, 101 S.Ct. 2392), and the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that any condition of confinement can mutually enforce another, so long as those conditions lead to the same deprivation, see Wilson, 501 U.S. at 304, 111 S.Ct. 2321; see also Walker, 717 F.3d at 127-28. The latter point is implicit in Willey, 801 F.3d at 68, which found that conditions that would normally have nothing to do with sanitation (for example, poor air circulation or being kept naked) can exacerbate the harmful effects of unsanitary conditions. Accordingly, this Court has repeatedly reiterated that conditions of confinement cases involve fact-intensive inquiries. See, e.g., Willey, 801 F.3d at 68-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">The standards for evaluating objective deprivations, as articulated in Willey, thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>extend to each of the nine challenged conditions of confinement at issue in this case \u2014 (1) Overcrowding; (2) Unusable Toilets; (3) Garbage and Inadequate Sanitation; (4) Infestation; (5) Lack of Toiletries and Other Hygienic Items; (6) Inadequate Nutrition; (7) Extreme Temperatures and Poor Ventilation; (8) Deprivation of Sleep; and (9) Crime and Intimidation \u2014 regardless of whether those conditions relate to a deprivation involving sanitation or inadequate nutrition. Each of these conditions must' be measured by its severity and duration, not the resulting injury, and none of these conditions is subject to a bright-line durational or severity threshold. Moreover, the conditions must be analyzed in combination, not in isolation, at least where one alleged deprivation has a bearing on another. See Wilson, 501 U.S. at 304, 111 S.Ct. 2321 (noting the synergy between cold temperatures and the failure to provide blankets in establishing an Eighth Amendment violation). An overcrowded cell, for example, may exacerbate the effect of unsanitary conditions. Similarly, poor ventilation may be particularly harmful when combined with an overflowing toilet. Inadequate nutrition may be compounded by infestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The second element of a conditions of confinement claim brought under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the defendant\u2019s \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to any objectively serious condition of confinement. Courts have traditionally referred to this second element as the \u201csubjective prong.\u201d But \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d which is roughly synonymous with \u201crecklessness,\u201d can be defined either \u201csubjectively\u201d in a criminal sense, or \u201cobjectively\u201d in a civil sense. As such, the \u201csubjective- prong\u201d might better be described as the <em>\u201cmens rea </em>prong\u201d or \u201cmental element prong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Just over two decades ago, in Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), the Supreme Court addressed the meaning of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d in the context of a convicted prisoner\u2019s deliberate indifference to conditions of confinement claim brought under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment. The Supreme Court concluded that deliberate indifference is properly equated with the <em>mens rea </em>of \u201crecklessness.\u201d Id. at 836, 114 S.Ct. 1970. However, the Court observed that recklessness is not completely self-defining. See id. The Court noted that recklessness could be defined according to an objective standard akin to that used in the civil context, which would not require proof of an official\u2019s actual awareness of the harms associated with the challenged conditions, or according to a more exacting subjective standard akin to that used in the criminal context, which would require proof of such subjective awareness. See id. at 836-37, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The Supreme Court in Farmer rejected the application of an objective standard for deliberate indifference as inappropriate under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, holding that an official \u201ccannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\u201d Id. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970. The Supreme Court based its holding on a close reading of the text of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, which \u201coutlaws cruel and unusual \u2018punishments,\u2019 \u201d not \u201ccruel and unusual \u2018conditions.\u2019\u201d Id. According to the Supreme Court, \u201cpunish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ment\u201d connotes a subjective intent on the part of the official, which also requires awareness of the punishing act or omission. See id. at 836-37, 114 S.Ct. 1970. As the Court stated, \u201can official\u2019s failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while no cause for commendation, cannot under our cases be condemned as the infliction of punishment.\u201d Id. at 838, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Farmer did not address deliberate indifference for pretrial detainees under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Following Farmer, this Court seven years ago in Caiozzo, 581 F.3d at 66, discerned two lines of Fourteenth Amendment deliberate indifference authority in this Circuit: one that applied an objective standard and another that applied a subjective standard. Caiozzo resolved the in-tra-circuit divergence, holding that the same subjective standard for deliberate indifference claims under the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause should apply to deliberate indifference claims under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which the Court reasoned was \u201ca logical extension of the principles recognized in Farmer.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id. at 71. This Court explained that this Court\u2019s jurisprudence for claims brought under the Eighth Amendment had generally mirrored this Court\u2019s jurisprudence for claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. See id. (citing Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 106 (2d Cir. 2000)). Relying on the analysis of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Hare v. City of Corinth, Mississippi, 74 F.3d 633 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc), this Court highlighted that the Supreme Court had given no indication that pretrial detainees should be treated differently from their post-conviction counterparts. See Caiozzo, 581 F.3d at 71-72 (quoting Hare, 74 F.3d at 649). This Court also noted that the majority of the other Courts of Appeals had reached a similar conclusion. See id. at 71 n.4 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kingsley v. Hendrickson, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2466, 192 L.Ed.2d 416 (2015) \u2014 in which the Supreme Court concluded that excessive force claims brought under the Fourteenth Amendment do not require the same subjective intent standard as excessive force claims brought under the Eighth Amendment \u2014 has undercut the reasoning in Caiozzo.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The issue before the Supreme Court in Kingsley was whether \u201cto prove an excessive force claim [under the Fourteenth Amendment], a pretrial detainee must show that the officers were <em>subjectively </em>aware that their use of force was unreasonable, or only that the officers\u2019 use of that force was <em>objectively </em>unreasonable.\u201d Kingsley, 135 S.Ct. at 2470 (emphasis added). Kingsley involved a pretrial detainee\u2019s allegations that prison officers, who had undisputedly deliberately used force against the detainee (by using a Ta-ser to incapacitate him), had, in doing so, acted with excessive force. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Regarding the requisite <em>mens rea </em>for the officer\u2019s use of force against the detainee, the Court held \u201cthat a pretrial detainee must show only that the force purposely or knowingly used against him was objectively unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id at 2472-73. The Court observed that, \u201c[t]hus, the defendant\u2019s state of mind is not a matter that a plaintiff is required to prove.\u201d Id. at 2472.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The Court reasoned that its interpretation of excessive force claims under the Due Process Clause was consistent with its prior precedents, including Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), where the Court had held that a pretrial detainee can prevail on a claim brought under the Fourteenth Amendment challenging \u201ca variety of prison conditions, including a prison\u2019s practice of double-bunking\u201d solely by proffering objective evidence to show that the conditions were not reasonably related to a legitimate, nonpunitive governmental purpose. Kingsley, 135 S.Ct. at 2473 (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 541-43, 99 S.Ct. 1861). The Court found that the focus of Bell and its progeny on punishment \u201cdoes not mean that proof of intent (or motive) to punish is required for a pretrial detainee to prevail on a claim that his due process rights were violated\u201d or that the \u201capplication of Bell\u2019s objective standard should involve subjective considerations.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id. at 2473-74 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The Court also concluded that Eighth Amendment excessive force jurisprudence did not control the standard for excessive force claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. See id. at 2475 (finding that Eighth Amendment cases \u201care relevant here only insofar as they address the practical importance of taking into account the legitimate safety-related concerns of those who run jails\u201d). The Court stressed the different functions of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">The language of the two Clauses differs, and the nature of the claims often differs. And, most importantly, pretrial detainees (unlike convicted prisoners) cannot be punished at all, much less \u201cmaliciously and sadistically.\u201d Thus, there is no need here, as there might be in an Eighth Amendment case, to determine when punishment is unconstitutional. Id. (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in Kingsley, there is no basis for the reasoning in Caiozzo that the subjective intent requirement for deliberate in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>difference claims under the Eighth Amendment, as articulated in Farmer, must apply to deliberate indifference claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. Caiozzo is thus overruled to the extent that it determined that the standard for deliberate indifference is the same under the Fourteenth Amendment as it is under the Eighth Amendment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Farmer is clear that \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d can be viewed either subjectively or objectively. In the context of a convicted prisoner asserting a violation of an Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishments, the Supreme Court in Farmer defined deliberate indifference subjectively, meaning that a prison official must appreciate the risk to which a prisoner was subjected. The conditions of confinement were a form of punishment,. and, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, the prison official had to have subjective awareness of the harmfulness associated with those conditions to be liable for meting out that punishment.'</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">After Kingsley, it is plain that punishment has no place in defining the <em>mens rea </em>element of a pretrial detainee\u2019s claim under the Due Process Clause. Unlike a violation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, an official.can violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment without meting out any punishment, which means that the Due Process Clause can be violated when an official does not have subjective awareness that the official\u2019s acts (or omissions) have subjected the pretrial detainee to a substantial risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Kingsley held that an officer\u2019s appreciation of the officer\u2019s application of excessive force against a pretrial detainee in violation of the detainee\u2019s due process rights should be viewed objectively. The same objective analysis should apply to an officer\u2019s appreciation of the risks associated with an unlawful condition of confinement in a claim for deliberate indifference under the Fourteenth Amendment. A pretrial detainee may not be punished at all under the Fourteenth Amendment, whether through the use of excessive force, by deliberate indifference to conditions of confinement, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Therefore, to establish a claim for deliberate indifference to conditions of confinement under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the pretrial detainee must prove that the defendant-official acted intentionally to impose the alleged condition, or recklessly failed to act with reasonable care to mitigate the risk that the condition posed to the pretrial detainee even though the defendant-official knew, or should have known, that the condition posed an excessive risk to health or safety. In other words, the \u201csubjective prong\u201d (or <em>\u201cmens rea </em>prong\u201d) of a deliberate indifference claim is defined objectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">In concluding that deliberate indifference should be defined objectively for a claim of a due process violation, we join the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which, sitting <em>en banc </em>in Castro v. County of Los Angeles, 833 F.3d 1060, 1070 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc), cert. denied, No. 16-655, \u2014 U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 831, 197 L.Ed.2d 69, 2017 WL 276190 (U.S. Jan. 23, 2017), likewise interpreted Kingsley as standing for the proposition that deliberate indifference for due process purposes should be measured by an objective standard.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals for the Ninth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Circuit concluded that Kingsley\u2019s broad reasoning extends beyond the excessive force context in which it arose.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See kL at 1069 (\u201cThe underlying federal right, as well as the nature of the harm suffered, is the same for pretrial detainees\u2019 excessive force and failure-to-protect claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The defendants argue that using an objective standard to measure deliberate indifference \u2014 a similar standard to the one used before Caiozzo, see, e.g., Benjamin, 343 F.3d at 51; Liscio v. Warren, 901 F.2d 274; 276 (2d Cir. 1990), overruled by Caiozzo, 581 F.3d at 71 \u2014 risks that officials that act with mere negligence will be held liable for constitutional violations. But any \u00a7 1983 claim for a violation of due process requires proof of a <em>mens rea </em>greater than mere negligence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See Kingsley, 135 S.Ct. at 2472 (\u201c[LJiability for <em>negligently </em>inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.\u201d (citation omitted)). A detainee must prove that an official acted intentionally or recklessly, and not merely negligently. Indeed, pre-Caiozzo case law that applied an objective standard was clear that officials could not be found liable for negligent conduct. See, e.g., Liscio, 901 F.2d at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The defendants also argue that the return to an objective definition of deliberate indifference will open the flood-gates to litigation. The argument is unpersuasive. Prior to Caiozzo, some courts in this Circuit applied an objective standard for deliberate indifference. Caiozzo chose to apply a subjective standard to deliberate indifference because this Court thought that it was more consistent with Farmer, not because of any concerns that an objective standard would prompt the filing of non-meritorious claims. Consistency with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kingsley now dictates that deliberate indifference be measured objectively in due process cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">The District Court erroneously granted summary judgment for the defendants on the basis that no jury could find that the nine challenged conditions of confinement in this case, considered together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>or separately, amounted to an objective constitutional deprivation because no plaintiff could establish a regular deprivation lasting more than twenty-four hours, or an actual serious injury or sickness. However, the plaintiffs have adduced substantial evidence, much of it uncontroverted, that they were subjected to appalling conditions of confinement to varying degrees and for various time periods. While we recognize that the District Court did not have the benefit of this Court\u2019s guidance in Willey, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims should not have been dismissed on the grounds that the conditions in this case did not exceed ten to twenty-four hours, or result in serious injury-</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The District Court repeatedly stressed that the plaintiffs were not <em>regularly </em>denied humane conditions of confinement: \u201cPlaintiffs only complain of such issues for a short period of time \u2014 an average of ten to twenty-four hours \u2014 with nothing more.\u201d Cano, 119 F.Supp.3d at 73; see also, e.g., id. at 75 (\u201c[T]he uncontroverted evidence establishes that no Plaintiff was <em>regularly </em>deprived access to a toilet.\u201d); M at 77 (\u201cHere, not a single Plaintiff was exposed to urine, feces, and/or vomit for anything more than a limited period of time because no Plaintiff was held at BCB for more than one twenty-four hour period.\u201d); id. at 79 (\u201c[Tjhere is no evidence that a single Plaintiff was <em>regularly </em>denied any such toiletry during his or her stay at BCB....\u201d). The District Court essentially ruled that no set of conditions, no matter how egregious, could state a due process violation if the conditions existed for no more than ten to twenty-four hours. This was error. Willey, 801 F.3d at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The District Court also repeatedly stressed the lack of any actual serious injury or illness in the case. See, e.g., Cano, 119 F.Supp.3d at 82 (\u201cMost Plaintiffs did not seek any sort of medical treatment and none of the Plaintiffs provide evidence of having suffered any long term physical or emotional harm due to time spent in the BCB.\u201d). In Willey, 801 F.3d at 68, this Court rejected the argument that a plaintiff must prove a serious injury in order to establish a constitutional violation due to inhumane conditions of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The defendants argue that the District Court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed based on an assessment of the severity and duration of the conditions at issue. They argue that Willey supports their position given its admittedly more extreme facts. They contend that those are the types of facts that constitute an objective deprivation. They further contend that no plaintiff in this case actually suffered a long term, grievous physical or emotional injury, a not-so-subtle attempt to bring the standard full circle back to evaluating objective deprivation by injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Ultimately, the defendants\u2019 theory appears to be that state officials are free to set a system in place whereby they can subject pretrial detainees awaiting arraignment to absolutely atrocious conditions for twenty-four hour periods (and perhaps more) without violating the Constitution so long as nothing actually catastrophic happens during those periods. That is not the law. As the District Court aptly stated in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, \u201c[o]ur Constitution and societal standards require more, even for incarcerated individuals, and especially for pretrial detainees who cannot be punished by the state.\u201d Cano, 44 F.Supp.3d at 333. This Court\u2019s cases are clear that conditions of confinement cases must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to severity and duration, and instructs that a pretrial detainee\u2019s rights are at least as great as those of a convicted prisoner. Based on the record, the gradation between the condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>tions of confinement at issue in this case, and those at issue in Willey, may speak to damages, not the absence of an objective constitutional deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In addition, the District Court granted summary judgment to the individual defendants because it concluded that the plaintiffs could not establish that the individual defendants had acted with subjective deliberate indifference, as opposed to objective deliberate indifference. The District Court neither analyzed Kingsley, nor had the benefit of our interpretation of Kingsley as set forth in this opinion, which inures to the benefit of the plaintiffs. The defendants argue that the judgment should nevertheless be affirmed based on the standard for deliberate indifference articulated here. The defendants\u2019 argument should be addressed in the first instance by the District Court. The purported deliberate indifference of the individual defendants must be assessed on an individualized basis with respect to each plaintiff.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The District Court also erred in its application of the well-settled standards for deciding a motion for summary judgment. The District Court did not construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, nor did it draw all reasonable inferences in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"ABg3\">For example, the District Court justified the rejection of the plaintiffs\u2019 inadequate nutrition claims in part by noting that plaintiff Vikki had \u201cclaimed that BCB served \u201cwonderful cheese and bologna sandwiches.\u2019 \u201d Cano, 119 F.Supp.3d at 80. Although not reflected in the District Court\u2019s opinion, plaintiff Vikki later clarified in her deposition that she did not eat the sandwiches \u201c[bjecause the cheese was dry, the bread was dry, and [she] wouldn\u2019t feed it to [her] dog.\u201d Construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, plaintiff Vikki\u2019s comment about \u201cwonderful\u201d sandwiches was sarcastic.</p>\n<p id=\"A-Q\">In another example, the District Court noted that plaintiff Guarino had asked for a sanitary napkin to clean herself because she was menstruating and \u201cbleeding all over [her]self,\u201d but the District Court indicated that there was no proof that \u201cany officer at BCB acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.\u201d Id. at 84. This ignored plaintiff Guarino\u2019s testimony that, after repeatedly- asking for a sanitary napkin, she only desisted because she observed an officer threaten another detainee with delayed arraignment if that detainee made any additional requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">Moreover, the District Court discounted as a mere matter of preference the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony that toilets were unusable, reasoning that the plaintiffs were not \u201cdenied access\u201d to toilets. Id. at 75-76. That frames the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony far too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>narrowly. The plaintiffs testimony was that the toilets (if there were any toilet in the particular cell) could not be used for bowel ' movements because the toilets lacked privacy, and because the toilets were not kept in such a way that they could reasonably be used. The plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that the toilets were maintained by deliberately indifferent officers in such a manner that they were unusable. It is not a reasonable inference that the plaintiffs merely decided not to use the toilets, especially when one plaintiff defecated in his pants, another defecated without toilet paper, and a third had an anxiety attack that required hospitalization because he was \u201cholding [his] bowel for about four hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Contrary to the District Court\u2019s ruling that the individual defendants \u201cestablish[ed] [that] they responded reasonably to any risk that existed,\u201d see id. at 83-85, the evidence about regularly scheduled cleanings and pest control visits, at best, established that there are genuine disputes as to material facts concerning the handling of sanitation issues at BCB. The fact of thrice daily visits by cleaning crews, even if undisputed, would not eliminate the force of the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony that the cleaning crews did not do what was needed to clean the cells, or remedy the non-functioning toilets.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">The District Court also granted summary judgment for the defendants on the grounds that the plaintiffs could not establish a claim based on punitive intent; that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity; and that the plaintiffs could not establish that the City had Mo-nell liability. In light of the foregoing rulings, we vacate these rulings as well, although we do not decide how those issues should be decided using the proper standards, including the standards for a due process claim for.deliberate indifference to the conditions of confinement described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 punitive intent theory, the District Court should reconsider the dismissal of that theory in light of the evidence of 'the objectively serious conditions of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">With respect to qualified immunity and Monell liability, the District Court based its rulings solely on its finding that no plaintiff could establish an objective due process deprivation. Because we disagree with that conclusion, we vacate the qualified immunity and Monell liability rulings, and remand those issues for further consideration in light of this opinion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See, e.g., Jova v. Smith, 582 F.3d 410, 418 n.4 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (remanding the issue of qualified immunity where the district court did not consider the question in the first instance).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">For the Teasons explained above, the judgment is AFFIRMED in part, and VACATED in part, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-10\">. The plaintiffs are Kevin Darnell, Germain Cano, Michael Glenn, Michael McGhee, Kerry Scott, Travis Gordan, Gregory Maugeri, Dmi-triy Miloslavskiy, Steven Modes, Jacqueline Guarino, Michael Spalango, Wesley Jones, Raymond Tucker, Yvonne Ming, Nancy Vi-glione, Keith Jennings, Elli Vikki, Eric Ce-phus, Phillip Singleton, and Deborah Gonzalez. Three additional plaintiffs initially brought claims against the defendants, but, prior to this appeal, two voluntarily dismissed their claims without prejudice, and one passed away.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ASq\">. The John Doe defendants named in the original complaint are no longer parties to this action because the plaintiffs did not pursue claims against them in the amended complaints. During the proceedings before the District Court, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed with prejudice the claims against former NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly.

The judgment dismissing the claims against Mr. Pineiro is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-9\">. This case implicates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it involves state pretrial detainees who are seeking to vindicate their constitutional rights. See, e.g., Benjamin v.

However, the analysis in this decision should be equally applicable to claims brought by federal pretrial detainees pursuant to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See Malinski v. New York, 324 U.S. 401, 415, 65 S.Ct. 781, 89 L.Ed. 1029 (1945) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (\"To suppose that 'due process of law' meant one thing in the Fifth Amendment and another in the Fourteenth is too frivolous to require elaborate rejection.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b68-10\">.

By letter dated September 22, 2016, the plaintiffs abandoned their claims against Captain Kobetitsch, except as to plaintiff Glenn, because Captain Kobetitsch was the commanding officer of BCB only at the time plaintiff Glenn was detained there.

With the exception of plaintiffs Spalango and Tucker, who were each detained at BCB on March 13, 2013, and plaintiffs Jennings and' Singleton, who were each detained at BCB on July 23, 2013, the plaintiffs' confinements at BCB did not overlap with each other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">.

Those Orders do not raise any substantial issues that affect the disposition of this appeal. To the extent that the plaintiffs' Notice of Appeal divested the District Court of its jurisdiction to hear the post-judgment motions, Rule 62.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits district courts to issue \"indicative rulings\u201d to appellate courts when \"a timely motion is made for relief that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending.\u201d Fed.

The Supreme Court in Kingsley framed its analysis by observing that excessive force cases involve \"two separate state-of-mind questions. The first concerns the defendant\u2019s state of mind with respect to his physical acts \u2014 -i.e., his state of mind with respect to the bringing about of certain physical consequences in the world.

The Court did not address the first question because it was undisputed that the officers had deliberately used force against the detainee by purposefully and knowingly using the Taser on the detainee, although the Court left open the possibility that the mental state of recklessness might suffice for the first state-of-mind question as well.

A pretrial detainee can establish a due process claim for inhumane conditions of confinement either by proving an official\u2019s deliberate indifference to those conditions, or by proving that that those conditions are punitive. See Benjamin, 343 F.3d at 50. Kingsley and its precedents are clear that the two theories of liability are distinct. Nothing about our interpretation of the proper standard for deliberate indifference for due process purposes should be construed as affecting the standards for establishing liability based on a claim that challenged conditions are punitive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">.

The defendants cite several decisions by other Courts of Appeals that have continued to apply a subjective standard to deliberate indifference claims for pretrial detainees after Kingsley. But none of those cases considered whether Kingsley had altered the standard for deliberate indifference for pretrial detainees. See, e.g., Brown v. Chapman, 814 F.3d 447 (6th Cir. 2016); Moore v, Diggins, 633 Fed.Appx. 672 (10th Cir. 2015) (summary opinion); Mason v. Lafayette City-Par. Consol. Gov't, 806 F.3d 268 (5th Cir. 2015); Smith v. Dart, 803 F.3d 304, 310 n.2 (7th Cir. 2015) (noting, in light of Kingsley, that the parties argued the state of mind element but that \"it is not at issue in this appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b82-13\">. The reckless or intentional action (or inaction) required to sustain a \u00a7 1983 deliberate indifference claim must be the product of a voluntary act (or omission) by the official.

The defendants also argue on appeal that the plaintiffs have failed to establish that the individual defendants had any personal involvement in any of the challenged conditions of confinement. As counsel for the defendants conceded at oral argument, although the defendants raised the personal involvement argument on their motion to dismiss, they did not renew the argument in their motion for summary judgment. In their summary judgment papers, the defendants only raised the personal involvement argument with respect to the former First Deputy Commissioner of the NYPD, Raphael Pineiro, who is no longer a party to this action. See note 2, supra. The defendants' argument is accordingly not preserved for review and deemed waived. See, e.g., Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396 F.3d 96, 124 n.29 (2d Cir. 2005).
