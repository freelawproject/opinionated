United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1074, 191 L.Ed.2d 64 (2015), that the statutory provision under which Morales was convicted covers \u201conly objects one can use to record or preserve information\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-22\">(3) Whether, in calculating Morales\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range, Morales\u2019s convictions for accessory after the fact must be \u201cgrouped\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-23\">The essential factual background of this case is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-24\">On the early morning of March 9, 2011, three members of the Roberson family\u2014 Jaquetta<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Roberson, Quayshawn Roberson, and Wanda Roberson \u2014 died in an intentionally-caused fire at 48-50 Wolcott Street in New Haven, Connecticut. Hector <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Natal, a neighbor of the Robersons, was charged with arson resulting in death, and his father, Hector Morales, was charged with being an accessory after the fact to arson for conduct that allegedly included driving Natal away from the scene of the fire after Natal started the blaze. Both Natal and Morales were charged with conspiring to tamper with, and tampering with, witnesses during law enforcement\u2019s investigation of the arson, including by seeking to cause witnesses to testify falsely to the grand jury. Additionally, Morales was charged with destruction and concealment of evidence for repainting the van that he had allegedly used to drive Natal away from the fire. Natal was also charged with attempted arson for trying to start a fire at the same New Haven building in approximately October 2010.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, both Natal and Morales were charged with participation in a drug conspiracy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Defendants Natal and Morales were tried jointly in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Ar-terton, /.), and on April 18, 2013, a jury found the defendants guilty on all counts. On January 8, 2015, the district court sentenced Morales to 174 months\u2019 imprisonment and 36 months of supervised release. On February 25, 2015, the district court sentenced Natal to life imprisonment on the arson counts, 240 months on each of the other charges that went to trial, and 40 years on the conviction resulting from Natal\u2019s guilty plea to the cocaine possession charge, all to run concurrently. Following the district court\u2019s entry of judgment, both Natal and Morales timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">On appeal, the defendants raise numerous claims, including allegations that Natal\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights were violated at trial, that there was a prejudicial variance between the indictment and the proof at trial, that the district court erroneously admitted lay opinion testimony concerning the operation of cell phone towers, that Morales\u2019s conviction for destruction and concealment of evidence must be vacated in light of an intervening Supreme Court decision, that Natal\u2019s sentence was imposed in contravention of the Eighth Amendment, and that the district court\u2019s calculation of Morales\u2019s U.S. Sentencing Guidelines range was procedurally erroneous. In a case with many issues, the district court was thorough and meticulous.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">We affirm the district court except as to the following claims. First, we hold that testimony on how cell phone towers operate constitutes expert testimony and may not be introduced through a lay witness. However, the admission in the instant ease of lay opinion testimony on the operation of cell phone towers was harmless. Second, we hold that Morales\u2019s conviction for destruction and concealment of evidence must be vacated in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Yates v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1074 (2015), handed down shortly after Morales filed the instant appeal. We remand Morales\u2019s case to the district court to vacate Morales\u2019s conviction for destruction and concealment of evidence, and, pursuant to <em>United States v. Powers, </em>842 F.3d 177 (2d Cir. 2016), to conduct <em>de novo </em>resentencing of Morales. Third, as part of the district court\u2019s calculation of Morales\u2019s Guidelines range at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>resentencing, Morales\u2019s three counts of conviction for accessory after the fact should be grouped pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. We reject the defendants\u2019 other claims. Consequently, we uphold all counts of conviction except Morales\u2019s conviction for destruction and concealment of evidence, and we remand Morales\u2019s case to the district court to vacate Morales\u2019s conviction for destruction and concealment of evidence and to resentence Morales <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">I. The admission of lay opinion testimony on how cell phone towers operate</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Morales and Natal argue that the district court erred in admitting lay opinion testimony on the operation of cell phone towers instead of requiring this testimony to be presented by an expert witness. We review the district court\u2019s eviden-tiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Rosemond, </em>841 F.3d 95, 107 (2d Cir. 2016). \u201cA district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence or rendered a decision that cannot be located within the range \u00f3f permissible decisions.\u201d <em>United States v. Rowland, </em>826 F.3d 100, 114 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting <em>United States v. Fazio, </em>770 F.3d 160, 165 (2d Cir. 2014)). However, \u201c[w]e will reverse only if an error affects a \u2018substantial right,\u2019 meaning that the error \u2018had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(first quoting Fed. R. Evid. 103(a); then quoting <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>413 F.3d 201, 210 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \u201c[W]here a court, upon review of the entire record, is sure that the evidentiary error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Garcia, </em>413 F.3d at 210) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u201cHistorical cell-site analysis,\u201d as the Seventh Circuit recently explained, \u201cuses cell phone records and cell tower locations to determine, within some range of error, a cell phone\u2019s location at a particular time.\u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>818 F.3d 289, 295 (7th Cir. 2016). A cell phone connects to a cell phone tower in order to access the cellular network and communicate with other phones. <em>Id. </em>\u201cEach cell tower covers a certain geographic area[,]\u201d which \u201cdepends upon \u2018the number of antennas operating on the cell site, the height of the antennas, topography of the surrounding land, and obstructions (both natural and man-made).\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Aaron Blank, <em>The Limitations and Admissibility of Using Historical Cellular Site Data to Track the Location of a Cellular Phone, </em>18 Rich. J. L. &amp; Tech. 3, 5 (2011)). \u201cWhile the proximity of the user is a significant factor in determining the cell tower with which the cell phone connects,\u201d other factors also play a role, including structural features of the tower and the phone, as well as the geography and topography of the surrounding environment. <em>Id. </em>at 295-96; <em>see also </em>Matthew Tart et al., <em>Historic Cell Site Analysis </em>\u2014 Overview <em>of Principles and Survey Methodologies, </em>8 Digital Investigation 185, 186-87 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Here, Natal and Morales attempted to show at trial that Michael Shamash, the landlord of the New Haven building burned in the arson, was a plausible alternative suspect in the arson. To counter this theory, the government sought to introduce evidence that Shamash\u2019s cell phone was connecting to cell phone towers in Queens, New York, on the night of the fire. In particular, the government called Joseph Trawieki, an employee of the Sprint Nextel wireless communications company, to testify regarding Shamash\u2019s cell phone activity. The district court permitted Trawieki to testify as a Sprint rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ords custodian in order to explain records showing \u201cwhat law enforcement relied on in ruling out Shamash\u201d as a suspect in the arson, and admitted Shamash\u2019s cell phone records as business records pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6). The government did not seek to show that Traw-icki\u2019s testimony satisfied the requirements for admissible expert testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, and the district court, over the defendants\u2019 objection, did not require the government to make this showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Trawicki, on the witness stand, explained entries on the Sprint phone records containing details about the calls in which Shamash\u2019s phone had participated on the night of the fire (for example, the time and duration of each call), as well as the location of the cell phone towers to which Shamash\u2019s cell phone had connected at the beginning and end of each call. When asked about the factors that would make a phone call \u201cstart with one cell tower and end with another cell [tower],\u201d Trawicki responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">Your handset is always looking for the strongest available signal, and your handset makes that determination, not the network, not anything else. And your handset, the instant it sees another strong signal that\u2019s stronger than the one it has, it will jump to that signal. That could be movement, it could be radio frequency interference, it could be just a tower that had a better signal that was previously busy becomes available. Based on this information, it\u2019s impossible \u2014 just looking at these individual records, it\u2019s impossible to say if there\u2019s movement there or not.... It\u2019s just your line of site [sic] to the tower, any radio frequency interference, like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Trawicki also indicated that a cell phone \u2022will connect to the tower with the \u201cstrongs est available signal,\u201d which may not be the closest tower. Trawicki ended his testimony by stating that a certain cell phone number, which was elsewhere identified as belonging to Shamash, connected to a tower in .Queens at 1:41 a.m. on the day of the fire. The arson was alleged to have occurred at approximately 1:15 a.m. in New Haven.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">In addition to admitting Trawicki\u2019s testimony as lay testimony, the district court permitted the government to offer lay testimony from two law enforcement officers, who testified that Shamash had been eliminated as a suspect in the arson investigation partially because Shamash\u2019s cell phone was shown by his cell phone records to be in Queens at the time of the fire. One of these law enforcement officers stated, for example, that Shamash\u2019s \u201ccell phone ... was down at [Shamash\u2019s] house bouncing off a cell phone tower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">On summation, the government drew the following conclusions from the cell phone tower evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">Before we move off the arson, I want to talk briefly about the landlord, the notion the landlord did it, Michael Sha-mash. Well, we know he was in Queens the night of the fire. And I\u2019ve got these phone records here, which we can zoom in on.... And then we know from the representative from Sprint how cell phones work \u2014 cell towers, and I\u2019ll direct your attention over to these columns. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>You get the repoll number and the cell tower number, and you go to another document at the back of the exhibit and you are going to see that the towers that Mr. Shamash was hitting off at the time, around 1:52 and 2:04 a.m., they all come back to 64th Street, Flushing, New York. So, I don\u2019t think there is any dispute that Mr. Shamash was not in New Haven standing outside the door saying should I light it, or words to that effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">On appeal, the defendants argue that the district court erred in admitting testimony on cell phone towers, especially the testimony offered by Trawicki, from a lay witness. Federal Rule of Evidence 701 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">[i]f a witness is not testifying as an expert, testimony in the form of an opinion is limited to one that is: (a) rationally based on the witness\u2019s perception; (b) helpful to clearly understanding the witness\u2019s testimony or to determining a fact in issue; and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">.Fed. R. Evid. 701. Federal Rule of Evidence 702, in turn, contains standards for the admission of expert testimony. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. 702. \u201cLay opinion under Rule 701 must be limited to opinions that \u2018result[ ] from a process of reasoning familiar in everyday life.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cuti, </em>720 F.3d 453, 459 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 701 advisory committee\u2019s note, 2000 amend.). \u201c[T]he purpose of Rule 701(c) is \u2018to eliminate the risk that the reliability requirements set forth in Rule 702 will be evaded through the simple expedient of proffering an expert in lay witness clothing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bank of China, N.Y. Branch v. NBM LLC, </em>359 F.3d 171, 181 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 701 . advisory committee\u2019s note, 2000 amend.).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">The Second Circuit has not yet ruled on whether testimony concerning cell phone towers requires expertise. We hereby join the Seventh and Tenth Circuits in-holding that testimony on how cell phone towers operate must be offered by an expert witness. <em>See Hill, </em>818 F.3d at 296 (\u201c[The witness\u2019s] testimony ... included statements about how cell phone towers operate. In our view,, this fits easily into the category of expert testimony, such that Rule 702 governs its admission.\u201d); <em>United States v. Yeley-Davis, </em>632 F.3d 673, 684 (10th Cir. 2011) (\u201cThe agent\u2019s testimony concerning how cell phone towers operate constituted expert testimony because it involved specialized knowledge not readily accessible to any ordinary person.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Reynolds, </em>626 Fed.Appx. 610, 614 (6th Cir. 2015). We need not hold that <em>all </em>evidence related to cell phone towers necessarily requires expertise. But we caution that the line between testimony on how cell phone towers operate, which must be offered by an expert witness, and any other testimony on cell phone towers, will frequently be difficult to draw, and so both litigants and district courts would be well advised to consider seriously the potential need for expert testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">In the- instant case, Sprint employee Trawicki offered testimony on how cell phone towers operate when he indicated, for example, that a cell phone will connect to the tower with the strongest available signal, which may not be the closest tower; that factors such as radio interference, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>tower availability, and the line of sight between a phone and a tower affect the tower to which a cell phone connects; and that the phone handset determines which signal is strongest. At least these aspects of Trawicki\u2019s testimony did not \u201c \u2018result[ ] from a process of reasoning familiar in everyday life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cuti, </em>720 F.3d at 459 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 701 advisory committee\u2019s note, 2000 amend.). They were, instead, \u201cbased on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 701(c). Therefore, the government in the instant case introduced testimony that required expertise through a lay witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">However, the admission here of lay opinion testimony on how cell phone towers operate was harmless and not reversible error. \u201cThe principal factors\u201d in the harmless error \u201cinquiry are \u2018the importance of the witness\u2019s wrongly admitted testimony\u2019 and \u2018the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Dukagjini, </em>326 F.3d 45, 62 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>Wray v. Johnson, </em>202 F.3d 515, 526 (2d Cir. 2000)). Here, the government\u2019s case against the defendants\u2019 theory that Shamash had committed the arson was not based solely on evidence concerning Sha-mash\u2019s cell phone; an FBI agent testified at trial that Shamash was ruled out as a suspect partly on the basis of witness accounts that Shamash was in New York on the night of the fire, and a New Haven police officer testified that Shamash was ruled out partly because, in law enforcement\u2019s view, Shamash had no financial motive to set the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">More significantly, the prosecution presented a very strong case against the defendants. Government witnesses testified that Natal admitted to them that he started the fire, including in a tape-recorded conversation that was played for the jury. One of these witnesses testified that Morales told her that he had driven Natal away from the fire. A neighbor of Natal and Morales testified that she saw the defendants driving away from 48-50 Wol-cott Street in Morales\u2019s van on the night of the fire. The same neighbor also described previous confrontations between Natal and residents of 48-50 Wolcott Street. The government also presented substantial evidence of attempts by Natal and Morales to thwart the police\u2019s investigation into the crime, including by instructing family members to testify falsely to the grand jury and by painting Morales\u2019s van a different color after eyewitness reports surfaced of a blue van leaving the scene of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Natal and Morales, for their part, offered evidence in opposition to the government\u2019s case. For example, they highlighted government witnesses\u2019 prior inconsistent statements, and called their own witnesses, some of whom gave unfavorable testimony about Shamash. Nevertheless, \u201cupon review of the entire record,\u201d the Court can be \u201csure that the evidentiary error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Rowland, </em>826 F.3d at 114 (quoting <em>Garcia, </em>413 F.3d at 210). Therefore, we find that the admission of lay opinion testimony on how cell phone towers operate was harmless and not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Relatedly, Natal and Morales argue that the government violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 by not disclosing before trial its intent to offer expert testimony, and that the district court abused its discretion in not granting the defendants a continuance that defense counsel sought in order to retain an expert to assist defense counsel in cross-examining Trawicki. In light of our holding that testimony concerning how cell phone towers operate constitutes expert testimony, we also hold that such testimony is covered by the disclosure requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, However, any error related to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 or the denial of a continuance was harmless for the reasons specified above.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">II. Morales\u2019s conviction for destruction and concealment of evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Morales argues, and the government concedes, that Morales\u2019s conviction for destruction and concealment of evidence must be vacated in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Yates v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1074 (2015), which issued after Morales filed his notice of appeal. Morales painted his blue van with black primer after the fire, and the government alleged that Morales took this action out of a concern that a blue van had been seen leaving the scene of the fire. Accordingly, Morales was charged, in Count Eleven of the indictment, with \u201cknowingly altering] a tangible object, that is, a blue 1994 Dodge Caravan, with the intent to impede ... an investigation\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519. The jury convicted Morales on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Yates, </em>however, that a \u201ctangible object\u201d within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519, covers \u201conly objects one can use to record or preserve information, not all objects in the physical world.\u201d <em>Yates, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1081. Because Morales\u2019s van was not an \u201cobject[ ] one can use to record or preserve information,\u201d <em>id. </em>Morales\u2019s act of repainting his van is not covered by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519. Indeed, the dissenting opinion in <em>Yates, </em>specifically referencing the instant case, stated that Morales\u2019s alleged act of \u201crepainting [his] van to cover up evidence of [a] fatal arson\u201d would, in light of the <em>Yates </em>Court\u2019s holding, \u201cnow fall outside \u00a7 1519.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1100 (Kagan, J., dissenting). The plurality opinion in <em>Yates </em>also referred to <em>United States v. Morales </em>and did not dispute the dissent\u2019s statement that Morales\u2019s conduct would not be covered by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519. <em>See id. </em>at 1088 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">Therefore, the Court hereby remands Morales\u2019s case- to the district court to vacate Morales\u2019s conviction for destruction and concealment of evidence (Count Eleven). Further, this Court has recently confirmed that when a count of conviction is overturned due to a \u201cconviction error,\u201d the proper remedy is <em>de novo </em>resentenc-ing, except in circumstances not applicable here. <em>Powers, </em>842 F.3d at 179-81; <em>see also United States v. Rigas, </em>583 F.3d 108, 117 (2d Cir. 2009). Consequently, on remand, Morales must be resentenced <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">III. The calculation of Morales\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">Morales contends that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court should have grouped his three counts of conviction for accessory after the fact in calculating his Guidelines range. To elaborate, Morales was charged with three counts of being an accessory after the fact to arson. Each count referred to one of the three arson counts charged against Natal, one for each of the three victims of the arson. The district court at Morales\u2019s sentencing, over Morales\u2019s objection, declined to \u201cgroup\u201d Morales\u2019s three counts of conviction for accessory after the fact to arson. As a result, the district court applied the multiple count analysis in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4 (\u201cDetermining the Combined Offense Level\u201d) without grouping the accessory counts. Morales notes that if the accessory counts had been grouped, Morales\u2019s Guidelines range would have been 121-151 months\u2019 imprisonment, not 168-210 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Morales to 174 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u201cA district court commits procedural error where it ... makes a mistake in its Guidelines calculation.... \u201d <em>United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 190 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc). \u201cProcedural reasonableness is reviewed for abuse of discretion,\u201d <em>United States v. Desnoyers, </em>708 F.3d 378, 385 (2d Cir. 2013), but \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo,\u201d United States v. Kent, </em>821 F.3d 362, 368 (2d Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We hold that Morales\u2019s counts of conviction for accessory after the fact to arson must be grouped pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. This provision, titled ' \u201cGroups of Closely Related Counts,\u201d states that \u201c[a]ll counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single Group. Counts involve substantially the same harm within the meaning of this rule: (a) When counts involve the same victim and the same act or transaction. ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. Additionally, the application notes to this provision of the Guidelines state that \u201c[a]mbiguities should be resolved in accordance with the purpose of this section as stated in the lead paragraph, i.e., to identify and group \u2018counts involving substantially the same harm.\u2019 \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 cmt. n.2 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Here, Morales was convicted not of the substantive crime of arson, but of the \u201cdistinct\u201d offense of accessory after the fact, which \u201cis differently punished.\u201d <em>Bollenbach v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 607, 611, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946); <em>see also United States v. Cabrales, </em>524 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 1772, 141 L.Ed.2d 1 (1998); <em>United States v. James, </em>998 F.2d 74, 80 (2d Cir. 1993). In particular, Morales\u2019s \u201coffense is ... that of interfering with the processes of justice.\u201d Wayne R. LaFave, 2 <em>Subst. Crim. L. </em>\u00a7 13.6 (2d ed.); <em>see also United States v. Vidal, </em>504 F.3d 1072, 1078 (9th Cir. 2007) (\u201cAccessory-after-the-fact liability ... is aimed at post-offense conduct that aids the offender in evading law enforcement.\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds, see Cardozo-Arias v. Holder, </em>495 Fed.Appx. 790, 792 n.1 (9th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">As the Supreme Court of Minnesota stated, in interpreting Minnesota\u2019s criminal statutes, \u201caccomplices after-the-fact come along after the victims have been harmed and do not further their victimization merely by helping the principal offenders evade the law.\u201d <em>State v. Skipintheday, </em>717 N.W.2d 423, 427 (Minn. 2006). Consequently, the Minnesota Supreme Court indicated, the defendant\u2019s \u201cthree counts of being an accomplice after-the-fact, all arising from a single behavioral incident, were not multiple-victim crimes, and [we]re therefore not subject to multiple sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427. Similarly, Morales\u2019s counts of conviction for accessory after the fact \u201cinvolv[ed] substantially the same harm\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, namely damage to the \u201cadministration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425. The \u201cvictim\u201d for the purpose of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 '3D1.2 is hence \u201cthe societal interest that is harmed,\u201d that is, society\u2019s interest in the administration of justice, and \u201cthe societal interests that are harmed\u201d by the conduct giving rise to Morales\u2019s three convictions for accessory after the fact \u201care closely related.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 cmt. n.2. Therefore, these counts should \u201cbe grouped together into a single Group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. We accordingly direct the district court, in calculating Morales\u2019s Guidelines range at his resentencing, to group his three counts of conviction for accessory after the fact pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">We have considered the other claims raised by defendants Natal and Morales, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>and we find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court except as to Morales\u2019s conviction for destruction and concealment of evidence. We REMAND Morales\u2019s case to the district court to vacate his conviction for destruction and concealment of evidence, and to conduct <em>de novo </em>resentenc-ing of Morales. We also direct the district court, at Morales\u2019s resentencing, to group Morales\u2019s counts of conviction for accessory after the fact pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-25\">.

The defense did not cross-examine Trawicki because, according to defense counsel, the defendants had not realized before trial that the government was planning to call a witness to discuss cell phone tower location data. The government, defense counsel argued, had violated a pretrial understanding that no evidence on cell phone towers would be offered. <em>See infra </em>for the Court\u2019s conclusion that these claims by the defendants do not warrant a finding of reversible error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\">. In this case, asking the jury to draw the conclusion that Shamash could not have been in New Haven because his cell phone was using a tower in Queens required testimony on the possible ranges of any relevant cell phone towers and how they operate, which required expertise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
