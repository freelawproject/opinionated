A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">This is a sad and unfortunately too common example of how a case should not be tried. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney said things he should not have said. Defense counsel (not present counsel) did not object to most of the utterances, and too late or insufficiently to the remainder. The trial judge took no action to curb or cure the improprieties. As a result, we must reverse for \u201cplain errors\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>under <em>R. R. </em>1:5-3 (e) a judgment which we would otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The action is for malicious prosecution. Plaintiff Isaac Pierce, Jr. had purchased a second-hand automobile from defendant Taccarino under a conditional sales contract. On or about January 1, 1957 the automobile, while paxked unoccupied, was struck and damaged by a motorist insured by the General Accident Insurance Company (General). Even though he first obtained an estimate of $396.95 to repair the damage from another concern, plaintiff brought the damaged vehicle to defendant, who operated as Lou\u2019s Body Shop as well as Guaranteed Auto Sales, and left it with defendant to be repaired without an estimate or agreement as to price. Plaintiff testified he did so because when he purchased the car he was given a card by defendant stating that ail repairs \"must be done through Guaranteed Auto.\u201d Plaintiff testified that defendant told him he \"would take care of the procedures\u201d of settling with General and would repair the damage with the proceeds of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Defendant submitted an estimate of $794.90 to General but later settled with that company for $456.55. Defendant expected General to send him the check or, at least, that he would be one of the payees, but, on January 22, 1958, General sent to the plaintiff a check to plaintiff\u2019s order alone for $456.55. Plaintiff knew that he was not insured by General but by another company he called \"Globe.\u201d Therefore he took the check to someone he called \"Seymour Sales\u201d (not connected with anyone else mentioned in this opinion) and asked \"what it was and they told [him] what it was.\u201d Plaintiff then cashed the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">On January 29 plaintiff came to defendant\u2019s place of business in Neptune for the car. Defendant told plaintiff that the car was at Chris\u2019s Body Shop, in Long Branch. He gave plaintiff a check for $125 to the order of Chris\u2019s Body Shop and told plaintiff he could pick up the car there. When plaintiff did so he found that not all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>damage had been repaired. Indeed, plaintiff\u2019s attorney contended at the trial that the $125 paid to Chris\u2019s Body Shop represented the value of all the repairs done on the car and that defendant had expended no more than that sum on it, in spite of the fact that defendant planned to get $456.55 from General.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Plaintiff returned with the car to defendant\u2019s place of business and complained to him about the insufficiency of the repairs. Plaintiff testified that he told defendant he did not want the car \u201cbecause it wasn\u2019t properly fixed\u201d and that he asked for another car of the same make and year which defendant had in his yard. Plaintiff said that when defendant refused, saying that all that was needed was \u201cjust a few minor adjustments,\u201d he asked defendant what he owed him for the repairs, and that defendant answered \u201cthat\u2019s all right the insurance company will take care of it.\u201d Plaintiff then departed with his ear. He admits he did not tell defendant that he had already received and cashed the check. He claims that he knew nothing of the amount or details of the settlement with General and believed defendant\u2019s statement that the insurance company would pay defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Defendant\u2019s version of the surrender of the automobile is quite different. He testified that \u201cMr. Pierce asked me for the automobile and I explained to him the bill was $456 and I do not release an automobile unless I get paid. He asked me if I would be nice enough to let him have it, he had to go to work with the car and I explained again that I hadn\u2019t received the insurance check and I asked him if he had received it and he told me he had not and I asked him if he\u2019d promise me if I gave him the car that he would bring it in as soon as he got [it] and he said he would and on the strength of that I gave him the car.\u201d Defendant testified that plaintiff\u2019s only complaint as to the repairs was that \u201cthe deck lid was not closing properly\u201d and that he told plaintiff \u201cif he would leave the car the following day we\u2019d have the adjustment taken care of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Plaintiff did not come back with, the automobile. Defendant testified that about a week or ten days after January 29, the day plaintiff departed with the car, he learned that plaintiff had received and cashed the check. He testified that he did not make the complaint until after trying \"very hard\u201d to locate plaintiff in Neptune. The complaint was made on February 21, 1958, and plaintiff was arrested on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The complaint was inartistically drawn and it is difficult to determine precisely what crime or crimes (if any) it charged. Plaintiff claims it charged forgery; defendant denies it, and argues it charged only the obtaining of possession of the car by means of false promises or pretenses, contrary to <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:111\u20141. As we have said, the check issued by General was dated January 22, but the car was not taken by plaintiff until January 29. The complaint charged that on <em>January </em>plaintiff did \"commit a fraud\u201d upon Yaecarino \"to wit: the defendant had repairs completed upon his motor vehicle * * * incurring a bill of Four hundred and fifty six dollars and fifty five cents ($156.55) and the defendant did thereupon cash a check made out for these repairs by the American Casualty Group of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for this amount, said check being issued to Isaac Pierce, Jr. &amp; Lou\u2019s Body Shop, and did fail to pay the complainant for the work completed by the complainant, thereby depriving the complainant of his rightful goods and chattels, all of which is contrary to and in violation of the E. S. of the State of New Jersey and therefore he prays that the said Isaac Pierce Jr. may be apprehended and held to answer to said complaint, and dealt with as the law and justice may require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Plaintiff was released on bail on February 25, the day after his arrest. On March 1 he was given a preliminary hearing before the Neptune acting magistrate. At that time defendant, having learned that the check was payable to Pierce alone, withdrew the allegation of the complaint that Pierce had cashed a check \"issued to Isaac Pierce Jr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>and Lon\u2019s Body Shop,\u201d but the acting magistrate (as he testified) \u201cheld Mr. Pierce for the grand jury on the grounds of false pretenses.\u201d The record before us does not show what Yaccarino\u2019s testimony was before the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The grand jury handed down an indictment which purported to charge Pierce with violating <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:111-1 in that he did \u201cfalsely represent, pretend and promise to the said Louis Yaccarino that he * * * would pay</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">over to the said Louis Yaccarino\u201d the check, and thus obtained the car. On January 28, 1959 defendant was arrested on this indictment. This time he was in jail until February 2, when he was released on bail. In May he was tried on the indictment, and acquitted after a two-day trial. The present action was then instituted. It resulted in an award of $4,505 compensatory and $3,000 punitive damages. Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Throughout the trial plaintiff\u2019s attorney endeavored to project the image of plaintiff as an uneducated Negro at the mercy of defendant; that defendant schemed to get as much as possible from the insurance company while giving plaintiff as little as possible in repairs; and that, angry when defendant\u2019s scheme was thwarted by General\u2019s mailing the check to plaintiff, defendant instituted the criminal proceedings to force plaintiff to give him the $456.55 when the repairs were worth only $125.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">At the very end of a long cross-examination of Yaccarino along these lines, the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">\u201cRecross-examination by Mr. Edelstein:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">Q. Mr. Yaccarino, a great part of your business is done with Negroes, is it not? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">Mr. Edelstein: That\u2019s all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">There was no objection by defendant\u2019s attorney and no action by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">Counsel agree that one juror was a Negro. The quoted question obviously was intended to give the jury the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>pression that defendant was in the business of cheating ignorant Negroes.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorney does not suggest any other reason for asking it, or what else it could have meant to the jury. He does not argue that it was a proper question, but asks to be excused on the ground that the question was put in the heat of his examination. Eirst of all, that is no excuse for so shocking a question. Secondly, he returned to the same attack in his summation <em>the following day. </em>He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201cI want you also to consider tlie fact that Mr. Yaecarino, the fact that he admitted, the last thing he testified to on the stand, does the bulk of his business with negroes. Now, I don\u2019t have to point out to you the fact, the advantages and disadvantages that one has over the other. You are all over the age 21 and you have been in the world long enough to know the facts of life. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Again there was no objection from defendant\u2019s attorney and no action by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">It is the obligation of counsel to make timely objection, and <em>ordinarily </em>the trial court will not interfere with the lawyer\u2019s judgment of whether an objection is necessary or desirable. However, there are limits to such <em>laissez faire. </em>As we said in <em>Purpura v. Public Service Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>475, 480 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">\u201c \u2018Courts exist for the judicial determination of the rights of the litigants and for the administration of justice, and it is the duty of those presiding, as far as humanly possible, to see that the setting of each individual case shall be such that an impartial and just deliverance shall be had between the parties, and when counsel deliberately seeks to inject into a cause an element which has, and is designed to have, the effect of prejudicing the rights of one or the other of the litigants, it is the duty of the judge to guard against such effect, either by arresting the trial <em>in limine </em>* * * or by guarding against the pernicious results through proper instruction to the jury * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">We appreciate the fact that a trial judge may be reluctant to take a greater part in the trial of a case than is absolutely necessary. Nevertheless, as the court said in <em>Martin v. State, </em>63 <em>Miss. </em>505, 56 <em>Amer. Rep. </em>812, 813 (1886):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">* * n js among the highest of judicial functions to see that the law is impartially administered and to guard the jury box as far as possible from unlawful influences. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>It may sometimes be a difficult and delicate duty for the court to confine counsel to legitimate argument, but this is no reason why it should not be done when necessary to prevent the perversion of law and justice. Like other difficult and delicate duties, it should not be shunned or disregarded by those upon whom it is imposed. Justice should not be sacrificed on mere sentiments of delicacy. * * *.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">See also <em>Greenberg v. </em>Stanley, 30 <em>N. </em>J. 485, 503 (1959); <em>Paxton v. </em>Misiuk, 54 <em>N. J. Super. </em>15, 22 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959); <em>Haid v. Loderstedt, </em>45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>547 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Another serious impropriety arose in the following fashion. In cross-examining defendant\u2019s witness Addeo, plaintiff\u2019s attorney asked him whether he had \u201cgone over\u201d his testimony with defendant and Addeo answered \u201cNo.\u201d The cross-examination then continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">\u201cQ. Let me refresh your recollection. Isn\u2019t it a fact, Mr. Addeo, at 1:22 P. M. this afternoon you were walking down the street here in front of the Courthouse on Main Street and you asked Mr. Yaccarino a question as to your testimony and Mr. Yaccarino in a very loud voice answered, \u2018If they ask you what happened tell them what happened, but only the important things.\u2019 You remember that? A. I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">Q. You don\u2019t remember that? A. No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">Q. You remember seeing me walk away from the Courthouse? A. I seen you walking a lot of times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">Q. I am talking about this afternoon. You didn\u2019t make this statement? A. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">Q. And Mr. Yaccarino didn\u2019t make that statement to you? A. Not to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">Q. In front of the old Courthouse? A. I know where you are talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">Q. Next to the automobile supply place? A. He didn\u2019t make that statement to me. We weren\u2019t even talking about the case, if that\u2019s what you are talking about.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not take the stand, nor did any other witness testify that the conversation described in Mr. Edelstein\u2019s question had in fact taken place. Therefore, in his summation defendant\u2019s attorney properly pointed out to the jury that merely because the question was asked did not prove that Yaccarino had made the alleged statement to Addeo, and, since Addeo\u2019s denial was uncontradicted, there was no proof that it had indeed been said.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>In his summation plaintiff\u2019s attorney replied by saying-defendant\u2019s attorney \u201caccused me of unethical conduct.\u201d When defendant\u2019s attorney protested that he had made no such accusation, plaintiff\u2019s attorney withdrew the statement, but immediately thereafter he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\u201cNow, I was the only person there and Mr. Mattice knows that I couldn\u2019t get on the stand. I am trying this ease. Now it is a question of whether or not I fabricated this testimony and there was no one there to corroborate it. If there had been, the person would have been on the stand. I wouldn\u2019t manufacture Mr. Pierce with me and say he heard it because he didn\u2019t. I walked down and I walked back alone. And I say to you that if I did that I would be subject to disbarment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Again defense counsel did not object and the trial judge said nothing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cCounsel should never in the course of argument state facts which are based on his own personal knowledge only, regardless of their relevancy to the issues at bar, but if he desires to get such facts before the jury, he should take the stand and present them in a legitimate manner.\u201d 53 <em>Am. Jur., Trial, Sec. </em>483, <em>p. </em>390.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\"><em>Accord: Tabor v. O\u2019Grady, </em>59 <em>N. J. Super. </em>330, 340 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960); <em>Flynn v. Stearns, </em>52 <em>N. J. Super. </em>115, 126 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958); <em>Kulodzej v. Lehigh Valley Railroad Co., </em>39 <em>N. J. Super. </em>268, 273-274 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956). See also <em>Shafer v. H. B. Thomas Co., </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>19, 26 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Counsel is competent to testify if he insists upon doing so <em>(Callen v. Gill, </em>7 <em>N. J. </em>312, 317 (1951)), but the giving of testimony by trial counsel has been \u201cunder emphatic condemnation\u201d for over 100 years <em>(Roston v. Morris, 25 N. J. L. </em>173, 175 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1855); <em>Callen v. Gill, supra). Canon </em>19 of the <em>Canons of Professional Ethics </em>provides, \u201cExcept when essential to the ends of justice, a lawyer should avoid testifying in Court on behalf of his client.\u201d Therefore, unless it is important to do so and unavoidable, the wise trial attorney will not create an issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>of veracity between himself and a witness. First, it is unfair to the witness, for the jury looks upon the attorney with trust and respect because he is a member of an honored and learned profession, an officer of the court, and one of the commanding figures in the court room. Second, and as a consequence, when a witness disputes the attorney\u2019s veracity, it causes embarrassment not only to the attorney but to everyone in the courtroom. It easts doubt upon the integrity of the attorney and thus reflects upon the profession as a whole. \u201c[(Questions of his own credibility and of the accuracy of his statements afford for * * * [the attorney] most indelicate questions for discussion.\u201d 58 <em>Am. Jur., Witnesses, </em>\u00a7 152, <em>p. </em>110. See also <em>Gershonowitz v. Neider, </em>95 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>580, 582 <em>(Ch. </em>1924). Finally, when the matter is too unimportant to justify his taking the stand to establish his truthfulness, the trial attorney must risk the chance that the jury will disbelieve him. He may not attempt to convince the jury of his veracity by declamation, argument or summation, as was done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The issue upon which counsel threw his veracity into the scales against that of Mr. Addeo was of slight importance. However the possible prejudicial effect of this episode was heightened by the court\u2019s inadequate charge on <em>\u201cfalsus in uno \u201d </em>in which he failed to say that the falsehood must be as to a material fact. <em>State v. Sturchio, </em>127 <em>N. J. L. </em>366 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1941); <em>State v. Ernst, </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>567, 583 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">If the testimony in the guise of summation were the only transgression we would find it insufficient to justify reversal for plain error. However it did not stand alone. In addition to the reference to defendant\u2019s doing business with Negroes there were other and lesser improprieties\u2014too numerous to discuss. In short, we are convinced that justice demands a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Defendant contends that plaintiff did not prove a case and that his motions for judgment should have been granted; and, therefore, that we should order the entry of judgment in favor of defendant. We find no merit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>this contention. Plaintiffs case was that defendant caused his arrest and imprisonment by falsely accusing him of cashing a check made out to defendant (which accusation defendant withdrew after the first arrest, having learned he was not a payee) and of obtaining the automobile by promising to give the defendant the check when it arrived, when in fact plaintiff had already cashed it. Defendant argues that he honestly believed the check had named him as a payee, and that such honest belief is a defense. However, it appears that defendant made no investigation, had no factual basis for the alleged belief, and merely assumed that the cheek had been so issued. Under these circumstances belief, however honest, is no defense. The jury was also entitled to find that defendant caused plaintiffs arrest on the indictment, and resultant damage, by charging plaintiff with falsely promising to turn over the check when he had already cashed it, and that no such promise had been made by Pierce.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Eeversed for a new trial, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
