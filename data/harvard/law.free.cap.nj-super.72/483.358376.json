The branch manager had spoken to him that day and offered him thirty days in which to improve the quantity and quality of his work, but the claimant chose to leave immediately.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Section 5 of the Unemployment Compensation Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-5, provides, <em>inter </em>alia, that an individual shall be disqualified for benefits if he leaves work voluntarily \u201cwithout good cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">On the basis of the foregoing it was determined by the Appeal Tribunal, which determination was affirmed by the Board of Review, that claimant did not have good cause to leave his employment and was disqualified for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Claimant argues that he was \u201cfired\u201d and was not offered any trial period of 30 days by his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">In reviewing factual findings made in an unemployment compensation proceeding the test \u201cis not whether we would come to the same conclusion if the original determination was ours to make, but rather whether the fact-finder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>could reasonably\u201d so conclude upon the proofs. <em>Berry, Whitson &amp; Berry v. Division, etc., Dept. of Labor and Industry, 21 N. J. </em>73 (1956); <em>cf. United Hunters Assn. of N. J., Inc. v. Adams, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>288 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In the instant case there is ample evidence to support the factual findings made by the Appeal Tribunal. At the hearing claimant testified that he told Mr. Archer, his employer\u2019s office manager, \u201cI\u2019d rather go out of the job happy instead of me walking in one day and find I\u2019m out of a job. I\u2019d rather leave amiably, so therefore I\u2019m able to get a job elsewhere.\u201d Archer testified that he told claimant he was under observation but would be given an opportunity (30 days) to raise the quality and quantity of his work. According to Archer, claimant replied that he did not want to work under those circumstances and that it would be better if he resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">On the basis of the Appeal Tribunal findings we conclude that it was properly determined that claimant did not have good cause for leaving work. \u201cGood cause means cause sufficient to justify an employee\u2019s voluntarily leaving the ranks of the employed and joining the ranks of the unemployed.\u201d Goeb<em>elbecker v. State, </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>53, 59 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958), certification denied 29 <em>N. J. </em>354 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Here, claimant was offered a 30-day trial period in which to improve the quality and quantity of his work. Instead, he chose to terminate his employment immediately. Had he stayed on, his work might have improved to the satisfaction of his employer and his fears of being discharged might never have materialized. The situation presented is not one of leaving work voluntarily for good cause within the meaning of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-5. <em>Cf. Medwick v. Bd. of Review, </em>69 <em>N. J. Super. </em>338 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
