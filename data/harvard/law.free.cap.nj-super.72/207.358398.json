S. C.</author>\n<p id=\"AAb\">(temporarily assigned). Defendant, with leave of this court, appeals from an order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Superior Court, Law Division, denying his motion, made pursuant to <em>R. R. </em>4:12-2(e), to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for the reason that same \u201cfails to set forth a cause of action upon which relief can be granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Defendant argues as grounds for reversal that the trial court erred in that (1) it treated his motion as one for summary judgment and denied same because questions of fact had been raised; (2) it failed to determine whether the complaint stated a cause of action, and (3) it \u201cshould\u201d have dismissed the complaint on said ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The pertinent parts of the complaint \u201cIn Lieu of Prerogative Writ\u201d follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201cPlaintiff * * * having its principal office at * * * Wood-bridge Township * * New Jersey, complaining says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">1. At present and at all times referred to herein, plaintiff * * * is and w-as * * * in the business of operating \u2018wreckers\u2019 or tow trucks, and the defendant * * * is and was a duly elected Committeeman of the Township * * * and Police Commissioner of the Township * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">2. On November 3, 1941, the Township Committee * * * passed an ordinance concerning the regulation of \u2018wreckers\u2019 and the licensing of the owners thereof, * * * which provides, among other matters for licensing of owners of wreckers and the revocation or suspension of such licenses i: * * after a hearing upon the nature and circumstances of the violation :i * *. This ordinance is in force, at present and was in effect at all times herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-17\">3. In April, 1960, defendant * * * as Police Commissioner * * * established and published a Call List of eligible garages to be used when wrecker services were required or requested through the Police Department. A copy of the announcement establishing the Call List and the list of requirements and regulations is attached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-19\">4. Under the April, 1960, Call List, the Defendant * * * drew up and issued to the Police Department a list of wrecker owners, broken down into two geographical sections of Woodbridge * * * and further broken down into rotating lists of wrecker owners in each section. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-23\">5. On the said Call List issued by the defendant on May 7, 1961, the plaintiff is not listed for a call day from May 8, 1961 to June 7, 1961, and thereafter is listed every six days until the end of the Call List on June 30, 1961. A covering letter sent with the May 8th\u2014 * * * Call List, * * * and signed by the defendant, addressed to Township Police Chief * * * and Participating Garages * * * announced the suspension from the Call List of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>tiff for violation of the Call List, safety requirements and motor vehicle laws on April 4, 1961, at 5.1S p. m. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">\u201c5. <em>(sic) </em>The plaintiff denies any violation of the Call List safety requirements and motor vehicle laws on April 4, 1961, and through its attorneys * * * requested of the defendant, a hearing on the suspension and a stay of the suspension, pending the hearing and decision. The * * * request for hearing was denied by the defendant. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">WHEREFORE, the plaintiff demands judgment as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGS\">A. The defendant * * * be ordered to grant a hearing to plaintiff * * * on the occurrences on April 4, 1961.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">B. The defendant * * * be ordered to appoint an impartial hearing on the alleged violations by the plaintiff on April 4, 1961.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">C. The defendant * * be ordered to reinstate the plaintiff to the Call List and adjust the Call List so as to restore to the plaintiff days equivalent to the number of days lost by the suspension, by listing the plaintiff\u2019s name on successive days until the lost time is made up. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">The above referred to \u201ccall list\u201d states that it was \u201cestablished\u201d by the township to \u201cequitably spread the needs of the Township\u201d and to \u201cprotect the Township.\u201d It sets forth the requirements and steps \u201cthat must be taken to be placed\u201d thereon and the \u201cpenalties to be invoked when failing to comply\u201d therewith; the latter being exclusion therefrom for stated periods. Significantly, it also provides that the \u201cwreckers\u201d ordinance \u201cshall be enforced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">At the argument of the motion, defendant submitted a legal memorandum to the court which included an unverified \u201cStatement of Facts.\u201d Therein defendant asserted that the \u201ccall list\u201d was established at the request of the garagemen in order to provide equal opportunity for towing work and that the \u201cdrafting\u201d thereof and its administration were \u201cvoluntarily assumed\u201d by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">The trial judge treated defendant\u2019s motion as one for summary judgment. In denying same, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-17\">\u201c* a \u2022:= Since it appears to me that counsel in their arguments raise questions of fact as to whether or not the police commissioner so named was speaking for himself or whether he was speaking for the township, it would appear to me * * * that the motion is premature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>It may very well be that after the plaintiff\u2019s case goes in a motion at that time for the defendant would be in order. But as I see it at this particular time, the case should go on for a regular trial in lieu of a prerogative writ, to the end that further disclosure might be made as to the power of the police commissioner to determine whether or not he was acting for himself, and if he was, whether or not the plaintiff accrued certain rights, and if he had no power, whether or not there were any rights that would accrue to the plaintiff. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><em>R. R. </em>4:12-2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">\u201cEvery defense, legal or equitable, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the answer thereto, except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader he made by motion, with briefs: * * * (e) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, * * *. <em>If, on motion asserting the defense numbered (e) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the eonrt, </em>the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 4:58, * * (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">On a motion made pursuant to <em>R. R. </em>4:12\u20142(e) the inquiry is confined to a consideration of the legal sufficiency of the alleged facts apparent on the face of the challenged claim. While the court has the power to enlarge the scope of said motion and treat the same as \u201cone for summary judgment/\u2019 this may be done only if on said motion \u201cmatters outside the pleading are presented.\u201d However, such matters must he presented by depositions, admissions or affidavits. They cannot be raised, without verification, in -oral arguments of counsel or in briefs filed with the court. <em>Goldman v. Summerfield, </em>94 U. <em>S. App. D. C. </em>209, 214 <em>F. 2d </em>858 <em>(D. C. Circ. </em>1954); <em>Patitucci v. United States, </em>178 <em>F. Supp. </em>507, 509 <em>(E. D. Pa. </em>1959); <em>R. R. </em>4:58-3; <em>McGuirk v. McBennett, </em>7 <em>N. J. </em>111, 114 (1951). See also <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>67, 74 (1954) and <em>Orrok v. Parmigiani, </em>32 <em>N. J. Super. </em>70, 76\u201477 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Based on the aforesaid rule and decisions, we conclude that the trial court should not have treated defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>motion as one for summary judgment. However, for the reasons hereinafter stated, we are of the opinion that in denying defendant\u2019s motion the court did not commit reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Defendant, for the purpose of his motion, \u201cadmitted every allegation in plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\u201d He makes the same admission on appeal. The facts alleged in the complaint (accepted as true for the purpose of said motion) are that defendant, as police commissioner of the township, \u201cestablished and published a call list,\u201d which list states that it was \u201cestablished\u201d by the township. Further, the complaint alleges that by virtue of the existing township \u201cwreckers\u201d ordinance, plaintiff was entitled to a \u201chearing upon the nature and circumstances of the violation\u201d prior to suspension of its license.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Thus the complaint asserts the \u201ccall list\u201d to be a creation and instrument of government and charges defendant police commissioner with the failure to perform a duty imposed upon him in administering such \u201clist,\u201d as well as with the improper performance of such duty. At common law, official municipal inaction could be remedied by <em>mandamus, Gallena v. Scott, </em>11 <em>N. J. </em>231, 238 (1953), and the improper acts of municipal officers and boards could be reviewed by <em>certiorari, McKenna v. New Jersey Highway Authority, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>270, 274, 275 (1955). Although these writs are superseded, procedure \u201cin lieu thereof\u201d for \u201creview, hearing and relief\u201d may be had in the Superior Court. <em>R. R. </em>4:88-1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We are of the opinion that the complaint stated \u201ca claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d and, therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the same. We agree with the trial court that upon the facts pleaded, plaintiff was entitled to a \u201cregular trial.\u201d In so holding, we are indicating no opinion as to plaintiff\u2019s ultimate success therein; we are merely determining that it is entitled to a plenary trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Affirmed. Costs to abide the outcome.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
