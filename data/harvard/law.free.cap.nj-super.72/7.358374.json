S. C.</author>\n<p id=\"A5\">This is an action in lieu of prerogative writs.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">Plaintiffs contend that they are teachers under tenure, employed by the Elizabeth Board of Education; that on or about January 12, 1961 the board of education estimated the amount necessary for the school year beginning July 1, 1961 and ending June 30, 1962, which amount was $6,408,248.71; that included in said budget were increases and increments for the teachers\u2014including the plaintiffs; that on January 13, 1961 the board of education, pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18:6-49, prepared and delivered copies of said budget to each member of the board of school estimate; that on February 14, 1961 the board of school estimate, pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18:6-50, fixed and determined the amount of money necessary to be appropriated for the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>of the public schools in Elizabeth for the school year 1961-1962 at the sum of $6,308,248.71; that further pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18:6\u201450 the board of school estimate made two certificates of said amount and delivered one copy to the school board and one copy to the City of Elizabeth on February 15, 1961; that <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53 makes it mandatory that the city shall, upon receipt of the said certificate, appropriate the amount certified to it by the board of school estimate by including it in the tax ordinance, and that such amount shall be assessed, levied and collected in the same manner as money appropriated by the city for other purposes is assessed, levied and collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Plaintiffs further contend that on February 28, 1961 the city council voted not to appropriate the amount certified to it by the board of school estimate upon the belief that the amount so certified to it by the board of school estimate exceeded <em>1%% </em>of the \u201cassessed ratables\u201d of the City of Elizabeth; that the statute, <em>R. S. </em>18:6\u201453, provides that no amount in excess of 1%% of the \u201cassessable ratables\u201d of any municipality, as determined by the county board of taxation, shall be appropriated without the concurrence and consent of the governing body; that the Union County Board of Taxation had fixed $433,817,887 as the valuation of the \u201cassessable ratables\u201d of the City of Elizabeth for 1961, and that the amount of $6,308,248.71, as certified to by the board of school estimate, is an amount less than 1%%, and that the defendant City of Elizabeth had no authority to refuse to appropriate the said sum of $6,308,248.71; that on March 28, 1961 the board of school estimate certified to the city council that the sum of $6,147,730.86 was necessary for the school year beginning July 1, 1961, and on March 28, 1961 the city council concurred and consented to said amount; that as the result of the refusal of the City of Elizabeth to appropriate the said amount of $6,308,248.71 and as the result of the appropriation of the reduced amount of $6,147,730.86 the plaintiffs will suffer financial losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Thus, plaintiffs demand judgment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">\u201c(a) directing the defendant City to appropriate the sum of $6,308,248.71, being the amount certified to it by the Board of School Estimate for the school year 1961-1962, and forthwith to include such amount in the City\u2019s tax ordinance, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">(b) declaring that the language used in <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53, that the \u2018valuation of the assessable ratables * * * as determined by the county board of taxation\u2019 refers to the valuation of $433,817,887 as determined by the Union County Board of Taxation as the base upon which the one and one-half per centum limitation shall be computed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The defendants admit most of the facts alleged by plaintiffs but deny the interpretation of <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53 as contended for by plaintiffs, and deny that the actions of defendants were in violation of said statutes, and further deny that the City of Elizabeth has no authority to refuse to appropriate the sum of $6,308,248.71. Defendants also contend that they had no knowledge or information concerning the tenure status and losses claimed by plaintiffs, but this has been established by affidavits of plaintiffs, the contents of which have not been denied. Defendants also set up a number of separate defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Plaintiffs move for summary judgment to compel the defendant City of Elizabeth to appropriate for school purposes the sum of $6,308,248.71, which is the amount certified to it by the board of school estimate for the year commencing July 1, 1961, and for the interpretation and construction of <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Defendants have filed a cross-motion for summary judgment based upon the allegations of the complaint, and for the interpretation and construction of <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">In a separate defense defendants assert that the plaintiffs are required to exhaust their administrative remedies before making application to this court. Any failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>to exhaust administrative remedies is no bar to the plaintiffs\u2019 right to bring this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">There is no question that <em>R. R. </em>4:88-14 provides that, in the usual case, administrative remedies are to be exhausted before a proceeding is to be started in lieu of prerogative writs. This rule provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-6\">\u201cExcept where it is manifest that the interests of justice require otherwise, proceedings under Rule 4:88 shall not be maintainable, so long as there is available judicial review to a county court or inferior tribunal or administrative review to an administrative agency or tribunal, which has not been exhausted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">It will be noted at the outset that the rule is not absolute by its very terms. The rule was intended as a simple rule of ordinary procedure. <em>Ward v. Keenan, </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>298 (1949). The rule has constantly been departed from where the interests of justice require. Reference may be had to <em>Waldor v. Untermann, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>188 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950), which was an action for the ouster of the defendant as a member of the Board of Education of the City of Newark. Justice (then Judge) Jacobs, in discussing this rule, relied on a school case in part when he said, at <em>page </em>191, regarding the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">\u201cHowever, it was neither jurisdictional nor absolute and was departed from where, in the opinion of the court, the interests of justice so required. See <em>Lane v. Bigelow, </em>135 N. <em>J. L. </em>195, 200 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1947); <em>Conaway v. Atlantic City, </em>107 <em>N. J. L. </em>404, 408 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1931); <em>Koven v. Stanley, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>446, 447 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1913). In the <em>Lane </em>ease the Court of Errors and Appeals permitted judicial determination without exhaustion of the administrative remedy available under the Zoning act and adopted the postion taken earlier in the <em>Conaway </em>case that the court had \u2018power to intervene, and in a proper case will intervene, without waiting for intermediate statutory remedies to be exhausted.\u2019 In the <em>Koven </em>case the court entertained a <em>quo warranto </em>proceeding to determine the title to office of members of a school board without awaiting determination of the double appeal to the Commissioner and the State Board of Education. After expressing his thought that the administrative tribunals could not take dispositive action on the issue presented Justice Swayze said: \u2018I think it clear that where so important a question as the title of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>members of a school board to their office is involved, a proper exercise of discretion permits, if it does not require, the speedy adoption of the only final and effective procedure to determine the question.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The court, in <em>Waldor, </em>allowed the matter to proceed even though the plaintiff had not exhausted his administrative remedies because (as indicated at <em>page </em>193) <em>\u201c* </em>* * \u2022 the matter was of importance to the community and expeditious determination was directly in the public interest.\u201d The court also concluded (at <em>page </em>192) that the matter \u201c* * * did not involve any questions of administrative policy, discretion or judgment.\u201d Similarly, this matter is of extreme importance to all connected with the City of Elizabeth, and expeditious determination is imperative, particularly where, as here, the budget and the tax ordinance are affected. Moreover, the questions involved do not concern any administrative policy, discretion or judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In <em>Nolan v. Fitzpalrick, </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>477 (1952), the situation was somewhat analogous to that presented here. In the case at bar, the plaintiffs are seeking a determination compelling the City of Elizabeth to make an appropriation certified to it by the board of school estimate. In the <em>Nolan </em>case certain members of the Boulevard Commissioners of the County of Hudson brought an action in lieu of prerogative writs to compel the Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Hudson to raise a certain amount certified to such board of chosen freeholders by the boulevard commissioners. The court ultimately held that the defendant board was to appropriate immediately the funds requisitioned by the plaintiff commissioners. Regarding the contention that the plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies, the late Chief Justice Vanderbilt, speaking for the court, said as follows (at <em>pages </em>486-487) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">\u201c# * * On the contrary, whenever the rule of exhaustion of remedies is asserted as a defense in a proceeding in lieu of prerogative writ <em>Rule </em>8:81-14 both expressly and in spirit calls for a determination as to whether or not the interests of justice require an exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>What are the requirements of justice in the instant ease? The question presented in this ease is solely one of law. Any determination of that question either by the Director of the Division of Local Government, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:2-53, or by the Division of Local Government, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:27BB, would clearly be subject to judicial review, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:2-53 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:27BB-20. On such judicial review of a question of law the opinions of these administrative tribunals would not be persuasive as they would be on questions of fact within their purview. The only result of requiring an exhaustion of administrative remedies whore only a question of law is in issue would be useless delay, and this in the interest of justice cannot be countenanced. The case thus presents another instance <em>(i. </em>e., where the disposition of the matter depends solely on the decision of a question of law) in addition to tile two situations specifically stated in <em>Ward v. Keenan </em>where under <em>Rule </em>3:81-14 the interests of justice do not require the exhaustion of administrative remedies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">What was said above in <em>Nolan </em>is equally applicable to the case at bar. The question involved in this case is solely a question of law. The only result of requiring an exhaustion of administrative remedies would be useless delay. Therefore, because of the nature of the matter and because the question is solely one of law, this court will proceed and determine the proper construction of <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Defendants in their answer have attacked, in effect, the right of plaintiffs to raise the question of the validity of the action of the defendant City of Elizabeth in appropriating the sum of $6,308,248.71. The defendants allege this in substance in their first, second, third and eighth separate defenses. Plaintiffs contend that they have been or will he injured by the action of defendants, and that consequently plaintiffs have a clear right to question the legality of such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Plaintiffs are tenure teachers employed by the Elizabeth Board of Education. Included in the budget in the amount of $6,308,248.71 were certain increments that plaintiffs, together with all the other teachers, were to receive if the city had appropriated the aforesaid sum. By reason of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>failure of the City of Elizabeth to appropriate this sum, they will not get these increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">There has been in recent years a more liberal judicial response to an attack of alleged improper public actions. For example, in <em>Koons v. Board of Com\u2019rs of Atlantic City, </em>134 N. <em>J. L. </em>329 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1946), the court ultimately held that a resident of a municipality, even though she was not a property taxpayer, could, by means of a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>question a sales tax. At <em>page </em>338 Justice Heher pointed out the determining factor as to the status of a plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">\u201cThe determinative question is whether the challenger has sustained, or is in immediate danger of sustaining, some direct and certain injury as the result of the enforcement of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The policy of our Supreme Court may be seen in <em>Walker, Inc. v. Borough of Stanhope, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>657 (1957), where the court decided that the potential loss of business by a businessman was sufficient to give him enough interest to enable him to challenge in a prerogative writ proceeding a certain ordinance even though he was neither a citizen nor a taxpayer of the municipality enacting such ordinance. In reaching this decision Justice Jacobs indicated (at <em>page </em>661) the significance of the prerogative writ in our State as a safeguard against wrongful official action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">\u201cIn our State, perhaps more than any other, the prerogative writ has been broadly made available as a comprehensive safeguard against wrongful official action. <em>Garrou v. Teaneck Tryon Co., </em>11 <em>N. J. </em>294, 302 (1953). In <em>Gimbel v. Peabody, </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>574, 577 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935) the plaintiff obtained a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review proceedings by the Township of Pennsauken and others for the operation of a greyhound racing track in the township. The court set aside the proceedings as violative of the anti-gambling provisions of the Constitution; with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s capacity to sue, it remarked that he had the standing of a citizen and taxpayer and that measures \u2018to test the legality of proceedings in direct violation of the fundamental law of the state should be liberally granted.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">And at <em>page </em>666 the court concluded, as indicated above, that the plaintiff had sufficient standing to raise the question involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\u201cWe are satisfied that, under the particular circumstances presented in the instant matter, the plaintiff may fairly be deemed to have a sufficient standing to maintain its action. There has been real and substantial interference with its business and the serious legal questions it has raised should, in the interest of the public as well as the plaintiff, be passed upon without undue delay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">And in <em>Elizabeth Federal S. &amp; L. Ass\u2019n v. Howell, </em>24 <em>N. J. </em>488 (1957), the late Chief Justice Vanderbilt again emphasized, at <em>pages </em>500-501, the liberal approach of the court regarding the use of the prerogative writ as a form of protection against improper official action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">\u201cEarly in our judicial history the courts of this State in almost every respect took a more liberal view of the province of the prerogative writ of <em>certiorari </em>than the courts of any other state, <em>Goodnow, \u2018The Writ of Certiorari,\u2019 </em>6 <em>Pol. Sc. Q. </em>493, 510, 526 (1891). The New Jersey courts extended the scope of <em>certiorari </em>far beyond its limited use at common law to review judicial acts, so as to include g\u00abosi-judieial, g\u00ab&lt;m-legislative, administrative and municipal action. Notwithstanding this liberal tradition, this form of protection against improper official action was further broadened by the <em>Constitution of </em>1947, <em>Art. </em>VI, <em>Sec. </em>V, <em>par. </em>4, to make its relief available as a matter of right and not only as a matter of discretion. <em>Ward v. Keenan, </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>298, 302-309 (1949).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Certainly what has been indicated above is applicable here. There can be no question that plaintiffs stand to suffer financially if the public actions of defendants are not questioned. Consequently, plaintiffs certainly have a direct financial interest in this matter. This interest, when coupled with the important public questions involved, gives plaintiffs standing to obtain a determination of the meaning of <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53. Furthermore, this suit is not based on any alleged improper actions of the board of education. This action is based on the alleged improper actions of the board of school estimate and the City Council of the City of Elizabeth. Thus the board of school estimate and the City of Elizabeth are proper parties. The board of education would not be a proper party.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Plaintiffs contend that the 1%% limitation in <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53 applies only to the true valuation of ratables of the City of Elizabeth as determined by the Union County Board of Taxation. This amount for the year 1961 was in the amount of $433,817,887, and thus the sum certified by the board of school estimate of $6,308,248.71 was less than 1 <em>y%% </em>of the above amount. Thus it was mandatory under <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53 for the city council to appropriate this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">On the other hand, defendants contend that the \u201cassessable\u201d ratables for the year 1961 were $156,589,858, so that the amount requested by the board of school estimate was in excess of 1%% of that sum, and therefore required the concurrence and consent of the governing body. If the refers to the total assessments made by the City of Elizabeth, then the defendants are correct and the consent and concurrence of the governing body are necessary for the appropriation of the amount in coni 'oversy. If, on the other hand, the 1%% refers to the tr^e value of the ratables as determined by the Union County Board of Taxation\u2014as plaintiffs contend\u2014then the City of Elizabeth had no choice but to appropriate the amount certified to it by the board of school estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\"><em>R. S. </em>18:6-53 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">\u201cThe governing body of a municipality shall upon receipt of the notice, appropriate the amount certified as provided in sections 18:6-50 and 18:6-51 of this title, as the case may be, by including it in the tax ordinance, and such amount shall be assessed, levied and collected in the same manner as money appropriated for other purposes in such municipality is assessed, levied and collected. <em>No amount in excess of one and one-half per cent of the valuation of the assessable ratables of any municipality as determined by the county board of taxation shall be appropriated except with the concurrence and consent of the governing body expressed by its resolution duly passed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The controversy settled on the last sentence of the paragraph. The plaintiffs interpret the term \u201c* * * the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>valuation of assessable ratables of any municipality as determined by the county board of taxation * * *\u201d as meaning the \u201ctrue value\u201d of said ratables.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The defendants construe the clause as meaning the valuation of \u201cassessed ratables\u201d of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The statute must be read in its entirety, and the first section of the statute <em>(R. S. </em>18:6-53) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">\u201cThe governing body of a municipality shall upon receipt of the notice, appropriate the amount certified as provided in sections 18:6-50 and 18:6-51 of this title, as the case may be, by including it in the tax ordinance, <em>and such amount shall he assessed, levied and collected in the same manner as money appropriated for other purposes in such municipality is assessed, levied and collected.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">If the amount to be appropriated is to be assessed, levied and collected in the same manner as money appropriated for other purposes in such municipality is assessed, levied and collected, then it is clear that the appropriations for school monies must be provided for in the same manner and using the same measure as is used in the appropriation of monies for other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">Further, the Union County Hoard of Taxation fixed and determined that the \u201cnet valuation on which taxes are apportioned\u201d shall be $433,817,877, and this amounts to nothing more than an equalization of value upon which the expense for running a county government shall be apportioned and is not a measure for the support of the city government. On the contrary, the measure used for the support of the city government is the assessed ratables originally determined by the local assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">The Elizabeth school district and the City of Elizabeth are synonymous. The city alone supports its school system, in contrast to some school districts which are consolidated school districts with two or more municipalities sharing the cost. The Elizabeth school district is known in educational circles as a <em>chapter </em>VI District because the school district and the municipality are one and the same, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>is operated under the provisions of <em>chapter </em>VI of <em>Title </em>18. The city assesses, levies and collects taxes for all other purposes, and the amount of money so collected in taxes is determined and fixed at the municipal level, and all appropriations for the expenditure of the city monies are based upon it. <em>R. S. </em>18:6\u201453 clearly and unequivocally states that the amount provided for school purposes shall be provided for in the same manner as other money is provided for. The language is clear, and if the construction of the statute were otherwise, the city would be compelled to appropriate money using one method for all other purposes and a different method for school purposes. Such a situation would throw the entire financial structure of the city and other cities operating under <em>chapter </em>VI out of balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Plaintiffs contend that the term \u201cvaluation of the assessable ratables\u201d means \u201ctrue value.\u201d However, the statute does not state \u201ctrue value,\u201d and the words \u201ctrue valuation\u201d are not used in the statute. Neither does the statute use the term \u201cnet valuation on which county taxes are apportioned.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>defines \u201cvaluation\u201d as \u201can estimated worth or price, estimation\u201d; and <em>Blade\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u201cvaluation\u201d as the \u201cact of ascertaining the worth of a thing; the estimated worth of a thing.\u201d The term \u201cassessable property of the town\u201d means all property in the town liable to be assessed for the purpose of taxation. <em>Weber v. Probey, </em>125 <em>Md. </em>544, 94 <em>A. </em>162, 165 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1915); 4 <em>Words and </em>Phrases, <em>p. </em>414. So that the term \u201cvaluation of assessable ratables of any municipality\u201d\u2014in the absence .of the term \u201ctrue valuation\u201d or \u201cnet valuation on which county taxes are apportioned\u201d \u2014means an estimate of the ratables in the municipality liable to be assessed for the purpose of taxation. This definition is more general than and is not restricted to \u201ctrue value\u201d which has been defined in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:1-35.3 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\u201cTrue value for the purposes of this act shall be deemed to be a valuation at current market prices or values, determined in such manner as the director may in his discretion select. The director shall determine the ratio of aggregate assessed to aggregate true valuation of real estate of each taxing district.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Thus it is evident that true value is \u201cvaluation at current market prices or values\u201d and aggregate \u201cassessed valuation\u201d is different from aggregate \u201ctrue valuation\u201d and the word \u201cvaluation\u201d is not limited or restricted to \u201ctrue valuation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"> On the other hand, the terms \u201cassessable\u201d and \u201cvaluation o\u00ed assessed\u201d have similar meanings. The term \u201cassessed\u201d is equivalent to the term \u201cimposed.\u201d <em>Town of Brandon v. Harvey, </em>105 <em>Vt. </em>435, 168 <em>A. </em>708, 710 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1933); 4 <em>Words and Phrases, p. </em>415. An \u201cassessment\u201d of real or personal property is an official estimate of the values which are to constitute the basis of an apportionment of a tax. <em>Village of Ridgefield Park v. Bergen County Board of Taxation, </em>61 <em>N. J. Super. </em>170 <em>(Law Div. </em>1960). An \u201cassessment\u201d is value placed on property to which the rate per cent is applied to reach the amount of taxes required by local taxing authorities. <em>People ex rel. Ingram v. Wasson Goal Co., </em>403 <em>Ill. </em>30, 85 <em>N. E. 2d </em>182, 185 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1949). So it would seem that the definition of \u201cassessed\u201d or \u201cassessments\u201d would be more in harmony with the term \u201cassessable\u201d than is \u201ctrue value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The county board of taxation must determine the valuation of the assessable ratables. The county board of taxation must not only equalize the value of taxable property, but must also correct the list of assessable ratables by including any taxable property omitted from assessment. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:3-20; <em>R. S. </em>54:4-58. Therefore, the language of <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53 should be construed to mean a valuation originally determined by local authorities, of property included on the list of assessable ratables as finally determined by the county board of taxation. Assessments levied on property in the assessors\u2019 duplicate are not complete until the county board of taxation certifies the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>assessors\u2019 duplicate to the tax collector. <em>Hackensach Water Co. v. Division of Tax Appeals, </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>157 (1949). Indeed, if the Legislature intended that the valuation be that of the local board, this is the only way in which the said language can be interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">To construe certain words in a statute, the entire statute must be read and considered as a whole. <em>Denbo v. Moorestown Township, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>476 (1957). A unitary reading of <em>R. S. </em>18:6\u201453 indicates that the basic reason for its existence is to direct the governing bodies of municipalities to appropriate, without question, the amount of the certified school budget. It further directs that the money for such appropriation is to be obtained by the same means as money appropriated for other purposes, namely, by taxes based upon local property valuations. Ho discretionary powers are instilled in the governing bodies with regard to this matter. <em>Townsend v. State Board of Education, </em>88 <em>N. J. L. 97 (Sup. Ct. </em>1915). However, the second sentence of <em>R. S. </em>18:6\u201453, the sentence with which we are primarily concerned, imposes a limitation on this mandatory directive. It would seem that this limitation has been imposed to prevent the board of' education or the board of school estimate from forcing upon the municipal governing body a budget which, by virtue of its size, would overburden the financial resources of the municipality. To use as a norm for this limitation a figure other than the one upon which the municipality\u2019s revenue depends (including that portion appropriated for the school budget) could place an undue burden on the financial resources of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\"> A limitation on appropriations similar to the one under discussion is found in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18:6-62. The limitation contained therein is concerned with money appropriated for school buildings and land and is that no amount shall be appropriated in excess of 3 % of the average assessed valuation of property as defined in said <em>section </em>18:5\u201488 in the district except with the concurrence and consent of the governing body, and <em>section </em>18:5\u201488 defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the \u201caverage assessed valuation of property\u201d in a school district comprising one municipality as \u201cthe average of three next preceding assessed valuations of the taxable real property * * * of the municipality * * Assessed valuations are made on the local level (see <em>Essex County Park Comm. v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, </em>58 <em>N. J. Super. </em>93 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959), where the court distinguishes between the terms \u201cassessed valuation\u201d and \u201ctrue value\u201d). The court at <em>page </em>101 states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">\u201cThere is legislative recognition here that \u2018assessed valuation\u2019 and \u2018true value\u2019 are not the same thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">This section <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>18 :6-62) is comparable to <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53 and should therefore bear upon the construction of the latter. Statutes constituting a system should be so construed as to make that system consistent in its parts and uniform in its operation. Where statutes are part of a general system relating to the same class of subjects and rest upon the same reasons, they should be construed if possible so as to be uniform in their application and in the results which they accomplish and statutes upon cognate subjects may be referred to though not strictly <em>in pari materia. </em>2 <em>Sutherland, Statutory Construction (2d ed.), sec. </em>443, <em>pp. </em>847, 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The board of school estimate is required by the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18:6-50 to fix and determine the amount necessary for the school appropriation by February 15 of each year. Under the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:3\u201418 the valuation figures prepared by the county board of taxation are not required to be completed before March 10 of each year, and this includes the figures under column 7 of P\u20142, entitled \u201cNet Valuation Taxable including Second-Class Railroad Property,\u201d which consists of the ratables assessed locally.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">This would seem to indicate that the board of school estimate woidd be forced to certify an appropriation without the use of the final county figure. See <em>Essex County Park </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>Comm. v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, supra, </em>at <em>page </em>107. This would be the situation if <em>R. S. 18:6-53 </em>provided that the determination of the county board of taxation should be the determination for that particular year. However, the statute is silent as to this. This permits the board of school estimate to use the determination of the county board of taxation for that particular year; or, if the final county figures are not ready, then the determination of the county board of taxation for the preceding year may be used. As stated above, the phrase \u201cas determined by the county board of taxation\u201d imposes a limitation on the mandatory directive of <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53 and it would seem that this limitation has been imposed to prevent the board of education and the board of school estimate from forcing upon the municipal governing body a budget which by virtue of its size would overburden the financial resources of a municipality. A construction that will render any part of a statute inoperative, superfluous or meaningless is to be avoided, <em>State v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>38 (1956), and it is fundamental to statutory construction that a statute be construed as a whole and, if possible, full effect must be given to all its parts. <em>Tagmire v. Atlantic City, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>11 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955). Thus, the phrase \u201cas determined by the county board of taxation\u201d must be considered in construing the statute, <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Defendants argue that the valuation, or equalization, by the county tax board is merely for the purpose of equitable apportionment of the costs of county government. A review of the pertinent statutes and of eases dealing with the matter indicates this argument to be cogent. <em>N. J. S. A. 54:4-49 </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">\u201c\u00ab! * Si each county board of taxation, after * * * having equalized the aggregate valuations of all the real property in the respective taxing districts * * * shall * * * apportion the amount to be raised in the respective taxing districts for State, State school, county and free county library purposes and for purposes of regional and consolidated school districts and school districts com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>prising 2 or more taxing districts, on the basis of the total valuation so ascertained for each taxing district.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In the <em>Essex County Park Commission </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the court was construing <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:37-15.1, which requires that the fund appropriated for the maintenance of public parks and roads shall not be \u201cless than one-half of one mill on the dollar, nor more than one mill on the dollar of the assessed valuation of the taxable ratables of the county.\u201d The issue in that case, like the present case, was concerned with whether the valuation to be used in the formula should be that made on the local level or that of the county board of taxation. The court, in deciding that local assessments were the proper norm, on <em>page </em>102 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">\u201cTlie legislative purpose in enacting the equalization statute was clearly to limit the use of the equalization table to apportionment situations. As the Law Division judge observed, the present ease is not one of apportionment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In <em>Maplewood Township v. Essex County Board of Taxation, </em>39 <em>N. J. Super. </em>202 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956), and again in <em>Berkeley Heights Township v. Union County Regional Board of Education, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>276 (1957), it was held that the county board\u2019s equalization tables should be used for apportionment purposes in order to effect an equitable distribution of such expenses. Both of these cases were concerned with an apportionment of school costs among members of a common school district. Furthermore, in <em>Berkeley Heights v. Union County Regional Board of Education, supra, </em>the decision of the court was based on \u201capportionment valuations,\u201d the latter term being arithmetically defined in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:4-49 <em>(L. </em>1956, c. 93, <em>sec. </em>2) as a figure attained after equalization of the district aggregate, and the amendments placed the responsibility for apportionment upon county tax boards rather than regional school boards. The statute in the case at bar does not use the term \u201capportionment valuations,\u201d and this is not a case of apportionment of expense of a joint school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>endeavor upon the basis of the local assessors\u2019 aggregate valuation, as was the case in Berkeley, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">A review of the legislative history of <em>R. S. </em>18:6-53 shows that the source of this statute was <em>L. </em>1903, c. 1, <em>art. </em>VI, <em>sec. 75, </em>which in part provided that any amount in excess of three-quarters of one per cent of the <em>taxable valuation </em>of the real and personal property shall be appropriated only with the concurrence and consent of said common council, board of finance or other body expressed by its resolution duly passed. Thus the original statutes use the term \u201ctaxable valuation.\u201d Other amendments such as <em>L. </em>1919, <em>art. </em>VI, <em>sec. 75, </em>and <em>L. </em>1922, c. 243, <em>sec. </em>75, used the same language but made changes in the dates. However, on March 15, 1922, <em>L. </em>1922, c. 248, was enacted, which provided that any amount in excess of three-quarters of one per cent <em>of the valuation of the assessable ratables </em>of such city as determined by the county board of taxation of the county in which said city is situated shall be appropriated only with the concurrence and consent of said common council, board of finance, or other body by its resolution duly passed. In this amendment the words \u201ctaxable valuation\u201d were eliminated and the term \u201cvaluation of the assessable ratables of such city as determined by the county board of taxation, of the county in which said city is situated\u201d were substituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><em>L. </em>1925, <em>c. </em>236, was an amendment which increased the percentage from three-quarters of one per cent to one and one-half per cent. It is significant that the statement attached to this amendment when it was introduced reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">\u201cThe purpose of this bill is to allow the Board of School Estimate in a city school district to fix and determine the amount for the annual school budget up to one and one-half per centum of the <em>assessed </em>valuations instead of three-quarters of one per centum as heretofore, which sum shall be mandatory for the governing body of a city to appropriate.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>It must be noted that the statement uses the words \u201cassessed valuations\u201d after <em>L. </em>1922, c. 248, had been in effect for a period of approximately three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Other amendments, <em>L. </em>1933, <em>cc. </em>28 and 400, used the same language as that of <em>L. </em>1922, c. 248. Thus a review of the history of the statute and its amendments as well as the statement set out above reveals that the legislative intention was to use the term \u201cvaluation\u201d generally, and to base the 1%% on the valuation of the \u201cassessed ratables\u201d and not on the \u201ctrue valuation\u201d of the ratables or the \u201cnet valuation\u201d of the ratables on which county taxes are apportioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">When the words of a statute are susceptible of two meanings, the one favorable and the other hostile to its principal design, the former should prevail and control the construction, and in construing constitutional and statutory provisions the court has rightly recognized that since words are inexact tools at best, resort may freely be had to the pertinent constitutional and legislative history for aid in ascertaining the true sense and meaning of the language used. <em>Lloyd v. Vermeulen, </em>22 <em>N. J. </em>200, 205, 206 (1956). The judicial goal is to carry out fairly legislative purpose and plan, and history and contemporaneous construction may well furnish important light as to that purpose and plan. <em>New Jersey Pharmaceutical Ass\u2019n v. Furman, </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>121 (1960). See also <em>Town of Brandon v. Harvey, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Furthermore, the introducer\u2019s statement that was appended to <em>L. </em>1925, <em>c. </em>236, with reference to \u201cassessed\u201d valuations is relevant evidence on any proper issue as to the legislative intent, although a considered judgment must be exercised in determining the weight to be attached to it. <em>Morris &amp; Essex Investment Co. v. Director of Division of Taxation, </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>24, 33, 34 (1960): <em>Deaney v. Linen Thread Co., </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>578 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">When the board of school estimate certified the sum of $6,308,248.11, that sum was in excess of 1%% of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>assessed ratables of the city, which amounted to $156,589,858 (see column 7, p. 2), and therefore required the concurrence and consent of the city council. The city council referred the certificate to a committee of the whole, and while it was in committee the board of school estimate rescinded its certificate and on March 28, 1961 forwarded a second certificate to the city council, which certificate was concurred in and consented to by the city council and was included in the 1961 budget, and the budget with the inclusion of the school monies was approved by the Director of the Division of Local Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">It was pointed out in the oral argument that as a result of the change of government of the City of Elizabeth on January 1, 1961 all city affairs were undergoing a transition period, and obviously the completion of many tasks was unavoidably delayed; therefore, the municipal budget was not forwarded to the Director of the Division of Local Government until after the time provided for in the statute, and the local budget, which included in it monies appropriated for school purposes, was approved by the Director of Local Government upon receiving explanation for the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The time limits fixed in the statute covering county and municipal budgets, <em>R. S. </em>40:2-5, etc., and <em>R. S. </em>18:6\u201451 concerning school districts, were designed for an orderly preparation and completion of the <em>county and municipal budgets. </em>In accordance with the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18:6\u201450 the board of school estimate did, not later than February 15, 1961 (on February 14, 1961), fix and determine the amount of money necessary to be appropriated and made out the two necessary certificates. It was only after the city council on February 28, 1961 voted not to appropriate the amount certified which exceeded the 1 %% as set out above that the board of school estimate reconsidered and reduced the amount to $6,147,739.86 on March 28, 1961, which amount was concurred in and consented to by the city council on the same date. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>board of school estimate did comply with the statute when it submitted its original estimation on February 14, 1961. The Director of Local Government has ample power and authority to enforce the time provisions, and in this case after due explanation of the delay he certified the budget in accordance with <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:2-10.1 which gives him the authority to receive, examine and certify any county or municipal budget beyond the time limits prescribed by statute, provided satisfactory reasons for the delay are submitted. The plaintiffs have not been harmed in any way by the delay and cannot attack the submission and certification of the budget on this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Furthermore, in <em>Townsend v. State Board of Education, </em>88 <em>N. J. L. 97 (Sup. Ct. </em>1915), the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">\u201cThe certificate of a board of school estimate to the municipal board or council, required by <em>section </em>75 of the School Act (4 <em>Comp. St., p. </em>4746) is a certificate of the total amount required for the purposes specified in <em>section 74, </em>and not of the specific items to which such amount is applicable; and said total, when certified and appropriated, is at the disposal of the board of education for such application within the provisions of the act as said board chooses to make it, in whole or in part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Therefore, it would seem that the action of the board of school estimate is a necessary action in order to provide money for the public schools; that the submission of a certificate to the city council and the concurrence and consent by the city council, and the final approval by the Director of the Division of Local Government was in accordance with the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">During the course of the oral argument a discussion was held by the court and counsel as to the practice in other municipalities. The information available was rather indefinite, and it was also pointed out that the practice was not uniform throughout the State. With reference to this the defendant submitted the following affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cSTATE OF NEW JERSE<em>Y </em>COUNTY OF MERCER ) SS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">RUTH H.

It was found that the majority of these Districts under current restrictions must apply to the governing body for consent, since most local appropriations exceed 1%% of the assessed ratables.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">Conceivably the original intent of the law meant to apply to budgets which exceeded 1 %% of true value. Thirty years or more of use has made the local level of assessment the measure. The Committee then made a study of the effect of <em>!Vz% </em>and 2% of true value on local appropriations. The enclosed study shows that sixteen districts would still be over their limit if 1%% of true value were used and three districts would need the consent of the governing body even if 2% of true value was adopted. The Committee therefore submitted the following recommendations for legislative amendment to the Executive Committee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">1. Budget limitations in Chapter VI Districts should be based on true value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">2. The percentage should be raised from 1 %% to <em>2%.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">3. Budgets needing the consent of the governing body would automatically be referred to the Commissioner of Education in cases where the governing body and the Board of School Estimate could not reach agreement by March 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">The Committee felt that these provisions would give greater fiscal independence to boards in Chapter VI districts and would provide redress where a stalemate existed between two bodies responsible for setting the amount for budgets which exceeded the new limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">Sworn and subscribed before me this 30th day of April 1961 ) RUTH H.
