A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqvd\">Since the argument on appeal in this workmen\u2019s compensation heart case, <em>Dwyer v. Ford Motor Company, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>487 (1962) has been decided. Our study of the present record, and applying the principle enunciated in <em>Dwyer </em>that \u201ccompensability arises whenever the required exertion is too great for the man undertaking the work, whatever the degree of exertion or condition of his heart,\u201d impels this court to reverse the judgment of the Atlantic County Court which affirmed the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The statement of the proffered facts, depositional and testimonial, detailed at length in the opinion of the judge of compensation, is not assailed; in r\u00e9sum\u00e9:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">As to the Alleged \u201cClose Accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Petitioner Charles Bacon, 49 years of age, was a bus driver for the respondent Atlantic City Transportation Companjq operator of a public utility transportation line on Absecon Island and elsewhere. He had been an employee of that company for approximately 15 years, and for some time operated a passenger bus in the Atlantic City area.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>On the morning of June 16, 1958 (a Monday) he commenced duty at 6:30 A. m., completing five local runs by 1:45 p. m. He rested before starting, at 2:55 i\\ m., on the last trip of the day, characterized as the \"school time trip,\u201d which was along Atlantic Avenue (the main artery of travel) from the depot at the Inlet to the Franklin Avenue station at \"7800 Margate.\u201d Upon reaching Tennessee and Atlantic Avenues (17 blocks from the Inlet), the bus stopped in front of City Hall; he \"loaded\u201d the passengers into the bus and was just pulling away from the curb line when a car approaching from the rear made a sudden right-hand turn directly in front of him. He (Bacon) quickly applied his brakes and swerved the steering wheel \u201creal hard to the right in order to avoid the ear hitting me, or mo hitting the car\u201d; there was no collision but \"it was a near accident\u201d; ho then had to pull the steering wheel to the left with a great effort to get back in the bus lane. Petitioner claimed that at this particular moment he \u201cbroke out in a terrific sweat,\u201d experiencing excruciating pain across his chest and back, with burning pains down both arms, and that he was nauseated \"in his stomach\u201d; he pulled to the side of Tennessee Avenue in order to get out of traffic, rested for a few seconds, and then proceeded to go on with his route.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">At the Franklin Avenue station he became sick. He \"felt terrible\u201d and was \"in great pain\u201d but, notwithstanding, he continued to make the return trip\u2014carrying out his usual duties, discharging and picking up passengers, maneuvering through traffic\u2014and finished the run without mishap. At Michigan Avenue Lawrence Beritelli, a neighbor, boarded the bus as a passenger and observed that petitioner \u201clooked sick to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Upon arrival at the bus terminal at the Inlet shortly after 4 r. si., he again experienced a stomach upset and rested for a while in the trainmen\u2019s room before walking home, about two blocks, unassisted. He made no official report of the alleged \u201cnear accident,\u201d although he gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>testimony concerning a conversation 'with, two fellow employees (then bus drivers), Charles Helder and Russell Hutchinson, to whom he complained that he was very sick and to whom he explained that he had had a \u201cnear accident\u201d on Tennessee Avenue near City Hall. They offered to drive him home, which offer he refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Petitioner\u2019s wife returned home from work about 5 p. m. and found him in bed. She testified that he appeared to be in great pain; that she called Harry Coombs, a dispatcher for the respondent company, and reported to him that her husband got sick on the bus while at work and that she was about to call the doctor, which she did. The following day petitioner was taken to the Atlantic City Hospital. Bacon claims that while waiting for the ambulance, he telephoned Raymond Stark, superintendent of the transportation company, and informed him about the close accident of the preceding day. Stark admitted a conversation, but averred Bacon said he was going \u201cto the hospital on account of his heart condition\u201d and that he made no mention of a \u201cclose accident.\u201d No reference to a traffic incident is to be found in the hospital records. The history report dated June 17, 1958 indicates that the onset of Bacon\u2019s condition occurred three days prior to his admission to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Neither the Division nor the County Court was convinced that petitioner had established the happening of a \u201cclose\u201d or a \u201cnear\u201d accident. The only evidence of the alleged traffic episode came from the lips of petitioner. He could not describe nor identify the ear involved other than it was black; several passengers were aboard his vehicle, but none of them was produced as a witness; the incident occurred in front of City Hall and he continued the journey of an additional 14=0 blocks without making any effort to obtain assistance\u2014we note a phone booth was available at the Franklin Avenue station.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The conduct of petitioner was at odds with an expected normal behavior pattern of a victim suffering from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>a sudden heart attack. \u201cOne\u2019s actions are more significant than one\u2019s words uttered after the event in support of one\u2019s cause.\u201d <em>Steinbrugge v. Steinbrugge, 2 N. J. </em>77, 82 (1949). The self-serving declarations of Bacon did not fall within the <em>res gestae </em>exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Murphy v. George Brown &amp; Co., </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>412, 416 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1918), cited approvingly in <em>State v. Stephan, </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>592, 602 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1937); <em>Hagopian v. Fuchs, </em>66 <em>N. J. Super. </em>374, 383 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961). Said the judge of compensation: \u201c* * * the Petitioner\u2019s story does not stand up under the glare of other testimony of all the circumstances and I feel that he has failed to prove by the greater weight of credible testimony that he has suffered an injury which arose out of his employment with the Respondent.\u201d The County Court found only \u201cordinary physical effort of petitioner\u2019s day by day job and doubt as to when the attack did occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">IT.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The Medicad Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">As early as September 1955 petitioner began to experience pains across his chest, which were diagnosed as angina pectoris by Dr. Samuel A. Shuster, who had been the family physician for approximately 15 years. Electrocardiographic tests were negative. Nitroglycerin was prescribed for the patient and he was advised \u201cto lose weight, smoke less, change his job and to return in six months for a checkup.\u201d Periodically since that time, petitioner revisited Dr. Shuster with similar symptomatic complaints and was treated for a heart condition. In 1957 the doctor again suggested that he \u201cchange the type of work he was doing.\u201d On May 16, 1958 Bacon reported to the doctor \u201cthat he had been getting pains in the chest more severely and more frequently and they were of longer duration and they were still occurring only while at work.\u201d The next time the doctor saw him was on June 16, 1958, the night of the alleged \u201cnear acei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>dent.\u201d The physician\u2019s impression was that his patient had an attack of \u201cangina, but it might have been some severe myorcardial [sic] insufficiency.\u201d He was given demerol. The following morning petitioner was hospitalized (for over three weeks) and his condition diagnosed as \u201cacute posterior coronary thrombosis.\u201d On January 6, 1959 he was rehospitalized and put on medication. He was discharged on January 22 as totally disabled\u2014\u201call we could hope to do was to try to keep him comfortable and alive as long as we could with the anticoagulants and the other medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Dr. Irving C. Shavelson, a specialist in cardiovascular diseases, examined Bacon at the request of Dr. Shuster and testified that he considered the employment and the incident of June 16, 1958 to be \u201ca competent producing cause\u201d of his condition and disability. This opinion was based upon his examination, taking into consideration the patient\u2019s history and subjective complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Respondent produced as an expert witness Dr. Levi Walker whose practice was limited to cardiology. His examination on November 18, 1959 revealed the patient to be totally disabled and that he had a well-healed myocardial infarction \u201cwhich was no doubt the residual of the acute infarction that was noted on June 17 when he was admitted to the hospital first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Petitioner\u2019s disability is unquestioned; likewise, the fact that he had a pre-existing heart condition since 1955. Work-associated causation is the central issue. Reliance was placed upon the cases recognizing the \u201cpresumption\u201d that disability resulted from \u201cnatural physiological causes\u201d; the principles declared in <em>Ciuba v. Irvington Varnish &amp; Insulator </em>Co., 27 <em>N. J. </em>127 (1958), <em>Loew v. Borough of Union </em>Beach, 56 <em>N. J. Super. </em>93 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959), certif. denied 31 <em>N. J. </em>75 (1959), and <em>Jacobs v. </em>Kaplan, 56 <em>N. J. Super. </em>157 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959); and this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Dwyer v. Ford Motor Company, </em>66 <em>N. J. Super. </em>469 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961). These authorities were extensively considered and reappraised by Justice Francis in his majority opinion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>our Supreme Court in <em>Dwyer v. Ford Motor Company, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>487 (1962), reversing <em>Dwyer, supra </em>(66 <em>N. J. Super. </em>469). They need not be here reviewed. This is an intermediate appellate tribunal, bound by the final determinations of our Supreme Court. <em>Kream v. Public Service Coordinated Transport, </em>42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>307 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956), affirmed 24 <em>N. J. </em>432 (1957), <em>cert. </em>denied 355 <em>U. S. </em>864, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>97, 2 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>69 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Subsequent to oral argument of the case at bar, counsel for the parties have submitted correspondence stating their respective views concerning the application of the recent decision in <em>Dwyer. We </em>do not agree with respondent that \u201c[tjhere is no proof in this case within the holding of the Dwyer case, that the petitioner\u2019s heart condition was the result of anything dealing with his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">It was not necessary that petitioner establish a \u201cnear accident\u201d to qualify for workmen\u2019s compensation coverage. The competent evidence in the record, reviewed as a whole, preponderates in support of the hypothesis that petitioner\u2019s bus driving activities precipitated, aggravated or accelerated an existing heart disease in an appreciable degree, <em>i. e., </em>\u201ca degree greater than <em>de minimis\u201d </em>within the meaning of <em>Dwyer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Accordingly, we hold that petitioner is entitled to an award and that the judgment of the County Court should, be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
