During Fuentes\u2019s trial, the jury heard evidence that Fuentes practiced medicine without a physician\u2019s license, wrote prescriptions without authorization, obtained health insurance policies with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, Inc. (\u201cBCBS\u201d) by using his patients\u2019 personal information, and without their knowledge or consent, and fraudulently billed BCBS for procedures that were never performed. The government\u2019s last witness, Special Agent Maximilian Trimm, testified over objection that, in his opinion, Fuentes\u2019s clinic was not a lawful business. The district court, after initially overruling Fuentes\u2019s objection and allowing the testimony, reversed itself, sustained the objection, and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony. The jury convicted Fuentes on all counts. On appeal, Fuentes argues that the district court\u2019s admission of Special Agent Trimm\u2019s testimony constituted an incurable error, and the court\u2019s subsequent curative instruction did not cure the prejudice. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">We review the district court\u2019s admission of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. De La Cruz Suarez, </em>601 F.3d 1202, 1215 (11th Cir.2010). A trial court\u2019s prompt admonishment of the jury to disregard improper testimony can cure an error. <em>United States v. Gabay, </em>923 F.2d 1536, 1541 (11th Cir.1991). Strong evidence of guilt, combined with a trial court\u2019s curative instructions, renders improper testimony harmless error. <em>Id.; cf. United States v. Creamer, </em>721 F.2d 342, 345 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cAlthough the prosecutor acted improperly in the instant case, it was an isolated instance which was cured by the strong, prompt cautionary instruction issued by the district judge, and by the relatively strong evidence of guilt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-19\">To support a conviction for health care fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347, the government must prove that the defendant: (1) knowingly and willfully executed, or attempted to execute, a scheme to (2) defraud a health care benefit program or to obtain by false or fraudulent pretenses money or property under the custody or control of a health care benefit program, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>(3) in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347. A conviction for aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A requires that the defendant knowingly transfer, possess, or use, without lawful authority, another person\u2019s identification while committing certain enumerated felonies, including health care fraud. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1028A(a)(l), (c)(4). Doing any act with respect to a drug, if the act is done while the drug is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce, and results in such article being adulterated or misbranded, is prohibited. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331 (k).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Here, even assuming that the district court erred in belatedly disallowing Special Agent Trimm\u2019s testimony, strong evidence of Fuentes\u2019s guilt, combined with the court\u2019s prompt curative instruction, rendered any error harmless. <em>See Gabay, </em>923 F.2d at 1541. The jury convicted Fuentes after hearing evidence that Fuentes, <em>inter alia, </em>practiced medicine while he had no physician\u2019s license on file with the Florida Department of Health; wrote prescriptions using the names of another doctor and a medical assistant without them authorization or consent; identified himself to patients as a doctor; used his address and the addresses of family members on the BCBS applications; paid the insurance premiums through a separate family-owned business; and fraudulently billed BCBS for millions of dollars in visits, treatments, and diagnoses that did not occur. Finally, in addition to this overwhelming evidence of guilt, the court promptly instructed the jury to disregard Special Agent Trimm\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>649 F.3d 1222, 1237 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201cWe presume that juries follow the instructions given to them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Accordingly, any error in belatedly disallowing the testimony was rendered harmless, and we affirm. <em>See Gabay, </em>923 F.2d at 1541.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
