On appeal, Thomas argues the district court erred in denying her motion to suppress false exculpatory statements she made after invoking her right to counsel under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Thomas further argues the district court\u2019s error was not harmless. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AS4\"><em>A. Thomas\u2019s </em>arrest <em>and, intenvgation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Daisy Thomas was arrested in July 2010 for fraudulent use of a stolen credit card, but police suspected Thomas was involved in, or knew something about, the robberies in which the credit cards were stolen. Thomas was handcuffed, taken into a small room, and interrogated by two law enforcement officers, Detective Neal and Detective Richardson. The Government claims Detectives Neal and Richardson brought Thomas into the interrogation room, advised her of the charges against her, and read Thomas her <em>Miranda </em>rights, at which point Thomas refused to sign the waiver and invoked her right to counsel. The Government claims the detectives then ended the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Video of the interrogation, however, tells a different story. The video shows Thomas invoked her right to counsel almost immediately upon entering the interrogation room, long before the police claim she did. To be precise, at 1 minute and 25 seconds of the video Thomas tells Detectives Neal and Richardson she is \u201cnot talking without a lawyer \u2014 no way.\u201d Rather than ending the interrogation, however, the video shows the detectives continued interrogating Thomas, discussing the case, discussing the benefits of talking, and warning her of the consequences of not talking. In response to Thomas\u2019s request for counsel Detective Richardson pointedly asked \u201c[s]o then you just want to get charged with everything ... without letting us hear your side of it?\u201d Detective Richardson told Thomas her failure to talk without counsel would lead her to being \u201chemmed up with another felony\u201d \u2014 by which Richardson meant Thomas \u201ccould potentially be charged with other offenses from other counties.\u201d The detectives told Thomas \u201cthere are some additional things, some very serious charges\u201d that could be placed on her, and that her \u201cname has come up in some other investigations.\u201d Detective Neal told Thomas they could help her out by making \u201ca simple phone call\u201d to the \u201cstate attorney\u201d if she cooperated \u2014 which necessarily included talking to them without the benefit of the counsel she had requested. The video reveals it was not until Thomas invoked her right to counsel <em>again </em>that the police stopped questioning her, but not before \u201cnot[ing] in passing that they soon would be arresting\u201d Thomas\u2019s boyfriend. The video ends shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">According to the Government, the detectives then moved Thomas from the interrogation room to a holding cell. During her 10 to 15 minutes in the holding cell, Thomas \u201cyelled here and there\u201d and muttered \u201ca few choice swear words,\u201d although she generally said \u201cnothing pertinent.\u201d At one point, however, Thomas yelled \u201cI sure hope you have your facts straight because I wasn\u2019t there. Uh, I hope you\u2019ve done your work, I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Detective Richardson responded \u201cwe\u2019ve done all our work\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ve made a number of arrests\u201d before naming Rykeith Levatte and Antoine Harris as among those arrested. Thomas interrupted Richardson by denying any knowledge of Levatte and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>Harris, yelling that she did not fraternize with juvenile delinquents.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">\n<em>B. The district court\u2019s hearing and verbal order denying Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Thomas was indicted, along with five alleged co-conspirators, for conspiring to commit armed robberies, committing or aiding and abetting the commission of an armed robbery, and brandishing or aiding and abetting the brandishing of a firearm while committing an armed robbery. The indictment alleged Thomas participated in an armed robbery of the \u201cAll About You Hair Salon\u201d on May 11, 2010, and conspired to commit several others between May 11, and June 3, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Prior to trial, Thomas moved to suppress the statements she made from the holding cell. The Government intended to use those statements to establish Thomas knew her alleged co-conspirators, Levatte and Harris, on the theory that she must have known them in order to know they were juveniles. Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress argued the holding-cell statements were barred under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Specifically, the detectives violated the rule in <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981) by interrogating Thomas after she first requested counsel, and therefore her statements from the holding cell \u201cwere irreparably tainted by custodial interrogation.\u201d The Government\u2019s response motion argued Thomas\u2019s false exculpatory remarks from the holding cell were <em>\u201cpost-Miranda </em>spontaneous statements\u201d that \u201cwaived, or relinquished, [Thomas\u2019s] Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">At the hearing on Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress, the Government entered the interrogation video into evidence but did not play it for the judge. On direct examination, Detective Richardson testified that once Thomas requested counsel, the interrogation ended and \u201c[n]o questions were asked of [her].\u201d Only later in the holding cell did Thomas spontaneously make the statements at issue, according to Richardson.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">Prior to cross-examination, the court permitted defense counsel to play the entire video. At that point, Richardson conceded that Thomas \u201cimmediately said she didn\u2019t want to talk to [the police].\u201d Richardson defended her continued interrogation of Thomas, however, by claiming she merely wanted Thomas \u201cto have the educated information of what ... the potential charges down the road were coming, and give her the opportunity to speak.\u201d Richardson further testified, despite video evidence to the contrary, that her partner Detective Neal never \u201csaid anything about calling the prosecutor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">The district court orally delivered its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court denied Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress, reasoning that Thomas \u201cknowingly waived her rights\u201d when she \u201cspontaneously initiated\u201d discussion of the case in the holding cell. The court noted that although \u201cthe defendant had initially said that she did not wish to speak to law enforcement,\u201d her statements from the holding cell were \u201cspontaneous[ ]\u201d and therefore \u201cwaived whatever rights she might have had to remain silent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">At trial, the Government offered Thomas\u2019s statements both in Detective Richardson\u2019s testimony as well as in closing argument. The jury subsequently convicted Thomas of the offenses charged in the indictment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">A district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents mixed questions of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>and fact. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1185 (11th Cir.2011). This Court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the law to the facts de novo. <em>Id. </em>We construe the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below, but in doing so we are \u201cnot restricted to the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and instead consider the whole record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">\n<em>A. The admissibility of Thomas\u2019s statements from the holding cell</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The district court erred in denying Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress. Thomas unequivocally invoked her right to counsel 1 minute and 25 seconds into her interrogation when she told Detectives Neal and Richardson she was \u201cnot talking without a lawyer \u2014 no way.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Maryland v. Shatzer, </em>559 U.S. 98, 130 S.Ct. 1213, 1224, 175 L.Ed.2d 1045 (2010) (noting a defendant unequivocally requested counsel when he stated \u201che would not talk about th[e] case without having an attorney present\u201d). This Court has stressed that \u201conce an accused requests counsel, the officer cannot ask questions, discuss the ease, or present the accused with possible sentences and the benefits of cooperation.\u201d <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>927 F.2d 1530, 1539 (11th Cir.1991); <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>812 F.2d 1329, 1331 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cIt best serves all interests, especially law enforcement, to remain close to the \u2018bright line\u2019: interrogation must cease when an accused in custody requests the presence of a lawyer before further interrogation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">In this case, the interrogation video reveals Detectives Neal and Richardson did precisely what the law forbids.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After Thomas requested counsel, the detectives not only continued discussing Thomas\u2019s case, but they also pressed on her the possible \u201cbenefits of cooperation\u201d as well the penalties of disobedience. <em>See Gomez, </em>927 F.2d at 1539. In doing so, Detectives Neal and Richardson unmistakably violated Edwards\u2019s \u201crigid prophylactic rule.\u201d <em>See Towne v. Dugger, </em>899 F.2d 1104, 1106 (11th Cir.1990), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994); <em>see also Smith v. Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 92-96, 105 S.Ct. 490, 491-93, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984) (per curiam) (holding police violated <em>Edwards </em>when they continued questioning a defendant after his initial invocation of the right to counsel, even though he responded to the subsequent questioning).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">The Government claims Thomas\u2019s statements from the holding cell were admissible under <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards, </em>because they were voluntary and spontaneous. The Government is wrong as a matter of law. <em>See United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1326 (11th Cir.2010) (noting voluntariness is a question of law). An <em>Edwards </em>violation carries a \u201cpresumption of involuntariness,\u201d <em>Shatzer, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1220, that is not instantaneously ameliorated when police end an interrogation. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>der this Court\u2019s precedent, a defendant\u2019s statement made several hours after she requests counsel may be uncoerced and voluntary, <em>see United States v. Valdez, </em>880 F.2d 1280, 1238-34 (11th Cir.1989), but a statement made \u201cno more than a few minutes\u201d after an <em>Edwards </em>violation does not meet the legal standard for voluntariness, <em>see Gomez, </em>927 F.2d at 1536, 1538-39; <em>cf. Henderson v. Singletary, </em>968 F.2d 1070, 1074 (11th Cir.1992) (holding that, in the absence of an <em>Edwards </em>violation, the amount of time between interrogation and a defendant\u2019s statement is only one \u201cmeasure of ... voluntariness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">This case is remarkably similar to our decision in <em>United States v. Gomez. </em>There, like here, the prosecution sought to introduce statements made shortly after an <em>Edwards </em>violation. <em>Gomez, </em>927 F.2d at 1533, 1538-39. In <em>Gomez, </em>while being moved to a holding cell a \u201cfew minutes\u201d after an unlawful interrogation, the defendant spontaneously asked an officer why he had been arrested. <em>Id. </em>Upon hearing the charges against him, Gomez \u201casked to speak to someone about cooperating,\u201d at which point police advised him of his rights again, he signed a waiver, and then confessed. <em>Id. </em>This Court held the defendant\u2019s statements were inadmissible, because once the government \u201cviolate[s] <em>Edwards </em>\u201d \u201ca few minutes\u201d is not enough time for the \u201ccoercive effect of the [impermissible] interrogation\u201d to \u201chave subsided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1539 &amp; n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">In this case, like <em>Gomez, </em>\u201cno more than few minutes\u201d had elapsed between the impermissible interrogation and Thomas\u2019s statement in the holding cell. <em>See id. </em>at 1537. Also, like <em>Gomez, </em>Detectives Neal and Richardson persisted in interrogating Thomas in violation of <em>Edwards </em>and \u201cstressed] the importance of cooperating\u201d even after she initially invoked her right to counsel. <em>See id. </em>at 1537-39. Moreover, this Court in <em>Gomez </em>excluded the defendant\u2019s confession even though he \u2014 unlike Thomas \u2014 received fresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings and signed an explicit waiver form prior to inculpating himself. <em>See id. </em>Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress should have been granted under <em>Gomez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">In denying Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress, the district court relied on our decisions in <em>Henderson v. Dugger, </em>925 F.2d 1309 (11th Cir.1991), and <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>880 F.2d 1230 (11th Cir.1989). But those decisions are readily distinguishable, since neither involved a preliminary <em>Edwards </em>violation. In <em>Valdez, </em>police \u201cceased interrogation\u201d of the suspect as soon as he requested counsel and it was not until several hours later, when being transported to jail, that the defendant began asking questions and subsequently confessed. 880 F.2d at 1234. This Court held Valdez\u2019s statements were admissible under <em>Edwards </em>because police had respected his initial request for counsel and the intervening hours eliminated any residual coercion he might have experienced. <em>See id. Henderson </em>is similarly distinguishable as it involved a confession proffered five hours after a suspect initially requested counsel \u2014 a request the police honored pursuant to <em>Edwards. Henderson, </em>925 F.2d at 1311-13. <em>Henderson </em>simply stands for the proposition that a suspect is free to \u201cchange[ ] his mind with regard to giving a confession to the police,\u201d but that such a confession is admissible only when it is clear the defendant gave it \u201cof his own volition.\u201d <em>Singletary, </em>968 F.2d at 1075. Here, the initial <em>Edwards </em>violation distinguishes <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Valdez </em>and brings this case squarely in line with <em>Gomez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">The law on this issue is clear: <em>Gomez </em>bars post-interrogation statements like Thomas\u2019s made only a \u201cfew minutes\u201d after an <em>Edwards </em>violation. And this rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>makes good sense. If, as the Supreme Court has held, even a \u201csingle consultation with an attorney does not remove ... the coercive pressures that accompany custody,\u201d <em>Minnick v. Mississippi, </em>498 U.S. 146, 153, 111 S.Ct. 486, 491, 112 L.Ed.2d 489 (1990), we fail to see how 10 or 15 minutes of unbroken custody in a holding cell <em>without </em>an attorney could remove such pressures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court erred in denying Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">\n<em>B. Thomas\u2019s statements from the holding cell and harmless error analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Our determination the district court erred does not end the matter, however, since <em>Miranda </em>violations are subject to harmless error analysis. <em>United States v. Ramsey, </em>992 F.2d 301, 306 (11th Cir.1993). A <em>Miranda </em>error is harmless when it is beyond a reasonable doubt the erroneously admitted statements \u201cdid not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u201d <em>United States v. Pena, </em>897 F.2d 1075, 1082 (11th Cir.1990). In making that determination, we consider the effect of the statement (1) \u201cupon the other evidence introduced at trial,\u201d and (2) \u201cupon the conduct of the defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Arbolaez, </em>450 F.3d 1283, 1293 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Thomas\u2019s statement from the holding cell satisfies the harmless error standard for <em>Miranda. </em>In the holding cell, Detective Richardson named Rykeith Le-vatte and Antoine Harris as the two individuals police had arrested other than Thomas. Thomas denied knowing Levatte and Harris, but in doing so she identified them, correctly, as juveniles. On appeal, Thomas argues the admission of her statement was prejudicial. But this contention is meritless. Even assuming Thomas\u2019s statement was \u201cincriminating\u201d in an abstract sense, <em>see Harryman v. Estelle, </em>616 F.2d 870, 876-77 (5th Cir.1980),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> there is no \u201creasonable possibility\u201d the statement contributed to her conviction in light of the overwhelming evidence of her guilt, <em>see Hart v. Att\u2019y Gen. of State of Fla., </em>323 F.3d 884, 895 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">\n<em>1. Other evidence adduced at trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AYF\">Thomas\u2019s statement had no prejudicial effect on the other evidence of her guilt. At the outset, it is important to clarify exactly who Thomas denied knowing. The Government\u2019s evidence showed Levatte and Harris are Thomas\u2019s cousins \u2014 relatives by blood relation. Even if Thomas hadn\u2019t falsely denied knowing Levatte and Harris, her literal and figurative familiarity with them was plainly evident based on their family connection. Thomas\u2019s statement merely shows she was not telling the truth in the holding cell, but it did not contribute to establishing a conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>among the parties. That conspiracy was independently proven by the testimony of Levatte and Harris, in addition to other evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Levatte and Harris testified Thomas not only participated in the robberies \u2014 brandishing a firearm in one and acting as the getaway driver in another\u2014 but also that she initiated the plan, selected the target, attempted to use a debit card stolen during the May 11 robbery, and continued to participate in the conspiracy from prison by offering to pay Levatte several thousand dollars to falsely inculpate another woman in the robberies. Given this testimony as well as other evidence, there is no reasonable possibility Thomas\u2019s statement from the holding cell contributed to the jury\u2019s finding she was involved in the charged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Additionally, Thomas\u2019s false exculpatory statement was not \u201cclosely tied to\u201d the non-conspiracy offenses with which she was convicted, and therefore \u201ccould have made little difference to the jury verdict.\u201d <em>See Arbolaez, </em>450 F.3d at 1293. Aside from the conspiracy charge, Thomas was convicted on Counts Two and Three for committing an armed robbery and brandishing a firearm during the armed robbery of a hair salon on May 11, 2010. To prove those offenses,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Government presented, inter alia, the following evidence: (1) Levatte and Harris testified Thomas participated in, supervised, and boasted about her involvement in the May 11 robbery; (2) video surveillance of the robbery showed a woman who physically resembled Thomas brandishing a firearm during the robbery; (3) Levatte identified the woman brandishing a firearm in the video as Thomas; and (4) the victim of the May 11 robbery gave eyewitness testimony that the woman Levatte identified as Thomas appeared to be leading and orchestrating the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">This is not a case in which the evidence of Thomas\u2019s guilt was merely \u201ccircumstantial without [her] statements.\u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Ramsey, </em>992 F.2d 301, 306 (11th Cir.1993), <em>abrogated on other grounds by, Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994); <em>cf. also United States v. Lall, </em>607 F.3d 1277, 1293 (11th Cir.2010) (holding a <em>Miranda </em>violation was not harmless error when the \u201conly other inculpatory evidence was the testimony of\u2019 a single \u201ccooperating witness who claimed to have conspired with\u201d the defendant); <em>Hart, </em>323 F.3d at 895 (finding <em>Miranda </em>error prejudicial when the only evidence linking the defendant to the crime, other than his statements, was a single fingerprint that could have been left at any time, and neither the eyewitness nor the four codefendants testified). In light of the overwhelming direct and circumstantial evidence of her guilt, Thomas\u2019s improperly admitted statement did not have a prejudicial effect on the other evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">\n<em>2. Effect on defense counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Thomas\u2019s statements from the holding cell also did not affect defense counsel in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>any discernible way. Defense counsel\u2019s strategy clearly was to undermine the credibility of Levatte and Harris, the Government\u2019s key cooperating witnesses. Counsel attempted to persuade the jury not to believe Levatte and Harris, arguing they were liars and felons whose testimony was inaccurate, self-serving, and nonsensical in light of other evidence. Defense counsel even went so far as to implore jurors that, \u201cif you don\u2019t believe [Levatte and Harris\u2019s] testimony, then you can\u2019t find the defendant guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">On the facts of this case, there is no logical or evidentiary connection between Thomas\u2019s false exculpatory statement and the believability of Levatte and Harris. Thomas\u2019s statement suggested only that she was not being truthful in the holding cell, but that fact, even if proven, has no bearing on Levatte and Harris\u2019s credibility. Thomas has pointed to no aspect of defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy or eviden-tiary presentation that would have been different absent the admission of her statement from the holding cell. <em>Cf. Hart, </em>323 F.3d at 895 (holding <em>Miranda </em>error prejudicial, in part, because the defense presented testimony it otherwise would not have due to the improperly admitted statements). As a result, Thomas cannot show defense counsel was affected by the improper admission of her false statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">All relevant considerations counsel in favor of upholding Thomas\u2019s convictions. The admission of Thomas\u2019s false statement was undoubtedly error, but it was also undoubtedly harmless. We have no difficulty concluding it is beyond a reasonable doubt the improperly admitted statement did not contribute to the jury\u2019s verdict finding Thomas guilty as charged. <em>See Arbolaez, </em>450 F.3d at 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">The district court erred in denying Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress. However, in light of all evidence in the record, the court\u2019s error was harmless. The district court\u2019s ruling and Thomas\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-6\">. The interrogation video is part of the record and was entered into evidence before the district court. Neither the Government nor Thomas challenges its accuracy or authenticity. Even construing the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, we do not simply ignore accurate video evidence that \"completely and clearly contradicts [that] party's testimony.\u201d <em>Cf.
