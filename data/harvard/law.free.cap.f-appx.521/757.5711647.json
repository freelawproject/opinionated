In response, the United States has moved for summary affirmance of the district court\u2019s decision based on its belief that our controlling precedent clearly establishes that Mr. Williams is ineligible for a sentence reduction. After review, we agree with the government and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">On July 29, 2004, Mr. Williams pled guilty to three counts of possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Both parties agree that Mr. Williams qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which subjected him to an enhanced sentencing guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Mr. Williams as a career offender to three concurrent terms of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">On May 6, 2008, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered both parties to address whether Mr. Williams was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the retroactivity of Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court determined that Mr. Williams was ineligible for a sentence reduction because he was sentenced as a career offender, and, consequently, his applicable guideline range was not affected by Amendment 706. We affirmed the district court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>D.E. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">On August 27, 2012, Mr. Williams filed a new \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion arguing that, even though he was a career offender, he was entitled to a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The United States filed a response in opposition, asserting that Mr. Williams is ineligible for a sentence reduction because he was sentenced as a career offender and, therefore, Amendment 750 does not impact his sentencing range. The district court denied Mr. Williams\u2019 motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u2018we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3528(c)(2), a district court may reduce the terms of a defendant\u2019s imprisonment if the sentence was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. If, however, \u201ca retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">In this case, Mr. Williams is not eligible for a reduced sentence under Amendment 750 because he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. His sentencing guidelines remain unchanged because \u00a7 4B1.1 was not affected by Amendment 750. <em>See id. </em>at 1327 (holding that defendants sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 are not entitled to sentence reductions based on Amendment 706, which amended the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses in \u00a7 2D1.1); <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that <em>Moore </em>re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>mains binding precedent and applies to Amendment 750).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Mr. Williams\u2019 claim for relief under the Fair Sentencing Act is similarly foreclosed by our binding precedent. In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012), we held that the Fair Sentencing Act is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission and, therefore, cannot be the basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In addition, Mr. Williams was sentenced before the effective date of the FSA, and it is not retroactively applicable to him. <em>See id. </em>(\u2018We agree with every other circuit to address the issue that there is \u2018no evidence that Congress intended [the FSA] to apply to defendants who had been sentenced prior to the August 3, 2010 date of the Act\u2019s enactment.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). <em>See also United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Finally, Mr. Williams\u2019 Fourteenth Amendment equal protection challenge is the type of \u201cextraneous resentencing issue\u201d that is not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that the district court did not have jurisdiction to address defendant\u2019s constitutional claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding). <em>See also Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (noting that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) has a limited scope and purpose). Because the district court lacked jurisdiction to address this constitutional issue, it could not have plainly erred by failing to consider <em>sua sponte </em>Mr. Williams\u2019 equal protection challenge. If Mr. Williams desires to make a constitutional challenge to his sentence, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not the proper vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">For these reasons, we find that all of the arguments raised by Mr. Williams are squarely foreclosed by our prior precedent, and \u201cthere can be no substantial question as to the outcome of this case.\u201d <em>See Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1969) (summary disposition is appropriate in eases where \u201cthe position of one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case\u201d). Accordingly, the United States\u2019 motion for summary affirmance is granted, the judgment of the district court is affirmed, and the United States\u2019 alternative motion for extension of time to file a brief is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
