After careful review, we deny Campbell\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-21\">Campbell, a native and citizen of Jamaica, was admitted to the United States in January 1998 as a lawful permanent resident. In November 2004, he was convicted in Florida of three counts of armed robbery and sentenced to 9.75 years\u2019 imprisonment. The following month, DHS served Campbell with a Notice to Appear, charging him with removability under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) (alien convicted of two crimes of moral turpitude); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number><em>id. </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (alien convicted of an aggravated felony); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C) (alien convicted of a firearm offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Campbell appeared <em>pro se </em>at his March 2005 removal hearing, where the IJ found him removable as charged. When the IJ asked Campbell if he had any fear of returning to Jamaica, Campbell said he did because he \u201cha[d] no family back home.\u201d But because the IJ found no basis for Campbell to remain in the United States, the judge ordered Campbell removed. Campbell did not appeal this decision to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">On November 9, 2011, while he was still serving the remainder of his state sentence, Campbell filed a counseled motion to reopen removal proceedings and requested a stay of removal. He attached to the motion an application for relief under the United Nations Convention against Torture (CAT), in which he averred that if he returned to Jamaica he likely would be persecuted for being homosexual. On November 17, while his motion was pending, DHS removed Campbell to Jamaica. On December 1, the IJ nonetheless granted Campbell\u2019s motion to reopen and request for a stay of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">DHS moved to reconsider the IJ\u2019s decision, arguing the IJ lacked jurisdiction to grant the motion to reopen because Campbell was not in the United States when the IJ acted. The IJ agreed, granted DHS\u2019s motion to reconsider, and denied Campbell\u2019s motion to reopen. Campbell appealed to the BIA, which dismissed the appeal. The BIA reasoned that Campbell\u2019s motion to reopen did not automatically stay his removal and, because DHS had a final removal order at the time of Campbell\u2019s November 17 removal, the action was lawful. Although the BIA did have jurisdiction to entertain the motion to reopen despite Campbell\u2019s removal, <em>Jian Le Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>681 F.3d 1236, 1241 (11th Cir.2012), the sole form of relief Campbell sought (CAT relief) was available only to applicants present in the United States. Accordingly, the BIA concluded, Campbell\u2019s request for relief was moot. Campbell then filed the instant petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Although we generally lack jurisdiction to review an order against an alien, such as Campbell, who is removable because he committed a crime under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2), we retain jurisdiction to address constitutional issues and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D). Because Campbell challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that he was ineligible as a matter of law for CAT relief, we may review his petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). The BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, so we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See At Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">We typically review the BIA\u2019s disposition of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). But where, as here, the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, we review <em>de novo. Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cThe BIA\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to deference as long as it is \u2018reasonable\u2019 \u2014 as opposed to \u2018plainly erroneous\u2019 \u2014 and not inconsistent with the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>of Congress or the text of the regulation itself.\u201d <em>Li Shan Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>672 F.3d 961, 965 n. 2 (11th Cir.2011) (citing <em>Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. </em>452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Campbell contends the BIA erred and violated his right to due process by finding him ineligible for apply for CAT relief. We do not agree. It is true that we have recently decided that physical removal of a petitioner by DHS does not preclude the petitioner from pursuing a motion to reopen. <em>Jian Le Lin, </em>681 F.3d at 1241. Here, the BIA accepted that fact but nonetheless concluded that Campbell was ineligible as a matter of law for the relief he sought through his motion to reopen. The BIA cited its regulations, which make CAT relief available to an \u201capplicant for withholding of removal\u201d who shows that, <em>\u201cif </em>removed to the <em>proposed </em>country of removal,\u201d he would more likely than not be tortured. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c) (emphasis added). And the BIA construed this text to mean Campbell\u2019s request for relief was moot because he was not an \u201capplicant for withholding of removal,\u201d nor was he still facing possible removal to a proposed country. <em>Id. </em>Campbell makes no argument for why this interpretation should not be entitled to deference. <em>See Li Shan Chen, </em>672 F.3d at 965 n. 2. We therefore defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of its regulations to mean Campbell is ineligible for CAT relief and, accordingly, conclude that Campbell\u2019s due process rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-8\">. Campbell also argues DHS could not lawfully have removed him after he filed his motion to reopen. But he does not dispute that DHS had a valid order of removal. And he cites no authority indicating that the filing of a motion to reopen with an application for CAT relief attached operates as an automatic stay of removal. We therefore find this argument meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
