He did not obtain lawful permanent resident status until November 7, 2003, when he was twenty years old. On July 29, 2009, he possessed a firearm, in violation of Section 39-17-1307 of the Tennessee Code, and he committed two controlled substance offenses \u2014 possession of marijuana and possession of dihydroco-deinone \u2014 in violation of Section 39-17-418. He seeks review of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cthe Board\u2019s\u201d) decision dismissing his appeal of the Immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u2019s\u201d) denial of his application for cancellation of removal and his claim to derivative citizenship through his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">This court reviews the Board\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Khalid v. Holder, </em>655 F.3d 363, 366 (5th Cir.2011). Applying <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), this court subjects the Board\u2019 construction of the immigration statutes \u201cto a deferential review.\u201d <em>Deus v. Holder, </em>591 F.3d 807, 809 (5th Cir.2009). This deferential review asks (1) whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise issue involved, and if not, (2) whether the Board\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Eligibility for cancellation of removal requires seven years of continuous residence in the United States \u201cafter having been admitted in any status.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2). \u201cAdmitted,\u201d in this context, means that the alien lawfully entered the United States \u201c \u2018after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holder v. Martinez Gutierrez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2011, 2015 n. 1, 182 L.Ed.2d 922 (2012) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A)). Thus, Pena began to accrue time as a lawful resident in November 2003, when he obtained lawful resident status. <em>See id. </em>However, an alien stops accruing time of residence in the United States upon commission of a crime that makes him inadmissible. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l); <em>see also Martinez Gutierrez, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2015 n. 2. Therefore, Pena stopped accruing time of residence in the United States on the date he committed the controlled substances offenses, July 29, 2009. <em>Id. </em>Since less than seven years had elapsed since he obtained legal resident status, the IJ and the Board correctly found him ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Pena argues that under the Child Status Protection Act (\u201cCSPA\u201d), his age was \u201cfrozen\u201d when his mother, after becoming a naturalized citizen, filed a petition on his behalf for lawful resident status when he was thirteen years old. He argues that his derivative citizen status should have been automatic on the date his mother became a naturalized citizen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431(a). Pena also suggests that he was lawfully admitted as an infant by virtue of his mother\u2019s naming him as a joint applicant on all of her applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Under the version of the derivative citizenship statute applicable to Pena, a child born outside of the United States automatically becomes a citizen of the United States when \u201c(1) At least one parent of the child is a citizen of the United States, whether by birth or naturalization!;,]\u201d (2) The child is less than eighteen years old, and \u201c(3) The child is residing in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the citizen parent <em>pursuant to a lawful admission for pennanent residence.\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 1431(a)(1) \u2014 (3) (emphasis added). Pena was twenty when he first obtained legal status. Since Pena failed to establish that he was admitted for lawful permanent residence while under the age of eighteen, the Board did not err in finding that he did not satisfy the statutory requirements for derivative citizenship. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1431(a)(3). This was a permissible construction of the statute. <em>See Marquez-Marquez v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 548, 550 n. 3 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Walker v. Holder, </em>589 F.3d 12, 19-21 (1st Cir.2009). Nor is there merit to Pena\u2019s arguments that under the CSPA, he automatically became a citizen when his mother was naturalized in May 1997 or that he retained his \u201cchild\u201d status until the time he was admitted for permanent residence in 2003. The CSPA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(h)(1)(A), is not applicable to the facts of this petition. Nor may Pena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>claim that his mother\u2019s lawful status was imputed to him prior to November 2003, or under the prior version of the derivative citizenship statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432, for purposes of cancellation of removal. <em>Martinez Gutierrez, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2014-15; <em>see Marquez-Marquez, </em>455 F.3d at 550 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Accordingly, Pena\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
