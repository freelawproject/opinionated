Frone, proceeding <em>pro se,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights complaint brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the City of River-dale (City), Riverdale Municipal Court Judge Ronald Freeman, and Riverdale Court Services Manager Nathaniel Mingo. Frone\u2019s complaint asserts due process and equal protection violations based on his allegation that Defendants unlawfully deprived him of his right to appeal a speeding conviction and forced him to pay his f\u00edne while his appeal was or should have been pending.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Frone raises multiple issues on appeal, which we address in turn. Issue One</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Frone first argues the district court erred in granting the Defendants\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. We review <em>de novo </em>a grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), \u201caccepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Glover v. Liggett Grp., Inc., </em>459 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2006). To survive dismissal, a plaintiffs complaint \u201cmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Stating a claim upon which relief may be granted \u201crequires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not\u201d be enough to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">The district court did not err in dismissing Frone\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. Frone failed to state a \u00a7 1983 claim against the City because he has not alleged any facts that would implicate a city custom or policy responsible for his injury. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2037-38, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (stating \u201ca local government may not be sued under \u00a7 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents,\u201d but is instead only responsible when the \u201cexecution of a government\u2019s policy or custom ... inflicts the injury\u201d). Frone also failed to state a claim against Judge Freeman, who is entitled to absolute judicial immunity. Frone\u2019s argument that his notice of appeal stripped Judge Freeman of jurisdiction, and thus his judicial immunity, is unavailing because \u201c[t]he applicability of judicial immunity does not depend on the determination of nice questions of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See Rolleston v. Eldridge, </em>848 F.2d 163, 165 (11th Cir.1988) (quotation omitted) (rejecting the argument that judicial immunity did not apply because the judge issued the order after plaintiff filed a notice of appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Moreover, the facts set forth in Frone\u2019s complaint fail to demonstrate a violation of the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses. The conduct Frone\u2019s complaint ascribes to Judge Freeman and Mingo amounts to, at most, a negligent failure to follow state law governing Frone\u2019s trial and appeal, and does not constitute a \u201cdeprivation\u201d under the Due Process Clause. <em>See Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 664-66, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986) (stating that mere neg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>ligent conduct by a state official, even though causing injury, does not constitute a \u201cdeprivation\u201d under the Due Process Clause). Likewise, Frone has failed to establish an equal protection claim because he has not alleged any facts showing similarly situated individuals were treated more favorably. <em>Draper v. Reynolds, </em>369 F.3d 1270, 1278 n. 14 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Issue Two</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Frone next argues the district court should have allowed him to amend his complaint. The district court denied Frone leave to amend his complaint because it would be futile. We review the denial of a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion and review <em>de novo </em>whether the requested amendment would be futile. <em>Cockrell v. Sparks, </em>510 F.3d 1307, 1310 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Although \u201c[ojrdinarily, a party must be given at least one opportunity to amend before the district court dismisses the complaint,\u201d the district court need not allow an amendment \u201cwhere amendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1014 (11th Cir.2005). Amending a complaint would be futile if the complaint, as amended, would still be subject to dismissal. <em>Cockrell, </em>510 F.3d at 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">We conclude the district court properly denied Frone leave to amend his complaint. Neither in the district court nor on appeal has Frone stated how he would amend his complaint. He has not identified any new facts, nor has he cited to anything different from his original complaint that he would include if granted leave to amend. Instead, he reiterates the same facts alleged in his original complaint. As such, the district court correctly determined that granting leave to amend would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Issue Three</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Finally, Frone contends the magistrate judge erred in denying his motion for costs of service. We generally review costs awards for abuse of discretion. <em>Cochran v. E.I. duPont de Nemours, </em>933 F.2d 1533, 1540 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(1), a plaintiff may request that a defendant waive service of summons. The notice and request must, among other requirements, \u201cbe accompanied by ... two copies of a waiver form.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(1). The court may impose the costs of service on the defendant if the defendant fails to sign and return the waiver form without showing good cause for the failure. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">The magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Frone\u2019s motion for costs of service. The waiver of service provisions do not apply to the City. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(1), 0')- As to Judge Freeman and Mingo, Frone admitted he did not send them an actual waiver form, but rather a document that contained language from Rule 4(d), and argued they could have printed a copy of the actual waiver form, filled it out, and returned it. Thus, Frone admitted he did not comply with Rule 4(d), which requires that the plaintiff send the Defendants a \u201cwaiver form.\u201d <em>Compare </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(1)(C) (requiring plaintiff to send defendants \u201ctwo copies of a waiver form\u201d) <em>with </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(1)(D) (requiring plaintiff to inform defendant of consequences for failure to waive \u201cusing text prescribed in Form 5\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Frone\u2019s motion for costs of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\">. <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-10\">. It is unclear whether Frone is actually asserting a claim for relief as to Mingo, as Frone stated he is not seeking damages against Mingo.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
