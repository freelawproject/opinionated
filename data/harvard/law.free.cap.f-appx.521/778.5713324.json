Brown argues here that the district court erred in denying his request for an eviden-tiary hearing on his motion to compel the government to file a motion pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K1.1 based on his substantial assistance. At sentencing, Brown argued that Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents had made an unqualified promise that the government would file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Brown argued that the government refused to file this motion because he exercised his constitutional right to a trial, not because he had perjured himself at trial, as the government asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">Brown was arrested in April of 2010 when he brought $20,000 and a handgun to a meeting with a government informant posing as a cocaine dealer. After his arrest, Brown cooperated, to a degree, in the investigations of four other suspected drug dealers including Henry Manns.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">On the advice of counsel, Brown proceeded to trial on the drug conspiracy and possession charges, and the gun charge. At trial, Brown asserted an entrapment defense, arguing that he had not been predisposed to drug dealing. The government challenged Brown\u2019s assertions on cross-examination with recordings of Brown negotiating a price for the cocaine and with questions about the assistance he offered the DEA. Brown argued that he had been \u201crole-playing\u201d and \u201cgoing along with what the dude had told me to go along with.\u201d He also asserted that he had not been an informant, denied knowing drug dealers, and claimed that he had simply cooperated with the DEA because DEA agents told him \u201cit was the right thing to do.\u201d The government also put on DEA Special Agent Mark Baughman as a rebuttal witness. Baughman testified that through the years Brown had provided him with information about the local drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>trade. The jury convicted Brown on all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Before sentencing, Brown moved the court to compel the government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure based on his substantial assistance. Brown\u2019s motion alleged that the government was withholding the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion to punish Brown for going to trial. The government responded that Brown did not deserve a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion because he had tried to sabotage the Manns investigation, had scuttled two other investigations, and had perjured himself at trial. The government also denied that it had promised Brown anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">At sentencing, the court reviewed the Presentence Investigation Report and determined that it would impose an enhancement for obstruction of justice on Brown\u2019s perjury at trial. Brown does not contest this enhancement on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Then, the district court allowed Brown to present evidence that he was deserving of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The court made repeated attempts to learn the terms of the alleged agreement, asking about \u201cwho specifically said what and when.\u201d Brown claimed that the agreement, offered exclusively by DEA agents, was \u201c[v]ery simple,\u201d they would \u201cshow [him] the love at sentencing.\u201d Brown asserted, essentially, that this was an unqualified promise. Brown also claimed that the prosecutor\u2019s motive for not filing the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was to punish him, but offered no evidence of that motive aside from saying that \u201cthe government\u2019s poor reasons don\u2019t hold water.\u201d With respect to the court\u2019s perjury finding and the government\u2019s use of perjury as a justification not to file the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, Brown simply stated \u201cthat [reason] is not even consistent with the government\u2019s obligation to reward the substantial assistance that they have already acknowledged existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">The district court assumed the facts presented by Brown to be true, and also that the denial of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for the purpose of punishing Brown would be an unconstitutional motive. The district court found, however, that \u201c[w]e\u2019re going to show you the love at sentencing\u201d could not be transformed into an unconditional promise warranting judicial intervention in the face of an uncooperative, not credible defendant. The district court also observed that Brown\u2019s proffer \u201cpresented no evidence whatsoever that the reason motivating the prosecutor or the prosecution was the defendant\u2019s decision to go to trial.\u201d The district court declined to hold an evi-dentiary hearing and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">Brown argues that the district court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing as to whether the government breached an agreement to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion due to an improper motive. Brown argues that his proffer created \u201cmaterially disputed facts relating to the due process issue of the government\u2019s breach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Arbolaez, </em>450 F.3d 1283, 1293 (11th Cir.2006). The existence and scope of an agreement between the government and a defendant are findings of fact that we review for clear error. <em>See United States v. Al-Ari</em>an, 514 F.3d 1184, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that \u201cthe district court\u2019s factual findings regarding the scope of [a plea] agreement will be set aside only if they are clearly erroneous\u201d); <em>United States v. Cain, </em>587 F.2d 678, 680 (5th Cir.1979) (holding the same, with respect to the existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>plea agreement).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Where a criminal defendant\u2019s guilty plea \u201crests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration,\u201d the promise must be enforced. <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). Nevertheless, courts should (1) avoid \u201chyper-technical\u201d readings of these agreements that might directly contradict the oral understanding of the defendant; (2) view the agreements against the background of any negotiation between the government and the defendant; and (3) construe the agreements against the government in the case of ambiguities. <em>United States v. Jefferies, </em>908 F.2d 1520, 1523 (11th Cir.1990) (quotation marks omitted). However, a court cannot read terms into an agreement, but rather, \u201c[t]he contract, once created, is to be interpreted in accordance with the objective import of its unambiguous terms.\u201d <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>905 F.2d 1466, 1473 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a sentencing court may depart from the guidelines if the government files a motion stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 (2011). Generally, the government has the power, but not the duty, to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial-assistance motion. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). In <em>Wade, </em>the Supreme Court held that a district court can review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and grant a remedy if the court finds that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive, such as the defendant\u2019s race or religion. <em>Id. </em>at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44. We have also said that \u201cjudicial review is appropriate only when there is an allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation.\u201d <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>554 F.3d 958, 961 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). Mere allegations of bad faith on the part of the government are not sufficient if they are unrelated to the constitutionally impermissible motivation. <em>See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1501 n. 4 (11th Cir.1993) (rejecting the dissent\u2019s suggestion that the Court should engage in a broader bad faith analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">The district court neither abused its discretion in denying to hold an eviden-tiary hearing nor clearly erred in finding that the facts did not support the existence of an enforceable agreement between the government and Brown. Brown\u2019s factual proffers, even accepted as true, were not sufficient to establish the existence of an unqualified promise that the government would file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Assuming that DEA agents did say that Brown would get \u201clove at sentencing\u201d for his assistance, there is no evidence that this was the type of agreement contemplated in <em>Santobello. See Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 262, 92 S.Ct. at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">Particularly in light of Brown\u2019s perjury at trial, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Brown had failed to establish that the government was motivated by a constitutionally impermissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>reason. We note that Brown does not contest on appeal the district court\u2019s finding that he had committed perjury. In fact, his very arguments on appeal contradict his testimony and support the perjury finding. His assertion that he assisted the government because of an unqualified promise for a substantial assistance motion is contradicted by his testimony at trial that he helped because he was told \u201cit was the right thing to do.\u201d His claim to providing substantial assistance is contradicted by his testimony at trial that he was not a confidential informant and was generally ignorant of the drug trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Finally, given that the district court accepted Brown\u2019s proffered facts as true and still found Brown to be not entitled to relief, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. at 1844 (holding that \u201ca defendant has no right to ... an evidentiary hearing unless he makes a substantial\u201d showing of facts entitling him to relief). <em>Cf. Spinkellink v. Wainwright, </em>578 F.2d 582, 590 (5th Cir.1978) (finding an evidentiary hearing to be unnecessary in a habeas case where a movant was not entitled to relief even assuming his proffered facts were true).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981. 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
