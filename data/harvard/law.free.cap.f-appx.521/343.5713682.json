He was sentenced to 120 months, the mandatory minimum, on the drug counts, a concurrent 120 months on the firearm conspiracy count, and a consecutive five years for using a firearm. He appeals and contends that the district court erred by failing to make \u201cfurther inquiry\u201d into the voluntariness of his plea in light of doubts about whether he understood that his sentence could be based on a drug amount larger than that charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-22\">We review for plain error because the issue was not raised in the district court. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Consequently, if M\u00f3nita shows a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affected his substantial rights, we have discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>M\u00f3nita must show a reasonable probability that the error affected his decision to plead guilty. <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 88, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The district court explicitly advised M\u00f3-nita that his sentence would be based on the drugs he was \u201cresponsible for\u201d which could include \u201cwhat other people who were part of the conspiracy did.\u201d The court also advised him that he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months for the drug crimes, with a possible sentence of life. M\u00f3nita fails to show any error because he does not explain how any doubts arose or what further inquiry should have been made after he stated under oath that he understood the court\u2019s admonishments. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>302 F.3d 279, 283-84 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In addition, because M\u00f3nita pleaded guilty in the face of a life sentence, nothing suggests that he would not have done so had the court made further inquiries about relevant drug quantity. <em>See Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. at 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333; <em>Cothran, </em>302 F.3d at 283-84. Moreover, M\u00f3nita received the mandatory minimum sentence based only on the drug amount charged in the indictment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii). Therefore, any error did not affect the fairness of the judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
