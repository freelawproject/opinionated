After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-22\">Boles pleaded guilty in 2008 to one count of possession of an unregistered firearm, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), and was sentenced to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, 3 years\u2019 supervised release, and a $2,400 fine. During supervised release, Boles was required, among other things, to refrain from committing another crime, submit to drug testing, and pay $100 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>month toward his f\u00edne. In 2012, Boles admitted to violating these terms and the court sentenced him to nine months\u2019 imprisonment followed by an additional two years\u2019 supervised release. Boles appeals, arguing the additional supervised-release term is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. He also contends that the district court erred by failing to elicit objections to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Because a district court\u2019s failure to elicit objections to a sentence affects the standard of review, we first consider that argument. \u201cWhere the district court has not elicited fully articulated objections following the imposition of sentence, this court will vacate the sentence and remand for further sentencing in order to give the parties an opportunity to raise and explain their objections.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1103 (11th Cir.1990), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136 (11th Cir.1993) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201cA remand is unnecessary, however, when the record on appeal is sufficient to enable review.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2007). In such a case, we review the appellant\u2019s claims as if they were properly raised in the district court. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">At the conclusion of sentencing, the district court asked Boles\u2019s attorney only if there was \u201c[ajnything else\u201d he wanted to add. This statement did not comply with <em>Jones\u2019s </em>obligation. <em>United States v. Holloway, </em>971 F.2d 675, 681 (11th Cir.1992). Because the record is sufficient to review the reasonableness of Boles\u2019s sentence, however, we need not remand. <em>See Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1347. We instead review for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Kuhlman, </em>711 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2013); <em>see also Johnson, </em>451 F.3d at 1242. The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of demonstrating it is unreasonable. <em>Kuhlman, </em>711 F.3d at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Boles contends his additional supervised-release term is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. But the record reflects that the court considered the statutory factors, even if it did not explicitly so state. <em>See id. </em>(noting that the court need not explicitly state that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors). The court found that Boles failed to report for required drug testing on several occasions, he was \u201cwoefully far behind\u201d in paying his f\u00edne, and he concededly gave a false name to a police officer, thereby indicating it took into account the nature and circumstances of Boles\u2019s violations, their seriousness, and the need to provide just punishment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(2)(A). Boles\u2019s attorney also spoke about Boles\u2019s efforts to improve his life, including recent payments Boles had made toward his outstanding child-support obligations, which is relevant to his history and characteristics. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1). And the court stated that Boles offered only \u201cspecious excuses,\u201d reflecting consideration of the need to protect the public from his future violations. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C); <em>see also United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1318 (11th Cir.2009) (indicating that a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse can demonstrate a need to protect society because it bears on a defendant\u2019s likelihood of rehabilitation). Finally, the district court explicitly mentioned the sentencing commission\u2019s policy statements and noted it took those into account. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5). Thus, Boles cannot show that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">Boles also asserts that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was based entirely on the court\u2019s perception that he lacked sincerity. But, as discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>above, the district court properly considered this factor and balanced it with multiple other considerations. Boles therefore cannot show the additional supervised-release term was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">For the foregoing reasons, Boles\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
