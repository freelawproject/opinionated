Holder, </em>685 F.8d 511 (5th Cir.2012), in which the court deferred to the BIA\u2019s \u201csocial visibility\u201d and \u201cparticularity\u201d requirements for establishing membership in a \u201cparticular social group\u201d for purposes of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">In <em>Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 515-16, Jose Orellana-Monson sought asylum, like Vega-Munoz, based on his membership in a particular social group, namely, a group of Salvadoran males between the ages of 8 and 15 who had refused to join a pervasive street gang due to a principled opposition to gangs. This court upheld the BIA\u2019s application of the \u201cparticularity\u2019 and \u201csocial visibility\u201d test in defining what constitutes a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d finding it \u201ca reasoned interpretation ... entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521. Because Orel-lana-Monson\u2019s proposed group lacked particularity and social visibility, this court upheld the BIA\u2019s decision that the proposed group did not meet the requirements of a \u201cparticular social group\u201d for asylum purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\u201c[I]n the absence of intervening Supreme Court precedent,\u201d one panel cannot overrule another panel even if it disagrees with the prior panel\u2019s holding. <em>Montesano v. Seafirst Commercial Corp., </em>818 F.2d 423, 426 (5th Cir.1987). As such, contrary to Vega-Munoz\u2019s assertion, the BIA did not err in requiring \u201cparticularity\u201d and \u201csocial visibility\u201d to establish that Vega-Munoz was a member of a \u201cparticular social group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Accordingly, Vega-Munoz\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
