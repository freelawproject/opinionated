On appeal, he argues that the district court incorrectly applied a 12-level enhancement to his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4(a), based on a finding that he intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">Thomas\u2019s admissions in his plea agreement and during his plea colloquy, as well as undisputed facts in the pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) detailed at length how Thomas conspired with a co-defendant to assault federal agents. Specifically, during his plea colloquy, Thomas agreed with the district court\u2019s assessment that he conspired to obtain a destructive device for the purpose of mounting attacks on federal employees and buildings. The PSI stated that Thomas discussed plans to assassinate named government officials at multiple meetings, and conducted reconnaissance of two government buildings in Atlanta, Georgia. At sentencing, the government argued that the federal crime of terrorism Thomas intended to promote was the killing of federal officials and the bombing of a federal facility, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">On appeal, Thomas raises two points. First, he argues that, since his offense of conviction did not fall under one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>specifically enumerated offenses for a federal crime of terrorism in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2382b(g)(5)(B), the district court erred by not explicitly stating on the record both the federal crime of terrorism he intended to promote, and the facts that led it to that conclusion. Second, Thomas challenges, as unsupported, the court\u2019s conclusion that his offense was intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">With respect to Thomas\u2019s claim that the district court failed to make sufficient factual findings, we generally review all sentences under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008). Here, we find no error. The district court\u2019s findings, coupled with the rest of the record below, are sufficient to provide for a meaningful review of Thomas\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 56, 128 S.Ct. 586, 600, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">While the district court did not explicitly accept the government\u2019s argument that Thomas intended to promote the attack of federal agents and buildings, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114, it did so implicitly, based on Thomas\u2019s admission, in his plea agreement and during his plea colloquy, that he obtained explosives \u201cto assault federal agents\u201d and \u201cfor the purpose of attacking federal employees and buildings.\u201d We note that the district court also adopted the findings and conclusions of the PSI, which served as a basis for its own factual findings. In so doing, the court explained some of its general reasoning, weighing its hesitation to label everyone a terrorist, with its concerns that arose once Thomas\u2019s discussions materialized into obtaining dangerous materials. While not highly detailed, the district court\u2019s findings, provide a sufficient factual basis for us to review the application of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">With respect to Thomas\u2019s claim that the district court clearly erred in applying his terrorism enhancement, we review a challenge to the application of the Sentencing Guidelines as a mixed question of law and fact, in which the district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, while its application of the Guidelines to those facts is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Jamieson, </em>202 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.2000). Where a fact pattern gives rise to two reasonable and different constructions, the district court\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Almedina, </em>686 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Section 3A1.4 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides for a 12-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the offense is a felony that involved, or <em>was intended to promote, </em>a federal crime of terrorism.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4(a) (emphasis added). Application Note 1 states: \u201c[f]or purposes of this guideline, \u2018federal crime of terrorism\u2019 has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4, comment. (n. 1). Section 2332b(g)(5) defines the term \u201cfederal crime of terrorism\u201d as an offense that \u201cis calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct,\u201d and that is a violation of a list of enumerated criminal statutes, including killing or attempting to kill officers and employees of the United States under \u00a7 1114. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">To date, we have construed U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4 in relation to a defendant\u2019s felony conviction that, while not an enumerated offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(B), involved or was intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism, in one case, <em>United States v. Mandhai, </em>375 F.3d 1243 (11th Cir.2004). In <em>Mandhai </em>upon affirming the district court\u2019s imposition of a 12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>level terrorism enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3A1.4, we held that \u201c[h]ad the Guideline drafters intended that \u00a7 3A1.4 apply only where the defendant is convicted of a crime listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(B), they would have included such limiting language. Instead, they unambiguously cast a broader net by applying the enhancement to any offense that \u2018involved\u2019 or was \u2018intended to promote\u2019 a terrorism crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1247-48. \u201cUnder a plain reading, the phrase \u2018intended to promote\u2019 means that if a goal or purpose was to bring or help bring into being a crime listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(B), the terrorism enhancement applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">We conclude that the district court did not err in applying the 12-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4(a), because there was ample evidence presented at various stages to support its finding that Thomas intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism. While Thomas\u2019s offense of conviction was not an enumerated federal crime of terrorism, <em>see Mandhai, </em>375 F.3d at 1248, the record indicated that his conspiracy to possess an explosive device was intended to promote the killing or attempted killing of officers and employees of the United States, in violation of \u00a7 1114, an enumerated offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(B). While Thomas argued that he planned to use the materials for defensive purposes, the undisputed facts presented in his plea agreement, the plea colloquy, and the PSI confirmed that after a series of meetings culminating in the purchase of explosives and silencers, Thomas\u2019s goal or purpose was not defensive, but rather, to assault or attack federal employees and federal facilities. Where a fact pattern gives rise to two reasonable and different constructions, we will not second guess the district court\u2019s choice between them. <em>See Almedina, </em>686 F.3d at 1315. Accordingly, we affirm Thomas\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Finally, after noticing an error in the judgment <em>sua sponte, </em>we may \u201cvacate the judgment and remand the case to the district court for entry of a judgment\u201d if the error in the judgment is considered \u201ca clerical error, and the correction of the judgment would not prejudice the defendant in any reversible way.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>190 F.3d 1247, 1252 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Because the district court\u2019s final judgment identified only 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d) and 5871 as the laws Thomas violated, we vacate and remand to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment and commitment order to specifically reflect the statutory basis underlying the offense of which Thomas was adjudicated guilty, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
