She contends that Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines authorized the court to reduce her sentence, despite her status as a career offender, because a downward departure led to her receiving a sentence below her career offender guideline range. She also argues that her sentence was based at least in part on her crack cocaine guideline range because that guideline is the \u201cstarting point\u201d for all crack cocaine offenses. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-23\">Ms. Harris pled guilty to possession with the intent to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(iii), and to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>cause she had two prior felony convictions, the district court sentenced Ms. Harris as a career offender. The court therefore used United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 instead of \u00a7 2D1.1 to determine her offense level and criminal history category, which (after an acceptance of responsibility reduction) were 34 and VI, respectively. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Because her criminal history category overrepresented the seriousness of her past criminal conduct, the court departed downward to category V. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Ms. Harris\u2019 resulting guideline range was 235 to 293 months, and the court sentenced her to 235 months, the low end of that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Ms. Harris then filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706. The district court denied that motion, concluding that it lacked authority to reduce Ms. Harris\u2019 sentence because her sentence was based on the career offender guideline and not on the crack cocaine guideline. Ms. Harris later filed a second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, this time based on Amendment 750. The district court denied that motion on the same grounds, and Ms. Harris appealed that denial to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). See <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Where a retroactively applicable guideline amendment does not alter the sentencing range upon which a defendant\u2019s sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentence reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 1330. Amendment 750, which lowered the crack cocaine base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1, did nothing to the career offender base offense levels in \u00a7 4B1.1. Because Ms. Harris was sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.1 and not \u00a7 2D1.1, then, Amendment 750 did not alter the range upon which her sentence was based. <em>See id. </em>Under our decision in <em>Moore, </em>that should be the end of the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">But Ms. Harris invites us to add another chapter: she contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), undermined our <em>Moore </em>decision to the point of abrogation. Unfortunately for Ms. Harris, however, we have already rejected that argument in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012). Although she acknowledges that fact, Ms. Harris argues that <em>Lawson </em>is distinguishable from her case because, unlike the <em>Lawson </em>defendant, she was not sentenced within the career offender guideline range. Instead, because the sentencing judge granted her a downward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 and reduced her criminal history category from VI to V, the sentence she ultimately received was below her career offender guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">While this fact does differentiate Ms. Harris from the defendant in <em>Lawson, </em>it makes her similar to two of the defendants in <em>Moore. </em>In <em>Moore, </em>two defendants received sentences below their career offender guideline ranges because of downward departures. Despite that fact, we held that neither defendant was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because each had been sentenced as a career offender. <em>See </em>541 F.3d at 1330. So, like Ms. Harris\u2019 abrogation argument, we have already rejected this argument as well. And like the two <em>Moore </em>defendants, Ms. Harris (even with her downward departure) was still sentenced based on her career offender guideline range. That means she is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See, e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1 (clarifying that the applicable guideline range evaluated when assessing eligibility for a sentence reduction is the one \u201cdetermined before consideration of any departure provision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Ms. Harris\u2019 final argument \u2014 that her sentence was in part \u201cbased on\u201d the crack cocaine guideline range because that guideline is the \u201cstarting point for sentencing in all crack cases\u201d \u2014 does not make her eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. As we have recognized, \u201c[a]ny reduction must be \u2018consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012) (quoting \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). Here, the applicable policy statement requires that an amendment \u201chave the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">When the district court determined that the career offender guideline applied to Ms. Harris, the court replaced her original sentencing guideline range (the crack cocaine guideline range in \u00a7 2D1.1) with the one contained in \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). That became her applicable guideline range, and that range was not affected by Amendment 750. <em>Cf. United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2008) (finding, based on policy statements, defendant ineligible for \u00a7 3852(c)(2) reduction because he \u201cwas subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original sentencing guideline range\u201d and \u201cwas not sentenced according to the base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1\u201d). Ms. Harris was therefore ineligible for a sentence reduction, and the district court did not err in denying her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The district court\u2019s denial of Ms. Harris\u2019 motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
