Lopez-Perez argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. The district court imposed a sentence at the low end of Lopez-Perez\u2019s recommended guideline range of 33 to 41 months, and we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). Lopez-Perez requested a downward variance of 15 months, but the district court reasonably rejected the request because Lopez-Perez had been responsible for transporting at least 140 aliens after they entered the country illegally. The district court also reasonably determined that a sentence of 33 months of imprisonment would best serve the statutory purposes of sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Lopez-Perez argues that he was entitled to a lesser sentence because he had no criminal history, he was not a leader of the conspiracy, his offenses \u201cdid not involve the typical \u2018aggravators\u2019 \u201d that often accompanied smuggling operations, and he cooperated with authorities, but we are not persuaded that Lopez-Perez\u2019s sentence \u201clies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of [his] case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court imposed the sentence that Lopez-Perez requested as an alternative to a sentence below the guidelines, and that sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-18\">We AFFIRM Lopez-Perez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
