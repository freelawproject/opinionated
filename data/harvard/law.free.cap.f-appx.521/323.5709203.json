As part of that investigation, William Myles, a paid cooperating witness, posed as a corrupt businessman marketing a fictional trash can cleaning product: the \u201cCifer 5000.\u201d After accepting bribes from Myles, Grace introduced Myles to his \u201cA-Team\u201d of mayors. One of the mayors was Defendant-Appellant Maurice Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>After a months-long sting operation, the government charged Brown in a twenty-count indictment with violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), engaging in mail and wire fraud, and using an interstate facility in aid of racketeering. The government introduced evidence at trial that Brown, as mayor of White Castle, Louisiana, promoted in an official capacity the Cifer 5000 at the behest of Myles and undercover FBI Special Agent Darin McAllister (\u201cthe businessmen\u201d). The evidence showed that, in exchange for promoting Cifer 5000, Brown solicited and received New Orleans Saints tickets and hotel rooms from the businessmen. The evidence also showed that Brown obtained for the businessmen confidential law enforcement information.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">At the close of trial, the district court gave the Fifth Circuit pattern jury instruction on entrapment. The district court also gave the pattern instruction that the jury should treat each count separately, and a supplemental instruction, derived from <em>United States v. Wells, </em>506 F.2d 924, 925 (5th Cir.1975): \u201cYou must determine whether or not the defense of entrapment is applicable to any or all counts. Each count must be considered separately. Your verdicts may be the same or they may be different. Each verdict must be agreed to by all members of the jury.\u201d The district court denied Brown\u2019s request for a special instruction providing, in effect, that \u201conce entrapped, always entrapped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The jury returned a particularized verdict, finding Brown guilty on all but two counts. The district court sentenced Brown to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, below the guidelines range of 235 to 298 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Brown appeals, challenging the sufficiency of the government\u2019s evidence rebutting his entrapment defense, the district court\u2019s decision not to give Brown\u2019s requested entrapment instruction, and the district court\u2019s decision not to allow Brown to impeach McAllister on the basis of his out-of-court statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\n<em>The Entrapment Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">\u201cEntrapment occurs when the criminal design originates with the officials of the government, and they implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.\u201d <em>United States v. Wise, </em>221 F.3d 140, 154 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cGovernment inducement consists of the creative activity of law enforcement officials in spurring an individual to crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Gutierrez, </em>343 F.3d 415, 420 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is proper (i.e., not an \u2018inducement\u2019) for the government to use a \u2018sting [operation],\u2019 at least where it amounts to providing a defendant with an \u2018opportunity\u2019 to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cPredisposition focuses on whether the defendant was an \u2018unwary innocent\u2019 or, instead, an \u2018unwary criminal\u2019 who readily availed himself of the opportunity to perpetrate the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Theagene, </em>565 F.3d 911, 919 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cEvidence of predisposition can include, for example, active, enthusiastic participation or demonstrated expertise in the criminal endeavor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] defendant\u2019s ready and willing participation in government-solicited criminal activity, standing alone, is sufficient to prove predisposition.\u201d <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>239 F.3d 722, 739 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">\u201cWhen a jury, which was fully charged on entrapment, rejects the defendant\u2019s entrapment defense, the applicable standard of review is the same which applies to sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[W]e must ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>cept every fact in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, and we may reverse only if no rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt either (1) lack of government inducement or (2) predisposition to commit the charged crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Here, there was evidence sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict because a reasonable juror could have found that the government rebutted Brown\u2019s entrapment defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">First, there was sufficient evidence that the government did not induce Brown to commit the offense because, as this court reasoned in <em>Gutierrez, </em>the sting operation in this case did not \u201cinvolve either threatening or harassing conduct or actions designed specifically to take advantage of the defendant\u2019s weaknesses.\u201d <em>Gutierrez, 343 </em>F.3d at 420. Rather, the sting operation \u201csimply provided the opportunity\u201d to commit a crime, <em>see id. </em>at 419 \u2014 an opportunity Brown repeatedly seized. For example, Brown requested from Myles six tickets to a Saints game in exchange for promising to \u201ctake care of [Myles] on the other end.\u201d Brown also sought Saints tickets, New Orleans Hornets tickets, and hotel rooms in exchange for promising to promote Cifer 5000, and for providing to Myles confidential law enforcement information.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Second, there also was sufficient evidence that Brown was predisposed to commit the offense because, as discussed above, by initiating many of the bribes, Brown was a \u201cready and willing participant].\u201d <em>Reyes, </em>239 F.3d at 739. Further, by accepting bribes, and by doing so with minimal hesitation, Brown was an \u201cactive, enthusiastic participant] ... in the crim[e].\u201d <em>Theagene, </em>565 F.3d at 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Brown argues that the government induced this behavior by \u201cdangling a fictitious product that would benefit his community,\u201d by \u201ccontinuing to offer sporting event tickets\u201d that \u201cwere initially free, but later came with a condition that [he] perform some official act,\u201d and by misrepresenting facts as part of the undercover investigation. As discussed above, however, a sting operation generally is proper unless there is \u201cthreatening or harassing conduct or actions designed specifically to take advantage of the defendant\u2019s weaknesses.\u201d Gutie<em>rrez, </em>343 F.3d at 420. Conduct such as \u201cdangling a fictitious product\u201d merely amounts to the \u201c[a]rtifice and strategem [that] may be employed to catch those engaged in criminal enterprises.\u201d <em>Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 441, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Brown also argues that there was \u201cno evidence that [he] was inclined to engage in the crimes for which he was charged before his initial exposure to government agents,\u201d and that there was \u201cno evidence that [he] engaged in similar prior illegal acts.\u201d As discussed above, however, the question is not whether Brown was \u201cinclined to engage in the crimes,\u201d or whether he had engaged in \u201cprior illegal acts,\u201d but whether he \u201cavailed himself of the opportunity to perpetrate the crime.\u201d <em>Theagene, </em>565 F.3d at 919. Brown\u2019s requests for bribes shows that there was evidence to support that he was a \u201cready and willing participant].\u201d <em>Reyes, </em>239 F.3d at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Brown adds that Grace\u2019s comment that the mayors would \u201cdo it\u201d \u2014 that is, promote Cifer 5000 \u2014 \u201cstraight up now\u201d showed that \u201cBrown would not cross the line.\u201d As the government notes, however, Grace\u2019s \u201cdo it straight up\u201d comment appears to refer to a different mayor. Further, taken in context, a reasonable juror could infer that the full comment \u2014 \u201cthese guys will do it straight up now, basically\u201d \u2014 does not indicate that the mayors would promote Cifer 5000 without bribes. For example, after the \u201cstraight up\u201d comment, Grace told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Myles that the mayors would \u201c[p]robably [want] cash\u201d for their help in promoting Cifer 5000.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\n<em>The Entrapment Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We review a district court\u2019s refusal to give a defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hale, </em>685 F.3d 522, 541 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion in denying a requested instruction only if such instruction (1) is a substantively correct statement of the law, (2) is not substantially covered in the charge as a whole, and (3) concerned an important point in the trial such that the failure to instruct the jury on the issue seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present a given defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Porter, </em>542 F.3d 1088, 1093 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give the \u201conce entrapped, always entrapped\u201d proposed instruction because the instruction was an incorrect statement of the law. This court rejected a similar \u201conce entrapped, always entrapped\u201d theory in <em>United States v. Morris, </em>holding that a jury \u201cshould consider each [entrapment] count separately, allowing it to consider whether Defendant was guilty of any or all of the offenses charged.\u201d 974 F.2d 587, 588 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see also Wells, </em>506 F.2d at 926 (\u201cUnless the evidence established as a matter of law that there was a \u2018course of conduct,\u2019 it would have been error to charge, as the defense requested at trial, that [the defendant] was either guilty of all or innocent of all.\u201d). In addition, as discussed above, a reasonable juror could have rejected Brown\u2019s argument that the government entrapped him into taking the first bribe. <em>See Reyes, </em>239 F.3d at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">\n<em>Hearsay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>See Hale, </em>685 F.3d at 538. When a district court allows into evidence a hearsay statement, the opposing party may impeach the hearsay declarant. Fed.R.Evid. 806; <em>see also United States v. Graham, </em>858 F.2d 986, 990 (5th Cir.1988). An out-of-court statement is hearsay only if it is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Fed.R.Evid. 801(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by not allowing Brown to impeach undercover Special Agent McAllister<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because McAllister\u2019s false business scheme statements were not hearsay. The government introduced audio recordings between Grace and Brown and McAllister that contained McAllister\u2019s sting \u201cstrategem\u201d statements. McAllis-ter\u2019s statements on the audio recordings\u2014 for example, boasting that he could \u201cgrease paths\u201d \u2014 were not hearsay because they were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. As the government observes, \u201cin keeping with his undercover role, virtually all of McAllister\u2019s statements to [Brown] were false.\u201d Further, the government offered McAllister\u2019s statements to give context and background for statements made by Brown and Grace\u2014 not to prove their truth. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez-Chavez, </em>842 F.2d 77, 81 (5th Cir.1988) (finding that recorded statements offered for a similar purpose \u201cwere not introduced to prove their truth, but rather to prove only that they were uttered\u201d). Finally, the district court in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>structed the jury not to consider \u201cthe truthfulness\u201d of McAllister\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM judgment against Brown.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">. A federal grand jury indicted McAllister for offenses related to his personal finances. The district court, granting a motion in limine by the government, prohibited Brown from mentioning McAllister's pending criminal charges at trial on the basis that McAllister would not appear as a government witness. As a result, McAllister did not testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AK8\">. Because McAllister's statements were not hearsay, Brown's argument that his inability to impeach McAllister impacted his rights under the Confrontation Clause fails. <em>See United States v. Moody, </em>903 F.2d 321, 329 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
