(\u201cCH2M\u201d) and Operations Management, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cOMI\u201d) motion to dismiss Smith\u2019s complaint, which alleged age discrimination pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1), and race discrimination pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Smith argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims because he alleged a <em>prima facie </em>case of race and age discrimination. After careful review, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">We review the grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo, </em>accepting the complaint\u2019s allegations as <em>true </em>and construing <em>them in </em>the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Hill v. White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">At the pleading stage, a complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, in order to give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quotations omitted) (discussing the pleading standard in Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the allegations \u201cmust be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level\u201d and must be sufficient \u201cto state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1964-65, 1974. This standard requires more than labels, conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action. <em>Id. </em>at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">The Supreme Court clarified the level of specificity required to state a plausible claim for relief, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-12\">A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a \u201cprobability requirement,\u201d but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are \u201cmerely consistent with\u201d a defendant\u2019s liability, it \u201cstops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of \u2018entitlement to relief.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_c\"><em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">I. ADEA</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">The ADEA prohibits employers from discharging an employee who is at least 40 years of age because of that employee\u2019s age. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 623(a)(1), 631(a). To show age discrimination, the plaintiff must prove that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of the challenged decision. <em>Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>557 U.S. 167, 177-78, 129 S.Ct. 2343, 2351, 174 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009); <em>Sims v. MVM, Inc., </em>704 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">Smith alleged that his termination was \u201csubstantially motivated\u201d by age. An age discrimination claim under the ADEA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>however, requires that age be the but-for cause of the termination. Here, Smith did not allege sufficient facts to allow us to reasonably infer that CH2M and OMI violated the but-for standard set forth in the ADEA. <em>See Gross, </em>557 U.S. at 177-78, 129 S.Ct. at 2351; <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s age discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">II. Title VII</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Title VII prohibits employers from discharging an employee on the basis of race. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). To allege facts establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination under Title VII based on circumstantial evidence, the plaintiff may demonstrate that: \u201c(1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) he was replaced by a person outside his protected class or was treated less favorably than a similarly-situated individual outside his protected class.\u201d <em>See Maynard v. Bd. of Regents, </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Here, Smith\u2019s allegations are sufficient to state a plausible claim for race discrimination. Smith alleged that he was black. Smith alleged facts revealing his experience and that he was qualified for his work. He also alleged that his termination was substantially motivated by race, that he was replaced by a nonAfrican-American person, and that less-qualified non-African-American persons in his job classification retained their employment with CH2M and OMI when Smith was discharged. He alleged that he was pressured by city officials to selectively enforce applicable codes in a racially discriminatory manner, in effect enforcing some codes against a black citizen under circumstances substantially similar to a situation in which he had been directed not to enforce these codes against a white citizen. He also alleged that, after he objected to the discriminatory enforcement, the City demanded that CH2M and OMI remove Smith from his job, and that defendants complied and terminated him with full knowledge of the discriminatory motive. Smith\u2019s allegations provide sufficient factual content to give the defendants notice and to state a plausible claim for relief under <em>Twombly. See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949; <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1964. Accordingly, the district court erred in granting CH2M and OMI\u2019s motion to dismiss on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Smith\u2019s ADEA claim. However, we reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings as to Smith\u2019s Title VII claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
