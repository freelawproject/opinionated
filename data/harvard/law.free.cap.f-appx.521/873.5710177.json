Jimenez-Delgado challenges the enhancement of his sentence for managing five or more people in the conspiracy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">The district court did not clearly err by enhancing Jimenez-Delgado\u2019s sentence for his managerial role in the conspiracy to transport illegal aliens. A defendant is subject to a three-level increase in his offense level if he is a \u201cmanager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) (Nov.2011). Evidence presented at Jimenez-Delgado\u2019s change of plea and sentencing hearings established that he exercised control and decision-making authority over at least seven participants in the Calixto alien smuggling organization; transported aliens after they were smuggled into the United States; and recruited participants to join the organization. <em>See id. </em>cmt. n. 4. During his change of plea hearing, Jimenez-Delgado admitted to managing the transportation of illegal aliens from Alabama to Florida; directing his wife to verify with him what fee to collect from each alien; attempting to recruit his neighbor\u2019s husband to drive vehicles for the organization; and using the neighbor instead to transport the aliens. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cThe findings of fact of the sentencing court may be based on ... facts admitted by a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty ... or evidence presented at the sentencing hearing.\u201d). At the sentencing hearing, Robert Vadasz, an agent of the United States Border Patrol, identified by name seven participants whom Jimenez-Delgado supervised in the organization; recounted statements made by Jimenez-Delgado\u2019s wife and neighbor that he coordinated the destinations and routes of the drivers and directed what fee to collect from the aliens and where to deliver the proceeds; and testified that Jimenez-Delgado relocated a third participant in his \u201ctransportation cell\u201d to Arizona to lengthen the route for his transportation cell and \u201cmake extra money per alien.\u201d Jimenez-Delgado argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court should not have relied on Agent Vadasz\u2019s hearsay testimony \u201cabout things Mr. Jimenez-Delgado allegedly said to third-parties\u201d in the presence of his wife and neighbor, but the agent\u2019s testimony has \u201csufficient indicia of reliability\u201d to be considered at sentencing, <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1269 (11th Cir.2010). Agent Vadasz interviewed Jimenez-Delgado\u2019s wife and neighbor and their accounts were consistent with Jimenez-Delgado\u2019s admissions about his role in the smuggling organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">We AFFIRM Jimenez-Delgado\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
