U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007). While legal determinations of the BIA are reviewed <em>de novo, Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (2001), administrative fact findings are reviewed under the highly deferential substantial evidence test. <em>Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 820 (11th Cir.2007). The BIA\u2019s decision will be affirmed \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cUnder the substantial-evidence test, we view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004). Thus, \u201c[t]o conclude the BIA\u2019s decision should be reversed, we must find that the record not only supports the conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">An applicant for asylum must meet the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A) (2006). The definition of \u201crefugee\u201d includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">[A]ny person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">INA \u00a7 101 (a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2006). \u201cTo establish asylum eligibility, the petitioner must, with specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted). A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1) (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"ARA\">\u201c[P]ersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations marks and brackets omitted). In the absence of a presumption of a well-founded fear created by a showing of past persecution, the applicant must show that there is a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of suffering persecution if he returns to his home country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i)(B). The fear of persecution must be \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1289 (11th Cir.2001). The alien must also \u201cestablish a causal connection\u201d or nexus between a statutorily protected ground and the feared persecution. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. He can do so by \u201cpresenting specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear\u201d he will be \u201csingled out for persecution\u201d on such ground. <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ted). Alternatively, the alien can show this nexus by establishing that there is a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of persecution on that ground. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A). The persecution of a particular group must be \u201csystemic or pervasive\u201d to amount to a \u201cpattern or practice.\u201d <em>In re A-M-, </em>23 I &amp; N Dec. 737, 741 (BIA 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">An application for asylum made in removal proceedings is also considered to be a request for withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.3(b) (2013). When an applicant fails to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, he necessarily fails to establish his eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Muththiah claims that the record evidence compels reversal because it showed that his father was murdered by, Muththi-ah\u2019s life was threatened by, and Muththi-ah\u2019s family was extorted by paramilitary groups \u2014 possibly associated with the Sri Lankan government. Muththiah argues that State Department reports confirm that these paramilitary groups disproportionately target Tamils. Muththiah also claims that the evidence showed that his family still in Sri Lanka continues to receive threatening phone calls demanding money. Finally, Muththiah claims the evidence showed that he had a well-founded fear of reprisal from the smuggler who helped him leave because Muththiah informed the FBI about the smuggler.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">We are not persuaded by Muththi-ah\u2019s argument. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Muththi-ah\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims failed because he did not establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily protected factor. Even assuming that the past harm Muththiah and his family endured amounted to \u201cpersecution,\u201d nothing in the record linked that harm to the family\u2019s Tamil ethnicity. Muththiah could not identify the perpetrators and, by his own testimony, their threats turned on demands for money rather than his family\u2019s ethnicity. It is true that the country reports and news articles entered into evidence showed that Tamils have been, and continue to be, subject to human rights abuses. However, those same reports also indicated that other ethnicities were targeted by paramilitary groups, and that some of the paramilitary groups were themselves Tamil.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Because the record does not compel a conclusion that Muththiah was persecuted on account of his ethnicity, he does not benefit from presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. In any event, the evidence does not demonstrate that Muththiah will be targeted for persecution based on his ethnicity if he returns to Sri Lanka. Muththiah\u2019s claimed threat of persecution from the smuggler who he identified to authorities would not be based on a ground protected under the INA. Finally, because Muththiah failed to prove he is entitled to asylum relief, he necessarily failed to demonstrate his eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">Next, Muththiah contends that the BIA improperly engaged in factfinding and erroneously concluded that he did not demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his attempt to secure asylum in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">Department of Justice regulations provide that, \u201c[e]xcept for taking administrative notice of commonly known facts such as current events or the contents of official documents, the [BIA] will not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>peals.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (2013). In the context of a well-founded fear determination, this means that the BIA may not find facts or review <em>de novo </em>those facts found by the IJ. <em>See Zhou Hua Zhu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>703 F.3d 1303, 1311-14 (11th Cir.2013). Additional regulations provide that asylum applications and associated records shall not be disclosed without the written consent of the applicant. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.6 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Muththiah argues first that the BIA made an improper finding of fact by noting that, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.6, the asylum process in this country is confidential and thereby rejecting Muththiah\u2019s claim to fear of future persecution because of his current request for asylum. Second, Muththiah argues that the record compels a conclusion that he would be subject to future persecution based on his asylum application, particularly in light of his testimony that a bribe was required to secure safe release after his prior failed asylum attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Muththiah\u2019s arguments in this regard fail as well. First, the BIA\u2019s reference to the confidentiality of asylum proceedings did not amount to a factfinding, but instead merely recited the law. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.6. Second, substantial evidence undergirded the BIA\u2019s determination that Muththiah did not demonstrate a well-founded fear of reprisal for seeking asylum. Specifically, Muththiah\u2019s family remained unharmed in Sri Lanka, and he was able to return safely to the country following a failed asylum attempt. Because Muththiah failed to satisfy his burden with respect to asylum relief on this ground, he likewise failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See For-gue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Finally, Muththiah argues that both the IJ and BIA erred by failing to engage in a \u201cmixed motive\u201d analysis of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), a final order of removal is reviewable only if \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2006). The exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional and precludes review of a claim that was not presented to the BIA. <em>See Fernandez-Bernal v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001). We \u201cmust inquire into subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>See Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, we address whether Muththiah exhausted his administrative remedies with regard to his \u201cmixed motive\u201d claim before the BIA, even though neither party raises the issue in their brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">Muththiah\u2019s notice of appeal to the BIA challenged the IJ\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding past persecution and his fear of future persecution, but it made no mention of the IJ\u2019s alleged failure to perform a \u201cmixed motive\u201d analysis of his claims. We therefore lack jurisdiction to entertain the \u201cmixed motive\u201d challenge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Fernandez-Bernal, 2UJ </em>F.3d at 1317 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>For these reasons, we deny Muththiah\u2019s petition in part and dismiss the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-16\">. Muththiah also sought relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT), which the IJ and BIA denied. However, he has abandoned any challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because he did not raise the issue in his brief to this Court. \"When an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\" <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\">. Muththiah\u2019s counsel unsuccessfully moved to extend the briefing schedule and filed a statement in lieu of a brief rather than briefing the appeal to the BIA. The statement explained that \u201d[c]ounsel previously filed an extensive closing argument in this matter as well as providing information in the Notice of Appeal as to errors in the Judge's decision.\u201d Because this statement in lieu of a brief did not add any argument about whether the IJ improperly failed to perform a mixed-motive analysis, we rely solely on the notice of appeal to the BIA in determining whether Muththi-ah\u2019s mixed-motive analysis claim is properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
