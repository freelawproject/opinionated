Because he had three prior convictions qualifying under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), the statutory minimum sentence Corey could receive was 15-years\u2019 imprisonment, so the District Court sentenced him to prison for a 15-years\u2019 term. He appeals his sentence, arguing (1) that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to him because it exceeds Congress\u2019 authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>under the Commerce Clause; (2) that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated because he was sentenced to a term above the statutory maximum sentence based on prior convictions not alleged in his indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) that the residual clause in \u00a7 924(e) is unconstitutionally vague. After careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Corey\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Corey argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him because it exceeds Congress\u2019 authority under the Commerce Clause. We review <em>de novo </em>the constitutionality of a statute. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 715 (11th Cir.2010). Section \u00a7 922(g)(1) makes it unlawful for a convicted felon \u201cto ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We have repeatedly upheld \u00a7 922(g)(1) against facial attacks as a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019 power under the Commerce Clause. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1273 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that \u201cthe jurisdictional element of the statute, <em>i.e., </em>the requirement that the felon \u2018possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition,\u2019 immunizes \u00a7 922(g)(1) from [a] facial constitutional attack\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>124 F.3d 1265, 1266 (11th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 389-90 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">We have also upheld \u00a7 922(g)(1) against as-applied challenges, where the Government has shown a \u201cminimal nexus\u201d between the firearm and interstate commerce. <em>McAllister, </em>77 F.3d at 390. A showing that the firearm was manufactured in one state and traveled in interstate commerce to another state satisfies the \u201cminimal nexus\u201d test. <em>Scott, </em>263 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">As Corey readily concedes in his appellate brief, his facial challenge to \u00a7 922(g)(1) is foreclosed by our precedent upholding \u00a7 922(g) under similar facial attacks. His as-applied challenge to \u00a7 922(g) is also unavailing. At the plea colloquy, he admitted that the firearm was manufactured outside of Florida and thus traveled in and affected interstate commerce. As such, this was sufficient to show a \u201cminimal nexus\u201d between the firearm and its connection to interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">Corey argues that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated because he was sentenced above the statutory maximum sentence based on prior convictions not alleged in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. His argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that, for sentencing enhancement purposes, a defendant\u2019s prior conviction does not have to be alleged in the indictment or submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 239-40, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 1228-29, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">Corey argues that the residual clause in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) is unconstitutionally vague. Under \u00a7 924(e), a person who violates \u00a7 922(g)(1) and has three previous convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>committed on occasions different from one another\u201d will be subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15-years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The residual clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) defines a violent felony as any offense that \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">In <em>James v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the argument \u201cthat the [ACCA\u2019s] residual provision is unconstitutionally vague.\u201d 550 U.S. 192, 210 n. 6, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1598 n. 6, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). The Court stated that \u201c[t]he statutory requirement that an unenumerated crime \u2018otherwise involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u2019 is not so indefinite as to prevent an ordinary person from understanding what conduct it prohibits.\u201d <em>Id., </em>550 U.S. at 210 n. 6, 127 S.Ct. at 1598 n. 6. (brackets omitted). In <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court noted that the residual clause \u201cstates an intelligible principle and provides guidance that allows a person to conform his or her conduct to the law. Although this approach may at times be more difficult for courts to implement, it is within congressional power to enact.\u201d \u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2277, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011) (citation and quotation omitted). The holdings in <em>James </em>and <em>Sykes </em>foreclose Corey\u2019s vagueness challenge. <em>See United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 978 n. 3 (11th Cir.2012), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 288, 184 L.Ed.2d 169 (2012) (stating that the position taken by the Supreme Court in <em>Sykes </em>appears to foreclose lower courts from concluding that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
