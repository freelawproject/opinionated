He was deemed a career offender and, after a downward departure, was sentenced to 98 months in prison and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Duncan is not entitled to relief on appeal. The district court did not plainly err in applying the career offender enhancement as the state court charging documents for Duncan\u2019s 1998 and 2003 convictions reveal that Duncan violated the state statute within the relevant definition of a controlled substance offense for purposes of the career offender enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b); <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>255 Fed.Appx. 849, 851 (5th Cir.2007). Additionally, the district court\u2019s denial of a mitigating role adjustment was not clearly erroneous because Duncan\u2019s roles, such as being a contact person, recruiting his son to assist him, and stealing the marijuana that he intended to sell, were essential, not peripheral, to the overall scheme underlying the instant offense of conviction. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
