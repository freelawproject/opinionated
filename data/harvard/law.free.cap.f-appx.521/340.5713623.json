The Government has filed an unopposed motion for summary affirmance or, in the alternative, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-22\">In his first claim, Rocha-Martinez contends that the district court erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>assessing a 16-level \u201cdrug trafficking\u201d enhancement under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), based on his prior federal conviction for conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute. He argues that a conspiracy conviction such as his prior conviction, which has been obtained pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, does not require proof of an overt act and thus does not meet the generic, contemporary definition of conspiracy for purposes of applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement. As the parties concede, this issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751, 753-55 (5th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2044, 185 L.Ed.2d 902, 2013 WL 1313840 (Apr. 29, 2013) (No. 12-9483).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In his second claim, Rocha-Martinez contends that the district court erred in not awarding an additional one-level reduction of his offense level for acceptance of responsibility under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3El.l(b) when the Government declined to move for the reduction after he refused to sign a plea agreement containing an appeal waiver. As the parties concede, this issue is likewise foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 376-79 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">In light of the foregoing, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
