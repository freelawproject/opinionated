(successor-in-interest to Wachovia Bank, N.A.) for violations of Florida\u2019s Civil Remedies for Criminal Practices Act (\u201cFlorida RICO Act\u201d), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 772.101, and for conspiracy to violate the Florida RICO Act. Horaee-Manasse also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration, filed pursuant to Rules 59 and 60(b)(6). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. <em>Hill v. White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">Between January 2007 and December 2008, George Theodule and others perpetrated a Ponzi scheme in which they stole over $68 million from investors, including Horaee-Manasse and members of the class she seeks to represent. Wells Fargo\u2019s alleged involvement in the scheme stems from Theodule\u2019s use of Wachovia\u2019s banking services \u2014 over a five-month period \u2014 to conduct his illegal operations. During this time, Theodule laundered more than $10 million through various Wachovia accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">Horaee-Manasse filed this complaint against Wells Fargo, alleging violations of the Florida RICO Act and conspiracy to violate the Florida RICO Act. She asserted that Wachovia willfully and knowingly participated in a pattern of criminal activity by repeatedly accepting cash deposits in excess of $10,000 without filing Currency Transaction Reports, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956. Horaee-Manasse also alleged that Wachovia violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957 when it continued to permit large cash deposits and withdrawals \u2014 and failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports \u2014 after being put on notice that the cash represented proceeds from illegal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-14\">The district court granted Wells Fargo\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss concluding that \u2014 although Horaee-Manasse had alleged criminal conduct within the meaning of the Florida RICO Act \u2014 she had not alleged sufficient \u201ccontinuity\u201d to state a claim under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-15\">On appeal, Horaee-Manasse does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that she failed to satisfy the \u201ccontinuity\u201d element. Instead, she argues that \u201ccontinuity\u201d is no required element of the Florida RICO Act. In particular, she contends that (1) meaningful differences exist between the federal RICO Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 <em>et seq., </em>and the Florida RICO Act; (2) the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., </em>492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) (interpreting the federal RICO Act to include a \u201ccontinuity\u201d requirement), \u201cimplicitly holds\u201d that continuity is not required under the Florida RICO Act; (3) no Florida court has addressed the textual analysis in <em>H.J. Inc.; </em>and (4) courts from other jurisdictions with RICO statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>similar to Florida\u2019s have concluded that continuity is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The Florida RICO Act makes it \u201cunlawful for any person ... [e]mployed by, or associated with, any enterprise to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in such enterprise through a pattern of criminal activity.... \u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 772.103(3). To state a claim under the Florida RICO Act, Plaintiff must allege facts showing \u201c(1) conduct or participation in an enterprise through (2) a pattern of [criminal] activity.\u201d <em>Lugo v. State, </em>845 So.2d 74, 97 (Fla.2003) (interpreting Florida\u2019s criminal RICO Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 895.01 <em>et seq.)</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Contrary to Horace-Manasse\u2019s arguments, the Florida Supreme Court has said \u2014 post-N./. <em>Inc. </em>\u2014 that \u201ccontinuity\u201d <em>is </em>a required element under the Florida RICO Act. <em>See id. </em>at 99 (\u201cTo satisfy the pattern of racketeering element, the State must offer ... proof that a continuity of particular criminal activity exists.\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. Lucas, </em>600 So.2d 1093, 1094 (Fla.1992) (\u201cWe construe the \u2018pattern\u2019 element to require ... proof that a continuity of particular criminal activity exists.\u201d (citing <em>Bowden v. State, </em>402 So.2d 1173, 1174 (Fla.1981))).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Although Horace-Manasse objects to the <em>Bowden </em>decision as being based on an \u201cincomplete definition\u201d and objects to the <em>Lugo </em>and <em>Lucas </em>decisions as being \u201cdevoid of any independent analysis,\u201d we will not judge the soundness of the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements of the state law. Instead, when deciding a diversity case based on state substantive law, we \u201cmust \u2018decide the case the way it appears the state\u2019s highest court would.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ernie Haire Ford, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>260 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2001). Because the Florida Supreme Court has said that \u201ccontinuity\u201d is a required element of the Florida RICO Act and because Plaintiff does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that she failed to satisfy the \u201ccontinuity\u201d element, the district court properly granted Wells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of Rule 59 and 60(b) motions for abuse of discretion. <em>Willard v. Fairfield S. Co., </em>472 F.3d 817, 821 (1 1th Cir.2006) (Rule 60(b) motions); <em>Lockard v. Equifax, Inc., </em>163 F.3d 1259, 1267 (11th Cir.1998) (Rule 59 motions). Because Horace-Manasse\u2019s arguments are unsupported by Florida case law, the court abused no discretion in denying her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">The Florida Supreme Court has unambiguously said that the Florida RICO Act includes a \u201ccontinuity\u201d element. Thus, we deny Horace-Manasse\u2019s alternative request to certify a question to the Florida Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\"> In 1986, Florida separated its RICO statute into a civil RICO Act, codified in Chapter 772, and a criminal RICO Act, which remained codified in Chapter 895.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
