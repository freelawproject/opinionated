The district court concluded that Stone qualified for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), but declined to reduce his sentence after consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, noting that Stone attempted to sell cocaine base while in possession of a firearm and had a lengthy criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-20\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if the sentence was based on a sentencing range that has been subsequently lowered by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In determining whether to reduce a sentence, the court must first recalculate the defendant\u2019s guidelines range under the amended guidelines and must then consider whether a reduction is warranted by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). The court\u2019s power to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence is discretionary. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>The district court\u2019s order here demonstrates that it properly recalculated Stone\u2019s amended guidelines range and then properly considered the pertinent factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense and Stone\u2019s criminal history. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to consider Stone\u2019s post-conviction rehabilitation, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)) (\u201cThe court <em>may </em>consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant .... \u201d (emphasis added)), and it adequately explained its reasons for denying Stone\u2019s motions. Accordingly, we find the court did not commit a clear error in judgment by declining to reduce Stone\u2019s sentence and affirm the denial of Stone\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction and his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
