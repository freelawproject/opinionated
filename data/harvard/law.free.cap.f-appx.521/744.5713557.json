On appeal, Morales argues that the BIA erred when it determined he was admitted as a crewman and therefore statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal. He contends that he was not admitted as a crewman because his C-l/D visa was fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-16\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). One way the BIA abuses its discretion is if it reaches its decision \u201cin an arbitrary or irrational manner.\u201d <em>Gomez-Gomez v. INS, </em>681 F.2d 1347,1349 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-17\">Generally, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review discretionary determinations regarding applications of cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) (2006); <em>Jimenez-Galicia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>690 F.3d 1207, 1209 (11th Cir.2012). However, we have jurisdiction over questions of law that arise from the denial of an application for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Jimenez-Galicia, </em>690 F.3d at 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-18\">We review questions of law <em>de novo. De Sandoval v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2006). We \u201cwill defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of a statute if it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Quinchia v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number><em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>552 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Morales was working at a restaurant in Peru when he was given a letter, apparently offering employment on a cruise ship. He took the letter to the United States Embassy in Peru and applied for a C-l/D visa to enter as a crewman. He was issued the visa and entered the United States on the C-l/D visa.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">What happened once Morales entered the United States is not entirely clear. What we do know is that Morales entered on a C-l/D visa and has continuously maintained that the purpose of his trip to the United States was to work on a ship. We also know that Morales\u2019s visa was subsequently revoked after the U.S. State Department determined that the letter of cruise ship employment was fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">\u201cAn alien who entered the United States as a crewman subsequent to June 30, 1964[,]\u201d is not eligible for cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(c)(l) (2006). When determining whether an alien qualifies as a crewman, the BIA examines the alien\u2019s visa \u201cand the circumstances surrounding his entry into the United States.\u201d <em>Matter of G-D-M-, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dee. 82, 85 (BIA 2009). If an \u201calien was issued a visa as a crewman and entered the United States in pursuit of his occupation as a seaman, then he is to be regarded as an alien crewman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As this Court has explained, \u201cthe focal issue is whether [the] petitioner entered the United States in pursuit of his calling as a seaman.\u201d <em>Par-zagonis v. INS, </em>747 F.2d 1389, 1390 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Morales\u2019s visa application, C-l/D visa, and statements to immigration officials at his arrival and during these proceedings indicating that he came to the United States to work on a ship, support the conclusion that he \u201centered the United States in pursuit of his calling as a seaman.\u201d <em>See Parzagonis, </em>747 F.2d at 1390. Even though it was later determined that his visa was fraudulently obtained, that does not change the fact that he was \u201cissued a visa as a crewman and entered the United States in pursuit of his occupation as a seaman.\u201d <em>See Matter of G-D-M- </em>25 I &amp; N Dec. at 85. \u201cBy choosing to seek entry to the United States as a crewman, [Morales] agreed to the limitations associated with that status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84. Therefore, Morales was not eligible for cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">Based on foregoing circumstances, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Morales\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, we deny Morales\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">Petition Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
