Carter appeals from the district court\u2019s final order granting dismissal to Appellees DeKalb County, Georgia and seven police officers, Officer Bruce Bruggeman, Sergeant . Albert Mitchum, Officer Bartien Moore, Detective James Paden, Lieutenant Gregory Vanderpool, Detective Kevin White, and Officer Jason Sawyer. Carter\u2019s complaint alleged that the Appellees violated his constitutional rights when he was taken to DeKalb County Police Department headquarters for questioning after his wife was found dead in his home on July 31, 2011. On appeal, Carter argues that the district court erred in: (1) dismissing the complaint before allowing Carter to conduct discovery regarding DeKalb County policies, customs and procedures; (2) concluding that the Appellees did not subject Carter to unconstitutional conditions of confinement; and (3) concluding that the Appellees did not falsely imprison Carter with malice or intent and that the Appel-lees\u2019 course of conduct did not intentionally inflict emotional distress on Carter. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), taking the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <em>Edwards v. Prime, Inc., </em>602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir.2010). Dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper if the factual allegations are not enough to raise a right of relief above the speculative level. <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A complaint requires more than labels and conclusions, and more than a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action. <em>Id. </em>The facts alleged in a complaint must \u201cpossess enough heft to set forth a plausible entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>602 F.3d at 1276 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-13\">For starters, we agree with the Appellees that Carter\u2019s complaint makes numerous general statements regarding the \u201cDefendants\u201d but makes few, if any, distinctions amongst the seven individually-named police officers. In fact, the complaint does not allege that Appellants Bruggeman, Mitchum, Moore or Vander-pool took any action at all. The only action Carter\u2019s complaint alleges Detective Paden took is that he went to the hospital to view Mrs. Carter\u2019s body and found no evidence of trauma. Since Carter\u2019s complaint has not alleged any causes of action against Bruggeman, Mitchum, Moore, Vanderpool or Paden, the district court properly dismissed the allegations against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Carter says, nevertheless, that he should have had an opportunity to conduct discovery to uncover the actions each police officer took that day. As the Supreme Court has noted, however, \u201cthe doors of discovery\u201d do not unlock \u201cfor a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678-79, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Rather, discovery <em>follows </em>\u201cthe filing of a well-pleaded complaint. It is not a device to enable the plaintiff to make a case when his complaint has failed to state a claim.\u201d <em>Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1367 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). As we\u2019ve explained, \u201c[f]acial challenges to the legal sufficiency of a claim or defense, such as a motion to dismiss based on failure to state a claim for relief, should ... be resolved before discovery begins. Such a dispute always presents a purely legal question; there are no issues of fact because the allegations contained in the pleading are presumed to be true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). \u201cTherefore, neither the parties nor the court have any need for discovery before the court rules on the motion.\u201d <em>Id.; Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 2 (11th Cir.2002); <em>see also Epps v. Watson, </em>492 F.3d 1240, 1243 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cWithin the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, ... the well-pleaded factual allegations in the plaintiffs complaint are the focus of the determinations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">This is especially true in a case like this, involving the qualified immunity doctrine, which gives \u201ccomplete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities as long as their conduct violates no clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1193-94 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). Because qualified immunity is a defense not only from liability, but also from suit, it is \u201cimportant for a court to ascertain the validity of a qualified immunity defense as early in the lawsuit as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Thus, \u201c[ujnless the plaintiffs allegations state a claim of violation of clearly established law, a defendant pleading qualified immunity is entitled to dismissal before the commencement of discovery.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985); <em>Epps, </em>492 F.3d at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Alternatively, Carter claims that he should have been allowed to re-plead his complaint. However, we\u2019ve held that \u201c[a] district court is not required to grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint sua sponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by counsel, never filed a motion to amend [ Jor requested leave to amend before the district court.\u201d <em>Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir.2002) (en banc). Here, Carter was represented by counsel but did not move for leave to amend, <em>see United States ex rel. Sanchez v. Lymphatx, Inc., </em>596 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2010), nor has Carter indicated, even on appeal to this Court, what precisely his amended complaint would reveal. <em>See DiMaio v. Democratic Nat\u2019l Comm., </em>520 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant leave that was never requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Next, we reject Carter\u2019s claim that the district court improperly dismissed the complaint before allowing Carter to conduct discovery about DeKalb County policies, customs and procedures. A local government body can be held liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 \u201cwhen execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom ... inflicts the injury.\u201d <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). In order to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>strate governmental liability, \u201cthe plaintiff has the burden to show that a deprivation of constitutional rights occurred as a result of official government policy or custom.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Dillon, </em>403 F.3d 1208, 1221 (11th Cir.2005). A threshold identification of a custom or policy should initially be made. <em>McDowell v. Brown, </em>392 F.3d 1283, 1290 (11th Cir.2004). There are three ways to show a governmental policy or custom: (1) an express policy; (2) a widespread practice so permanent and well-settled as to constitute a custom; or (3) the act or decision of a municipal official with final policy-making authority. <em>Cuesta v. School Bd. of Miami-Dade Cnty., </em>285 F.3d 962, 966-68 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Here, Carter\u2019s complaint does not allege that any pattern, practice or custom of DeKalb County has caused him harm. Instead, Carter argues that he should have had the opportunity to conduct discovery to determine the customs, patterns and practices of DeKalb County and the individual defendants concerning the treatment of detainees being interrogated. As we\u2019ve already said, however, discovery <em>fol-\u00edolos </em>a well-pleaded complaint; not the other way around. Because Carter\u2019s complaint does not allege any unconstitutional policy or custom, the court did not err in dismissing Carter\u2019s municipal liability claim against the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We also are unpersuaded by Carter\u2019s argument that the district court erred in dismissing his conditions-of-confinement claim. To survive a motion to dismiss based upon qualified immunity, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to support a finding of a constitutional violation of a clearly established right. <em>Chandler v. Sec. of Fla. Dep\u2019t of Trans., </em>695 F.3d 1194, 1198-99 (11th Cir.2012). The right must be clear enough that any reasonable officer \u201cwould understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d <em>Morton v. Kirkwood, </em>707 F.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir.2013) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Claims involving the mistreatment of arrestees in custody \u201care governed by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause instead of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, which applies to such claims by convicted prisoners.\u201d <em>Cottrell v. Caldwell, </em>85 F.3d 1480, 1490 (11th Cir.1996). Regardless, the minimum standard under the Due Process Clause for pretrial detainees\u2019 basic necessities \u2014 including food, living space, and medical care \u2014 is the same as that allowed by the Eighth Amendment for convicted persons. <em>Hamm v. DeKalb County, </em>774 F.2d 1567, 1574 (11th Cir.1985). A plaintiff must show \u201ca deprivation or injury that is sufficiently serious to constitute a denial of the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities and a subjective showing that the official had a sufficiently culpable state of mind.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Bryant, </em>614 F.3d 1288, 1304 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted). A claim for an unconstitutional condition of confinement requires extreme deprivations. <em>Id.; see also Chandler v. Crosby, </em>379 F.3d 1278, 1289-90 (11th Cir.2004) (condition must be \u201cextreme\u201d and must pose \u201can unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health\u201d (quotation omitted)). The risk of harm from the condition must be \u201cso grave that it violates contemporary standards of decency to expose <em>anyone </em>unwillingly to such a risk.\u201d <em>Chandler, </em>379 F.3d at 1290 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">In this case, Carter complains about the treatment he received when he was taken to police headquarters after his wife was found dead in his home. He claims that he was questioned even though his son had told police that Mrs. Carter had simply fallen on the stairs; however, the son\u2019s statement, which was attached to the complaint, also reports that prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>the fall, the son heard the couple \u201cfussing\u201d and \u201cyelling at\u201d each other, and it is unclear whether the son had seen the fight. Carter further alleges that during the three-hour period he was at police headquarters (from 1:42 p.m. until 4:52 p.m.), the officers refused to take him to the restroom and he urinated in his clothes. Carter then says that he was allowed to remove his pants, but still had to sit in his underpants. Carter also alleges that he was denied his food and water requests during the three-hour period, and became \u201cacutely ill\u201d to the point an ambulance was called and took him to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Carter has not cited to any cases addressing whether a constitutional violation is stated when an arrestee is not permitted to use the toilet or given food or water during a three-hour period. He could, of course, still show the violation of a clearly established right by describing conduct \u201cso far beyond the hazy border between\u201d acceptable and unacceptable conditions the official had to know he was violating the Constitution even without caselaw on point. <em>Morton, </em>707 F.3d at 1282 (quotation omitted). So, for example, in <em>Hope v. Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002), the Supreme Court found a clear Eighth Amendment violation when corrections officers handcuffed an inmate to a hitching post for seven hours in the hot sun without a bathroom break, all the while taunting the inmate about his thirst. The Court noted that despite the absence of any emergency, the officers knowingly subjected the inmate to a substantial risk of physical harm and to unnecessary pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">This case is nothing like <em>Hope. </em>At most, Carter alleges that he had to sit inside, in wet underpants, without food or drink for a few hours while the police questioned him \u2014 after the police received a statement that Carter and his wife had been fighting before she fell. He does not explain why he ended up going to the hospital, nor does he say that he was denied medical help when he needed it. Moreover, unlike the inmate\u2019s situation in <em>Hope, </em>Carter was undergoing police interrogation, which we\u2019ve said, \u201cis theoretically undertaken for the public good in the first instance.\u201d <em>Tinker v. Beasley, </em>429 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2005). Therefore, we cannot say that Carter has alleged any \u201cextreme\u201d conditions that pose \u201can unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health.\u201d <em>Chandler, </em>379 F.3d at 1289-90 (quotation omitted). This claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">We are likewise unconvinced by Carter\u2019s claim that he was \u201ctricked\u201d into signing a <em>Miranda </em>waiver. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602,16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), established procedural safeguards concerning the rights of an accused to be free from compelled self-incrimination during custodial interrogation. In <em>Chavez v. Martinez, </em>four members of the Supreme Court held that a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff who had been interviewed for a crime but never given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and never charged with a crime stated no Fifth Amendment violation because he was never prosecuted for the crime nor compelled to be a witness against himself in a criminal proceeding. 538 U.S. 760, 764, 766-67, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 155 L.Ed.2d 984 (2003). Justice Souter constituted a fifth vote for holding that the claim would need to be remanded to determine the merits of whether the suspect could state a claim for substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 780, 123 S.Ct. 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">In <em>Tinker, </em>we held that a substantive due process violation occurs during an involuntary confession only if \u201cthe specific conduct alleged rises to a level of coercive interrogation that \u2018shocks the conscience.\u2019 \u201d 429 F.3d at 1327. Conduct \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>tended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1328. But \u201conly the most egregious official conduct will be the sort of abusive executive action that can be sufficiently arbitrary for constitutional recognition as a potentially viable substantive due process claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We noted that \u201cconscience shocking\u201d circumstances included police directing an emergency room doctor to extract against a suspect\u2019s will his stomach contents which included heroine-filled capsules. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. We concluded, however, that police conduct of falsely informing a suspect that her attorney had \u201cabandoned\u201d her and convincing her to sign a waiver of rights form and interrogating her multiple times over three days did not shock the conscience. <em>Id. </em>at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">As we\u2019ve noted, this case involves a suspect who was questioned for three hours after police obtained a report that he and the victim had been fighting prior to a fatal fall. And while Carter alleges that Detective White promised to take Carter to the hospital to see his wife in exchange for a <em>Miranda </em>waiver, it is not clear from the complaint whether the detective maintained that she was alive. Nor, furthermore, does the complaint allege that Detective White knew during the interrogation that there was no trauma to Mrs. Carter\u2019s body, since Carter says that another detective inspected the body. Given the circumstances of the interrogation and the lack of allegations revealing that the officer\u2019s conduct was deceitful, we cannot say the conduct alleged rose \u201cto a level of coercive interrogation that \u2018shocks the conscience.\u2019\u201d <em>Tinker, </em>429 F.3d at 1328. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Carter\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Finally, we find no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Carter\u2019s state-law claims. Georgia\u2019s doctrine of official immunity provides that a public officer or employee in his individual capacity may be personally liable only for ministerial acts negligently performed or discretionary acts performed -with malice or intent to injure. <em>Grammens v. Dollar, </em>287 Ga. 618, 697 S.E.2d 775, 777 (2010). Malice for official immunity purposes is defined as \u201c \u2018express malice or malice in fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merrow v. Hawkins, </em>266 Ga. 390, 467 S.E.2d 336, 338 (1996). Willful and wanton misconduct is \u201cconduct \u2018such as to evidence a wilful intention to inflict the injury, or else was so reckless or so charged with indifference to the consequences ... as to justify the jury in finding a wantonness equivalent in spirit to actual intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Truelove v. Wilson, </em>159 Ga.App. 906, 908, 285 S.E.2d 556 (1981) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Here, Carter\u2019s complaint does not allege that any of the officers acted with express malice, malice-in-fact or with intent to injure him. Nor has Carter connected any action made by any of the seven individually-named defendants to an injury that would be considered a willful intention to inflict harm. He argues on appeal that malice can be inferred from the conditions of confinement and trickery allegations he made. Yet, as we\u2019ve described above, Carter\u2019s allegations fail to describe blatantly deceitful conduct, much less actual malice or an intent to injure. Because Carter has not alleged that any of the Appellees acted with actual malice or intent to cause injury, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of the Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss Carter\u2019s state-law false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
