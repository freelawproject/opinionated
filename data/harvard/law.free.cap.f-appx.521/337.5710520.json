Funes-Bonilla maintains that the BIA erred in finding that he failed to establish changed country conditions for homosexuals in Honduras.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">An alien, like Funes-Bonilla, may move to reopen his immigration proceedings \u201c[t]o apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of deportation based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality ... if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>see Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 631 (5th Cir.2005). The evidence submitted by Funes-Bonilla in connection with his first motion to reopen, however, did not show a change in conditions for homosexuals in Honduras since the time of his removal proceedings. <em>See In re S-Y-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 253 (BIA 2007). Furthermore, Funes-Bonilla failed to establish that the evidence he submitted in connection with his second motion to reopen was not available when he filed his first motion to reopen. <em>See Ogbemudia v. I.N.S., </em>988 F.2d 595, 599-600 (5th Cir.1993); 1003.2(c)(1). Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Funes-Bonilla\u2019s motions to reopen and remand. <em>See Panjwani, </em>401 F.3d at 631-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Funes-Bonilla also contends that the BIA failed to consider his evidence of changed conditions and failed to explain the reasons for its decision. We will \u201creview the BIA\u2019s decision '\u2018procedurally\u2019 to ensure that the complaining alien has received full and fair consideration of all circumstances that give rise to his or her claims.\u201d <em>Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 585 (5th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). Although the BIA is not required to \u201caddress evidentiary minutiae or write any lengthy exegesis, its decision must reflect meaningful consideration of the relevant substantial evidence supporting the alien\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Our review of the record indicates that the BIA noted that (1) even though Funes-Bonilla failed to present an argument regarding changed country conditions in his first motion to reopen, the IJ nevertheless correctly concluded that Funes-Bonilla\u2019s evidence failed to establish changed conditions and (2) even though Funes-Bonilla\u2019s second motion to reopen and evidence were not properly before it on appeal, his second motion and evidence, especially the State Department\u2019s human rights reports, also failed to establish changed conditions. Thus, although the BIA did not discuss all of the evidence of record, we are satisfied that it meaningfully considered Funes-Bonilla\u2019s evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Finally, by failing to brief his claims for asylum and withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) or the Convention Against Torture in his initial appellate brief, Funes-Bonilla has abandoned them. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 360 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-33\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
