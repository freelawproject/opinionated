Morris sought a new trial based on newly-discovered evidence. Fed. R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-22\">The government argues that we should dismiss Morris\u2019s appeal because his written notice was untimely, but we disagree. Under the mailbox rule, a notice of appeal filed <em>pro se </em>is treated as filed on the date the inmate delivers his notice to the prison authorities. <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 270, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 2382, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). The district court entered its order denying Morris\u2019s post-trial motions on January 5, 2012, and Morris submitted to prison officials a notice of intent to appeal on January 17, 2012. Because Morris\u2019s notice states that he intends to appeal the denial of his post-trial motions, the notice satisfies the requirements for a written notice of appeal, under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c). <em>See United States v. Ward, </em>696 F.2d 1315, 1318 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.1983). Morris\u2019s notice of appeal was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-23\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Morris\u2019s motions for a new trial as untimely. Morris acknowledges that he filed his motions more than three years after his convictions, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1), and his arguments for equitable tolling or excusable neglect fail. Morris argues that his incarceration in various jails and his involuntary commitment in a mental institution for ten months after his conviction constituted a \u201clegal disability\u201d that tolled the period to move for a new trial, but Morris admitted in an affidavit that he filed complaints against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>both his counsel and the prosecutor during this period. Morris also argues that his appellate counsel \u201cignored\u201d his allegedly newly-discovered evidence and refused to file a timely post-trial motion, but \u201c[c]oun-sel\u2019s misunderstanding of the law cannot constitute excusable neglect\u201d to extend a deadline under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(b)(1)(B). <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 865 (11th Cir.2010) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). And Morris argues that the prosecutor interfered with his ability to file a timely motion for a new trial by causing trial counsel to withdraw from the case, but the district court appointed new counsel the same day that it granted trial counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">We AFFIRM the denial of Morris\u2019s motion for a new trial as untimely.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
