He was sentenced above the advisory guidelines range to concurrent statutory maximum terms of imprisonment of 120 months on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-26\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in denying Dean an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Dean argues that he should have received a two-level reduction in his base offense level under \u00a7 3E1.1, because he pleaded guilty to the charges in the superseding information, which specifically alleged possession of a stolen .38 caliber firearm; his plea agreement was based upon those charges; and he had no disagreement with the factual basis, which provided that he admitted to possessing the firearm described in the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u201cWhile the district court\u2019s findings under the sentencing guidelines are generally reviewed for clear error, a determination whether a defendant is entitled to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is reviewed with even greater deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>485 F.3d 274, 287 (5th Cir.2007). We will affirm a sentencing court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction unless it is without foundation. <em>United States v. Rudzavice, </em>586 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Section 3E1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines authorizes a two-level reduction \u201c[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). Although entering a guilty plea prior to trial is a factor to be considered in determining whether an adjustment is warranted, it is not dispositive. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment (n.3). Rather, acceptance of responsibility requires that a defendant demonstrate \u201csincere contrition regarding the <em>full extent </em>of [his] criminal conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>39 F.3d 568, 572 (5th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis in original). In addition to whether the defendant entered a guilty plea, the district court takes into account other factors, including whether the defendant truthfully admitted, or at least did not falsely deny, the conduct comprising the offense, including additional relevant conduct for which he is responsible. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 1(a)); see also \u00a7 3E1.1, comment (n. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">According to the factual resume, with which Dean agreed, officers seized several firearms during the execution of a search warrant of Dean\u2019s residence. Dean admitted that the firearms in the house belonged to him. He specifically admitted that he owned a .38 caliber firearm and that he knew it had been stolen. Although the .38 caliber firearm was in the residence during the search, it was not discovered during the search. Dean\u2019s codefendant later buried the gun in the backyard of the residence, where it was found by officers days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Although Dean pleaded guilty to possessing the .38 caliber firearm, he subsequently denied any knowledge of the gun during his presentence interview with the probation officer. Dean has attempted to explain his denial, but he has never refuted the fact of his denial \u2014 which was inconsistent with his prior admission to the court \u2014 or provided any testimony or evidence to rebut the presentence report\u2019s findings. Accordingly, the district court was entitled to rely on the presentence report, see <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 396 (5th Cir.2010), and consider Dean\u2019s subsequent denial in determining whether to grant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n. 1(a)); see also \u00a7 3E1.1, comment (n. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Under the circumstances, and in light of the highly deferential standard of review in this case, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s denial of the \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction was without foundation. <em>See Rudzavice, </em>586 F.3d at 315; <em>Buchanan, </em>485 F.3d at 287. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
