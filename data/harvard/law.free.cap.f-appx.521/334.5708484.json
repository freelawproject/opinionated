Tex. L.B.R. 8009.1. One authorized remedy for failure to comply with procedural rules is dismissal of the appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bank. P. 8001(a) (\u201cAn appellant\u2019s failure to take any step other than timely filing a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal.\u201d); <em>Ainsworth v. McDonald (In re McDonald), </em>327 Fed.Appx. 491 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (affirming district court\u2019s dismissal of bankruptcy appeal for appellant\u2019s failure to file a timely initial brief) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-22\">The docket sheet reflects, and Nixon does not dispute, that his brief was filed more than two months after the deadline, and leave to file an out-of-time brief was not granted. His brief on appeal to us does not offer a reason for the untimely filing, argument that dismissal was unwarranted, or authority that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the case. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
