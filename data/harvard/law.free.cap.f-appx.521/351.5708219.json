Contesting that sentence, Vargas contends the district court: erred by applying a 16-level crime of violence (COV) enhancement under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), pursuant to his conviction for conspiracy to commit armed robbery, in violation of Georgia Code Annotated \u00a7\u00a7 16^1-8, 16-8-41; and failed to rely upon proper documentation of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-23\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Because Vargas failed, however, to preserve in district court his contentions regarding his sentence, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327 (5th Cir.2012). (Arguably, the issues were waived by Vargas\u2019 counsel\u2019s comments at sentencing and would be, therefore, not subject to review.) For reversible plain error, Vargas must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). He fails to do so for each issue raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Vargas\u2019 contending the record lacks proper documentation of his prior offense lacks merit, because the PSR Addendum attached copies of the state-court judgment and indictment, and the Government supplemented the record on appeal with those documents. <em>E.g., United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 386-87 (5th Cir.2006) (state-court charging document or comparable judicial record may be considered to determine COV applicability). Additionally, the district court did not commit clear or obvious error by determining Vargas\u2019 conviction for conspiracy to commit armed robbery qualified as a COV for purposes of Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>E.g., United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 549-558, nn. 16-17 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc); <em>United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 380 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.2006); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(iii) and n. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
