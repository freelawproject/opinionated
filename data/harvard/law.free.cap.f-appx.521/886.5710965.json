Kivisto appeals the denial of his application to subpoena Michael Soifer, counsel for the Florida Bar, for discovery in aid of a foreign proceeding involving Kivisto\u2019s right to engage in the practice of law in Canada. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782. This litigation represents Kivisto\u2019s third federal suit for the purpose of collaterally attacking his disbarment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Susan Robbins, a private attorney, filed a complaint with the Bar alleging that Kivisto had demanded exorbitant fees for his work for an estate; had a conflict of interest in representing a second estate that had inherited money from the first estate; and had committed Medicaid fraud. The Bar dismissed the charge of Medicaid fraud, but a referee recommended disbarring Kivisto for charging excessive fees and engaging in conduct involving dishonesty and fraud and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. During the disbarment proceedings, Kivis-to \u201csubmitted over 120 filings with [the Supreme Court of Florida], the bulk of which were repetitive and meritless.\u201d <em>The Florida Bar v. Kivisto, </em>62 So.3d 1137, 1138 (Fla.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">After he petitioned the Supreme Court of Florida for review of the referee\u2019s report, Kivisto failed to file a timely brief in support of his petition. <em>Id. </em>The court granted Kivisto additional time to file his brief, but he continued to file motions and other papers \u201cin an attempt to delay the progress of his disciplinary case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ki-visto failed to file a brief within the additional time provided, and the court treated the referee\u2019s report as uncontested and disbarred Kivisto. <em>The Florida Bar v. Kivisto, </em>49 So.3d 747 (Fla.2010). Later, the court issued an order for Kivisto to show cause why he should not be sanctioned for his repetitive filings. <em>Kivisto, </em>62 So.3d at 1139. After Kivisto responded with \u201carguments regarding [his] disciplinary case,\u201d the court sanctioned Kivisto by refusing to accept any future filings except those signed by a member in good standing with the Bar. <em>Id. </em>at 1139-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-14\">Kivisto filed in the district court a complaint that Soifer, Robbins, and other attorneys had violated his civil rights, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-68, by conspiring to make false representations to the Supreme Court of Florida during its investigation and disciplinary proceedings. The district court dismissed the case with prejudice for failure to state a claim, and we affirmed. <em>Kivisto v. Miller, Canfield, Paddock and Stone, PLC, </em>413 Fed.Appx. 136 (11th Cir.2011). Kivisto later filed a second complaint against the same defendants that they had violated his civil rights. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>district court dismissed Kivisto\u2019s second complaint as barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel, and we affirmed. <em>Kivisto v. Soifer, </em>448 Fed.Appx. 923 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">In 2012, Kivisto applied for an order to subpoena Soifer. Kivisto alleged that Soi-fer, as counsel for the Florida Bar, possessed evidence that he, Susan Robbins, Robbins\u2019s law firm, and other attorneys conspired to \u201cfile[] with the Florida Bar ... a knowingly false grievance ... accusing [Kivisto] of Medicaid fraud ... to extort money\u201d from him; covered up the \u201cattempted extortion\u201d; and fabricated evidence to \u201cframe\u201d Kivisto for professional misconduct. Kivisto attached to his brief a copy of a letter from the Canadian Law Society dated December 10, 2010, stating that it had received notice of Kivisto\u2019s disbarment and was \u201cconsidering its course of action\u201d; inquiring whether Kivis-to \u201cintend[ed] to resume the practice of law in Ontario\u201d because he had been inactive since 1997; and requesting information about the status of his disbarment in Florida and his licensure in other jurisdictions. Kivisto also filed a document provided by the Society that explained its investigative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The district court denied Kivisto\u2019s application on the ground it \u201c[had] been made in bad faith, as a fishing expedition, or as a means to harass Soifer.\u201d The district court found that Kivisto was \u201ccontinuing] to drag out litigation that he [had] already lost and [had] continued to lose for years,\u201d and the court \u201cexercise[d] its discretion to prevent him from disguising more litigation under the pretext of additional discovery. ...\u201d The district court \u201cnote[d] that the Canadian bar association considering Kivisto\u2019s disbarment remain[ed] free under ... \u00a7 1782 to make its own application for information, if desired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">We review the denial of an application for discovery in a foreign proceeding for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Consorcio Ecuatoriano de Telecomunicaciones S.A. v. JAS Forwarding (USA), Inc., </em>685 F.3d 987, 993 (11th Cir.2012). Under that standard, \u201cour review ... is extremely limited and highly deferential.\u201d <em>United Kingdom v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1312, 1319 (11th Cir.2001). A district court has the authority to grant an application for discovery if the applicant satisfies statutory requirements, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782(a), but the \u201ccourt is not required to grant ... [the] application simply because it has the authority to do so.\u201d <em>Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., </em>542 U.S. 241, 264, 124 S.Ct. 2466, 2482, 159 L.Ed.2d 355 (2004). \u201c[F]aetors that bear consideration in ruling\u201d on an application include \u201cthe nature of the foreign tribunal, the character of the proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the foreign ... agency abroad to U.S. federal-court judicial assistance,\u201d and \u201cwhether the ... [application] conceals an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gathering restrictions or other policies of a foreign country or the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264, 265, 124 S.Ct. at 2483. The district court also may consider whether the application contains \u201cunduly intrusive or burdensome requests,\u201d <em>id,, </em>at 265, 124 S.Ct. at 2483, is \u201cmade in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment,\u201d <em>Euromepa S.A. v. R. Esmerian, Inc., </em>51 F.3d 1095, 1101 n. 6 (2d Cir.1995) (cited in <em>United Kingdom, </em>238 F.3d at 1319), or is part of a \u201cfishing expedition,\u201d <em>In re Request for Assistance from Ministry of Legal Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago, </em>848 F.2d 1151, 1156 (11th Cir.1988), <em>abrogated on a different ground by Intel Corp., 542 </em>U.S. at 259, 124 S.Ct. at 2480.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">The district court did not abuse its broad discretion by denying Kivisto\u2019s application for discovery. Kivisto failed to establish that the requested discovery would be useful to or accepted by the Canadian Law Society. Neither Kivisto\u2019s application nor his filings suggested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>the Society had commenced or intended to commence a formal disciplinary proceeding against him; the Society would find useful Kivisto\u2019s requested discovery; or the Society required any assistance in determining Kivisto\u2019s fitness to practice law in Canada. In the light of Kivisto\u2019s previous unsuccessful challenges to his disbarment, the district court reasonably found that Kivisto had sought the discovery for vexatious purposes. We expect \u201cthe district [court] [to] carefully examine and give thoughtful deliberation to any request for assistance submitted by an \u2018interested person\u2019 \u201d and \u201cdeny the request\u201d when it \u201csuspects that the request is a \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 or a vehicle for harassment.\u201d <em>Ministry of Legal Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago, </em>848 F.2d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">We AFFIRM the denial of Kivisto\u2019s application for discovery in aid of a foreign proceeding.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
