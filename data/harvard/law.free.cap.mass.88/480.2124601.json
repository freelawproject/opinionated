\u201d and that said Joseph has not performed said award, or paid said sum, though requested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\">The answer denied all the averments of the declaration, and further set forth that before the date of the bond the plaintiff had caused said Joseph to be arrested on a criminal charge, and thereafter, while the complaint was pending, promised him that, if he would sign the same, and obtain a person of responsibility to sign the same as surety, the plaintiff would not appear against him as a witness, but would retire to Canada, where he lived, so as to be out of the reach of a subpoena; and that the bond was accordingly executed under these circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">At the trial in the superior court, before <em>Brigham, </em>J., it appeared that the surety executed the bond first, and the same was afterwards, in the absence of the surety and upon the following day, executed by La Fleur, and delivered to the plaintiff; and that the award was signed and sealed up by the arbitrators, and delivered to one of their number, by whom it was read to La Fleur and an agent of the plaintiff, in the latter part of February 1862. The defendants thereupon requested the court to rule that under these circumstances the bond was not so executed as to be binding upon Lindsay, and that the plaintiff could not recover because he had shown ni <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>delivery or offer of delivery of the award to the plaintiff; but the judge declined so to rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-4\">The defendants offered evidence co show \u201c that the arbitrators, in making up their award, considered in the amount awarded the agreement of Rundell not to appear and testify against La Fleur; \u201d but the evidence was excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">The defendants offered evidence to show that at certain times and places the plaintiff had said that if La Fleur would give him the bond he would go away and not testify, but offered no evidence that any such thing was said at the time when the bond was signed by La Fleur. The plaintiff denied the truth of the above evidence; and was allowed to show, by Ralph Day, under objection, that he said no such thing at the time when the bond was signed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">Among other witnesses to impeach La Fleur, the plaintiff called Eli H. Patch, and asked him to state what was the general reputation of La Fleur for truth and veracity. The witness replied that <em>\u201c </em>he could not say he had not heard it called in question ; that he had heard it called in question to a limited extent.\u201d The defendants asked the court to exclude this evidence from the jury, but the judge declined so to do, and submitted it for their consideration with instructions, which are sufficiently stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-8\"><em>G.

We see no cause for any objection on the ground that the bond was not duly executed by the defendants. It is true that the bond was first signed by the surety, but before its delivery to the plaintiff it was executed by the principal. It was quite immaterial as to the order of the signatures, the same having been fully executed by all who purported to be parties to the obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">2. The facts shown as to the publication and delivery of the award are sufficient. By the stipulation in the bond, the award was to be made in writing and ready to be delivered to the parties on or before the 6th of March 1862. It appears that the award was duly made and sealed up and left with one of the arbitrators, and that the parties appeared before him in February 1862, and the award was then read to them at their request. No further publication was required to give effect to the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">3. The court properly rejected the offer of oral evidence by the defendants to show that the arbitrators in making up their award, <em>\u201c </em>considered in the amount awarded the agreement of Rundell not to appear and testify against La Fleur.\u201d As an attempt to impeach the award for misconduct of the arbitrators, it would perhaps be quite sufficient to say that the proposed offer of proof falls short of that definitiveness and precision required in such cases. But, upon broader grounds, it was properly rejected.. The defendants were allowed the fullest opportunity to establish the illegality of the bond. The facts set forth in their answer as to the circumstances under which they executed the bond, had they been established by proof to the satisfaction of the jury, would have required a verdict for the defendants; but they were not found by the jury to be true. The defendants seek also to impeach the award. This is a much narrower field for the introduction of evidence; and especially so, when nothing objectionable appears on the face of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">This submission was made in the broadest terms, and, after stating a particular claim, adds, <em>\u201c </em>and all demands concerning toe same, and all actions, causes of action, controversies or demands whatsoever depending by or between the said parties.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The arbitrators, by force of this submission, were constituted sole judges of both fact and law, as to all matters thus submitted to them. It is not a subject of inquiry whether they came to proper conclusions upon these matters. The books of reports are full of decisions adverse to revising the proceedings of a board of arbitrators clothed with unlimited powers as to their action, when there has been no corruption or partiality on the part of the arbitrators, or fraud practised by the prevailing party, holding that the court will not, in an action at law upon an award, inquire whether the arbitrators have judged right or wrong. The language of the court is, in such cases, \u201c You have constituted your own tribunal; you are bound by its decision.\u201d It is only in the case of errors apparent upon the face of the award, or where it is shown that the arbitrators have failed through mistake to give effect to their own intentions, that the courts have, in the absence of fraud or corruption, been disposed to open the inquiry into the grounds of the decision of the arbitrators, or allow it to be impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The cases of <em>Boston Water Power Co. </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>6 Met. 131; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>7 Cow. 185; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>10 Wend. 589; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Green, </em>7 Conn. 536; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Price, </em>2 Zabr. 578; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>26 Maine, 251; <em>Hodgkinson </em>v. <em>Fernie, </em>3 C. B. (N. S.) 202, will be found to sustain these views.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">It seems therefore that the court, under the circumstances, properly refused to allow the introduction of the evidence which was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">4. The testimony of Ralph Day was properly admitted. The question before the jury was, whether this bond was given upon an agreement on the part of the plaintiff that if La Fleur would give him such a bond, he would leave the Commonwealth and not appear to testify as a witness against him in the criminal prosecution. The testimony was conflicting upon this point. No evidence had been offered as to what took place at the time when the bond was signed by La Fleur. The plaintiff was allowed to ask the witness, Day, who was present at the execution of the bond, if any such thing was said at the time the bond was signed. This was a point of time properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the subject of inquiry. It did not negative the fact of other statements made at other times, if such were shown, but it did meet one point of time, and tended to show that no such agreement was made then. It may have been testimony very limited in its application, and not of a controlling character, but it was not incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">5. The court properly declined to rule that the evidence of Eli H. Patch should be excluded, and that the same was not competent evidence for the jury. The question propounded to this witness was entirely proper and accurate in its form. The witness having stated that he had known the person to whom the inquiry related for a long period of time, was asked to state what his general reputation was for truth and veracity ? The reply was, \u201c he could not. say he had not heard it called in question ; that he had heard it called in question to a limited extent.\u201d This evidence was properly given in the presence of the jury. The weight of it was for the jury and not for the court to consider. ' It was held by the court in <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>4 Cush. 108, that the inquiry as to the amount and means of knowledge on the part of a witness called to testify to the general reputation of another witness was for the jury, in order to enable them to satisfy themselves as to the weight and importance of the testimony. It was further said that there is no question of competency for the court to settle in regard to the knowledge of witnesses called to testify to the point of reputation for truth and veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">But further, the court did fully instruct the jury upon the nature of testimony of this character, and that the importance of it would depend much upon its being shown to be the common speech of his neighbors and those who knew his character for truth, and thus guarded the jury from giving it greater weight than was proper. This exception cannot avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
