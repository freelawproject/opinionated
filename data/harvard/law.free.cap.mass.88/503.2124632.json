Converse in the sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>of $3010, and on that day received payment of his debt from said Converse in full; that on the 12th of June following the defendant Cadwell, assuming to act in behalf of the John Hancock Bank of Springfield, presented to the judge of insolvency for the county of Hampden a petition in insolvency against Converse, praying for the issuing of a warrant against his estate on the ground that the above payment to the plaintiff was an unlawful preference; that upon said petition the judge of insolvency, after a hearing, issued his warrant, and the defendants were subsequently chosen assignees, and have since commenced an action against the plaintiff, in which, they allege that said payment was an unlawful preference of the plaintiff over other creditors, and in fraud of the laws of this commonwealth, \u201c all which said allegations of preference and fraud have no foundation in fact and in truth.\u201d The bill further set forth various alleged irregularities in the proceedings in insolvency, and prayed that the same might be set aside, and that the assignees might be restrained from the further prosecution of their suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">The defendants filed a general demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-6\"><em>N.

Pl. \u00a7 233. <em>Stevenson </em>v. Austin, 3 Met. 474. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>19 Pick. 162. The plaintiff is not a party aggrieved, within the meaning of Gen. Sts. c. 118, \u00a7 16. If he is, he is not entitled to equitable relief. His defence at law is complete. <em>Massachusetts Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>7 Cush. 183. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Met. 469. If his defence at law is not complete, it is because he obtained an unlawful preference. But if he obtained an unlawful preference, a court of equity will not aid him in retaining it. <em>Dehon </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>4 Allen, 545. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Goulding, </em>9 Gray, 50. <em>Ex parte Jarman, </em>4 Deac. &amp; Chit. 393. <em>Ex parte Hudson, </em>2 Russ. 456. <em>Cousins </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>13 Ves. 542. 1 Story on Eq. \u00a7 298.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-7\"><em>E. D. Beach, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avv\">Converse was not a party to the suit at law, and need not be a party to this bill to restrain the further prosecution of that suit. The plaintiff has sufficient interest to entitle him to maintain this bill. <em>Merriam </em>v. <em>Sewall, </em>8 Gray, 320. The demurrer admits the irregularity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>proceedings in insolvency. The remedy at law is not complete. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Woodworth, </em>6 Gray, 326. The court has jurisdiction in equity. Gen. Sts. c. 113, \u00a7 2; <em>c. </em>118, \u00a7 16. <em>Merriam </em>v. <em>Sewall, </em>8 Gray, 320. <em>Cheshire Iron Works </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>3 Gray, 531. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>Ib. 242, and cases cited.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b515-4\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARP\">This demurrer must be sustained and the bill dismissed. The plaintiff needs no injunction, and is entitled to none. The statements in the bill, which are admitted by the demurrer, show a perfect legal defence to the action of which he prays the court to restrain the prosecution. And nothing is alleged in the bill from which it appears that he cannot as well prove his defence, on the trial of that action, as he could on a hearing of this bill, if the defendants had filed an answer denying its allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">A court of equity does not issue an injunction to stay proceedings at law where the rights of a party can be fully sustained in a court of law. 3 Dan.
