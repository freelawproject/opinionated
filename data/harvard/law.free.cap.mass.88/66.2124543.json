The agreement contained the following clause: <em>\u201c </em>And in case of any disagreement with regard to settlement, it shall be left out to disinterested persons to be equally selected by the parties, and their decision shall be final.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-10\">At the trial in the superior court, before Russell, J., it appeared that, after a disagreement had arisen between the parties as to the settlement, each party selected an arbitrator, who after a hearing made no award, and the one selected by the plaintiff refused to act further in the matter. After several weeks, during which neither party did anything more in regard to a settlement 'by arbitration, the present action was brought; and, a trial by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>jury having been waived, the judge found for the plaintiff. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-5\"><em>W. P. </em>Webster, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARD\">cited <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>New England Ins. Co. </em>6 Gray, 192, 197, 204, and cases there cited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-6\"><em>S. H.
