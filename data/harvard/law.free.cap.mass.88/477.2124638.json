The plaintiffs also introduced evidence tending to show that the above deeds were delivered at or about the times of their respective dates; that Joseph built a house upon the land, and occupied and improved the same in person, under said deeds, and was in the open possession thereof from the date of the first deed until 1800, and that the premises were of the requisite annual income. The defendants contended that in the absence of any evidence, except possession, of notice to the town authorities that Joseph Whitford was the owner, and had a deed of the premises, he could not be considered as then seised of a freehold state under <em>St. </em>1789, c. 14, or <em>St. </em>1793, <em>c. </em>34, because the deeds were not recorded until the times above mentioned; but the judge instructed the jury that, if they should be satisfied that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>occupied and improved the premises two years under <em>St </em>1789, or three years under <em>St </em>1793, he'would be seised of a freehold estate within the true intent and meaning of said statutes, if he entered under such deeds so duly executed and delivered, and held and occupied under them for a requisite time under either of said statutes, although they were not recorded until the times above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">In order to show that Whitford was poor, and was not the owner or in possession of property, as claimed by the plaintiffs, the defendants offered the jail records of the county of Worcester, showing that he was committed to jail for debt, and took the poor debtors\u2019 oath on the 27th of April 1794; but the evidence was excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-7\">P. <em>E. </em>Aldrich, for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKo\">cited <em>Sts. </em>1783, c. 37, \u00a7 4; 1784, <em>c. </em>41, \u00a7 4; <em>M'Mechan </em>v. <em>Griffing, </em>3 Pick. 149; <em>Pomroy </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>11 Met. 244.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-8\"><em>S.

This provision was repealed on the 11th of February 1794, by <em>St </em>1793, <em>c. </em>34 \u2014 saving all settlements gained under it \u2014 and the following was substituted: \u201c Any person of twenty-one years of age, being a citizen of this or any of the United States, having an estate of inheritance or freehold, in the town or district where he dwells and has his home, of the clear yearly income of three pounds, and taking the rents and profits thereof three years successively, whether he lives thereupon or not, shall thereby gain a settlement therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The main question in this case is, whether Joseph Whitford gained a settlement in Dudley, by residing on an estate therein two whole years after the <em>St. </em>of 1789 was passed, occupying and improving the same, which was of the clear annual income of three pounds, the deed of which estate, dated March 2d 1787, was delivered to him at or about that date, but was not acknowledged and recorded until September 1793; or if he did not thus gain a settlement, whether he gained it by a like residence on the same estate and taking the profits thereof, of the same clear yearly income, three years successively, under a deed dated and delivered in February 1796, but not recorded until March 23d 1802, after he removed from Dudley.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">No question is made by the defendants as to the age or the citizenship of Whitford when he received his deeds and entered upon the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The jury were rightly instructed. It has been repeatedly decided that an estate passes to the grantee, on the execution of a deed thereof, though the deed is not registered. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>6 Mass. 24. <em>Dole </em>v. <em>Thurlow, </em>12 Met. 157. <em>Call </em>v. <em>Buttrick, </em>4 Cush. 345. The grantee, under a deed not registered, takes the granted estate subject only to the grantor\u2019s creditors or subsequent purchasers who have not notice of the deed. Whether there were any such creditors or purchasers of Whitford\u2019s grantors, or of either of them, does not appear, and is not material. His estate was not taken from him, and he gained a settlement by occupying and improving it during the requisite time, even if it might have been defeated by a legal claimant. <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Deerfield, </em>11 Mass. 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">If any evidence that Joseph Whitford took the poor debtors\u2019 oath six months after he had conveyed away his estate, and twenty-nine months before it was reconveyed to him, was competent for the purpose for which it was offered, to wit, \u201c to show that said Whitford was poor and was not the owner or in possession of property,\u201d as to which the plaintiffs had introduced evidence, it is clear that the jailer\u2019s calendar or register of prisoners committed for debt, containing his entry of the time and means of their liberation, was inadmissible. In April 1794, the <em>St. </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>1787, <em>c. </em>29, \u00a7 2, was in force, and required the magistrates, who administered to a poor debtor the oath therein prescribed, to make a certificate thereof to the jailer under their hands and seals. That certificate \u2014 or, if it were lost, proof of its contents \u2014 was the evidence which alone, if any, was campe tent.</p>\n<p id=\"A8s\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
