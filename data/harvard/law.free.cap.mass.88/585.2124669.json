The town of Spencer paid, on due demand, for her support there a sum which was admitted to be reasonable, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>town of Brookfield, where she and the defendant then had and still have their legal settlement, repaid said sum to the town of Spencer on due notice, and afterwards gave to the defendant notice thereof and of all the facts, and demanded payment thereof. The defendant was and is destitute of property. He was, however, able and willing to support his wife at home by his labor, but not otherwise. She, at the time of her commitment, had not left his house\u201dwith his express or implied consent, or in consequence of any fault on his part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-5\">On these facts, judgment was rendered in the superior court for the defendant, and the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-6\"><em>P.

Sts. <em>c. </em>73, \u00a7 23, was obliged to pay and did pay for her support in that institution; and as her settlement was then in Brookfield, that town, by \u00a7 25 of the same chapter, was obliged to reimburse the town of Spencer, and, having done so, now seeks indemnity from the defendant, in an action for money paid. This action is not maintainable on that part of the aforesaid \u00a7 25, which makes a lunatic\u2019s \u201c kindred, obligated by law to maintain him, liable for expenses paid by any city or town \u201d for his support in a lunatic hospital; for the word \u201c kindred \u201d includes only blood relations. A husband, says Lord Lough-borough, is not of kin to the wife, nor she to him. 3 Ves. 247. Besides; the \u201c kindred obligated by law \u201d are manifestly those only who, by Gen. Sts. c. 70, \u00a7 4, are made chargeable for the support of poor persons, namely, \u201c kindred in the line or degree of father or grandfather, mother or grandmother, children or grandchildren, by consanguinity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>But we are of opinion that the action is maintainable at common law. By that law, a husband is bound to provide support for his wife, and is liable to pay for it, if it is furnished by other persons, on his refusal or neglect to do so when he ought. So he is liable to pay a town for her support, when the town supports her as a pauper. <em>Hanover </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>14 Mass. 227. <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>5 Gray, 28. In the present case, the plaintiffs paid for the support of the defendant\u2019s wife as a pauper. <em>Charlestown v. Groveland, </em>15 Gray, . In that case, Shaw, C. J. said: <em>\u201c </em>We consider every person a pauper who receives relief at the public expense, and such as is provided by law for persons standing in need of immediate relief.\u201d It was accordingly there decided that a wife, who was committed to a lunatic hospital without her husband\u2019s concurrence, was there as a pauper. And since our statutes have authorized the commitment of a wife to such hospital, without her husband\u2019s consent or knowledge, for her good and the public good, we hold him liable to pay for her support there. The law is paramount to his will, (as it is in other cases in which he refuses or omits to provide for her,) and prescribes a mode in which he shall support her. The defendant\u2019s inability to pay for that support cannot be interposed as a defence to this action; as it certainly could not be in any other case when he should be called on to pay for support furnished to her by individual third persons. His deficiency of means does not exempt him from legal liability, though it may affect the value of a judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
