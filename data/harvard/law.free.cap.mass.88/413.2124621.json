The declaration alleged that the defendant, in consideration that the plaintiff would buy of him a certain pianoforte at and for a certain price or sum of money, to wit, \u2022 the sum of $300, undertook and promised to the plaintiff that it was as good as any other that was made for that price, and would give him good satisfaction, and that it was well made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>and would stand up to concert pitch; and the plaintiff, confiding in said promise and undertaking, bought the pianoforte of the defendant, and paid him the said sum of money; and the pianoforte proved worthless, and was not well made and would not stand up to concert pitch, \u201c and could not be put there; \u201d wherefore the plaintiff returned it to the defendant, and demanded the price paid therefor, &amp;c. The answer denied the various allega tians of the declaration, and among other things denied that the pianoforte was sold for any sum of money, and averred that the consideration paid for it was lumber and its proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-4\">At the trial in the superior court, before Brigham, J., the plain tiff introduced evidence tending to support the averments of the declaration. The defendant introduced evidence tending to show that the pianoforte was paid for by an accepted order on a thud person, payable in lumber; and asked the court to rule that this fact, if proved, would show a variance between the averment of the declaration and the proof; but the judge, under the pleadings, ruled otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">It also appeared that the defendant was not a manufacturer but a seller of pianofortes, and he contended that the affirmations alleged and relied upon were mere expressions of opinion. The judge instructed the jury that the representations that the pianoforte was as good as any made for the price, and would give good satisfaction, were expressions of opinion which, if false, would not constitute any ground for avoiding the sale and recovering back the consideration ; that a representation that a pianoforte is well made and will stand up to concert pitch is a representation of fact, which, if proved to be false, as between a seller making the representation and a buyer relying upon it, would authorize the buyer to recover back the consideration paid, upon a rescission of the contract, if the pianoforte was returned within a reasonable time, \u201c notwithstanding the price paid consisted of an order by the buyer on a third party, accepted by such third party, as payment by the seller, and payable in merchandise to the seller at the lowest cash market price, if this order was treated as cash by the parties at the time of sale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b425-5\"><em>M.

Story on Sales, (3d ed.) \u00a7 357, <em>n. </em>If the order was treated as money, the averment of consideration is well sustained. A plaintiff may always recover in assumpsit for money paid, if he can prove that the commodity which was received by the defendant was treated by both parties as money. 2 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 113. If, however, this view is not sustained, the plaintiff asks for leave to amend.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b425-7\">Chapman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvU\">The first exception relates to the ruling of the judge on the question of variance. The declaration sets forth a sale of a pianoforte with a warranty, and alleges that it was paid for in cash. The pianoforte was returned by the vendee, and the action is brought to recover back the consideration paid. The defendant, having offered evidence tending to show that the payment was not in cash, but by an order payable in lumber, requested the court to rule, in substance, that if payment was thus to be made, there was a variance between the declaration and the proof. But the court ruled otherwise. This ruling was erroneous. The allegation of a consideration in money would not be sustained by proof of a consideration in specific articles, in an action to recover back the consideration. The practice act does not change the rule that has always existed on this subject. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>White, </em>8 Gray, 594. The plaintiff must set forth with accuracy the substantive facts of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>There is some reason to believe that the defendant suffered no practical injury by this ruling, and that the objection is merely technical; for the jury were instructed that, \u201c notwithstanding the price paid consisted of an order by the buyer on a third party, accepted by such third party, as payment by the seller, and payable in merchandise to the seller at the lowest cash market price, if this order was treated as cash by the parties at the time of sale,\u201d the plaintiff might recover the price paid in money. The qualification as to. the merchandise being treated as cash by the parties makes the ruling substantially correct on the question of damages. But the court cannot be sufficiently certain that the defendant suffered no detriment by the ruling as to the variance to permit the verdict to stand, and allow an amendment of .the declaration for the sake of sustaining it. A new trial must be had; and the plaintiff may renew his motion for leave to amend in the court below, in order to enable him to meet this aspect of his case, if he thinks the evidence will require it. That court can fix the terms of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The second exception relates to the ruling of the judge, that \u201c a representation that a pianoforte is well made and will stand up to concert pitch is a representation of fact, which, if proved to be false, as' between a seller making the representation and a buyer relying upon it, would authorize the buyer to recover,\u201d &amp;c. The word \u201c representation \u201d was undoubtedly used here as synonymous with affirmation ; and there can be no doubt that such an affirmation is a warranty. It relates to the quality of the article, and is like an affirmation that a horse is sound and will work well in a harness. The defendant contends that it should have been left to the jury to find whether this language was used with the intention of affirming the fact, or of expressing an opinion. But the intent of the party is immaterial. The legal proposition stated by the judge was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
