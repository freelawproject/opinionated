Sts. <em>c. </em>124, \u00a7 10; and on the 25th of September 1861 obtained from a competent magistrate and served upon the plaintiffs a notice of his desire to take the oath for the relief of poor debtors, appointing \u201c the 27th of September, at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\u201d and a place therein named, as the time and place for his examination ; that Frost appeared at the time and place appointed, and the magistrate, upon examining the notice, decided that it was insufficient in form, in not designating the year when the examination was to take place, and informed Frost that a new notice and another service would be necessary, and Frost thereupon left the place; that after the departure of Frost, but before the expiration of the hour, the attorney of the plaintiffs appeared, and claimed that the examination should proceed, and efforts were accordingly made to find Frost, but without success ; and that on the 3d of October Frost applied for and obtained a new notice from the same magistrate, which was correct in form, and was duly served, and under which the oath was administered to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">On these facts, judgment was rendered in the superior court for the defendants ; and the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-6\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHm\">There has been no breach of this recognizance. If the first notice was sufficient in form, as we think it was, the debtor\u2019s departure from the place appointed for the examination did not constitute a breach, because he did not go without leave of the magistrate. He could not compel the magistrate to administer the oath, and if the magistrate adjudged the notice to be insufficient erroneously, and refused to act on that ground, it was no fault of the debtor. The form of the condition of the recognizance is not like that in the bond formerly given for the prison limits, under Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>97, ^ 63, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>that the debtor will not depart beyond the limits \u201c until lawfully discharged ; \u201d but only that he will not depart without leave of the magistrate, and will abide his final order. <em>Jacot </em>v. <em>Wyatt, </em>10 Gray, 236. But a more decisive answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 case is, that the debtor did, after due proceedings had, take the \u25a0 oath required by law for poor debtors, and was thereupon duly discharged by the magistrate. He thus completely fulfilled the condition of the recognizance. There was no error in these proceedings. The notice was regular in form and duly served, and it was not issued until after the expiration of seven days from the service of the first notice, according to Gen. Sts. c. 124, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
