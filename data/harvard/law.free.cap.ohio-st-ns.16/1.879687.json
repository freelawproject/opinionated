Reserved in the district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-6\">The original action was brought in the common pleas by the plaintiff, against the defendant Street and one Thomas Kennet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-7\">The petition alleges : That the defendant, Zadok Street, executed and delivered to R. R. Underhill, his two promissory notes payable to said Underhill\u2019s order, in \u201c <em>Shamokin Bank notes,\u201d </em>at the Bank of North America, in Philadelphia, each dated June 9, 1858, the one payable three months after date, for $3,045, and the other four months after date, for $2,856; that Underhill indorsed the notes to the plaintiff for a valuable consideration, before the same became due and payable; and that Street subsequently made an assignment of his property and effects to the said Thomas Kennet, in trust, for the benefit of his general creditors. The petition then prays for a money judgment against Street, and that \u201c said Thomas Kennet apply an equitable proportion of the trust funds in his hands, belonging to the said Street, to the payment of the same, and for other proper relief.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-8\">To this petition Street answered, setting forth two grounds of defense:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-9\">1. That the notes were \u201cwrongfully obtained from him without consideration.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-10\">2. That at the time of giving the notes to Underhill, Street \u2022executed to him a sealed bond, founded on the same supposed consideration, and as collateral security for the notes, with a warrant \u25a0of attorney to confess judgment for the amount thereof; upon which bond and warrant of attorney the said Underhill had since recovered judgment against him for the amount of the notes, which still remains in force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-11\">Kennet made no answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>To tbe answer of Street, the plaintiff interposed a general demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-5\">The court overruled the demurrei</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-6\">The plaintiff then filed its \u201cfirst amended petition,\u201d containing two counts against Street, upon the two notes, asking judgment against him for their amount; and a count ^against Rennet, asking a decree against him, that he apply an equitable portion of the trust funds in his hands to the payment of the judgment. The \u25a0counts against Street allege that the not\u00e9s were delivered by Street\u25a0 <em>to the </em>plaintiff, and were indorsed by Underhill <em>as </em>surety, upon considerations passing from the plaintiff to Street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-7\">To this \u201cfirst amended petition,\u201d the defendant demurred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-8\">1. Because several causes of action were, improperly joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-9\">2. Because neither the first nor second count contained facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-10\">The court sustained the demurrer, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-11\">The plaintiff then filed its \u201csecond amended petition,\u201d embracing only the two causes of action founded on the notes, alleging that Street executed them <em>to </em>Underhill, who then and there, \u201c for a valuable consideration, assigned and delivered the same to the^ plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-12\">To this second amended petition, Street put in a new, distinct, and full answer, in which he set forth two defenses:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-13\">1. That <em>Underhill did not assign and transfer </em>the notes to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff obtained them wrongfully, without his consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-14\">2. The execution of the bond and warrant of attorney; the recovery of judgment thereon for the amount of the notes; and that the defendant had satisfied and discharged the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-15\">To this answer, the plaintiff replied, traversing the first defense, but confessing and pleading mattera in avoidance of the second.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-16\">Upon these issues the cause went to'trial. But the jury failed \"to agree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-17\">The record shows that, before the final trial, the plaintiff filed exceptions to certain depositions taken by the defendant, <em>alleging </em>\u25a0 as a ground of exception, that they were not sealed up, directed, and certified according to law; but there is no bill of exceptions to show, nor does it otherwise appear, what were the facts in relation to them, except as they are to be inferred from the allegation in the \u25a0exceptions to the depositions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>*At the March term, 1862, the cause was submitted to the court. The finding and judgment were in favor of the defendant-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-5\">The plaintiff thereupon demanded a second trial, which was allowed by the court. Undertaking fixed at $200.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-6\">The action of the plaintiff under this demand and allowance is; shown by the following entry on the journal:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-7\"><em>\u201c </em>On the 20th day of March, 1862, A.

A promissory note payable in the notes of a particular bank\u2014as in Arkansas money of the Fayetteville Branch, Hawkins <em>v. </em>Watkins, 5 Pike, 481, or in office notes of the Lumberman\u2019s Bank at Warren, Irvine <em>v. </em>Lowry, 14 Peters, 293\u2014is not negotiable. This doctrine-is not in conflict with the Ohio cases. The notes not being negotiable, the defense of want of consideration, is good against the indorsee ; as is also the other defense\u2014the giving of the bond, and; judgment, in full force, taken thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-7\">2. The plaintiff in error having abandoned the original petition, no final judgment was entered on it, and hence no prejudice resulted to the plaintiff in error from any interlocutory order or entry in relation to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-8\">3. The demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s first amended petition was properly sustained. Code, secs. 35, 36, 80, 87.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-9\">4. As to the alleged error in overruling the exceptions to depositions. The record does not show the facts upon which the court, acted, nor that the plaintiff in error was prejudiced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-10\">5. The court did not err in striking the cause from the second-trial docket. No undertaking had been given; there was nothing: to amend.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b14-11\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6\">The first question raised, is upon the sufficiency of the answer to the original petition The court- of *common pleas held the answer a good defense, and overruled the plaintiff\u2019s, demurrer thereto. Was this holding erroneous, and did it result i-n injury to the plaintiff?</p>\n<p id=\"b14-12\">We answer both questions in the negative. The answer sets up-two grounds of defense: 1. The execution of the bond, and the judgment thereon; 2. That the notes were obtained wrongfulLy and \u201c without consideration.\u201d Each of these goes to the whole case made in the petition, and if either is a good defense, the court did. .not err in overruling the demurrer. Without deciding upon the-sufficiency of the first, we are satisfied that the second is a good defense. The notes were not payable in money or currency; nor were they payable in bank-notes generally, or in bank-notes cur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>rent at any particular place. They were made payable in the paper of a particular bank, absolutely, and without reference to the currency or value of the paper. They were not, therefore, notes for the payment of money, within the principles of any former adjudication of this court, or of any respectable authority elsewhere. It follows,, that the consideration may be inquired into, and the want of it may be set up as a defense, as well against the <em>bona fide </em>indorsee, as against the original payee, and that there was at least one good ground of defense contained in this answer. The court, therefore, did not err in overruling the demurrer to the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">But suppose it were otherwise\u2014suppose the court did err ini holding the answer sufficient. Has that error resulted to the plaintiff\u2019s injury, so as to justify him in asking the reversal of the final judgment on that account ? Clearly.not. The defense in question \u2014a want of consideration\u2014-was subsequently abandoned, and a new and -totally different defense\u2014a want of indorsement\u2014was interposed. The answer setting up the latter defense, by its silence on the subject, admits the existence of a good consideration. The final judgment, which the plaintiff seeks to-reverse, was predicated upon the <em>admitted fact </em>that there was a good consideration, and upon the further fact, found by the court upon the evidence, that the notes had never been indorsed. How, then, can the plaintiff be injured by the supposed error of the court ? What he failed to obtain from the the court, by its refusal to hold the ^defense of no consideration <em>invalid in </em>law, he obtained from the party, by the tacit admission of its <em>non-existence in fact. </em>In other words, if there was in fact a good consideration, the opinion of the court as to the effect of a supposed want of consideration, becomes a mere abstraction. If the notes were never indorsed to the plaintiff, he had no cause of action, and it is wholly out of the case finally made and decided, to inquire what would have been the effect of a want of consideration, had they been indorsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">The second error alleged is, in sustaining the demurrer to the first amended petition. It seems clear to us that there was a misjoinder of parties, and that upon that ground alone, the court were right in sustaining the demurrer. It matters not that the petition made a good case against some of the parties, or against each of them separately; if they were improperly joined, the court could only sustain the demurrer, leaving it to the plaintiff to say whether he would amend, and-proceed against some of the parties only-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>This is precisely what the court did; and the plaintiff accordingly amended, and proceeded against Street alone, upon the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-5\">But there is a second answer to this petition in error, as \u2022 there was to the former, in the fact that the case made in the first amended petition was afterward abandoned, and a new and repugnant case made in the second amended petition. The case made in the first .amended petition was on notes made <em>to the </em>plaintiff, upon a consideration passing <em>from the plaintiff. </em>The case in the second amended petition was, upon notes made to Underhill, upon (implied) considerations passing <em>from Mm, </em>and an indorsement and sale of the notes by him to the plaintiff. It is only necessary to state the cases, in \u25a0order to see that they are not repugnant, and that a party setting up one necessarily abandons the other, and admits that it is untrue. And it is unnecessary to say that a party can not reverse a judgment for an erroneous holding in a supposed ease, which he finally admits has no existence in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-6\">It is said, in the third place, that the court erred in overruling the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to certain depositions. But the record does not show any of the <em>facts. </em>There is no bill of exceptions, and the -record only shows that the plaintiff ^excepted to the \u25a0depositions, <em>alleging </em>as a reason that they were not properly sealed up and directed by the officer. Whether they were in fact so sealed and directed, the court below had the means of knowing\u2014we have not. It is unnecessary, therefore, to decide whether the objections were valid in law, as it is not shown that\u2019they were founded in fact. The bare assigning them as a ground of excejDtion, is no proof of the facts. If it were, the court surely erred; for it appears, in another part of the record, that a similar exception was overruled, where the ground alleged was, that the deposition was not taken at the time and place specified in the notice; and yet no exception was taken to this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-7\">The only remaining question is, whether the court erred in refusing the motion to amend the alleged undertaking, and in striking the cause from the second-trial docket. In other words, was there any \u201c undertaking \u201d susceptible of amendment as such, or were the steps taken for the purpose of giving such undertaking sufficient to give jurisdiction to the court, and justify an order for amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-8\">There certainly was no \u201cundertaking\u201d in any admissible sense of the term. The entry on the journal was made by Jordan as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>\u25a0cleric, </em>and not as an obligor, or surety. It is a mere <em>memorandum, </em>\u25a0of the fact that <em>money had been </em>deposited\u2014\u201cin lieu of an undertaking.\u201d It has none of the elements of an undertaking, such as \u25a0the statute requires. It is <em>ex parte. </em>It is a private memorandum, \u2022made to aid the memory of the clerk, as to the <em>fact of the deposit. </em>It was not the entry on the journal that the clerk \u201c approved.\u201d He .approved the \u201c security \u201d\u2014the $200 deposited. The plaintiff had no <em>intention, </em>and he took no <em>steps, </em>to file an undertaking. What he \u25a0intended was, to <em>deposit </em>money\u2014\u201c in lieu of\u201d the undertaking\u2014and, possibly, to preserve evidence of the fact. He fully accomplished .all he intended or attempted. No doubt he omitted to file the undertaking, in ignorance of the law, and acted in good faith, believing that a deposit of the money would be all that was required. But is that sufficient ? Is the simple fact that money was deposited, with the general intention of <em>complying with the law, </em>enough to give jurisdiction ? It is neither an undertaking, nor a \u201c proceeding\u201d for *the \u201cpurpose\u201d of filing an undertaking. It can not be .amended into an undertaking. The remedy, if any is necessary, is with the legislature. When the legislature enact that the <em>general intention </em>to comply with the law for second trials, and <em>any act </em>done in pursuance of that intention, shall be sufficient to give the \u25a0court jurisdiction, this case will come within the law. At present there is no such law. By the act of May 1, 1862, passed after this -cause was decided, the deposit of money in such cases is allowed in lieu of an undertaking. But there was no such law in force at the time the thirty days allowed for filing an undertaking in the \u00abase expired. I know the general power of amendment given to the courts by the code is very broad, and is only limited by the <em>\u25a0\u201c </em>justice \u201d of the case. . But the statutory <em>thing </em>to be amended must exist, before the power can be exercised. Under the present statute \u25a0an imperfect <em>deposit </em>of <em>money, </em>or steps taken to make it, could be amended or aided. Before its passage it was only an <em>undertaking, </em>\u2022or steps taken to give one, that could be so amended or aided.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">It is hardly necessary to say, that we can not see any force in the \u2022suggestion that the <em>certificate </em>of <em>deposit, </em>filed as money in the case, and treated as money by the clerk, may be considered as an <em>undertaking. </em>It was not filed as such, and has not the form of such. It \u25a0was merely evidence that the-plaintiff had money deposited in bank, payable to his order. In the clerk\u2019s entry he calls it money, and having received and treated it as such, could properly call it noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ing else. It requires little more imagination to make an undertaking out of the petition filed in the case, than it does to make one out of this certificate of deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">Upon the whole, then, we can see no error in the record, and are of opinion that the judgment of the common pleas should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b18-7\">Brinkerhoee, C.
