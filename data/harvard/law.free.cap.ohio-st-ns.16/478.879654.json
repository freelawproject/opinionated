It is a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>in error to reverse a decree of the same court rendered in special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-5\">The original case-was a petition fbr the sale of mortgaged premises, known as the Dennison House property. The mortgagor, William Dennison, held the property subject to the payment of what is called \u201c ground-rent,\u201d a large amount of which was in arrear at the time of rendering the decree. The ^parties-entitled to the rent, as well as various other incumbrancers, were made defendants in the cause; and the court ordered the premises to be sold free and discharged from the rents in arrear, reserving, till tbe final hearing, the question whether the parties to whom the rents were payable, had a <em>lien </em>therefor upon the premises, superior to the lien of the mortgagees. Upon the final hearing, the court decided this question in the affirmative, and ordered the proceeds to be distributed\u2014first, in payment of the rents; and next, in payment of the other incumbrances. Whether the court erred in this decision, is the only question presented by the petition in error. The plaintiffs in error are mortgagees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-6\">The following is a copy of one the deeds by which the so-called rent was reserved, and under which Dennison, the mortgagor, derived or held title at the date of the mortgage:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-7\">\u201cThis indenture, made this twenty-third day of 'June, anno domini one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, between Thomas Dugan, late of the city of Cincinnati, by Patrick O\u2019Reilly, his attorney in fact, of the first part, and Ephraim Carter, of the same place, of the second part, witnesseth: That the said Thomas Dugan, for and in consideration of sums of money hereinafter mentioned, and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter specified, hath granted, bargained, and sold to the said Ephraim Carter, his heirs or assigns, the following described property, to wit: Part of lot number ninety-two, in the city of Cincinnati, on Fifth street, at the corner of a lot leased or sold to Codrington Cheesebrough, Ephraim Carter, and Pentheus J.

By the force and effect, and true construction of the clause of redemption ; and by the nature of the clause of re-entry, as construed in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-8\">The clause of redemption provides that if the grantee, his heirs, etc, shall at any time pay to the grantor, his heirs, etc., <em>\u201cin addition to the charges hereby </em>reserved,\u201d the sum of, etc., then the said grantee, his heirs, etc., shall hold the said piece of ground <em>\u201cfree and discharged </em>from all the conditions aforesaid.\u201d But if these quarterly payments are not a charge, a lien on the land, why require them to be paid before the land shall be free and discharged?</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-9\">In the clause of re-entry, the quarterly payment is denominated \u201c the .said charge.\u201d In the clause of redemption, these payments are still called \u201c charges.\u201d In the second covenant of Carter, the grantee, they are called <em>\u201c </em>rents <em>and charges.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-10\">Thus, we have Carter, the party through whom the plaintiffs in error claim, acknowledging all through this deed that these payments are <em>charged </em>on this land.

These indentures originated in Philadelphia, from which city Mr. Dugan came. They were a species of conveyance well known and understood there, and in reference to which the rights of the parties in this regard were well understood and defined. The courts of that state have on many different, occasions held that these conveyances did create a preferred lien in favor of the holder of the grantor. See among other cases, Bantleon <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 Binn. 146; Pancoast\u2019s Appeal, 8 Watts <em>&amp; </em>Serg. 381; Dougherty\u2019s Estate, 9 Watts &amp; Serg. 189; Wood\u2019s Appeal, 30 Penn.

The same view of the law is taken in New York and Louisiana. Robinson <em>v. </em>Ryan, 25 N. Y. 327; Succession of Canoge, 1 La. An. 211.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-8\">3. The clause of re-entry carries notice to all the world, and as between the grantor and grantee, and those claiming under them, binds the estate for the performance of the covenant to pay rent. Clearly, it is intended as a security for these rents to the grantor. It is his means of enforcing the payment of rent <em>out of the property. </em>Whenever it is cut off by a sale, as to the back rents, the grantor must have his equivalent, or his remedy in the proceeds of such sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-9\">4. This right of re-entry runs with the land. It binds the land. It is transferred to the grantee when the land is conveyed to him, not as a separate chose in action, but as a covenant attached to the estate, and forming part of it, and of which all must take notice. It inheres in the land, and is so *for the very purpose of securing the rent. It binds the estate to which it is attached, in whose-soever hands it may be. Masury <em>v. </em>Southworth, 9 Ohio St. 347; Van Rensselaer <em>v. </em>Hoyt, 19 N. Y. 95-97; Harbaugh <em>v. </em>Zetmeyer, 2 Rawle, 160; Kerr <em>v. </em>Day, 14 Penn.

Jur., sec. 687; Ingersoll <em>v. </em>Sargent, 1 Wheat. 350.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-11\">5. This rule seems to follow also from the common maxim in equity, \u201c that equity looks upon that done which ought to be done.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-12\">6. What is this payment of rent but the purchase money of the estate, falling due in perpetual quarterly installments, with the estate as a security. Now, that it is such, and that all parties dealing with the grantee are bound to know that it is so, and whether paid or not, seems very clear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>7. By the very terms of this lease, the rent is an equitable lien upon the estate. It reads, \u201c Eor and in consideration of the sums of money hereafter mentioned, and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter specified, hath granted, etc., . . . <em>subject nevertheless to the payment and reservation of the following sums of </em>money, to be paid upon the several days hereinafter specified.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-5\">These rents are also, spoken of as \u201c <em>charged </em>\u201d upon the estate. Then there is this clause: \u201c And it is understood and agreed <em>that the estate hereby created is subject </em>to the further condition, that if at any time the said <em>charges </em>of rent, etc., are not paid',\u201d then the right of forfeiture and re-entry arises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">Now, the terms of this conveyance are peculiar. They make the payment of these rents <em>a condition of the grant. </em>They make the \u201c <em>estate granted </em>\u201d \u201c <em>subject </em>to \u201d them, and provide as a remedy reentry. They speak of the rents as rents \u201c <em>charged </em>\u201d upon the estate. We claim that the terms of the grant in these indentures secure all that we require. See Easter <em>v. </em>L. M. R. R. Co., 14 Ohio St. 53, and cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-7\">Then look again at the clause for the final extinguishment of the ground-rents at the close of the deed. It is not Carter and his heirs that are to be held \u201c free and discharged \u201d from the conditions, among which the chief was the payment of *rent, <em>but the ground and its appurtenances. </em>This clause also shows that these rents were attached to and a lien upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADWU\">See also, Neas\u2019 Appeal, 31 Penn St. 294; Bear v. Whistler, 7 Watts, 148; Dewalt\u2019s Appeal, 20 Penn St. 239; Mohler\u2019s Appeal, 5 Penn. St. 420; Matthew <em>v. </em>Bowler, 6 Hare, 110.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-9\">8. The estate granted by these indentures has sometimes been denominated a base-fee, or rather a fee which is subject to another fee, to wit, the perpetual payment of rent in quarterly installments. The estate granted can not be separated from it, or released from it, because it is granted upon that express condition, and \u201c <em>subject </em>\u201d thereto. The - fee is not absolute and unconditional. Taylor on Landlord and Tenant, 372 ; Wolveridge <em>v. </em>Stewart, 30 E. C. L. 315; Same <em>v. </em>Same, 1 Crompt. &amp; Mees. 654; Walker <em>v. </em>Physic, 5 Barr, 204, 204; 2 Bla. Com. 109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-10\">And these rents reserved are somewhat like those denominated fee-farm rents. De Royster <em>v. </em>Michael, 2 Seld. 497; Scott <em>v. </em>Lunt, 7 Pet. 606.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>A fee-farm rent is said to be a rent charge <em>issuing out of an estate in fee. </em>2 Bla. Com. 43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-5\">We do not claim that they are a technical rent charge, for-that was a species of rent to which a distraint of personal property on the land was attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-6\">It is also spoken of as a rent service. Ingersoll <em>v. </em>Sergeant, 1 Wheat. 337. They are, in every essential feature, like an annuity charged upon the land. Cupit <em>v. </em>Jackson, 13 Price, 733 ; Manby <em>v. </em>Hanks, 2 Drury &amp; Walsh, 323; French <em>v. </em>Morgan, 2 Molloy, 293.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-7\">But the common designation which they have received both here and in Philadelphia, from which place they came, is <em>ground-rents, </em>a peculiar expression in use to describe these perpetual rents fastened upon the ground.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b450-8\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMpo\">The whole case is a question of the construction and effect of this instrument. Does it reserve or create a <em>lien </em>upon the premises for the sums of money therein denominated \u201c rents and charges?\u201d We have no hesitation in holding that it does. Such, we think, is its plain legal import, ^whether regarded as a deed of conveyance, or, as counsel for plaintiffs claim it to be, a mere \u201c lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Both on reason and authority, a lien for the rent always exists where the lease provides for a right of re-entry\u2014that is, the right, upon non-payment of rent, to avoid the lease, and repossess the premises demised. The greater right, to take the whole estate, ought to be held to include the less right, to take enough of it to pay the rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Properly speaking, however, this is no \u201c lease.\u201d A <em>term </em>of years, and a <em>reversion, </em>seem indispensable to the idea of a lease. If this is a lease, it is also much more. It is a deed of conveyance in fee, subject to-a condition of defeasance. Its legal effect is to pass to the grantee an estate in fee simple, subject to be defeated by the nonpayment of annuities, denominated in the instrument \u201c <em>rents and </em>charges.\u201d The truth is\u2014and it is impossible to shut our eyes to the fact\u2014that the real transaction was a sale of the premises for $2,400, with a right to defer the payment of the principal sum, so long as the <em>interest </em>thereon should be paid quarter-yearly; and a conveyance of the premises upon condition to be void in case of non-payment. In other words, the transaction was equivalent to a sale and conveyance, with a mortgage to secure the payment of the purchase-money, thereby creating a twofold lien in favor of the vendor\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the equitable lien for the purchase money, and the lien by virtue of the reservation in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">But it is quite immaterial in which aspect we consider the deed. Yiewed in either of these characters\u2014as a lease, with power to reenter for non-payment of rent; as a deed of conveyance, subject to the payment of money charges; or as a sale and conveyence, avoidable by the vendor upon non-payment of the purchase money\u2014so far as the question of lien is concerned, the instrument has all the elements of a mortgage. It only differs from a mortgage in the fact, that the estate pledged for the debt is <em>reserved, </em>instead-of being conveyed, and in the consequent further fact, that it is wow-payment, instead of payment, which is to defeat the conveyance. In both, there is a condition in the nature of a <em>forfeiture, </em>which at law casts the whole estate upon the creditor,'whenever *it is broken. In both, there exists the equitable right to be x\u2019elieved against the fox\u2019feiture, by payment of the amount due, called the equity of redemption ; and iix both, there is the correlative right of the creditor to <em>waive </em>the forfeiture, go himself at once into equity, and subject the estate to the payment of his debt. Iix other words, the creditor has a lien on the thing pledged, just a pawnbroker or a carrier has a <em>lien. </em>This is the weakest form of the creditor\u2019s right. It is his right in equity. At law, his x-ight is to hold the thiixg absolutely, in lieu of the debt. In equity, he can not do this, but he can hold it <em>till payment is made. </em>That is to say, he can hold it <em>liable </em>for the debt, which is nothing more or less than holdixxg a <em>lien </em>upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">And it is no answer to this equitable claim for a <em>lien, </em>to say that the forfeiture was not insisted upon at the time of default; that is, that no demand of payment was made, or re-entry effected. That is a good answer to the <em>forfeiture, </em>but it is no answer to the equitable <em>lien. </em>The law abhors forfeitures, and will never, therefore, deprive a party of his rights in equity because he waives a forfeiture. If good conscience require its waiver at all, the sooner it is waived the better. The failure to make demand and entry in this case, ixo more destroys the grantor\u2019s right to subject the land to the payment of his just debt, than does the failure of a mortgagee to bring ejectment, when the mortgage has become absolute, destroy his right to foreclose the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">We see no error in the judgment of the court below, and it will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b451-8\">Scott, C.
