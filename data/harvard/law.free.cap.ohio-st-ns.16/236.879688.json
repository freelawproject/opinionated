To the introduction and admission of which parol evidence (to prove the alleged additional terms of the agreement so by the parties intentionally excluded from the written evidence of the contract as alleged), the defendant, the State Bank of Ohio, by its counsel objected; but the court, reserving to said defendant the benefit of the objection, allowed and admitted the testimony to be given, subject to be overruled or excluded, if upon full consideration it shall be found to be inadmissible in law, for the purpose of adding such additional terms of the contract to the written evidence thereof by parol as aforesaid, or,for any other competent purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">Whereupon, the evidence being given, the court found, subject to the objection reserved as aforesaid, that in fact it was verbally agreed between the committee and the commissioners as above mentioned, that the stock should not be disposed of or used by the company for any other purpose than in the construction of that part of the line of its road between Millersburg and Zanesville, nor be used at all unless such promised subscriptions along the line cf the road to the amount of 1400,000, should be first secured by the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">And the court further found, subject to the like condition, from parol testimony in like manner offered by the plaintiff, objected to by the defendant, and admitted under the like reservation by the court, that the commissioners, on the 15th of May, 1854, delivered the certificates to the committee so appointed by the company as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>above found, to negotiate for the same, to wit, to Simon Perkins,.

But no legitimate presumption of notice to the bank can be inferred from these relations of Mc-Millen. *Washington Bank <em>v. </em>Lewis, 22 Pick. 24; Bank of Pittsburg <em>v. </em>Whitehead, 10 Watts, 397; Custer <em>v. </em>Tompkins County Bank, 9 Barr, 27; Seneca County Bank <em>v. </em>Neass, 5 Denio, 337; Bank of U.

If the Bank of Akron had had actual notice, unless there had also been collusion on the part of the bank with McMillen to defraud the city (and this nobody pretends), it would establish nothing, except that the bank was advised that the railroad company was, <em>by the intention of the parties to the contract, </em>vested with the title and right as owner to sell or pledge the stock, the prohibition against this being <em>intentionally </em>excluded from the written evidence of the contract, and the commissioners being content to rest upon the good faith of the committo, pledged to them <em>verbally, </em>in that behalf.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">8. The bank had no basis on which to challenge the truth of the recitals in the resolutions of the board of directors of the railroad company, of October 16,1864, in pursuance of which the assignment was made to McMillen, also in the assignment itself. As between the bank and the railroad company, the company is estopped to deny their truth; and it is clear that the plaintiff can not allege their falsehood to the prejudice of the bank, unless it be established by proof that the bank <em>knew </em>them to bo false <em>at the time it received the assignment </em>from McMillen; and that is not alleged or pretended in any form. The rights of the bank, therefore, stand to be disposed of as would be equitable if the recitals were true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-7\">In this state of case, the plaintiff, the city of Cleveland, has no right, in equity, to demand of the bank a surrender of the stock certificates, and a decree enjoining the bank from transferring or disposing of the stock to make it available as such security. The claim of the bank, if it be not based upon the legal title, is at least <em>bona fide, </em>and as meritorious in equity as that of the plaintiff; and no case is presented warranting the active aid of a court of equity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>behalf of the plaintiff to the prejudice of the bank.

This would be its legal effect <em>per se, </em>and the written contract expresses it in terms. To give it effect beyond this would be doing violence to both.

The transfer of the stock certificates by the railroad company to McMillen, and by him to the bank, is to be taken as one continuous act of the railroad company; and is, at the same time, the act of McMillen, in his own individual right, in so far as regards the transfer and pledge of indebtedness of the railroad company to him. Here, then, in equity, and in legal effect, is a twofold hypothecation or pledge of the stock in question by the railroad company, the object and purpose of which was to secure the bank against loss by reason of the fraudulent perversion of its funds to the use of the railroad company. The hypothecation of the stock to the bank by the railroad company for its liability thus assumed, was an act done <em>at the very time of the inception of the liability of </em>the railroad company, and in no just sense was it a security for a <em>preexisting </em>debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-8\">11. Touching the question of legal title to the stock in the bank *as a security, claiming under the railroad company, we sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>gest, whether there can be a question (the time limited in the contract for the transfer on the books having transpired), but that the bank has the right to demand and require a transfer to it on the books of the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad Co.; and if such transfer were refused, to sustain an action against said company for the value of the stock and dividends.

As was natural and proper, the case has been argued, by able counsel, at great length, both orally and in print; and many questions, which it is not necessary for us to pass upon in order to decide the case, have been raised and discussed on the hearing. These we have mostly passed over; and we have confined ourselves to two questions, the decision of either of which in favor of the plaintiff, the city of Cleveland, precludes all further question of its right to the relief which it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The first question is this : Had the commissioners of the city of Cleveland the <em>power </em>to make the contract which they assumed to make with the Cleveland, Zanesville and Cincinnati Railroad Company?</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">If they had such power, it is to be found in the act of the general assembly which made them commissioners and defines their powei\u2019s. It can be derived from no other source. And in respect to that act I may remark, that it needs only a careful reading of it to show that its draughtsman, whoever he may have been, evidently had a distinct idea of the objects aimed at by the legislation he proposed; and that he understood the significance of language, and knew how to employ it so as to give a clear and definite expression to his ideas. *Now, what was the contract which the commissioners of Cleveland assumed to- make ? It was not a sale for cash in hand, nor for money on terms of credit. It was nothing but an exchange, a <em>swap, </em>of the stock of the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad, owned by the city of Cleveland, for a larger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>nominal amount of the stock of the Cleveland, Zanesville and Cincinnati Railroad\u2014the latter guaranteeing that its stock, given in exchange, should, at a given period of time, be worth a certain sum of money in the market. Now, in looking into the act referred to, for power in the commissioners of the city of Cleveland to make this contract for an exchange and barter of stocks, all that we can find from which, with a show of plausibility, such power can be inferred, is the power (sec. 3) \u201c to <em>sell </em>said shares, or any part thereof, at such time or times as to them may seem expedient, for not less than their par value,\u201d \u201c and to do whatsoever else may seem necessary to secure and advance the interests of the city <em>in the </em>premisesBut the power to sell is one thing, and the power to barter and exchange is another and a very different thing. \u201c A sale of a chattel is an exchange thereof <em>for </em>money, but a sale is discriminated in many respects from an exchange in law\u2014an exchange being the giving of one thing, and the receiving of another thing, while a sale is the giving of one thing for that which is the representative of all things.\u201d 1 Parsons on Contracts, 521. And the same distinction is asserted in Story on Sales, sec. 1. And a power to sell does not authorize a barter or exchange. Taylor <em>v. </em>Galloway, 1 Ohio, 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">And the following clause of the act, giving to the commissioners of Cleveland power \u201c to do whatsoever else \u201d they \u201cmay deem necessary to secure and advance the interests of the city <em>in the prem</em>ises,\u201d can not be held to enlarge the circle of the specific powers before conferred. The phrase, \u201cin the premises,\u201d is one of limitation, and is substantially equivalent to, in the things premised, or, in the matters aforesaid. It limits the discretion conferred to the <em>manner </em>of exercising the powers specifically granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">These conclusions are confirmed by the fact that the statute referred to, does expressly authorize the commissioners <em>\u201cto exchange </em>\u201d *the shares of stock held by the city, for the outstanding evidences of indebtedness issued by the city in order to raise the means with which to pay up its stock subscriptions in the first place; for it shows that the draughtsman of the act knew and recognized the distinction between a sale and an exchange, and that where he meant an exchange ho said exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The commissioners of the city, then, had no power to make the contract of exchange which they assumed to make; and the powers of the commissioners being derived solely from a public legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>act, those who dealt with them, or who claim under them directly or remotely, were bound to take notice of the extent of those powers; and the city is not estop\u00a3&gt;ed to deny the existence of the power assumed. The contract of exchange is void for want of power in the commissioners to make it.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">This is conclusive of the case; and we might, with no impropriety, stop here. But the second question considered by the court leads to the same result. The district court find, as a matter of fact, in substance, that the so-called contract for an exchange of stocks, was obtained from the commissioners of the city of Cleveland by false and fraudulent representations made to them, in the course of the negotiation, by one McMillen, acting in behalf of the Cleveland, Zanesville and Cincinnati Railroad Company. McMillen took to himself an assignment of the stocks thus fraudulently acquired.' As against him, the contract was null by reason of hia fraud in obtaining it. He subsequently assigned the stocks to the Bank of Akron, simply as collateral security for a pre-existing indebtedness of McMillen to that bank, and not contracted in any way on the faith of such security. On the principles decided by this court in Roxborough <em>v. </em>Messick, 6 Ohio St. 448, this assignment conferred on the Bank of Akron no better title than McMillen had; and the State Bank of Ohio, succeeding as it does, under the statute, simply to the rights of the now defunct Bank of Akron, stands in its shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\n<em>Decree for plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-7\">Scott, C.
