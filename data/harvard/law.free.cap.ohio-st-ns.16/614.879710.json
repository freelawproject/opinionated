The state has power to tax shares in the national banks located in Ohio, subject to the limitations that such tax shall not exceed the rate imposed upon other moneyed capital of individuals, nor that imposed upon shares in the state banks, as provided in the act of Congress of June 3, 1864.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b567-8\">2.

On the 2d day of May, 1865, their ^several <em>shares </em>in the bank were listed on the grand duplicate of Hamilton county, as-a part of their personal property, and assessed for taxation agreeably to the provisions of the state law, of April 2, 1865. 62 Ohio-X. 106. The assessment is upon the par value of the shares, and no deduction is made therefrom on account of the capital or funds of the bank invested in United States bonds, .which are not subject to state taxation, or in real estate, which is taxed against the bank itself. The case below was a petition filed by the plaintiffs against the defendants, to enjoin the collection of the tax thus assessed upon their shares, and to enjoin the assessment and collection of like-taxes in the future under said act of 1865. The court below were of the opinion that the tax was legally assessed, and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s petition, on demurrer thereto; and the case now comes here, on petition in ci-ror, for decision of the single question whether the court erred in that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The act of Congress authox-izing national banks provide that <em>\u201c shares \" </em>in such banks may be assessed for state taxes, and taxed as the personal property of the owners thereof, subject to two limitations. The first limitation is, that the assessment shall not be at-a greater rate than that imposed upon <em>\u201c </em>other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of the state.\u201d The second is ;\u2022 \u201c That the tax so imposed under the laws of any state, upon the shares of any of the associations authorized by this act, shall not-exceed the rate imposed upon the <em>shares </em>in any of the banks organized under authority of the state where such association is located.\u201d The act also provides that real estate owned by the banks, may be taxed as such, by state authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The plaintiffs allege that the tax sought to be enjoined is unauthorized by law, and is in violation of both these limitations; that\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>\"the moneyed capital of individuals residing in the state-is taxed at .a lower rate; that \u201c shares \u201d in the state banks are not taxed at all; .and that the banks themselves are taxed at a rate lower than is so .assessed upon the plaintiffs. They say that the state banks are taxed at a lower rate, because they are taxed upon their capital, with\u25a0out including the value of the <em>franchise, </em>or privilege of banking, '618] *and subject to a deduction for the value of <em>real estate, </em>and of \u25a0untaxable <em>bonds of the United States, </em>owned by the banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">At the time this tax was assessed, the banks of issue in this state consisted of the branch banks and the independent banks, organized under the act of February 24, 1845, and the free banks, organized under the act of April, 1851. The act of 1845 imposes on the \u25a0state and independent banks a tax of six per cent, on their profits, in lieu of all other taxes. The act of April, 1861, imposes no re.strictions on the power of the legislature to tax the banks organized \u25a0thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The state law of 1865, under which the assessment was made, requires all persons to list, with their other personal property, moneys, -credits, etc., \u201call shares in national banks located in this state.\u201d 62 Ohio L. 106. At the date of this act, and at the time of the assessment \u2022 of the present tax under it, the other laws in force in Ohio were, the general act of 1859 (2 S. &amp; C. 1438) ; the amendatory act of 1861 (58 Ohio L. 59) ; and the act of 1852 (59 Ohio L. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">By the act of 1859, all persons are required to list for taxation, .among other items of personal property, etc., \u201c all investments in 'stocks;\u2019 \u201d but section 59 of the act provides, among other exemptions, that no person shall be required to include' in the list of his personal property, etc., \u201c any share or portion of the capital stock \u25a0or property of any company or association, which is required to list \u25a0or return its capital and property for taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The jnovisions of said act of 1861, for taxing the banks, organized under the act of 1845, are as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">\u201c Seo. 4. It shall be the duty of the president and cashier of \u25a0 each banking company organized under the act entitled \u2018 an act to incorporate the State Bank of Ohio and other banking companies,\u2019 passed February 24, 1845, on or before the second day of May in each year, to make out, under oath,, and to return to the proper assessor of the township, town, or ward where such company is located, a certificate containing a statement of <em>the amount of the cap-dial stock of such company paid in and remaining as capital stock </em>un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>diminished by loss or </em>otherwise, together with the amount of surplus and contingent fund and undivided profits accrued prior to the ^first Monday in May, and also the amount loaned to or deposited with such bank for a term certain, or which by agreement \u2022or understanding between the parties, is not to be withdrawn on \u2022demand, excepting amounts which may-have been deposited with .any bank established as a clearing-house for the redemption of the notes of banks making such deposits, and on which no. interest is charged or received by the banks making such deposits; and the amount so returned shall be placed on the county duplicate, and on the city duplicate where city taxes are collected on a separate \u25a0duplicate, and taxed as other personal property in the same township, town, village, or ward may be taxed by law. <em>In making the certificate aforesaid, any portion of said stock, surplus, or contingent fund, or undivided profits invested in real estate, which is subject to taxation under the laws of this state, may be deducted; </em>but the certificate shall \u2022specify the amount so deducted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">By the act of January 16,1862, all banks of issue in the states were authorized temporarily to suspend specie payments, and were relieved from penalties provided in their charters against such suspension, upon condition that they should, respectively, consent to be taxed under said act of 1861. And all the banks organized under said act of 1845 gave their consent accordingly, within the time specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Under this state of legislation, was the tax levied upon these shares authorized by law?</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Whether the state has inherent power, without any authority from Congress, to impose an equitable and just tax upon shares or capital in banks organized under the revenue laws of the federal government, and whether the power, if it exists, is unlimited, unless restrained by Congress, need not be made questions in the case. The power and the limitation are both supplied in the act of Congress referred to. Nor can the constitutional right of Congress to grant the power, be impugned \u2019 on the ground that it impairs the validity of the contract of the government, exempting the bonds upon which the circulation of the banks is based, from taxation. Congress had the right to impose this condition as a royalty annexed to the grant of corporate power, and the corporators, by acceptance of the grant, have. assented to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>dition. *The state, therefore, had power to tax these shares,, according to the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">It is, perhaps, now conceded\u2014although the contrary was originally argued in the case\u2014that the word \u201cshares,\u201d used in the act of Congress in reference to the national banks, was intended to be understood in the sense of <em>choses, </em>and not as <em>aliquot parts of the capital stock </em>of the association. It was used to designate the <em>separate </em>and <em>individual </em>property of the owners, and not their interest in the <em>common </em>property of the bank. The intention was, to subject these shares to taxation, as such property of the owner, at their <em>full value, </em>without any deduction on account of the <em>franchise, </em>or for investments of the capital or funds of the bank in untaxable <em>bonds, </em>or in <em>real estate. </em>That such is the true construction of the act is now well settled by the case of Duer <em>v. </em>The Commissioners, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States at its present term, and in Van Allen <em>v. </em>The Assessors, 3 Wallace, 573. It is not claimed that the plaintiffs are taxed beyond the value of their-\u201cshares\u201d in this sense. They are taxed upon the par value of the shares, and there is nothing in the case to show that their-real value is any less than par. The tax, then, is authorized and legal, unless it is in violation of the limitations imposed by the act of Congress, by exceeding the rate imposed upon \u201cmoneyed capital\u201d in the hands of individuals, or that imposed upon <em>\u201cshares-</em>'in state banks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">As to the first of these limitations there can be no question. If the shares are to be regarded as <em>choses, </em>and assessed at their full-value, then there can be no violation of the first limitation, unless they are subjected to a higher <em>percentage </em>of taxation than other-property or capital, at the place where the bank is located, which is not pretended in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">It remains to inquire, whether the tax exceeds the rate imposed upon the \u201c shares in the banks authorized by the state.\u201d This is-the principal question in the case, and it has been elaborately and ably argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">It must be premised, that in the cases referred to, the Supreme-Court of the United States have put a more liberal construction upon the word \u201cshares\u201d as here used, in favor of the power to tax, than they have upon the same word when ^designating; shares in the national banks. That court holds, that the equivalent taxation necessary to justify a tax upon the shares in national <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>banks, may be either upon the <em>shares </em>of the individual stockholders in the state banks, and assessed against the stockholders, or it may be upon the <em>capital </em>of the bank, and assessed against the bank itself; provided only that it be a <em>frill equivalent. </em>The tax against the owners of shares in the national banks must not exceed that imposed, in some form, upon the state banks or their stockholders. The question is, whether there is such equivalent in either form, in \u2022the present case? In other words: Does the act of April, 1861, properly construed with reference to provisions in our constitution on the subject, tax the <em>shares </em>in the state banks, and as the <em>choses </em>\u00abor property of the shareholders; or, if not, then does it tax the banks \u00a1themselves, upon an amount equal to the value of such shares without deduction? We are unanimous in the opinion that both these questions must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The counsel of the defendants contend, in the first place, that there is such equivalent tax imposed upon the banks themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">It is true, as counsel say, that the act of 1861 may be regarded \u2022as a <em>contract </em>with the banks organized under the act of 1845, and that the legislature had full <em>power, </em>as against the banks organized under the act of 1851, to impose an equivalent tax. But it matters not whether we regard the act as a <em>contract, </em>or as a <em>law, </em>or what may have been the power of the legislature, the question in either case is the same. What is its true <em>construction ? </em>Does it impose on the banks of the state a tax <em>equivalent </em>to that imposed upon the <em>shares </em>in national banks ?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">There are three alleged elements of inequality\u2014the <em>franchise, </em>\u2022the real, <em>estate, </em>and the (investment in <em>United States bonds. </em>Possibly we may rid the case of the first, by holding that the act of 1865 only required shares in the national banks to be taxed at \u2022their <em>par </em>or <em>nominal </em>value, as they were in fact taxed in this case, and not at their <em>actual </em>or <em>market </em>value, and, therefore, the value -of the <em>franchise </em>is to be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">As to the second element of inequality there can be no controversy. The shares in the national banks are assessed at *their value\u2014either nominal or real\u2014without any deduction for <em>real \u25a0estate, </em>which is taxed separately against the bank, as real estate; \u25a0whereas, by express provision in the act of 1861, the value of real \u25a0estate owned by the state banks is to be deducted from their capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">But the most important element of difference is the investment in <em>United States bonds. </em>The act of 1865, admittedly, allows no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>deduction for bonds owned by the national banks, from the valuation of shares to be taxed. Does the act of 1861 allow such deduction from the capital of the state banks ? However we might be disposed to decide this as an original question, we look upon it. as having been settled by decisions of the Supreme Court of the-United States, and we feel bound by those decisions. In the case-of Van Allen <em>v. </em>The Assessors, and also in The Bank Tax-Case, in 2 Wallace, 200, a tax law of New York, of 1857, of similar import, was held to admit of such deduction, and a tax levied under it upon the capital'of the New York state banks, without deduction-for such bonds, was declared by that court to be unauthorized and illegal. In New York, as in Ohio, the general <em>ad valorem </em>system of taxation is adopted. In both states taxes are assessed upon-<em>valuations. </em>The New York statute of 1857 subjected the banks of that state to taxed upon a valuation \u201c <em>equal to the amount of their capital stock paid in or secured to be paid in, </em>and their surplus earnings,\u201d etc. The valuation upon which our state and independent banks are to be taxed, by the law of 1861, is to consist of \u201c <em>the' amount of the capital stock of such companies paid in and remaining\u2022 as capital stock undiminished by losses or otherwise, </em>together with the amount of surplus,\u201d etc. The two statutes are substantially the-same; and were we to put a different construction upon ours, it would only be necessary to take the case to the Supreme Court of' the United States in order to have the decision reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">But it is contended, in the second place, that the act of 1861 imposes a tax upon <em>shares </em>in the state banks, <em>as well as </em>upon the capital of the banks. There is no pretense that the act <em>expressly </em>taxes-shares in the state banks. On the contrary, it is admitted that by~ the 59th section of that act they are expressly exempted. The argument is, that the exemption is ^unconstitutional, and must, therefore be rejected ; that the true meaning of the constitution is, that money employed in banking, by associations who divide their-capital stock into shares, shall be subjected to a species of <em>double </em>taxation ; that it shall be taxed once against the bank as its <em>capital, </em>and a. seeondtime against the shareholders as <em>stock </em>in the bank. We are not \u25a0called upon to decide this constitutional question. For the present, case it is enough to say, that the constitution docs not, on such matters, execute itself.- It does not levy takes, but merely prescribes the character of <em>laws </em>to be enacted for that purpose1 by the-legislature. Until the laws are passed, the taxes can not be levied-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The act of 1861 is not a law imposing snch double taxation, and!, can not, upon any admissible principle, be <em>amended </em>by judicial interpretation into such a law. It provides for a tax against certain, corporations and companies upon their capital, and for a tax against: the shareholders, upon their stock, in those corporations and companies that are <em>not </em>so taxed upon their capital. No form of words,, or arrangement of sections and sentences in the act, can enable the court, by mere construction, so to amend it as to bring in a <em>new class </em>of tax-payers; that is to say, stockholders in corporations and companies that <em>are </em>taxed, as such, upon their capital. The\u2019 meaning of the act is plain, and to alter it in the respect indicated, would be to legislate. The intention manifestly was to subject the-capital employed by these corporations and associations to a <em>single </em>taxation\u2014some of them in one form, and some in another\u2014and not. to tax any of them <em>twice. </em>It is the unmistakable intention manifested in our tax legislation for the last twenty years\u2014the central idea of our system of general <em>ad valorem taxation\u2014to tax every person upon what he is worth. </em>In a system like ours, where intangible as well as tangible property is taxed, some forms of <em>double </em>taxation are unavoidable; but the object should be\u2014and such seems to have been the general aim of all our late legislation upon the subject\u2014 to avoid double taxation wherever it is practicable, and, as nearly as may be, to tax all according to their actual wealth. That object is best attained in case of a corporation, or joint stock company, by taxing the <em>stockholders\u2014the persons who own its ^property, </em>upon the <em>full value </em>of their <em>shares </em>therein, including, of course, their interest in the <em>franchise or privilege, </em>and in all <em>tangible property </em>owned by the company; and by taxing the corporation also upon the value of such <em>tangible </em>property. The stockholders are thus taxed\u2014as all other individuals who own tangible and intangible property are sometimes unavoidably taxed\u2014once upon <em>all he is </em>ivorth, and a second time upon that part of his property which is <em>tangible. </em>This is the rule adopted by the act of Congress in question, and it seems to us to be a just and fair rule. The act of 1865, by subjecting shareholders in the national banks to such a tax, places upon the <em>owners </em>of those banks, the shareholders therein, no more than their just proportion of the public burden of taxation; and we regret that any technical reasons, growing out of the taxation of the few remaining state banks, should stand in the way of its enforcement. We are glad, however, to say that no such im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>pediments to just and equal legislation on the subject will exist in the future. The banks organized under the act of 1845, now only exist for the purpose of closing up their affairs, and arc no longer \u201cbanks\u201d within the meaning of the act of Congress; and the banks organized under the act of April, 1851, are liable to be taxed under the constitution of 1851, subject to no limitation in their charters. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to say, that the word \u201c banks \u201d in the act of Congress means incorporated banks, and that the limitation does not, therefore, apply to private bankers.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We are of opinion that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 petition, and its judgment will, therefore, be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">It by no means follows, however, that the plaintiffs are entitled to an unconditional injunction against the collection of the tax. They ask equity, and must do equity. They invoke the exercise of an extraordinary power of the court for their relief, and the court in its discretion should refuse that relief, except upon conditions that are equitable and just. We think, therefore, that the injunction should only be granted upon the condition that the plaintiffs, or their bank, *shall first pay to the treasurer of Hamilton county, a sum that will be a <em>pro rata </em>equivalent for the tax imposed upon the state and independent banks, under the act \u25a0of 1861, that is to say, such sum as might lawfully have been assessed upon the plaintiffs, or their bank, under said act, had it been \u2022one of said state banks. If the parties can not agree upon this sum, proceedings can be adopted to ascertain it by the court; and, if found necessary, the bank itself can be made a party.</p>\n<judges id=\"b576-7\">Scott, C.
