In this sense, the Index forms no part of the record. The record is complete without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">An index to the record of an instrument is the means provided' \u25a0for pointing out, or indicating, where the record may be found. It may, in many cases, be indispensable in order to secure the full benefit of the record to the public. But its office is to facilitate the Tesearches of those having occasion to examine the records; and, strictly, it can not be said to form part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">For the purposes of the present question, the duties of the recorder may be considered of a twofold character: (1) such as he ewes to mortgagees and grantees; and (2) such as he owes to third persons, having an interest in examining the records with the view \u25a0of ascertaining the condition of the title to particular property.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">To the former class belongs the duty of receiving, receipting for, \u2022and duly recording conveyances presented for record; and to the latter class, the duty of affording to persons having occasion to examine, all the facilities provided by law for ascertaining the state of the title as it may exist of record. Of the means thus provided, is the duty of allowing the records to be examined, and of furnishing a correct index to *aid in the examination. If an examination were denied, the desired information could not be obtained, .although the index might be full and correct; and a like result would probably follow if an examination were allowed, but no in\u25a0dex furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">For the misfeasance or nonfeasance of the recorder, he is liable to the party injured; and where his official delinquency consists in his failure to index the record of an instrument, the injured party is the person misled by the want of the index, and not the person whose deed has, in all other respects, been duly recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">lip\u00f3n a careful examination of the statutes, we have failed to discover any evidence of an intention on the part of the legislature that the index to the record of a deed is to be regarded as a part &lt;of such record.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">The first act making express provision for an index that we have been able to discover, is \u201c an act *fco authorize county recorders to transcribe records in certain- cases,\u201d passed January 30, 1835. S. &amp; &lt;3. Stat. 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">The third section of this act authorized the recorders of the several counties to provide suitable books, and make a new and complete general index <em>to all the records </em>in the recorder\u2019s offices of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>respective counties. Subsequent acts have provided for keeping up the indexes, and have prescribed what they should contain. In. none of these laws is it declared that the index is to be regarded as forming part of the record. On the contrary, the words seem to. have been used in their ordinary sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">From the commencement of the state government statutes have-existed requiring conveyances to be recorded, in order to charge-subsequent purchasers with notice; but nowhere has it been declared that an index is essential to make the record effective. If the legislature had intended that an index to the record should be-necessary to the validity of the conveyance as against subsequent purchasers, it is unreasonable to suppose that it would not have-been so declared in explicit terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The principle that would justify the holding the index to be essontial to the effective character of the record in the *case of conveyances, would seem to require that the index required to be-kept by the clerk should be regarded as essential to the lien of judgments; yet no one, we suppose, would claim that the effect of a judgment was dependent on the act or omission of the clerk in-making the index.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Again, if the index is held to be an essential element to the constructive notice arising from the record, the consequence will be to make the recorder liable for his neglect where no person has, in fact, been misled thereby. For in that view of the law, if there had-been a failure to index, the last purchaser would take the land, though he might not have sought to examine the records; and the-first purchaser, who had lost his land by the failure to index, might look to the recorder for his indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">But it may be said that this principle was not allowed to prevail in Jennings <em>v. </em>Wood, 20 Ohio, 261. This is true. But in that case the deed was held not to have been recorded. Here we are asked to enlarge the operation of the statute, and, by construction, declare the index a part of the record; and before doing so, we may-well look at the consequences that would follow such construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-10\">Scott, C. J., and Day, Welch, and Brinkerhoee, JJ., concurred;.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
