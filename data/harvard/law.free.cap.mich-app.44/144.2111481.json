The resolution created an office of corporation counsel for Wayne County to represent the county in all civil matters, which action was based upon findings of fact (1) that the volume and complexity of the county\u2019s civil litigation had increased; (2) that the prosecutor had failed to increase the size of his civil division despite overall staff increases of 37 assist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ants; (3) that studies on county reorganization recommended removal of civil-law functions from the prosecutor\u2019s office, and (4) that the prosecuting attorney is unable to properly represent the county. The resolution read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-3\">\"RESOLUTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAV\">\"By Commissioner Yates</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">\"WHEREAS, Act 15, P.A. 1941, as amended, authorizes the Board of Commissioners by a majority vote of the members-elect to employ an attorney to represent the County in civil matters, whenever the Board determines that the prosecuting attorney is unable to properly represent the County, and \"WHEREAS, the volume and complexity of civil litigation involving the County of Wayne has increased, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">\"WHEREAS, although the Board of Commissioners has increased the staff of the Prosecuting Attorney by 37 assistants since 1967, the Prosecuting Attorney has not increased the staff of the Civil Division; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiO\">\"WHEREAS, many studies on County Reorganization have recommended that the civil law functions be removed from the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney and be placed in a separate department, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A06q\">\"WHEREAS, the Prosecuting Attorney has openly taken a position along with other elected officials opposing reorganization unless reorganization is only by the County Home Rule, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">\"WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners in order to implement County Reorganization will need independent, impartial and unbiased legal counsel to represent the Board of Commissioners in all legal matters relating to Wayne County; now, therefore, be it</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG9\">\"RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners hereby determines that the Prosecuting Attorney is unable to properly represent the County, and be it further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">\"RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners create the Office of Corporation Counsel, the same to serve as legal counsel to the County of Wayne, and be it further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\"RESOLVED, that the Civil Division of the Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office be removed from the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney and that the Civil Division be designated as the Office of the Wayne County Corporation Counsel, and be it further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">\"RESOLVED, that the positions and the appropriation therefore in the budget of the Civil Division of the Prosecuting Attorney be transferred to the account of the Board of Commissioners and be designated as the budget for the Office of the Corporation Counsel, and be it further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">\"RESOLVED, that the personnel of the Civil Division of the Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office be transferred to the Office of the Corporation Counsel and be designated as Corporation Counsel and Assistant Corporation Counsel respectively, and be it further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">\"RESOLVED, that the adoption of the resolution shall constitute the employment of counsel within the meaning of 1941 PA 15.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The resolution was adopted by the board of commissioners at the meeting of June 17, 1971, by roll-call vote of 16 \"yeas\u201d and 9 \"nays\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Pursuant to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, a temporary restraining order was granted and an order to show cause was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">On July 2, 1971, the order to show cause and the motion to dissolve the restraining order were heard, and the order was dissolved and a modified temporary injunction was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">On July 12, 1971, other elected Wayne County officers filed a motion to intervene as plaintiffs. The motion was granted on July 15, at the same time a pretrial statement was taken, and an order was signed on July 22, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">On September 13, 1971, after briefs had been filed and considered, including a brief <em>amicus curiae, </em>and a hearing, the trial judge issued a full opinion in which he stated his conclusions of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>and law, and an order of declaratory judgment, including a permanent injunction, was issued on November 16, 1971. On January 17, 1972, the final order and permanent injunction were modified by the trial judge upon stipulation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">The final order of the circuit court, as modified, provided that: (1) the creation of the office of corporation counsel for Wayne County is valid; (2) the appointment of appellee Aloysius J. Suchy to serve as legal counsel is valid; (3) the attempted removal of the civil division from the office of the prosecuting attorney and redesignation of that division as the office of Wayne County Corporation Counsel is invalid; (4) the transfer of personnel, budget, and appropriations from the prosecutor is invalid; and (5) the persons who desire to transfer from said civil division onto the staff of the Wayne County Corporation Counsel with release by the plaintiff may do so. The plaintiff has filed a claim of appeal from this final order and judgment, but the intervening plaintiffs do not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Five issues are presented on appeal and will be dealt with seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\n<em>Does 1941 PA 15, as amended (MCLA 49.71, 49.72; MSA 5.824, 5.825), unconstitutionally restrict the constitutional office of prosecuting attorney?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The constitutional provisions relating to the authority of the Legislature, a board of commissioners, and a prosecuting attorney are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\"There shall be elected for four-year terms in each organized county * * * a prosecuting attorney, whose duties and powers shall be provided by law.\u201d Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\"Boards of supervisors shall have legislative, administrative and such other powers and duties as provided by law.\u201d Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">\"The provisions of this constitution and law concerning counties, * * * shall be liberally construed in their favor. Powers granted to counties * * * by this constitution and by law shall include those fairly implied and not prohibited by this constitution.\u201d Const 1963, art 7, \u00a734.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The challenged statute, pursuant to which the Wayne County Board of Commissioners acted, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">\"The board of supervisors of any county by a majority vote of the members-elect may employ an attorney <em>to represent the county in civil matters, </em>whenever the Board determines that the prosecuting attorney is unable to properly represent the county. * * * \u201d MCLA 49.71; MSA 5.824. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">\"In case the board of supervisors of any such county shall employ an attorney under this act to represent the county in civil matters, the prosecuting attorney of such county shall not act with respect to such matters unless requested to do so by the board of supervisors.\u201d MCLA 49.72; MSA 5.825.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The first section of the foregoing statute grants the power to a board of supervisors (now called a board of commissioners \u2014 MCLA 46.416; MSA 5.359[16]) to \"employ an attorney <em>to represent the county in civil matters\u201d. </em>Such a law, without more, appears to be clearly within the language of Const 1963, art 7, \u00a78. However, the Legislature had enacted MCLA 49.153; MSA 5.751, in 1846, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">\"The prosecuting attorneys shall, in their respective counties, appear for the state or county, and prosecute or defend in all the courts of the county, all prosecutions, suits, applications and motions, whether civil or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>criminal, in which the state or county may be a party, or interested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">The plaintiff argues that the prosecuting attorney and the board of commissioners are co-equal constitutional offices and one constitutional officer cannot invade the authority of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Defendants contend that the challenged statute was within the powers granted to both the Legislature and the Wayne County Board of Commissioners and that all that the commissioners did was make a discretionary determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We are confronted here with an apparent inconsistency arising from the fact that one statute requires the prosecuting attorney to represent the county in civil matters, while the action by a board of commissioners in employing an independent attorney would result in an apparent dual representation of the county in such civil matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">To avoid an incongruent result, the Legislature enacted 1941 PA 15, \u00a7 2, which instructs the prosecuting attorney to refrain from acting with respect to civil matters for which the commissioners employ an independent attorney. That the Legislature may terminate a duty of the prosecuting attorney in such a manner is implicit in the Legislature\u2019s power to provide by law for duties. Under Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 8, the Legislature has authority to confer local legislative power on county commissioners. The authority of the Legislature to confer local legislative powers contains the authority to suspend or revoke the power. <em>Attorney General v Marr, </em>55 Mich 445, 450 (1885). Similarly, a reasonable construction of the Legislature\u2019s authority in Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 4, leads to the conclusion that the Legislature may remove powers from the prosecuting attorneys of the counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>When a board employs an attorney to represent the county in civil matters, representation of the county by the prosecuting attorney in those matters is terminated by operation of MCLA 49.72; MSA 5.825, not by removal of the prosecuting attorney\u2019s powers by resolution of the board. In other words, an affirmative action by a board of commissioners (the hiring of corporation counsel) causes a reduction in the powers and duties of the prosecutor by operation of law. Therefore, the authority given to county boards in MCLA 49.71; MSA 5.824, does not violate Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The appellant\u2019s argument that the commissioners\u2019 resolution amounted to an unconstitutional, partial recall is not persuasive. Recall under Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 33, clearly relates to removal of a man from office, not a reduction of duties assigned to the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\n<em>Is 1941 PA 15, as amended, an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the boards of commissioners?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Plaintiff argues that MCLA 49.71; MSA 5.824, improperly delegates a legislative power, namely, the power to determine the duties of a prosecuting attorney, to the board of commissioners in the several counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">The defendants counter this by stating that the Wayne County Board of Commissioners was not delegated legislative power; under the statute it was permitted to make a discretionary determination that the prosecuting attorney is unable to properly represent the county in civil matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Our examination of the provisions of MCLA 49.71; MSA 5.824, reveals that the county boards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>of commissioners are empowered to adopt resolutions for the employment of a county corporation counsel. This , is definitely a delegation of local, legislative authority within the meaning of Const 1963, art 7, \u00a78. While it is true, as defendants argue, that the commissioners may act only after a discretionary finding that the prosecutor is unable to properly represent the county, a legislative power may be granted upon that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\">Since Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 8, specifically permits the delegation of legislative power to the boards of commissioners, it can be said that the plaintiffs argument of improper delegation of power is inapplicable. See, generally, Anno: <em>Permissible Limits of Delegation of Legislative Power, </em>79 L Ed 474, 492-494.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The rule of law barring the delegation of power is traceable to the constitutional concept of the separation of powers, which is specifically included in our state constitution. Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\"><em>Florka v Detroit, </em>369 Mich 568, 575 (1963), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">\"' \"The Legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law, but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Accord, <em>O\u2019Brien v State Highway Commissioner, </em>375 Mich 545, 555-558 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Whether viewed as a delegation within Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 8, or as a delegation within <em>Florka, supra, </em>MCLA 49.71; MSA 5.824, is constitutional because that section contains a standard for determining the fact precedent to a specified action. The challenged statute had adequate standards similar to the type approved in <em>Certain-Teed Products Corp v Paris Twp, </em>351 Mich 434 (1958), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>unlike the too-general delegation in <em>Osius v St Clair Shores, </em>344 Mich 693 (1956). There is no improper delegation of power in the challenged statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\n<em>Does the resolution of the commissioners exceed the scope of their authority under MCLA 49.71; MSA 5.824 because it is not limited to ad hoc circumstances and because it attempts to expand the commissioners\u2019 powers?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">It is argued by the plaintiff that in adopting 1941 PA 15, as amended, the Legislature intended the boards of commissioners to utilize the power on a case-by-case, ad hoc basis where a prosecuting attorney, might have a conflict of interest or where there might be a special problem. They also contend that the resolution permits the board to accomplish a county reorganization which is only permitted in compliance with MCLA 45.515(a); MSA 5.302(15)(a), following a home rule reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Ad hoc employment of an attorney by a board of commissioners is permitted under MCLA 49.71; MSA 5.824, but this does not necessarily preclude the conclusion that general employment of an attorney is permitted. In fact, if the Legislature was only concerned with case-by-case need, it appears existing legislation was sufficient at the time of original adoption in 1941. See MCLA 49.160; MSA 5.758, MCLA 49.32; MSA 5.792, MCLA 49.42; MSA 5.802. The trial judge\u2019s analysis of the matter warrants reiteration here for its lucid holding in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">\"In construing the legislative intention regarding this matter, it must be assumed that the Legislature in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>tended to enable the commissioners to employ counsel in a way and for a purpose that would best serve the public interest. The court is satisfied that the intention of an informed Michigan Legislature, when it last dealt with this statute in 1957, was that the commissioners would be empowered to act upon the public business, having available to them legal counsel who could provide steady, continuing, informed legal advice on a broad spectrum of complex legal questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-3\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">\"The very title of the act is instructive on that matter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">\" 'An act to authorize boards of supervisors in certain counties to employ <em>an attorney </em>to represent the county in civil <em>matters. </em>\u2019(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">\"It is the court\u2019s judgment that the statute in question empowers the commissioners to employ counsel to represent the county in civil matters, either on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis, or for permanent and continuing purposes, general or limited, whenever it concludes that the county prosecuting attorney is unable to properly represent the county, whether that be a one time only conclusion, or one made on an issue by issue basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">While it is true that the challenged resolution expands the power of the board, the authority for such expansion is a legislative enactment. That the Legislature saw fit to condition such an expansion upon a discretionary act of a hoard of commissioners does not make the statute less valid in the face of an appropriate standard. The board did not expand its powers in violation of MCLA 46.11; MSA 5.331, because the expansion was authorized by law as required by Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The plaintiffs contention that creation of an office of county corporation counsel is solely permitted under MCLA 45.515(a); MSA 5.302(15)(a), lacks merit for two reasons: (1) MCLA 49.71; MSA 5.824, permits such an action, and (2) MCLA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>45.515(a); MSA 5.302(15)(a), is not applicable to Wayne County \u2014 MCLA 45.520; MSA 5.302(20). The resolution of the Wayne County Board of Commissioners did not unconstitutionally expand the powers of that board.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\n<em>Is the resolution of the Wayne County Board of Commissioners, whereby an office of corporation counsel was created, invalid because it is in conflict with the state statutes imposing mandatory and discretionary duties upon the prosecuting attorney?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The action of a board of commissioners does not terminate the duties and power of a prosecuting attorney; operation of MCLA 49.72; MSA 5.825, terminates such duties and power in regard to those civil matters of the county for which an independent attorney is employed. Thus, the conflict is between state statutes, not local resolution and state statute, and the usual rules of statutory construction are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Plaintiff cites what he considers four major conflicts. First, he notes the general grant of authority in MCLA 49.153; MSA 5.751; second, the duty to advise and represent the board of county auditors under MCLA 47.12; MSA 5.562; third, the duty to advise the county treasurer under MCLA 211.100; MSA 7.154; and fourth, the general duty to advise county officers in regard to their official duties under MCLA 49.155; MSA 5.753. It should be noted that all of these statutes were enacted prior to enactment of 1941 PA 15, as amended. Plaintiffs complete list of statutes for which it is argued that there must be some conflict with MCLA 49.72; MSA 5.825, is included herewith. (See Appendix.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The trial court\u2019s opinion carefully and logically deals with this problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-3\">\"It is elemental that statutes relating to the same subject matter, such as those dealing with the varied powers and duties of county prosecuting attorneys and that which deals with the commissioners\u2019 power to hire civil counsel, must be considered together and are presumed to effectuate compatibly, the legislative intention expressed in each. A companion rule of statutory construction is that the Legislature is presumed to enact laws having regard for existing statutes. <em>Valentine v Bedford Twp Supervisor, </em>[371 Mich 138 (1963)]; <em>People v Buckley, </em>302 Mich 12 (1942).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\">\"Hence, it is presumed that the Legislature was cognizant of the powers and duties of the prosecuting attorney, it had previously 'provided by law\u2019 when it enacted MCLA 49.71 and MCLA 49.72 nullifying his role in those instances when counsel is hired to represent a county in civil matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">\"The prosecuting attorney has no property right in the duties and powers assigned him by the Legislature. No constitutional provision clothes him with the right to act for or on behalf of the county or its elected officials in matters involving the civil law. The prosecuting attorney has only those powers and duties the statutes confer. The Legislature can grant, withhold, expand, modify or abolish his powers and duties. Just such modifying action was taken by the Legislature in enacting MCLA 49.72:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\" 'Sec. 2. In case the board of supervisors of any such county shall employ an attorney under this act to represent the county in civil matters, the prosecuting attorney of such county shall not act with respect to such matter[s], unless requested to do so by the board of supervisors.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">\"The language is clear and unambiguous. If the commissioners\u2019 civil counsel acts in a matter of civil law, the prosecuting attorney 'shall not act with respect to such matters, unless requested\u2019 by the commissioners to do so. Just as the Legislature has heretofore reposed certain powers and duties in the prosecuting attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>with respect to civil matters, then expanded and modified them, likewise, it can \u00e1brogate them. This it has done under MCLA 49.71, <em>et seq., </em>by authorizing action by other counsel on county civil matters with the specific provision that, the prosecuting attorney shall not act with respect thereto, unless requested. No fatal conflict exists, nor is there any disregard of antecedent legislation. The Legislature has expressly authorized the commissioners to employ counsel to represent the county in civil matters. When the board of commissioners\u2019 civil counsel undertakes to act within the scope of his authority to represent the county in such matters, then otherwise operative legislative commands to the prosecuting attorney to act in the same matters are preempted and rendered inoperative by MCLA 49.72.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">A corporation counsel may be employed solely for the purpose of <em>representing the county in civil matters. </em>A proper definition of \"representing the county in civil matters\u201d would not include all noncriminal functions of a prosecuting attorney. For example, service on the driver\u2019s safety school driver\u2019s board pursuant to MCLA 257.320b; MSA 9.2020(2), the power to enforce the Michigan Food Law under MCLA 289.714; MSA 12.933(14), and MCLA 46.403; MSA 5.359(3), service on the county apportionment commission, are not reasonably within the definition of \"representing the county in civil matters\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\n<em>Assuming arguendo that the resolution of the Wayne County Board of Commissioners is valid in other respects, should the resolution be voided because the commissioners abused their discretion in \u00f1nding that \"the prosecuting attorney is unable to properly represent the county\u201d?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The plaintiff contends there was no reasonable basis for the determination of the board that the appellant \"is unable to represent the county\u201d in civil matters, and the board\u2019s motives were im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>proper, while defendants say the board acted within the scope of the challenged statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\">That legislative and administrative actions are within the <em>discretionary </em>power of the acting branch or agency also flows from the separation-of-powers concept. For a case drawing the analogy between discretion in acting and delegation of power, see <em>Carlson v Landon, </em>342 US 524, 540-544; 72 S Ct 525, 534-536; 96 L Ed 547, 560-562 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Whenever an act is within the scope of the power granted to the acting body, motive is not a test of the propriety of the exercise of that discretionary power. <em>People v Gardner, </em>143 Mich 104, 106-109 (1906); <em>United States Cold Storage Corp v Detroit Board of Assessors, </em>349 Mich 81 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The wisdom and motivation of the Wayne County Board of Commissioners in adopting its resolution is not a test of the validity of the exercise of its discretionary powers so long as the finding has a reasonable foundation as it does here.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">It does not appear that the Wayne County Board of Commissioners acted without a reasonable basis, therefore, it did not abuse its discretion. <em>Carlson v Landon, supra; Wendel v Swanberg, </em>384 Mich 468 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Affirmed.
