L. c. 152, \u00a7 35B, in order to receive benefits at the rate in effect at the time of his original injury, rather than at the rate in effect at the time of the recurrence of that injury. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">The facts are not disputed. Taylor suffered a work related injury to his lower back on March 31, 1991. He received temporary and total incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u00a7 34,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the amount of $320.51 per week, based upon 66 2 3/s% of $480.77, his average weekly wage at the time of his injury. He underwent a laminectomy at the L 4-5 level and was able to return to full-time, modified employment on August 18, 1991. In December, 1991, the workers compensation statute was amended so as to reduce benefits. St. 1991, c. 398. Taylor continued working<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> until May 15, 1993, when his condition again worsened. He commenced physical therapy and was only able to work part-time. He also began receiving partial incapacity benefits at that time, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35. On December 14,1993, Taylor underwent a third surgical procedure, and he has not returned to work. His average weekly wage as of that date was $563.30. Since December 14, 1993, Taylor has received temporary and total incapacity benefits under \u00a7 34<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the amount of $337.98, based upon 60% of his average weekly wage of $563.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">There is no dispute that Taylor\u2019s condition as of December 14, 1993, was a subsequent injury in the form of a recurrence of his injury of March 31, 1991. Both Taylor and the Insurer assumed the terms of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35B, applied to his \u00a7 34 claim. That statute, as inserted by St. 1970, c. 667, \u00a7 1, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">\u201cAn employee who has been receiving compensation under this chapter and who has returned to work for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>period of not less than two months shall, if he is subsequently injured and receives compensation, be paid such compensation at the rate in effect at the time of the subsequent injury whether or not such subsequent injury is determined to be a recurrence of the former injury; provided, that if compensation for the old injury was paid in a lump sum, he shall not receive compensation unless the subsequent claim is determined to be a new injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Taylor contended that he was entitled to 66 2/s% of his average weekly wages as of December 14, 1993, or the pre-1991 percentage factor applied to his post-1991 wages. The insurer applied the 60% rate found in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 59. Taylor appealed the action of the insurer. An administrative judge agreed with the insurer. Taylor appealed to the board, which affirmed the decision of the administrative judge. However, without the issue having been raised by either party, a majority of the board determined that Taylor should be permitted to elect whether \u00a7 35B would apply. It gave him leave to reopen his case, retract his claim under \u00a7 35B within sixty days of the filing of the board\u2019s decision, and seek compensation under \u00a7 34 at the rates in effect at the time of his original injury. The insurer appeals from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The issues presented in this appeal are (1) whether the board may allow a party to reopen his cas\u00e9 to pursue an unasserted claim, and (2) whether G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35B, is elective.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">1. <em>Authority of the board. </em>The board is an administrative tribunal and, accordingly, \u201cpossesses only such authority and powers as have been conferred upon it by express grant or arise therefrom by implication as necessary and incidental to the full exercise of the granted powers.\u201d <em>Levangie\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 213, 217 (1917). <em>Hansen\u2019s Case, </em>350 Mass. 178, 180 (1966). The powers of the board are set forth in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 31, and are, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">\u201cThe reviewing board shall reverse the decision of an administrative judge only if it determines that such administrative judge\u2019s decision is beyond the scope of his authority, arbitrary or capricious, or contrary to law. The reviewing board may, when appropriate, recommit a case before it to an administrative judge for further findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>fact. Where the reviewing board affirms the decision of an administrative judge, it may do so in summary fashion and without discussion of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Here, the board unanimously affirmed the decision of the administrative judge. However, a majority of the board, sua sponte, fashioned what it acknowledged was an \u201cunusual disposition,\u201d and gave Taylor leave to reopen his case in order to retract his \u00a7 35B claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Taylor had only sought the application of the 66 <em>2h% </em>factor to his average weekly wage as of his last date of employment. The narrow question before the board was whether the 66 2/a% factor or the 60% factor applied to Taylor\u2019s claim, and the board answered the question. The relief granted was not \u201cnecessary and incidental to the full exercise of the [board\u2019s] powers.\u201d <em>Levangie\u2019s Case, supra. </em>Nor was it \u201cnecessary to dispose completely of the claim.\u201d <em>Utica Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 267 (1985). Once the board affirmed the decision of the administrative judge, its authority over the case ended. Compare <em>Hansen\u2019s Case, supra. </em>Additionally, the board\u2019s power to recommit is, under \u00a7 11C, limited to the power to \u201crecommit ... for further findings of fact.\u201d There was neither an order nor a need for further findings. The board exceeded its statutory authority when it permitted Taylor to reopen his case after it affirmed the decision of the administrative judge. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2); G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)0), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">2. <em>General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 35B, issues. </em>The board unanimously affirmed the decision of the administrative judge, who determined that \u00a7 35B required the application of rates in effect as of December 14, 1993, the date of Taylor\u2019s \u201csubsequent injury.\u201d Those rates were inserted by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 59. The board correctly construed the operative effect of \u00a7 35B. See <em>Don Francisco\u2019s Case, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 456 (1982); <em>Bernardo\u2019s Case, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 48 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">However, after so holding, a majority of the board decided that whether \u00a7 35B would apply should be the option of the employee in circumstances where, as here, the prevailing rates in effect at the time of the \u201csubsequent injury\u201d may be overall less favorable to the employee than those in effect at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the original injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board reasoned that \u00a7 35B \u201cwas intended to address the problem of employees suffering a \u2018subsequent injury\u2019 being stuck with a compensation rate which was economically relevant to an often remote date of the original injury. We think that, like Sec. 51 A,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sec. 35B must be construed to benefit employees, not to disadvantage them.\u201d It relied upon dictum<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in <em>Madariaga\u2019s Case, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 477 (1985), for the proposition that the Legislature intended \u00a7 35B to serve to enhance benefits, and never to reduce benefits, between the time of injury and the time of recurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u201c|T]t is established that the workers\u2019] compensation act is to be construed broadly, rather than narrowly, in the light of its purpose and, so far as reasonably may be, to promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design. . . . But it is also settled that, in construing a statute, its words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning according to the approved usage of language . . . and that the language of the statute is not to be enlarged or limited by construction unless its object and plain meaning require it.\u201d <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 741, 746-747 (1945) (citations omitted). The words of \u00a7 35B are plain and unambiguous. \u201cAn employee . . . shall ... be paid such compensation at the rate in effect at the time of the subsequent injury.\u201d These words are mandatory, not precatory. Compare <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 609-610 (1983). In <em>Don Francisco\u2019s Case, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 463, we stated, \u201c[ujnder \u00a7 35B . . . the employee\u2019s right to compensation . . . originate[s] in the change in the employee\u2019s condition subsequent to his return to work.\u201d Section 35B looks to the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>upon which a subsequent injury occurs for purposes of determining the applicable compensation rates. See <em>Bernardo\u2019s Case, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 52. There is no indication that the Legislature intended \u00a7 35B to be elective. In <em>McLeod\u2019s Case, </em>389 Mass. 431 (1983), the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that the provisions of \u00a7 51 A<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were mandatory, using an analysis that is instructive here. The court stated that \u201c[t]he mandatory nature of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51A, is demonstrated not only by the language that the Legislature employed, but also by the language it did not employ. The statute contains no guidelines for the exercise of discretion. In the absence of a clear expression of legislative intent, we think it unlikely that the Legislature intended to vest in the board unlimited discretion to choose between rates of compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435. The use of elective provisions elsewhere in the act,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but not in \u00a7 35B, reinforces a nonelective construction for the section. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The board\u2019s reliance upon the beneficent design of c. 152 and the dictum in <em>Madariaga\u2019s Case, supra, </em>for the proposition that \u00a7 35B may not be used to decrease benefits, is misplaced. It does not follow that a decrease in benefits is a frustration of the purpose of the statute. As the dissenting member of the board noted, \u201c[ajlthough [\u00a7 35B] was enacted to avoid the obsolescence of rates, one must recognize that such obsolescence may be caused by rates that are too high, as well as too low.\u201d See <em>McLeod\u2019s Case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Where \u00a7 35B has been judicially construed to require application of rates in effect at the time of a \u201csubsequent injury,\u201d the Legislature is presumed to have been aware of those decisions at the time it enacted St. 1991, c. 398. See <em>Meunier\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 421, 423 (1946); <em>Verrochi </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>394 Mass. 633, 640 (1985). The Legislature is further presumed to know the effect \u00a7 35B would have upon the other sections of c. 152, in particular, \u00a7 34, as a result of the 1991 amendments. See <em>Randall\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 383, 386 (1954); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. 551, 554 (1996). The 1991 revisions to c. 152 reversed the historically upward trend<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in workers\u2019 compensation rates. The reductions in compensation rates under the 1991 legislation were sweeping and systemic, and came in response to declining economic conditions and rising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>costs of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. See Locke, Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act \u00a7 1.0 (Supp. 1995). There is no indication that the Legislature intended to spare any aspect of the prior rate structure from its design to improve the business climate by lowering workers\u2019 compensation benefits. St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 16, amended G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 2A, in part by adding the words \u201cor decreases,\u201d such that it now provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">\u201cEvery act, in amendment of this chapter, in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter becoming effective which increases <em>or decreases </em>the amount or amounts of compensation payable to an injured employee . . . shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be deemed to be substantive in character and shall apply only to personal injuries occurring on and after the effective date of such act, unless otherwise expressly provided.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Reading \u00a7 35B in harmony with the other sections of c. 152, as we must, see <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., supra, </em>and mindful of the cost saving purpose of the 1991 legislation, it is improbable that the Legislature did not anticipate that \u00a7 35B would result in a decrease in benefits to an employee if the prevailing rates at the time of a \u201csubsequent injury\u201d were lowered.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The board\u2019s decision that \u00a7 35B is elective was based upon an error of law. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c). That portion of the board\u2019s decision which permits Taylor to retract his \u201c\u00a7 35B claim\u201d on grounds that it is optional is reversed, and an order is to enter directing the calculation of his benefits based on the rates established by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 59. The decision of the board is, in all other respects, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 34, as amended by St. 1985, c. 522, \u00a7 42, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">\u201cWhile the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is total, during each week of incapacity the insurer shall pay the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to two-thirds of his average weekly wage before the injury, but not more than the maximum weekly compensation rate nor less than the minimum weekly compensation rate, unless the average weekly wage of the employee is less than the minimum weekly compensation rate, in which case said weekly compensation shall be equal to his average weekly wage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">\u201cThe total number of weeks of compensation due the employee under this section shall not exceed two hundred and sixty.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Taylor underwent a second surgical procedure on November 4, 1992, and was unable to work for approximately one month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b528-12\">Statute 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 59, amended G.
