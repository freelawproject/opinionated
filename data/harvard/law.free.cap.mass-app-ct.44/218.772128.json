The facts are not in dispute. The underlying claims involved an auto accident in which two complaints were filed against Zee\u2019s Wallpaper to Go (Zee\u2019s) and Jodi Zitofsky (Jodi), the seventeen year old operator who allegedly drove through a red light causing a collision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Zee\u2019s, a business owned by Jodi\u2019s parents, owned the automobile Jodi was driving at the time of the accident, a Mercury Sable station wagon (Mercury). Because Jodi was a minor at the time of the accident, the complaints in the underlying actions also named Jodi\u2019s parents as defendants and alleged negligent supervision and entrustment. The claims against the defendants in the underlying actions were settled by Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. (Aetna) for an aggregate amount of $1,215,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Aetna provided business automobile liability coverage for the automobile owned by Zee\u2019s through two business automobile liability policies, each with a $500,000 limit of liability. Both policies covered the same automobile driven by Jodi. One policy was purchased by Zee\u2019s, which is a franchisee of Wicks \u2019n Sticks (Wicks). The second policy, purchased by Wicks, contained a special endorsement providing coverage \u2014 as additional named insureds \u2014 to Wicks\u2019s 133 franchisees, including Zee\u2019s. The total premium for the policy owned by Zee\u2019s was $1,707. The total premium for the policy owned by Wicks was $16,328.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Thus, two policies, each with a limit of $500,000, and each covering the Mercury driven by Jodi, had been issued by Aetna in exchange for the payment of a premium by two legally distinct entities having separate interests \u2014 Zee\u2019s interest being that of the owner of the Mercury, and Wicks\u2019s interest being that of a franchisor of 133 businesses owning automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">This case also involves excess liability insurance provided by Aetna to Zee\u2019s in the amount of $1,000,000 and by RLI Insurance Company (RLI) to Jodi\u2019s father<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the amount of $1,000,000. Finally, the case involves a primary homeowners\u2019 policy issued by The Home Insurance Company (Home) to Jodi\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Aetna filed a declaratory judgment action in the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Court seeking a declaration that the aggregate coverage available under Aetna\u2019s two automobile liability policies is limited to $500,000. In addition, Aetna sought a declaration that the limits of RLI\u2019s personal liability excess policy must be exhausted before any contribution is required of Aetna under its excess liability policy. Finally, Aetna sought the recovery of defense costs from Home under its homeowners\u2019 policy for accident-related claims based on negligent supervision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The judge entered an order on cross motions for summary judgment declaring that Aetna was required to pay the aggregate total of insurance available under both business automobile liability policies (i.e., $1,000,000). He also ruled that Aetna and RLI, as excess insurers, were required to share equally the excess settlement amount. Finally, as no settlement amount was attributable to the claims arising out of negligent supervision of the minor driver, the judge held that Home was not liable for any costs of defending the actions. RLI and Aetna both appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">1. <em>Aetna\u2019s coverage limit. </em>The first question is whether Aetna\u2019s liability under the automobile liability policies issued to Zee\u2019s and Wicks is limited to $500,000, that being its maximum liability under either policy. In support of its argument that its liability is limited to $500,000, Aetna relies on a condition contained in both policies which states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201c8. TWO OR MORE COVERAGE FORMS OR POLICIES ISSUED BY US</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\u201cIf this Coverage Form <em>and </em>any other Coverage Form or policy <em>issued to you </em>by us or any company affiliated with us apply to the <em>same \u2018accident\u2019 </em>the aggregate maximum Limit of Insurance under all the Coverage Forms or policies <em>shall not exceed the highest applicable Limit of Insurance under any one Coverage Form or policy. </em>This condition does not apply to any Coverage Form or policy issued by us or an affiliated company specifically to apply as excess insurance over this Cov\u00e9rage Form.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Aetna construes the phrase in condition 8 \u2014 \u201cissued to you\u201d \u2014 to mean that where Aetna has <em>\u201cissued </em>more than one policy to a <em>named insured, </em>the aggregate limit of liability under all policies shall not exceed the highest applicable limit under any one policy\u201d (emphasis added). In the case at hand, Zee\u2019s is a named insured under both automobile policies. Since each, of the two policies contains a policy limit of $500,000, the argument continues, the highest applicable limit under any one policy is $500,000, and therefore the aggregate limit of liability under both policies may not exceed $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The argument is seriously flawed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Aetna did not \u201cissue\u201d more than one policy to Zee\u2019s; Aetna \u201cissued\u201d one policy to Zee\u2019s and one policy to Wicks.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The person or entity to whom or which a policy is \u201cissued\u201d (i.e., the purchaser) is commonly, as here, a named insured, but each and every named insured \u2014 there are 133 named insureds in the Wicks policy \u2014 is neither the purchaser nor the entity to which the policy was \u201cissued.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Sunrise Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bacon, Wilson, Ratner, Cohen, Salvage, Fialky &amp; Fitzgerald, P.C., </em>425 Mass. 63, 64-65 (1997) (policy \u201cissued\u201d to the professional corporation; the \u201cinsureds\u201d under the policy included the professional corporation and any lawyers who were stockholders or members of the professional corporation).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">That Zee\u2019s was a named insured under both policies (the linchpin of Aetna\u2019s argument) is true but, as to these circumstances, inconsequential. There is no language in condition 8 which calls for merging two policies issued to different entities merely because the two entities have a named insured in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Quite to the contrary, condition 8, properly construed, applies when Aetna (including any affiliate of Aetna) has issued more than one automobile liability policy to a <em>single owner, </em>and an automobile covered under more than one policy issued to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>single owner was involved in the \u201csame [i.e., single] accident.\u201d The policy gives notice to the owner that, in such event, the limit of Aetna\u2019s liability is the highest limit available under any one policy issued to it. In this fashion, Aetna has effectively brought to the attention of the owner not to buy or pay for double coverage for a single risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We are reinforced in these conclusions by the fact that Zee\u2019s, as the owner of the vehicle involved in the accident, paid $1,707 to protect its ownership interests, and Wicks paid $16,328 to protect its separate interest as a franchisor of businesses whose continued financial stability is in the interest of Wicks. That the vehicle owned by Zee\u2019s is covered under two separate policies issued by Aetna to separate owners is merely a coincidence from the point of view of the two policy owners; Zee\u2019s and Wicks were each insuring their separate interests. Combining the two policies to yield the single coverage of $500,000, as Aetna proposes, would permit Aetna, without notice to the policy owners, to avoid covering one of the two risks it insured and thus to obtain a windfall of one of the two premiums paid to it. Compare <em>Carlino </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>74 N.Y.2d 350, 357 (1989) (where two available policies contained a provision substantially the same as condition 8, the court held that both policies were collectible; the insurer\u2019s \u201cconstruction of the policy [to limit its liability to a single policy] \u2014 which no insured could have envisioned, least of all one paying a full premium for a separate policy \u2014 should not be given effect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">If Aetna\u2019s underwriting choice is not to issue multiple policies to multiple owners covering the same vehicles \u2014 as can commonly occur in the event of franchise relationships \u2014 then Aetna, as the common insurer, is uniquely in a position to be aware of the duplicate coverage, and to avoid the undesired result. Without an appropriate condition or notice in the policy expressly defeating the undesired coverage, Aetna cannot shift to the policy owners the burden of discovering duplicate coverage by different entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Aetna\u2019s reliance on authority from other jurisdictions which limits stacking of either uninsured-underinsured motorist benefits or liability policies is misplaced. See <em>Shelter Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>852 P.2d 459 (Colo. 1993); <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>331 Pa. Super. 387 (1984). These cases are not persuasive because the stacking of automobile insurance policies in Massachusetts is controlled by statute, G. L. c. 175, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u00a7 113L. It is the statute which prevents the stacking of uninsured-underinsured motorist benefits. See, e.g., <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>408 Mass. 70, 76 n.7 (1990). There is no similar statutory provision which prevents stacking of two business automobile liability policies which apply to the same automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Finally, the result we reach is consistent with the provisions of another condition in both policies. Condition 5.d provides that when there are two primary policies, as here, the insurer\u2019s share under each policy is the proportion that the limit of insurance provided by each policy ($500,000) bears to the total of the limits of all such policies ($1,000,000). Thus, each of the two primary policies (i.e., the policies Aetna issued to Zee\u2019s and to Wicks) must contribute $500,000 (one-half of $1,000,000), a total of $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">2. <em>Excess liability policies. </em>There are two excess liability policies that the judge ruled applied to the underlying actions: the Aetna commercial excess liability umbrella insurance policy issued to Zee\u2019s and the RLI personal umbrella liability policy which provided excess coverage to Bernard Zitofsky and his relatives, a term defined in the policy to include Jodi.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Each policy contains language that Aetna and RLI each argues limits its contractual obligation to excess coverage over other collectible insurance. We agree with the judge that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses of the two policies, while differently worded, are substantively identical,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and therefore, as the judge ruled, mutually repugnant. Since Aetna and RLI are each an excess insurer in the same degree, both insurers must pay the excess settlement ($215,000) in equal shares up to the limit of liability, as the judge ordered. \u201cWhere policies each contain excess or escape clauses, they are declared mutually repugnant, and each insurer is required to contribute to the loss, for to give effect to both clauses would result in no coverage for the insured.\u201d <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>401 Mass. 492, 496 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>n.4 (1988). Further, each insurer is required \u201cto contribute equally until the policy with the lower limit is exhausted. Any remaining amounts due would be paid by the remaining insurer until its policy limit is also exhausted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">3. <em>Costs of defense. </em>Aetna, which advanced the costs of defense, looks to Home and its homeowners\u2019 policy for reimbursement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is not disputed that Jodi\u2019s parents neither owned nor operated the motor vehicle involved in the collision, and thus the motor vehicle exclusion in the Home policy does not apply to <em>preclude </em>their claims for coverage regarding claims brought \u201cbecause of bodily injury or property damage . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">As to whether the Home policy provides the coverage which Aetna seeks to reach, we look first to Home\u2019s duty to defend under its policy. Certain principles are settled. An insurer\u2019s \u201cduty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify. An insurer must indemnify its insured when a judgment within the policy coverage is rendered against that insured .... The obligation of an insurer to defend is not, and cannot be, determined by reference to the facts proven at trial. Rather, the duty to defend is based on the facts alleged in the complaint.... The question then becomes whether the allegations of the complaint \u2018state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>406 Mass. 7, 10-11 (1989) (citation omitted). <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Paragraph 13 of the complaint in the declaratory judgment action alleges that the injuries suffered by the plaintiffs in the underlying action \u201cwere proximately caused by the negligence of . . . [Jodi\u2019s parents] in the supervision of their daughter, Jodi . . . .\u201d The \u201cmanifest design of homeowners\u2019 insurance is to protect homeowners from risks associated with the home and activities related to the home.\u201d <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Marnell, </em>398 Mass. 240, 245 (1986). Thus, in <em>Marnell, </em>a case involving the claim of negligent supervision by the parents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the operator of a motor vehicle in the underlying action, the court held that there was coverage because the complaint contained specific allegations that the negligent failure of the parents to prevent their son from drinking and driving were \u201calleged to have taken place within the . . . home [of the parents].\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">There are no such allegations in this complaint and none which, even if liberally read, suggest that the alleged negligent supervision related to the home of Jodi\u2019s parents. We conclude that Home did not fail in its duty to defend Jodi\u2019s parents, and therefore Aetna was not entitled to any contribution from Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Jodi, Zee\u2019s, Jodi\u2019s parents, and the plaintiffs in the underlying actions were all named as defendants in the declaratory judgment action. They do not participate in the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b251-10\">The RLI policy defines its insured to include Jodi.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Traveler\u2019s Insurance Company provided personal automobile liability insurance to Jodi\u2019s parents. Although originally part of the suit, the Superior Court granted summary judgment to Traveler\u2019s. That portion of the judgment was not appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\">We reach the same result as the judge, but for different reasons. See <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>413 Mass. 730, 734 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\">It is true that the word \u201cyou\u201d is defined in the policy to mean all named insureds, but the critical word in condition 8 is \u201cissued,\u201d not \u201cyou.\u201d In the context of the phrase, \u201cissued to you,\u201d the meaning of the word \u201cyou\u201d is the person or entity to whom the policy is \u201cissued\u201d whether or not that person or entity is a named insured. But if the word \u201cyou,\u201d in the context just stated, is ambiguous, the meaning must be resolved against Aetna, the party responsible for writing the contract of insurance. See <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>NP Corp., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 612 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The Aetna policy provides: \u201cOTHER INSURANCE. This insurance is excess over any other valid and collectible insurance whether such other insurance is stated to be primary, contributing, excess, contingent, <em>or otherwise\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The RLI policy provides: \u201cOther insurance. There may be other collectible insurance, other than the Basic Policies, covering a claim which is also covered by this policy. If this occurs, the other insurance will pay first and this policy will be in excess of the other insurance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Aetna makes this claim based on a theory of \u201cequitable subrogation,\u201d but cites no relevant case in support of that theory. See <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>The Travelers Indent. Co., </em>414 Mass. 747, 762 n.19 (1993) (\u201cAn obligation to indemnify does not automatically follow from the existence of a duty to defend\u201d). Nevertheless, because of the result we reach, we will assume that the theory is available to Aetna.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
