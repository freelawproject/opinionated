We reverse and order the entry of a judgment requiring the return to the buyers of their $17,750 deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The law\u2019s abhorrence of contractual penalties engenders no greater controversy than when it affects the enforcement of liquidated damages clauses contained in real estate purchase and sale agreements. A slim majority of jurisdictions, see Appendix, appears to favor a \u201csingle look\u201d approach, which tests the validity of such a clause only as of the time of contract. That view gives pragmatic deference to the bargain struck by the parties and, in the words of Justice Holmes, cautions courts \u201cso far as precedent permits ... to enforce contracts according to their plain meaning and not to undertake to be wiser than the parties.\u201d <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Stacy, </em>175 Mass. 595, 597 (1900). Competing with that approach in an almost equal number of jurisdictions, see Appendix, is the view espoused by this court, that requires in some circumstances a \u201csecond look\u201d as of the time of the breach to determine if the sum stipulated as liquidated damages is \u201cunreasonably and grossly disproportionate to the real damages from a breach, or is unconscionably excessive.\u201d <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Grinspoon, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 596, 603 (1989). As briefed, this case primarily raises questions as to the methodology for taking a \u201csecond look\u201d and only incidentally as to the propriety of such an approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The pertinent undisputed facts are as follows. On March 18, 1994, the buyers signed an offer to purchase residential property in Worcester for $355,000 which soon thereafter was accepted by the sellers. By the first week of May, 1994, the parties entered into a purchase and sale agreement. The agreement acknowledged the deposit of $17,750 against a purchase price of $355,000 and provided for a closing \u201con or before\u2019-\u2019 September 1, 1994. One of its clauses stated: \u201cIf the Buyer shall fail to fulfill the Buyer\u2019s agreements herein, all deposits made hereunder by the Buyer shall be retained by the Seller as liquidated damages.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By letter dated August 9, 1994, an attorney for the buyers authorized the sellers \u201cto market the subject property for sale at this time.\u201d The letter also stated, \u201cif no purchaser is found by September 1 and the [buyers] have procured a purchaser for their home . . . they would still close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>as agreed.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no contention that the buyers were ready to purchase on September 1, 1994. On August 24, 1994, the sellers accepted an offer from a third party to buy the property for $360,000. The accepted offer states: \u201cThis agreement is contingent upon the Kellys not performing after which the seller [the Marxes] will be able to convey to offerer.\u201d Following the execution of a purchase and sale agreement on September 8, 1994, reciting a deposit of $18,000, the property was conveyed to the third party on September 20, 1994, for the recited consideration of $360,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">In <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Grinspoon, supra, </em>this court determined that a liquidated damages provision in a real estate purchase and sale agreement is subject to two alternative tests. \u201c[T]he judge should first determine whether the actual damages to the [sellers] are difficult to ascertain. If they are, in view of the reasonableness of the forecast of those damages, the liquidated damages provision should be enforced. If not, he should consider whether [the amount designated as liquidated damages] is so \u2018unreasonably and grossly disproportionate\u2019 to, or is \u2018unconscionably excessive\u2019 of, the actual damages caused by the breach so as to make the liquidated damages a penalty. Finally, if the judge determines that the liquidated damages provision is unenforceable, and that the [sellers\u2019] losses exceed the difference between the contract price and the saleable value of the property at the time of breach, he should award to the defendants the amount of the actual damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605 (citation omitted). This formulation relied heavily upon the analysis of a liquidated damages provision in <em>A-Z Servicenter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Segall, </em>334 Mass. 672, 675 (1956), a case involving an acceleration clause in a promissory note. Our court also found support in Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 356, comment b and il<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>lustration 4 (1981),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and adopted a rule which we opined was \u201cconsistent with compensatory damages principles, gives continued recognition ... to the validity of fair and freely bargained for liquidated damages provisions, preserves the power of the court to grant equitable relief on retrospective consideration, and provides a fixed and final point at which to measure damages.\u201d <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Grinspoon, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 604. The court also noted the decision in <em>Colonial at Lynnfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sloan, </em>870 F.2d 761, 765 (1st Cir. 1989), released four months earlier, where it was stated that the conclusion that a \u201cliquidated damages provision was a reasonable <em>estimate </em>of difficult-to-ascertain damage at the time the parties agreed to it . . . does not end our inquiry .... Massachusetts law clearly envisions a retrospective appraisal of a liquidated damages provision in certain circumstances. If the actual damages turn out to be \u2018easily ascertainable,\u2019 a court must consider whether the stipulated sum is \u2018unreasonably and grossly disproportionate to the real damages from a breach,\u2019 \u201d quoting from <em>A-Z Servicenter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Segall, supra </em>at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The \u201csecond look\u201d approach enunciated in <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Grin-spoon </em>is not lacking for critics, especially in the context of real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>estate agreements<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> where there is substantial economic purpose in permitting the parties to avoid litigation and to be secure in their determination of the monetary risk and compensation in the event of a default by the buyer. It is arguable that such considerations may well call for legislative remediation or for a departure from <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Grinspoon, </em>as advocated by the dissent. We believe, however, that the unusual circumstances with which we are confronted militate against any retreat from precedent in this action. We have here precisely the case envisioned by our court in an opinion strongly affirming the role of a liquidated damages provision as \u201ca well established solution to the problems of expense and uncertainty in litigating the precise damages\u201d caused by a breach of a real estate agreement, while, at the same time, acknowledging the possible exception to enforcement which might exist when \u201cthe house sold within days of the first buyer\u2019s default, at about the same price, and without complicating factors which make the actual damages difficult to calculate with precision.\u201d <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Andrew, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 623, 628 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Were our inquiry limited to the circumstances obtaining at the time the parties entered into their agreement, we would permit the sellers to retain the deposit, amounting to five percent of the purchase price. Not only were the potential damages from a breach by the buyers, possibly occurring up to four months later, difficult to predict at the time of contracting, but the amount of the deposit (five percent of the purchase price) was within the ordinary range for a real estate purchase and sale agreement. See <em>Schrenko </em>v. <em>Regnante, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 282, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>284 (1989) (recognizing a 4.4 percent liquidated damages clause as \u201croutine\u201d and reasonable); 1 Residential Real Estate Basics at 7 (MCLE 1996) (indicating that buyers often negotiate a five percent deposit); Mendler, Massachusetts Conveyancers\u2019 Handbook \u00a7 1:17 (3d ed. 1984) (recommending that sellers obtain a ten percent deposit). As found by the judge, the clause, viewed at, the time of its acceptance, \u201cwas objectively fair to both parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Under the Massachusetts approach, however, the inquiry must be further informed by a retrospective view taken \u201cas of the time of the breach.\u201d <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Grinspoon, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 604. The judge undertook such a \u201csecond look,\u201d inferentially acknowledging that it encompasses the circumstances which follow the breach and includes expenses such as additional mortgage service costs, taxes, and legal fees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He concluded that damages were \u201cnot difficult to ascertain\u201d because there was \u201cno evidence that the [sellers] incurred any actual damages.\u201d That conclusion appears to derive from the fact that the sellers, in their discovery responses and summary judgment submissions, did not attach a monetary figure to their claimed and quantifiable damages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the context of the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment and the sellers\u2019 concession that there was no dispute of material fact, the failure to quantify these readily ascertainable damages supports the judge\u2019s conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>sion that there is no proof of actual damages. In any event, even if the sellers had attached dollar amounts to their claims, the brevity of the period between the breach and the subsequent sale, coupled with the absence of evidence of a complicating factor such as a lost opportunity to the sellers to purchase substitute housing during that period, see <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Andrew, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 627, support the conclusion that damages are easily ascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">It is when we turn, as did the judge, to the final question under the \u201csecond look\u201d formulation, that we differ with him. He concluded that \u201c[ajlthough there is no indication of any actual damages to the [sellers], their retention of the [buyers\u2019] $17,750 deposit is, nevertheless, neither unreasonable nor excessive under the circumstances of the breach, the overall value of the contract, and the customary nature of this type of a deposit.\u201d Our disagreement with the judge is bottomed on more than a difference of opinion with respect to a concededly imprecise and subjective standard. It is based in significant part on evidence of the agreement to purchase and the actual sale, both occurring within days of the breach and indicating that the market value of the property may well have increased while under contract to the buyers. See <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Grinspoon, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 604-605. That proof of value, when considered with the sellers\u2019 significant failure to quantify their damages after ample opportunity to do so, leads us to conclude that the sellers suffered no net loss due to the breach and, in fact, may have gained financially as a result. In essence, there are no damages to liquidate. These limited circumstances make this the \u201cextreme case\u201d of \u201cno loss\u201d described in comment b of \u00a7 356 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, and dictate that the clause establishing liquidated damages at $17,750 be treated as a penalty. To do otherwise is to ignore the principle that \u201c[liquidated damages must compensate for loss rather than punish for breach.\u201d <em>Space Master Intl., Inc. </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>940 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The judgment is reversed and a judgment shall enter for the plaintiff buyers requiring the return of their deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">Although differing language and context of the decisions make precise categorization difficult, our survey indicates the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>1. Twenty-two courts appear to apply the \u201csingle look\u201d approach by limiting evaluation of the reasonableness of a liquidated damages provision to the time of contract formation: <em>Barnette </em>v. <em>Sayers, </em>289 F. 567, 570 (D.C.

The issue seems to be controlled by statutes in three jurisdictions: <em>Weber, Lipshie &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>52 Cal. App. 4th 645, 654 (1997) (California Civil Code \u00a7 1671[b] [West 1985] states that \u201ca provision in a contract liquidating the damages for the breach of the contract is valid unless the party seeking to invalidate the provision establishes that the provision was unreasonable under the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made\u201d); <em>Philippi </em>v. <em>Viguerie, </em>606 So. 2d 577, 579 (La. Ct.

(No. 2) 12, 13, 15 (1990) (arguing the \u201csecond look\u201d approach invites litigation and was arrived at in <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Grinspoon, </em>at least in part, by reliance on a \u201cgrammatical ambiguity\u201d in <em>A-Z Servicenter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Segall, supra, </em>and \u201ca somewhat obscure Restatement illustration\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b862-6\">While theoretically defensible, the alternative approach \u2014 confinement of the second look to the period preceding the precise moment of breach \u2014 often will reveal no loss and lead to the conclusion that because there were no damages, they are easily ascertainable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\">In an affidavit filed below, the sellers, without ascribing a dollar amount, describe their damages as consisting of \u201c[tjwenty days of property maintenance expenses including mortgage principal and interest, real estate taxes, homeowners insurance, gas and electric, water/sewer, telephone, security system monitoring, pest control and lawn maintenance.\u201d They also state they suffered a \u201cconsiderable loss in legal fees\u201d and a loss of rental income with respect to a rental apartment on the subject property that they claim they did not lease out due to the buyers\u2019 indication that they would take it off the market. They do not rely on an attachment to the purchase and sale agreement indicating that the monthly rent produced by this apartment is between $650 and $700. In any event, there is no indication of associated expenses. In response to a request for \u201c[a]ll documents evidencing any financial loss,\u201d the sellers promised to provide them. There is no indication that they did. It is also noteworthy that the sellers were not obliged to pay a broker\u2019s fee under the first purchase and sale agreement until they \u201creceived] all purchase proceeds.\u201d Accordingly, the sellers make no claim for additional broker\u2019s expenses based on the buyers\u2019 breach.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b865-6\">Spina, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqO\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent. The parties, in the liquidated damages clause, bargained for peace of mind and certainty of result. There was, as the majority observes, nothing facially unjust about the terms of that clause: the five percent deposit was typical, and the parties, represented by counsel, are somewhat sophisticated. The buyers did not negotiate a \u201csecond look\u201d; and the sellers did not negotiate an option to seek actual damages. The parties instead agreed upon the simplest form of liquidated damages clause, negotiating a clear break in the event of a default.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Our \u201csecond look\u201d reveals nothing that the parties had not contemplated. The facts settled at one end of the spectrum: the seller had no damages. They could have settled at. the opposite end: the bottom could have fallen out of the market and the seller\u2019s losses could have been far greater than five per cent. We have, by our decision, permitted one party to reopen and rewrite an otherwise rational and commendable pact.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">The \u201csecond look\u201d approach first appeared in <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Grinspoon, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 596 (1989), a decision that claims direct lineage under <em>A-Z Servicenter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Segall, </em>334 Mass. 672 (1956). However, it is not clear whether that case anticipated any progeny. A-Z <em>Servicenter </em>applied traditional analysis to a liquidated damages clause in a note secured by a mortgage. That note provided that the entire sum due under the note (including unearned interest), less payments made, would be \u201cimmediately due and payable as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673. Noting that unearned interest under a note was not a measure of contract damages, the court there held that its inclusion in liquidated damages \u201cbears no rational relation to the balance remaining unpaid on the note . . . [and therefore] constituted a penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676. \u201cWhen a note is given for a fixed sum representing principal and interest for the period of the note, the clause accelerating the maturity of the debt will not be enforced as to future interest. . . . To al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>low a charge for unearned interest in the attending circumstances would be unconscionable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Unlike <em>A-Z Servicenter, </em>there is nothing facially unconscionable or smacking of a penalty in the instant case. This is a case \u201cwhere the sum agreed upon by the parties at the time of the execution of the contract represents a reasonable estimate of the actual damages,\u201d which were otherwise difficult to ascertain at the time. <em>Id. </em>at 675. The liquidated damages clause here was eminently suitable for the circumstances, and should be enforced as written, and as intended.. I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
