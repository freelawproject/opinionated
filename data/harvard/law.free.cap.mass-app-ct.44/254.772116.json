On June 29, 1996, State Trooper Jaworek, alone in a marked cruiser, observed a motorcycle speeding at over eighty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>miles an hour in a sixty-five mile per hour zone. He signalled the driver (defendant) to pull over. When the defendant did so, the trooper noticed that the defendant was wearing a jacket with the words \u201cHells Angels\u201d on the back. The trooper had had extensive experience with motorcycle groups, including the Hells Angels, and had made numerous arrests involving such groups for motor vehicle violations, violent crimes, and drugs and weapons charges. Ninety percent of the members of the Hells Angels whom he had stopped had convictions for crimes of violence. Moreover, a feud between the Hells Angels and the \u201cOutlaws\u201d (a rival motorcycle club) had been going on since 1994 and, to the trooper\u2019s knowledge, was still ongoing and involved violent confrontations, usually with weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The judge specifically found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">\u201cAs the trooper approached the motorcycle, the defendant remained seated. The trooper asked for the defendant\u2019s license and registration. The defendant was cooperative and produced a valid Connecticut license. The defendant proceeded to look for his registration and was having difficulty finding it.<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> The defendant was moving his body in order to look for his registration somewhere in or on his motorcycle.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> The trooper feared for his safety because of his knowledge about the Hells Angels. He stopped the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>defendant from looking any further for his registration. He asked him to get off his motorcycle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The trooper then conducted a pat-frisk of the defendant\u2019s jacket and felt the outline of a gun. When asked if he had a Massachusetts license to carry a firearm, the defendant replied he only had a Connecticut license. The trooper removed a .22 caliber pistol from the defendant\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The judge concluded his findings with the statement, \u201cThe Trooper\u2019s fear was based solely on the Hells Angels regalia the defendant was wearing and his knowledge of this group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We assume for purposes of this opinion that even where, as here, there was a legitimate stop and a justified order to leave the motorcycle, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 212 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vazquez, </em>426 Mass. 99, 103 (1997), an officer is not entitled to conduct a <em>Terry</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>search merely because the defendant belongs to a group which is not outlawed. This does not mean, however, that the officer could not take his knowledge of the group and of the ongoing feud into account as part of \u201cthe totality of the circumstances \u2014 the whole picture.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 545 (1991), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The judge specifically found that the defendant was having difficulty finding his registration and was moving around looking for it. \u201cInability to produce a license or a registration reasonably gives rise to a suspicion of other offenses, such as automobile [or motorcycle] theft, and <em>justifies heightened precautions for the officers\u2019 own safety\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lantigua, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 528 (1995). In such circumstances, a pat search for weapons is appropriate. <em>Ibid. </em>As pointed out in <em>Lantigua, </em>\u201cCourts cannot be oblivious to the recent escalation in the numbers of incidents reported wherein police officers have been killed or wounded while performing routine traffic functions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528-529. Here, the defendant\u2019s difficulty in producing his registration, together with his belonging to a group which was then involved in a violent feud with another group, were sufficient to permit the frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">This is not a simple case of the search of a member of the Hells Angels. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wing Ng, </em>420 Mass. 236, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>241 (1995). The trooper acted properly in stopping a speeding motorcyclist. The inference that something was amiss was reasonable when the defendant could not produce his registration. The person stopped was a member of a group which was then engaged in a violent feud. In these circumstances, the trooper, who was alone, was entitled to be concerned for his safety. His concern was reasonable and based on specific and articulable facts. The judge\u2019s ultimate finding, that the trooper\u2019s fear \u201cwas based solely on the Hells Angels regalia the defendant was wearing and his knowledge of this group,\u201d was not consistent with his other findings or with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lantigua, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to suppress reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\">1The record does not indicate whether the registration was ultimately produced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[2]\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\">2The officer\u2019s testimony, in so far as relevant, when asked what he did when the defendant was unable to produce a registration, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">A. \u201cWell he was attempting to locate it and with all the movement and looking around he was doing I didn\u2019t feel comfortable so I asked him to step off the bike.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">Q. \u201cOkay.
