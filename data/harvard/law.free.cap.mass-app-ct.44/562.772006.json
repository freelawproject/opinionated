The defendant appealed, his principal claim being the judge\u2019s denial of his motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">In his motion in limine, the defendant alleged that about five minutes before the defendant shot the victim, the victim was involved in an episode with other persons that revealed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>disposition to violent and threatening behavior.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant did not know of the episode when he shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion. He ruled that he would admit \u201cany evidence concerning the victim\u2019s character as a . . . violent person, if known to the defendant. . . [and] any threats made [by the victim] concerning this defendant, whether he knew of them or did not know of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Because the defendant received the benefit of an instruction on self-defense,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we look only to the question whether the judge\u2019s evidentiary ruling was correct, and if not, whether the exclusion was prejudicial error such that the ruling \u201cweakened the defendant\u2019s case in some significant way.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seabrooks, </em>425 Mass. 507 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenner, </em>426 Mass. 163, 165 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 78, 83 (1997). We summarize the evidence, major features of which are not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">1. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case. </em>The defendant lived in the second-floor apartment at 18 Allerton Street, Plymouth, with his girlfriend, Janice Hall, and her cousin, Tammy Peckham. At the first-floor level, there was a front porch. As one faced the porch, the entrance to the second-floor apartment was on the right; beyond the front door was a stairway leading to the defendant\u2019s second floor apartment. There was a doorbell at the front door for the second floor apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Around 5 p.m. on June 22, 1992, and again around 6:20 p.m., the victim came to the defendant\u2019s house looking for Peckham. Shortly before 8 p.m., another visitor came to the house looking for Peckham. Both the victim and the second visitor were black men.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>At about 9 p.m., there was another knock on the defendant\u2019s door. The defendant went downstairs to the front door, as he had done earlier, and again he told the visitor, who was later identified as the victim, that Peckham was not there. A short while later, Hall heard a car drive past the defendant\u2019s house, and a voice cursing and swearing at the house.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The defendant, who had spent the evening cleaning his shotgun, and Hall went to bed about 11:30 p.m. At about 11:50 p.m. the victim drove past the house, and again there was swearing and cursing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hall testified that she heard a male voice yelling, \u201cFuck you. Fuck you, you honky motherfucker. Fuck you, you fucking asshole.\u201d According to Hall, the defendant heard the cursing, became agitated, got out of bed, and said, \u201cI\u2019m sick of this . . . I\u2019m sick of these people coming around and I\u2019m going to do something about this.\u201d He pulled his shotgun out of the closet, and walked outside, leaving the gun inside. Ten minutes later, he returned, retrieved his gun and five rounds of ammunition, and returned to the porch where he loaded the weapon. At 12:48 a.m., the defendant called the police and reported the profanity and racial slurs he had heard earlier.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He told the dispatcher he would watch for a license plate number.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">At about 1:15 a.m., the victim and his friend, Dana Lopes, returned to the defendant\u2019s house. Lopes was carrying a boom box; it was playing loudly. The hallway light was on, but the exterior light on the porch was off. According to Lopes, who was watching from the sidewalk, the victim started walking up the walkway; he was calm and walking slowly. The victim walked slowly up the steps to the porch and turned to the right. Lopes saw the defendant \u201cstand up with a shotgun.\u201d Without a word being said, according to Lopes, the defendant, holding his shotgun at waist-high level, pulled the trigger. The victim fell backwards onto the porch steps, groaned, but never said a word. When a police officer later approached the defendant, the defendant, without any preceding question or comment for the officer, volunteered the statements that he had \u201cshot him. I had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>no choice. He tried to grab the gun and I shot him.\u201d When mating these statements the defendant was \u201cemotionless, rather calm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Expert testimony established that the muzzle of the defendant\u2019s shotgun was between three inches and one foot from the victim. The victim was shot in the chest, shredding the victim\u2019s heart. He died in approximately five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Hall testified that about two weeks before this episode, the defendant said that he did not want Peckham\u2019s black friends around the house. He described them as \u201cniggers, black trash, scum bags.\u201d Peckham testified that the defendant used to say that \u201call black people are the same. They either carry knives, guns, deal or do crack. They\u2019re on welfare.\u201d Before the witness was allowed to answer, the judge had given forceful limiting instructions regarding the jury\u2019s use of these racial slurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Kathy Caruso, the defendant\u2019s next door neighbor, testified. At about 1:15 a.m. on June 23, she heard a voice say, \u201cGet the fuck out of here.\u201d A second voice responded, \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking asshole.\u201d Then she heard a gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s case. </em>The defendant testified. He corroborated the essential principal features of Hall\u2019s testimony. As to the events immediately preceding the shooting, he testified that he went to bed about 11:30 p.m. and was awoken about fifteen minutes later. Someone on the street was leaning on his horn yelling, \u201cHonky motherfucker, fucking honky, we\u2019re going to get you.\u201d He dressed, went downstairs and went out on the porch. About one-half hour later, he returned to his second-floor apartment and called the police, as described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">After the telephone call to the police, he got his shotgun and loaded it with ammunition. He felt that he had been \u201cthreatened \u2022 \u25a0 \u2022 [by] people driving] by [his] house yelling things up. He was worried that he was out there all by [himjself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">With his loaded shotgun in hand, the defendant went downstairs and then took a seat on the porch. He was \u201cjust sitting there waiting.\u201d The porch light was off so that he could see the street and any number plate. He sat there for about one-half hour. Then he heard two sets of foot steps and a whispered conversation. The footsteps were on the sidewalk, but when he did not see people passing beyond his house he became concerned. Then he heard in a half whisper, \u201cWatch this shit, we\u2019re going to wake some motherfuckers up.\u201d The defendant was \u201cscared at that point.\u201d Then he heard someone come from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>around the bushes at the front of the house and mount the stairs to the porch. The defendant did not recognize the victim to be someone he knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">When the victim got to the top of the stairs, the defendant took a couple of steps forward; his shotgun was in his hand. The defendant, scared, told the victim, \u201c[H]ey, get the fuck out of here.\u201d He yelled it as loud as he could. The victim stopped. He stared at the defendant, saw the gun, and centered his attention on the gun. Then at the climactic moment, the victim, according to the defendant, \u201clunged\u201d at the defendant with his hands outstretched. The defendant was in fear for his life \u2014 that the victim would take the gun and shoot the defendant. The defendant took a step backwards, and the victim kept coming at him. As the victim reached for the weapon, the defendant pulled the trigger, and the victim fell backwards and then face down.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The defendant asked the victim if he was \u201cOK,\u201d but he received no response. Then the defendant returned upstairs to his apartment and called the police. He told them, \u201cI just shot someone.\u201d When the police arrived, he told them, \u201cI had no choice. He was going for the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">3. <em>The excluded evidence. </em>The proffered evidence, which the judge excluded, would have established the following. Shortly before the shooting, the victim and Lopes were in a car next to a basketball court where several men were playing basketball. The victim ran onto the court and said, \u201cWho wants me?\u201d Then he struck two of the players in the face and attempted to strike a third man. Then he struck a friend of Lopes, and when Lopes remonstrated, the victim said, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll kill them all. Remember my face. I\u2019m Ceasar Monterio. I\u2019m the baddest motherfucker in town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">From there, Lopes and the victim walked directly to the house where the victim lived \u2014 a matter of about five minutes. They passed the home of a Federal police officer, who was awakened by a boom box. He heard one of the occupants yell, \u201cI\u2019m bad. I\u2019m the baddest motherfucker in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The judge excluded the evidence, presumably because the victim\u2019s statements were not explicitly directed to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>396 Mass. 733, 737 (1986) (\u201cTrial judges can control undue investigation of collateral matters, keeping in mind that the central issue is not what the victim actually did in specific instances, but rather what was in the defendant\u2019s mind when he confronted the victim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>In response, the defendant argues that the basketball incident and the shooting incident have a \u201ctemporal and schematic nexus\u201d \u2014 that the jury could reasonably conclude that the victim\u2019s violent emotions displayed at the basketball court were continually erupting that night, the last and final eruption being his assault on the defendant immediately before the shooting. Thus, the judge\u2019s ruling \u201cdenuded\u201d the defendant of evidence corroborating the defendant\u2019s claim that it was the victim who attacked the defendant, and that when assaulted by the victim, the defendant had good reason to believe his life was in danger. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>418 Mass. 1, 5 (1994). Without this evidence, the argument continues, the defendant\u2019s description of the victim\u2019s conduct \u2014 that the victim \u201clunged\u201d at the defendant\u2019s shotgun \u2014 appears inexplicable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrero, All </em>Mass. 65, 68 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We need not decide whether our common law can be extrapolated for the benefit of the defendant, for the difficulty with the defendant\u2019s argument lies elsewhere. The judge admitted evidence of cursing at the defendant\u2019s house at 9 p.m. and again at 11:50 p.m. Those curses carried an implied threat of violence \u2014 evidence of the victim\u2019s \u201cstate of mind\u201d before the shooting \u2014 and were so understood by the defendant. Sensing some measure of danger, he called the police at 12:48 a.m. \u2014 <em>before </em>the basketball episode \u2014 to report the episode. Thus, the excluded evidence was to some degree cumulative of what had preceded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">But more to the point is the fact that the basketball episode does not explain, much less justify, the defendant taking out his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>shotgun, loading it, proceeding downstairs, and taking a seat on the porch to await his presumed enemies almost an hour <em>before </em>the basketball episode and before the victim arrived on the steps to his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The point is critical because the defendant\u2019s decision to leave the safety of his apartment and proceed to the porch, loaded gun in hand, to await his enemies, was not an act of self-defense. Quite the contrary, it was an act intended deliberately to confront his enemies with superior firepower.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The law question which arises has to do with the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat before resorting to the use of deadly force. The enactment of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A, modified the common law so that henceforth there would be no obligation on the part of an occupant of a dwelling to retreat if he acts in the reasonable belief that a person unlawfully <em>in </em>his dwelling is about to inflict great bodily injury or death upon him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 651, 652 (1984). That statute is of no help to the defendant, for \u201ca tenant\u2019s dwelling cannot reasonably be said to extend beyond his own apartment and perhaps any separate areas subject to his exclusive control.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>391 Mass. 853, 862 (1984). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 920, 921 (1996). The defendant\u2019s \u201cdwelling\u201d was the second-floor apartment, and the statute is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The common law rule, without regard to \u00a7 8A, is stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>367 Mass. 508 (1975). There, the court said, \u201cthe right to use deadly force by way of self-defense is not available to one threatened until he has availed himself of all reasonable and proper means in the circumstance to avoid combat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Epsom, </em>399 Mass. 254, 258 (1987) (to raise the issue of self-defense, \u201cthere must be evidence that the defendant availed himself of all proper means to avoid physical combat before resorting to the use of deadly force\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>427 Mass. 100, 102 (1998). In short, except when \u00a7 8A is available, there is a duty to retreat \u2014 if in the circumstances that is reasonable and proper \u2014 before resorting to the use of deadly force, see <em>Gregory, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 652, and the judge so instructed the jury: \u201cThe right of self-defense does not accrue until a person has availed himself of all proper means to avoid physical conduct.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>401 Mass. 799, 808 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 632 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Putting to one side, for a moment, the obvious question whether there was any justification for the defendant to have left the safety of his apartment to lie in wait, on a darkened porch, for his presumed enemies, the defendant\u2019s line of retreat, once he was on the porch, was immediately at hand. Upon hearing the two sets of footsteps and the whispered conversation on the sidewalk in front of his house, the defendant had but to open his front door and walk up to his apartment; that front door was on the right side of the porch near where he had taken his seat. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s appearance with a loaded shotgun on the darkened porch, coupled with his decision to eschew any retreat to the safety of his apartment, were deliberate acts of defiance, not defense. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 687 (1994), where there was \u201cno feasible means of retreat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In sum, the victim\u2019s violence at the basketball court was entirely peripheral to the events that account for his killing. If there was an abuse of discretion, there most certainly was no prejudice to the defendant by the exclusion of the proffered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The defendant also makes the related argument that the judge erroneously instructed the jury that in order to use deadly force, the victim \u201cmust have actually assaulted the defendant, that is, attempted or threatened to kill or [to] do serious bodily harm to the defendant.\u201d There was no objection to this portion of the charge, and there was no error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>401 Mass. at 808 (self-defense is raised when there has been an overt act against the defendant constituting an assault or threat). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 453 (1984). It is true, as the defendant suggests, a reasonable but erroneous belief that the defendant was assaulted would entitle the defendant to a self-defense instruction. <em>Glass </em>at 808. But the defendant\u2019s argument that the denial of his motion in limine made it \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d for the defendant to show that the victim attempted to do him bodily harm is belied by the defendant\u2019s own testimony (the victim \u201clunged\u201d for the defendant\u2019s shotgun).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Finally, the defendant argues that the judge erroneously permitted the Commonwealth to show that the defendant was a racist, thereby nullifying the defendant\u2019s claim that he was attacked by the victim. The judge gave forceful limiting instructions before the evidence came in, and in his final charge to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>jury the judge again, and forcefully, instructed the jury that it was \u201cof great importance\u201d that racial remarks were not admitted to show bad character, or a propensity to commit the crime charged. It was admitted only to show a state of mind. \u201cAnd it may be that it did not show you a state of mind. That, again, is for you and you alone to decide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The defendant relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>409 Mass. 461, 469 (1991) (when the defendant\u2019s case is essentially that the victim was the aggressor, relevant evidence of the victim\u2019s state of mind may be material to the defense).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-10\">\u201cTo raise the issue [of self-defense] sufficiently, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant must permit a reasonable doubt whether the defendant (1) had reasonable ground to believe and actually did believe that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, from which he could save himself only by using deadly force, (2) had availed himself of all proper means to avoid physical combat before resorting to the use of deadly force, and (3) used no more force than was reasonably necessary in all the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, All </em>Mass. 100, 102-103 (1998). \u201cThe Commonwealth has the burden of disproving the factor of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Hall heard the words, \u201cFuck you. Fuck you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Hall recognized the car as belonging to the victim and told the defendant that she thought it was \u201cthose guys that were here earlier.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\">The tape recording of the conversation has the defendant telling the police, \u201cI\u2019m calling to inform you that twice tonight, once about fifteen minutes ago, a car\u2019s driven by my house beeping their horn and yelling out, \u2018You fucking honkies.\u2019 \u201d Later, in a second call to the police, the defendant reported that he had shot someone on his porch.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The case most likely to support the defendant\u2019s position is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>318 Mass. 587, 588-589 (1945), cited with approval in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>396 Mass. 733, 735 (1986). In <em>Rubin, supra, </em>the court pointed out that threats against the defendant are unlike the more familiar evidence of self-defense, such as the admissibility of the victim\u2019s reputation for violence, if known to the defendant. \u201cA threat is a declaration of purpose, and like other declarations of purpose is evidence that an occurrence that might be in execution of that purpose was in fact in execution thereof.\u201d On that basis, then, the jury could conclude that threats against the defendant, even if unknown to the defendant, are admissible \u201cto show that the person hurt or killed was actually attempting to carry out his threat, and that the defendant was in real danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589. In this case, it might be said, consistently with <em>Harris, supra </em>at note 1, that evidence of episodes involving violent conduct by the victim, when those episodes immediately preceded the event for which the defendant is charged, may be admissible to show that the victim was the aggressor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
