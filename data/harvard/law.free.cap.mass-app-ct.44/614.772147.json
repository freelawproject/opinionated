Among other things, the Act substantially rewrote G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, and established an exclusive arbitration procedure under the auspices of the Commissioner of Education (commissioner) for those teachers terminated for \u201cjust cause.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as amended by St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>The defendants, Marcel Marchand and Anthony Coelho (teachers), requested that the commissioner commence arbitration proceedings pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as amended by St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44, concerning their August, 1993, layoffs by the Westport school superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">On October 3, 1994, the Westport school committee (committee) filed a complaint in the Superior Court against the teachers and the commissioner seeking a declaration that the teachers could not proceed with the requested arbitration hearing under the Act because they had previously requested arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement, the arbitration hearing had been held, and the arbitrator had ruled in favor of the committee. The committee also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order requesting that the commissioner be restrained from proceeding with arbitration under the Act. A Superior Court judge allowed the restraining order and subsequent orders have kept the stay in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The parties filed a joint motion along with a statement of agreed material facts, requesting that a Superior Court judge report the case to this court for determination. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111, third par. Mass.R.Civ.P. 64, 365 Mass. 831-832 (1974) (\u201cThe court, upon request of the parties, in any case where the parties agree in writing as to all the material facts, may report the case to the Appeals Court for determination without making any decision thereon\u201d). A Superior Court judge allowed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">We summarize the facts from the parties\u2019 statement of agreed material facts. The teachers were tenured teachers<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the West-port school system. On June 8, 1993, both teachers received written notices from the committee that their teaching positions had been eliminated for the 1993-1994 school year as a result of budgetary reductions and a realignment of curriculum programs. On June 22, 1993, the committee voted to eliminate the teachers\u2019 positions and to terminate their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Later, it was brought to the committee\u2019s attention that prior to its June 22, 1993, vote, the Governor had signed the Act and that the new statute, among other things, \u201cshifted primary responsibility for hiring, disciplining, and terminating teachers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>and administrative personnel from the local school committees to school principals, subject to the supervision and direction of the local school superintendents.\u201d <em>Higher Educ. Coordinating Council </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Assn., </em>423 Mass. 23, 29 n.6 (1996). After reviewing the Act, the committee decided that in regard to the teachers, the layoff process should be started again. Therefore, on August 16, 1993, the superintendent of schools sent the teachers new layoff notices. The notices stated that the reason for the layoffs was because \u201c[tjhere has been a reorganization of our High School curriculum offerings as a result of budgetary reasons and declining enrollment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The teachers were members of the Westport Federation of Teachers, Local 1906 (union) at the time of their layoffs. Prior to the layoffs, the committee and the union had entered into a collective bargaining agreement (agreement) which remained in effect at all times relevant to this action. The agreement contained grievance and arbitration procedures which allowed teachers in the Westport system to seek final and binding arbitration in regard to the propriety of layoffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The union filed a grievance under the agreement, challenging the layoffs. The teachers\u2019 grievances were denied by the committee, and on August 27, 1993, the union, under the provisions of the agreement, filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The demand stated that the nature of the dispute was that the committee had \u201cdismissed and/or laid off [the teachers] in violation of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The AAA responded to the union\u2019s demand for arbitration; an arbitrator was agreed upon by the parties and a hearing was held regarding the validity of the layoffs of the teachers. Noting that the teachers\u2019 \u201clayoffs were occasioned by a $250,000 reduction made by the Annual Town Meeting in the School Department budget for the 1993-1994 school year,\u201d the arbitrator specifically found that \u201climited funding was the justification for the curriculum revisions which resulted in the elimination of the positions.\u201d Because both curriculum revisions and limited funding constituted grounds for layoffs under the agreement, the arbitrator ruled that the committee had not violated the agreement. Neither side appealed the arbitrator\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">After the arbitrator\u2019s decision, the teachers retained their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>attorney, and requested that the commissioner commence arbitration proceedings pursuant to the Act. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as amended by St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44. In response to the teachers\u2019 request, the commissioner sent a list of three arbitrators to the committee and the teachers; the teachers and the committee selected arbitrators for each teacher\u2019s appeal and those arbitrators set hearing dates. Thereafter, the committee filed its complaint in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The teachers raise alternate grounds to challenge the committee\u2019s claim that they are not entitled to another arbitration hearing. They argue that the arbitration procedures in the Act are unconstitutional because the procedures deny them due process and also violate art. 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (right to jury trial). Alternatively, they contend that if we hold that the arbitration procedures are constitutional, they are entitled to another arbitration hearing. The commissioner, however, argues, among other things, that the arbitration procedures for teacher dismissals set forth in the Act do not apply to the teachers because they were laid off as a result of budgetary constraints rather than dismissed for performance-based reasons. The commissioner also asserts that the Act has a transitional section, not codified in the General Laws, that states that the provisions of \u00a7 42 do not apply to employees subject to collective bargaining agreements executed, as the agreement was here, prior to the effective date of the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Upon reviewing the Act in light of the record before us, we think that it is not necessary for us to resolve the constitutional questions raised by the teachers because we agree with the commissioner that the arbitration procedures in the Act are not applicable to the teachers\u2019 dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>It is clear from the statement of agreed material facts (and from the arbitrator\u2019s decision) that the teachers were laid off for budgetary reasons caused by declining enrollment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Act, in regard to rights and procedures for dismissed teachers, makes a clear distinction between performance-based dismissals and budget-induced layoffs. It states that a teacher who has attained professional teacher status cannot be dismissed \u201cexcept for inefficiency, incompetency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher, insubordination or failure on the part of the teacher to satisfy teacher performance standards developed pursuant to [G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38] ... or other just cause.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, third par., as amended. The statute then outlines an extensive and exclusive arbitration procedure for those types of performance-based dismissals, including stating that such arbitration is held under the auspices of the commissioner. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, fourth par., as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">However, in regard to budget-induced layoffs, the Act states that \u00a7 42, as amended, \u201cshall [not] affect the right of a superintendent to lay off teachers pursuant to reductions in force or reorganization resulting from declining enrollment or other budgetary reasons.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, seventh par., as amended by St. 1993, \u00a7 71, \u00a7 44.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This sentence not only distinguishes \u201clayoffs\u201d from \u201cdismissals\u201d but also precludes the application of any provision of \u00a7 42 that would \u201caffect the right of a superintendent to lay off teachers\u201d for the specified reasons. Because the arbitrator could void the superintendent\u2019s action, the application of the statute\u2019s arbitration provisions would \u201caf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>feet the right of a superintendent to lay off teachers,\u201d and the arbitration procedures in the Act do not extend to such economic layoffs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">An additional reason for holding that the Act does not apply to the layoffs in issue here is that the agreement between the parties set out detailed procedures in regard to arbitration and the agreement was executed prior to the enactment of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In response to the report, we rule that the Act, in particular G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 44, does not apply to the teachers\u2019 layoffs. Therefore, the teachers are not entitled to an arbitration hearing in regard to their August, 1993, layoffs by the superintendent. A declaration consistent with this opinion is to be entered in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-17\">The Act contained an emergency preamble, making it effective as of June 18, 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b647-9\">General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 41, as amended by St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 43, replaced the statutory concept of \u201ctenure\u201d with that of \u201cprofessional teacher status.\u201d Here, the teachers had served in the school district for more than three years. Therefore, they had attained professional teacher status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The parties stipulated that one of the issues to be arbitrated was whether, in light of the arbitration procedures contained in the Act, the teachers\u2019 griev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>anees should be arbitrated under the grievance and arbitration procedures contained in the agreement or whether there must be arbitration under the auspices of the commissioner. The union took the position that the procedures contained in the agreement controlled because the Act\u2019s procedure only applied to situations involving termination for \u201cjust cause.\u201d The arbitrator agreed with the union.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The commissioner also argues that the teachers are judicially estopped from contending that G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as amended, applies to them where they successfully argued before the arbitrator, under the agreement, that the statute did not apply to them. Because we hold that the statute does not apply to the teachers, we do not address this portion of the commissioner\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In the statement of agreed material facts, the parties rejpeatedly and without qualification refer to the job actions at issue as \u201clayoffs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The Act did not change the decisional law in regard to layoffs under the version of G. L. c. 72, \u00a7 42, in effect prior to St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The prior version of \u00a7 42 established (1) specific standards and (2) the general right to notice and a school committee hearing for dismissals, but then specified that \u00a7 42 \u201cshall [not] affect the right of a committee to dismiss a teacher whenever an actual decrease in the number of pupils in the schools of the town renders such action advisable.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as amended through St. 1988, c. 153, \u00a7\u00a7 4-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">In 1980, the Supreme Judicial Court held that, given the quoted language, the statute\u2019s notice and hearing requirements did not apply to work force reductions occasioned by a decline in student enrollment. <em>Milne </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Manchester, </em>381 Mass. 581, 582 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">In 1982, the court extended its ruling to exempt all budget-induced layoffs from \u00a7 42\u2019s notice and hearing requirements. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>386 Mass. 197, 215-216 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">There is dictum in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Dedham, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 354, 356 n.3 (1996), suggesting that the Act\u2019s arbitration procedure is an available remedy for all teacher terminations, including economic layoffs. In that matter, we did not have the commissioner\u2019s arguments before us. Therefore, upon further consideration, we reject the language contained in the dictum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
