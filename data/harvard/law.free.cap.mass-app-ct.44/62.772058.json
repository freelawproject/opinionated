Grinkley. The frisk produced no gun but did find two prescription bottles in Grinkley\u2019s pants pocket that contained twenty-eight bags of crack cocaine. A jury convicted Grinkley of possession of a class B substance with intent to distribute (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A[o]) and related offenses. He argues on appeal that a judge erroneously denied his motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>suppress the seized cocaine because the Commonwealth failed to establish that the police stop was based upon reasonable suspicion to believe that he had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime. He also complains that the police exceeded the reasonable scope of a permissible limited search. We agree with Grinkley\u2019s challenge to the stop and reverse the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The facts on which the motion judge ruled were presented through the testimony of the sole witness at the suppression hearing, Framingham police Sergeant Kevin Slattery. At approximately 8:20 p.m. on July 13, 1995, Slattery received word from the police dispatcher</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">\u201cthat a woman, whose name was given, was calling stating that she had seen a gun down at the Mary Dennison Field, on Beaver Street. That there was a group of black youths, and Hispanic youths there. That the group of black youths were by the tennis courts, and that they had a gun. And that she thought there was going to be a fight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Several officers were sent to the area to investigate, and Slattery went independently \u201cto assist.\u201d The Mary Dennison Field is a large, public recreational facility that contains playgrounds, tennis courts, lighted basketball courts (which are \u201cquite a distance away\u201d from the tennis courts), and softball diamonds. It is a popular summer \u201changout\u201d for youths in a neighborhood that is racially and ethnically mixed but is not (at least was not so described by Slattery) a high-crime area. Slattery parked his police vehicle in a funeral home parking lot at the rear of the field opposite the Beaver Street side so as to be in a position to intercept \u201canybody [who] came running.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">As he watched from his location, he noticed a group of Hispanic youths gathered at the distant basketball courts. He also saw several officers approach a group of black youths who were by the tennis courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the officers approached, the group \u201csuddenly broke up . . . [a]nd they started walking toward the wood[s]\u201d at the edge of the field. Slattery thought that they were walking \u201cquickly\u201d but conceded that they \u201cweren\u2019t running.\u201d He heard his fellow officers begin \u201cshouting, and . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>waving the kids back to where they . . . had been.\u201d Some of the youths entered the woods but then reemerged to join the others, who had stopped and returned in response to the police shouting and waving.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Slattery then left his position in the parking lot and walked by the two groups into that part of the woods where he had seen some of the youths go, in order to determine whether they had \u201cdumped the gun\u201d there. Finding no gun, he went back to make sure things were under control and to assist the other officers in \u201cpat[ting] the group down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Only then did Slattery notice Grinkley, as he was being questioned by another officer. Slattery recalled that he had previously arrested Grinkley for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (a knife), an arrest that resulted in Grinkley\u2019s conviction. Slattery also recognized another of the youths as someone whom he had arrested, and who was subsequently convicted, for armed robbery with a handgun. Slattery heard Grinkley give the inquiring officer a name Slattery knew to be false. When Slattery challenged Grinkley\u2019s response, Grinkley persisted in his refusal to admit his real name. At that point Slattery, concerned that the reported gun had not been discovered, \u201cwent to pat him down.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Grinkley resisted the pat, pulling back twice and guarding his right pocket area with his hand, despite Slattery\u2019s order to keep his hands in the air. Pushing Grinkley\u2019s hand away, Slattery succeeded in putting his hand on the pocket and felt a hard, round, cylindrical object that he thought could be a weapon. Slattery then pulled out of the pocket two plastic, \u201corange, semi-transparent\u201d prescription bottles, one on top of the other, that contained labels for ibuprofen tablets bearing Grinkley\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">As Slattery \u201cstarted looking ... at the bottles more carefully,\u201d Grinkley denied that they were his. Slattery immediately realized that what he had found was not a weapon or a danger to the officers. Holding the bottles in front of him and spinning them around, he saw that they contained small glassine bags with a white substance in them as well as tablets. Based on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>previous experience as a narcotics investigator, Slattery recognized tins as a common form of packaging crack cocaine for street level sales and opened the bottles. Grinkley suddenly started running toward the woods but was apprehended and arrested after a struggle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Based upon Slattery\u2019s essentially uncontested testimony, the motion judge concluded that the incriminating drugs had been obtained as the result of a valid investigative stop and frisk. That conclusion did not, however, find evidentiary support in Slattery\u2019s testimony or the reasonable inferences therefrom.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge erred most critically in ruling that the informant\u2019s tip constituted a sufficient basis for reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant, in finding that Slattery had \u201ccorroborate[d] much of the informant\u2019s information\u201d at the scene,.and in finding that the stop of Grinkley was justified because Slattery recognized Grinkley and another youth.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In \u201cstop and frisk\u201d cases, the primary inquiry is whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>police officer may make the stop because he has \u201creason to suspect that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405 (1974), citing <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968). The reasonableness of the officer\u2019s suspicion depends upon the existence of \u201cspecific and articulable facts and the specific reasonable inferences which follow from such facts in light of the officer\u2019s experience. A mere \u2018hunch\u2019 is not enough. Simple good faith on the part of the officer is not enough. The test is an objective one,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 406, \u201cviewing] the circumstances as a whole.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 790 (1996).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">When police suspicion arises not from officers\u2019 own observations but from an informant\u2019s tip, as here, the Commonwealth has- the burden of establishing both the informant\u2019s reliability and the basis of her knowledge, although police corroboration may make up for deficiencies in one or both of those factors. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. 16, 19 (1990).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The motion judge determined that the tip here satisfied those requirements because it came \u201cfrom a named informant who gives a detailed description of two groups of youths at a specific location (tennis court) within a park, a specific time and the fact that one of them had a gun.\u201d The judge\u2019s conclusion that the tipster\u2019s basis of knowledge was established by her recitation of \u201cspecific details\u201d is questionable on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">It might be inferred that the tipster had, as she asserted, personally observed the matters she recounted, and that there was a need for the police to act quickly because of the perceived threat to public safety. Those inferences might justify brevity and a lesser degree of detail. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>366 Mass. 394, 399 (1974). Nevertheless, the information supplied here as to the individuals involved was neither specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>nor detailed. Other than the report of a gun (which we discuss below), the tip was merely generally descriptive of race, ethnic identity, and location in a public place normally frequented by youths \u2014 all obvious, nonincriminating facts that would be easily observable to any bystander. Such data do not bespeak the kind of \u201cinside information\u201d that provides a legitimate inference of personal knowledge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. at 20-21 &amp; n.5. Unparticularized racial descriptions, devoid of distinctive or individualized physical details \u2014 even were they of a certain person and not, as here, of an entire group \u2014 cannot by themselves provide police with adequate justification for stopping an individual member of the identified race who happens to be in the general area described by the informant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>403 Mass. 179, 181 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheek, </em>413 Mass. 492, 495-496 (1992). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 896-897 (1990) (unnamed informant\u2019s basis of personal knowledge shown by the facts that he \u201cnamed the defendant, described his appearance, gave his phone number, knew of his national origin and citizenship status, how he had obtained that status as a result of marriage to a Massachusetts native, and described the anglicization of his name, his pickup truck, and his employment situation . . . [and his use of] luxury automobiles and expensive hotels in conducting his business . . . [which] level of detail [reflected] . . . \u2018direct knowledge . . . based on personal observation and contacts which went materially beyond \u201ca casual rumor ... or [knowledge of] ... an individual\u2019s general reputation\u201d \u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 927, 928 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Nonetheless, despite the fact that what the tipster described \u201cdid not reveal any special familiarity . . . that might substitute for explicit information about the basis of the caller\u2019s knowledge,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. at 20-22, we will accept the adequacy of the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge on the authority of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>423 Mass. 266, 271 (1996) (anonymous telephone caller\u2019s statement that he or she had seen several \u201cHispanic subjects\u201d in a blue car in the driveway of 138 Jackson Street and a handgun wrapped in a towel in the vehicle permitted inference of recent firsthand observation). As in <em>Alvarado, </em>the more difficult question is whether the police had an adequate basis for concluding that the informant was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"A7t\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>As just discussed, the tip did not contain the qualitative or quantitative detail that stamps it with an important indicium of reliability. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 499, 505-506 (1996), and cases cited, <em>S.C., </em>425 Mass. 99, 103-104 (1997). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass. 483, 487 (1988). Contrast <em>United States </em>v. <em>McClinnhan, </em>660 F.2d 500 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Clipper, </em>973 F.2d 944 (D.C. Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1070 (1993); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>64 F.3d 617 (11th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1173 (1996) (tips about guns all described a certain individual with particularity as possessing the gun). The Commonwealth argues that the informant\u2019s having provided police with her name and address sufficiently bolstered her reliability. It is true that our cases have stated that when information is reported to the police by \u201ca named and identified person\u201d rather than a \u201cfaceless informer,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atchue, </em>393 Mass. 343, 347 (1984); or by an identified \u201cprivate citizen\u201d or \u201cordinary citizen,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>393 Mass. 703, 710 (1985); or by a named \u201cconcerned citizen[]\u201d calling out of civic duty, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass. at 488, \u201c[t]he strict requirements of reliability which govern an analysis of an anonymous informant\u2019s trustworthiness are relaxed . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freiburg, </em>405 Mass. 282, 297, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 940 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Nonetheless, the cases cited by the Commonwealth in support of a relaxed standard of reliability involved individuals personally known to the police, most of them past reliable informants, and not, as here, a person previously unknown to and never actually met by the police. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 110, 114-115 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 500. Furthermore, other cases holding that the reliability of a tip from a private citizen is substantially strengthened when the citizen is identified by name and address are also distinguishable from the present situation. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atchue, </em>393 Mass. at 344-349 (informant, identified by name, address, and date of birth, gave detailed description of specific stolen items and their exact location); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grzembski, </em>393 Mass. 516, 520-521 (1984) (citizen provided police with a detailed written and signed statement); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>393 Mass. at 707-710 (person informing police of criminal activity was a municipal officer identified by name and address and did so in a face-to-face encounter with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the police); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freiberg, </em>405 Mass. at 296 n.7, 298 (informant was not only named and identified but described the criminal activity and its perpetrator in great detail and personally assisted the police at the scene of the crime); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bakoian, </em>412 Mass. 295, 297, 301 (1992) (identified informant was previously known to police as a source of credible information and provided specific details to the defendants\u2019 exact identities, destination, and time of arrival); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. at 783-784, 790-791 (tip that defendant had a gun came from a bystander who spoke face-to-face with the police in a high crime area and \u201cwho could have been identified\u201d). See generally 2 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.4(a), at 219-220 (3d ed. 1996) (\u201cIt does not follow . . . that if the name of the person providing the information <em>is </em>disclosed, then he is by virtue of that fact alone properly characterized as a citizen-informer entitled to the presumption of reliability. . . .\u2019 [That] is one factor which may be weighed in determining [reliability]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Unlike those cases, the informant\u2019s stated identity here could not be verified because she did not leave a telephone number and presumably could not be contacted by the police. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melendez, </em>407 Mass. 53, 58 n.4 (1990). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass, at 898; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. at 103-104. Her inaccessibility (and resultant unaccountability for providing false information, see G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 13A) made this informant barely distinguishable from an anonymous tipster. Analogous to the concern raised in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>that \u201c[a]nyone can telephone the police for any reason,\u201d 409 Mass. at 21, is the reality that anyone can claim over the telephone to be a particular individual with impunity if that claim cannot be verified. Contrast also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 336 (1994) (individual who reported to the police that the defendant was carrying a handgun in her purse was \u201ca neighborhood person<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> known to\u201d the patrolling police officer); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>426 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Mass. 99, 100-103 (1997) (several individuals on a public street approached a police officer, independently informed him that a man brandishing a gun had been chasing another man down the street, and pointed out the alleged assailant to the officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Whatever the insufficiencies in an informant\u2019s tip, we recognize that \u201c[w]hen a tip . . . concerns the possession of a firearm, it deserves the immediate attention of law enforcement officials.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. at 790. Nonetheless, such a tip is not, standing alone, a basis for reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, because the mere possession and carrying of a gun is not a crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>407 Mass. 178, 181, 183, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 951 (1990) (police had no reason to believe defendant did not have a license to carry firearm); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>423 Mass. at 271.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Police observations in discharge of that duty of prompt investigation can provide adequate corroboration to \u201cmake up for deficiencies in\u201d the informant\u2019s reliability. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. at 19. Corroboration by police of an informant\u2019s predictions as to what the police will find, particularly predictive information regarding \u201cnonobvious details\u201d beyond those apparent to a casual bystander, is perhaps of greatest significance in justifying police inquiries in reliance on the tip. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 506-507, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Unlike the cases in which police observations confirm all or most of the nonobvious predictive details of an informant\u2019s tip, e.g., <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 313 (1959); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. at 897-900; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. at 103-104, or confirm facts communicated by a tipster that are suggestive of criminal conduct, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valdez, </em>402 Mass. 65, 71 &amp; n.4 (1988); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spano, </em>414 Mass. 178, 185 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peguero, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 912, 913-914 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Munera, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 384 (1991), here there was minimal corroboration. Slattery confirmed only one bit of the informant\u2019s message, and that an innocent fact apparent to the most uninformed passerby: a small group of black youths had congregated near the tennis courts in a public park at day\u2019s end.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Although Slattery did see a group of Hispanic youths, they were not, as predicted, near the black youths or in a position to engage them physically but rather were \u201cquite a distance away.\u201d He discerned no interaction between the two groups, much less a recent, ongoing, or threatened fight, or even apparent tension. Neither Slattery nor any of the police officers espied a gun or other weapon in the possession of the black youths. Thus, the only significant details of the tip \u2014 the observation of a gun and the apprehended imminence of a melee \u2014 proved unreliable. Nor did Slattery view any strange, furtive, or suspicious behavior on the youths\u2019 part that could infuse otherwise innocent activity with incriminating aspect in the discerning eye of an experienced police officer. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. at 900.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In short, even combined with Slattery\u2019s observations at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>scene, the tip failed to constitute an adequate basis for reasonable suspicion that the group of black youths by the tennis courts, or any one of them, had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime. The fact that as police officers approached the group started walking quickly away did not elevate the police officers\u2019 inchoate suspicion to the level of reasonableness justifying a stop and frisk, even though a firearm was reportedly involved. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>381 Mass. 642, 645-646 (1980) (defendant\u2019s concealing his face from police did not create reasonable suspicion); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. 762, 763-764 (1981) (defendant on bicycle making sudden turn after noticing marked police cruiser did not constitute basis for reasonable suspicion); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. 367, 371 (1996) (\u201cNeither evasive behavior, proximity to a crime scene, nor matching a general description is alone sufficient to support the reasonable suspicion necessary to justify a stop and frisk\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Only if other factors are present in addition to arguably evasive behavior, which \u201cin combination may allow the police to narrow the range of suspects to particular individuals,\u201d may \u00e1ttempts to avoid contact with the police be considered in the reasonable suspicion calculation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, supra, </em>and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harkess, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 626, 632 (1993). Here, there were no such additional factors. Except for their dispersal at the approach of police officers, nothing about the location, appearance, or conduct of the group of black youths gave rise to reasonable suspicion. The report from an informant of questionable reliability that one of the group of black youths had a gun did not serve to \u201cnarrow the range of suspects\u201d to any of the group, much less to Grinkley himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">More to the point, unlike the \u201cother factors\u201d which the cases just cited allow to be combined for \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d purposes with apparent efforts to avoid contact with the police, the report of a gun was not an action or condition actually observed by or known to the police. It was not another \u201cfact,\u201d contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. at 371, or even a justifiable inference from observed facts, but rather little more than a working hypothesis. Nothing in the situation or in police experience (at least as testified to) provided a reasonable basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>for the police to induce the likely existence of a gun at such a scene, or to elevate the tipster\u2019s reported but unconfirmed observation of a gun to the status of a suspicious circumstance. To hold otherwise would essentially eliminate the necessity of police corroboration of conclusory reports about guns from tipsters of dubious reliability. It would effectively make the unconfirmed rumor of a gun a self-verifying fact justifying the stop and frisk for the suspected gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The cases involving police investigation of reports of a gun or other weapon do not countenance such a conflation: they rather stress the necessity of actual police knowledge and observations, particularly in conjunction with a particular individual\u2019s suspicious behavior, in substantiating a tip of less-than-solid veracity.

The youths reacted by doing precisely what the officers had demanded, in a situation in which we are confident no reasonable person would have felt free to leave without responding to the police commands. See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. at 19 n.16; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, 446 U.S. </em>544, 553-554 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. at 763-764; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. at 788-789; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pimentel, </em>27 Mass.

Did you hear any shots?\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Prior to that police show of authority in pursuit of the youths, Slattery and his police colleagues had no reasonable suspicion, based upon specific and articulable facts, to stop Grinkley for any past, ongoing, or threatened crime. Slattery\u2019s post-stop recognition of Grinkley and one of his companions as individuals he had previously arrested for weapons crimes, his awareness that Grinkley was using an alias, and his failure to find any gun in the woods \u2014 observations that would have constituted specific and articulable facts weighing in favor of a finding of reasonable suspicion had they preceded the stop, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. at 406; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 4 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harkess, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 632 \u2014 cannot retroactively justify a stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>effected on insufficient facts and lacking reasonable suspicion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. at 764; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wren, </em>391 Mass. 705, 708 n.2 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Laughlin, </em>25 Mass.

Had it been allowed, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence against Grinkley on the drug charges would have been insufficient to support conviction, and his motion for required findings of not guilty would have succeeded. He is now entitled to the entry of such findings.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thinh Van Cao, </em>419 Mass. 383, 384, cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1146 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The judge had summarily denied the motion to suppress on the date of the hearing without making findings, oral or written. At the request of this court, written findings were prepared by the motion judge. The pertinent erroneous findings behind the judge\u2019s ruling were as follows: \u201cAs he [Slattery] approached he saw a few other officers approach the group of black youths who then ran toward the woods. He followed them and recognized the defendant and another youth as individuals previously arrested by him and convicted of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and armed robbery with a handgun, respectively. When they stopped running, he heard one of the officers ask the defendant his name, to which he responded with a name which Sgt. Slattery knew to be false. He [Slattery] challenged the defendant\u2019s response but the defendant refused to admit his true name. At this point the other officers had pat frisked the other youths and had not found any gun .... At that point he was reasonably justified in fearing for his safety . . . [and in] deciding] to pat frisk the defendant for weapons out of concern for his safety.\u201d Aside from the minor embellishments that went beyond Slattery\u2019s testimony (he conceded that the youths did not \u201crun\u201d away and never mentioned that he feared for his safety), these findings most significantly overlooked the police show of authority that effected the stop, ignored the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>that the frisks had already commenced when Slattery began interacting with Grinkley, and misstated the sequence of events, the suspicious observations having come only after the otherwise unjustified stop.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Because we conclude that the stop and threshold inquiry did not satisfy those standards, we do not reach the second part of the two-part analysis in \u201cstop and frisk\" situations: whether the scope of the frisk, or the degree of its intrusiveness, was reasonable in the circumstances.
