Pingaro filed this motion, over fifteen years after his guilty pleas, only after he pleaded guilty in 1993, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, to charges of extortion, witness tampering, obstruction of justice, and perjury (five counts), following which he received an enhanced Federal sentence based, in part, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>his 1979 State convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because no transcript of his guilty plea proceedings has survived, Pingara asserts that the Commonwealth cannot establish that he entered his 1979 pleas voluntarily and knowingly and that he should consequently receive a new trial. We affirm the denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">A Massachusetts grand jury indicted Pingara in February 1978, for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, two counts of unlawful distribution of cocaine, and unlawful possession of a handgun. The police reports and the evidence presented to the grand jury revealed that Pingara had been caught red-handed in mid-January, 1978, participating with two codefendants in the sale of four ounces of cocaine to an undercover police officer, after having been involved the previous day in the sale of one ounce of cocaine to the same officer. Pingara had also displayed to the officer a pistol that he said he used to protect drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Following Pingara\u2019s pleas of not guilty to the indictments, his case was on the trial list for ten months; his trial date was set, then continued, three times with his agreement; and, by his own acknowledgment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> his case was ultimately resolved after extensive plea negotiations by a \u201cpackage deal.\u201d The \u201cdeal\u201d resulted in guilty pleas by all three defendants and extremely favorable dispositions for Pingara and his colleagues.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At all relevant times Pingara was represented by private counsel of his own choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The docket sheets reflect that all the guilty pleas were accepted by Boston Municipal Court Judge Richard Banks, who was sitting in the Superior Court by designation, only \u201cafter hearing.\u201d The affidavits supporting Pingaro\u2019s motion for withdrawal of his guilty pleas concede that a \u201cplea hearing\u201d occurred (although he now denigrates it as \u201cextremely brief, lasting no more than five minutes\u201d). However, because Pingara <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>never requested a copy of the hearing transcript, the stenographer\u2019s notes of the hearing were lawfully destroyed after six years, in the ordinary course of business, pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 1:12, 382 Mass. 717 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Within three weeks of his guilty pleas, Pingaro filed, through his trial attorney, a motion to revise his sentences on the distribution counts, .on the ground that his codefendant, who was the actual supplier of the drugs in the first transaction, was more culpable, yet had received a lesser sentence on his guilty plea than had Pingaro, a mere \u201cliaison\u201d between seller and buyer with a less extensive criminal record. In May, 1979, Judge Banks reduced Pingaro\u2019s sentences to one year to be served, the balance suspended and three years of probation. Judge Banks subsequently died. In November, 1982 (while the stenographer\u2019s notes of his plea hearing were still intact), Pingaro, having served his sentence and completed his probation without incident, successfully petitioned a different judge to seal his criminal record because of a job opportunity. His next court experience came eleven years later, in connection with the Federal charges discussed earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Pingaro\u2019s October, 1994, \u201cmotion for withdrawal of guilty plea and allowance of a new trial\u201d was supported solely by his own affidavit. It alleged that Judge Banks had failed in March, 1979, to provide Pingaro with any colloquy whatsoever, and specifically recited that the judge had failed (a) to inform him of the several constitutional rights he would be waiving by pleading guilty; (b) to inquire whether he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol or otherwise incapable of making a knowing and intelligent decision to change his plea; (c) to inform him of the essential elements of the crimes to which he was pleading guilty; or (d) to determine whether Pingaro had received adequate and effective assistance of counsel. Pingaro also claimed that there was no evidence presented at the plea hearing linking him to those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">On April 10, 1995, the Commonwealth filed its opposition to Pingaro\u2019s motion, stressing that Pingaro\u2019s affidavit was not credible; that Pingaro had not contended that he was in fact unaware of the rights he waived when he pleaded guilty or was in fact then under any improper or disabling influence; and that Pingaro had failed to make any specific claim of ineffectiveness of counsel. The Commonwealth maintained that, under the circumstances, Pingaro\u2019s bald assertions were not sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>place the burden on the Commonwealth of establishing that Pingaro\u2019s presumptively regular guilty pleas had been constitutionally valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">On April 11, 1995, one day after the Commonwealth\u2019s opposition, Pingaro filed and served an affidavit from his cousin, Peter M\u00f3dica (who was also his trial attorney\u2019s cousin), in which M\u00f3dica averred that he had been in the courtroom at Pingaro\u2019s \u201cextremely brief\u201d plea hearing and that Judge Banks had never advised Pingaro of any rights he was waiving by pleading guilty. Eight days after the Commonwealth\u2019s opposition, on April 18, 1995, Pingaro submitted his own \u201csupplementary affidavit.\u201d In it he asserted (without indicating why it had taken him until then to raise such issues) that his guilty pleas had been the product of his attorney\u2019s \u201cpressure\u201d to \u201cgo along\u201d with an \u201call or nothing package deal\u201d encompassing all the defendants. (Pingaro described the alleged \u201cpressure\u201d as the need to help out a codefendant whose wife was dying of cancer.) The supplementary affidavit also charged that Pingaro\u2019s attorney had a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d because he also represented one codefendant, had \u201cpreviously\u201d represented the other, and had \u201cengaged in plea negotiations\u201d on behalf of all the defendants. The attorney had also (the affidavit claimed, without any specification of how the omitted explanations would have affected Pingaro\u2019s pleas) never explained \u201cthe potential for a conflict of interest\u201d; or Pingaro\u2019s \u201cpossible options ... in defending the case\u201d; or \u201cthe possibility of seeking a severance for a separate trial\u201d; or \u201cthat [Pingaro] could have challenged the validity of the conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">On April 25, 1995, a nonevidentiary hearing on Pingaro\u2019s motion to withdraw his pleas was held, after having been continued from April 12, 1995, the originally scheduled date. The motion judge refused Pingaro\u2019s request to present live testimony from Pingaro\u2019s cousin as a purported eyewitness to the 1979 plea proceedings but did accept a \u201csupplementary affidavit\u201d from the cousin. That affidavit represented that Pingaro had \u201cno real criminal record\u201d when he pleaded guilty in 1979, at an \u201cextremely brief . . . five minute hearing\u201d; that Pingaro had been \u201cconfused and unsure of himself,\u201d had been \u201cvery reluctant\u201d to plead guilty, and was immediately \u201cupset about making the plea\u201d; and that the judge had given no explanation or advice to Pingaro at the hearing about any rights he was waiving. The affidavit contained no allegations regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>supposed shortcomings of counsel raised in Pingaro\u2019s own supplementary affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">At the hearing on the plea withdrawal motion, Pingaro\u2019s counsel presented a simple argument relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. 100 (1975): Pingaro\u2019s affidavits established his plea proceeding had been fatally inadequate, and the Commonwealth could not sustain its burden of demonstrating by a contemporaneous record that his guilty pleas had been knowing and voluntary. Counsel for the Commonwealth reiterated that Pingaro\u2019s motion and affidavits were so untimely, conclusory, and suspect as to be entitled to no credit, and that under the circumstances the Commonwealth had no burden to reconstruct the plea proceedings or otherwise justify the validity of Pingaro\u2019s guilty pleas because Pingaro\u2019s papers had failed to present a credible claim of error triggering such a burden.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The motion judge rejected the allegations in the affidavits submitted by Pingaro, whom she characterized as \u201ca convicted perjurer.\u201d The judge found Pingaro\u2019s belated claims of ineffective assistance of counsel to be \u201cdisingenuous\u201d as well as contradicted by the record, which demonstrated that Pingaro\u2019s counsel had successfully obtained \u201ca fairly light sentence\u201d for him in return for his plea, despite the fact that Pingaro \u201cwas more culpable\u201d in the drug transactions than the jointly represented codefendant who received the same sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge did not, however, address the Commonwealth\u2019s principal argument, that Pingaro had failed to carry his burden as a new trial movant of coming forward with credible factual assertions to support his challenge to the validity of his guilty pleas beyond his self-serving, conclusory affidavits. Instead, the judge ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>cepted the Commonwealth\u2019s subsidiary contention, that the contemporaneous extant record warranted the inference that Pingara\u2019s pleas were knowing and voluntary. The judge found that, though reconstruction was difficult,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the record could be reconstituted sufficiently to conclude that there was no substance to Pingare\u2019s attack on his pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The judge found particularly significant the following facts (none of which Pingara challenges): Pingara was continuously represented by counsel for over a year prior to entering his guilty pleas, during which time counsel filed various discovery motions and obtained the grand jury minutes that set forth Pingara\u2019s active participation in the drug transactions exposed by the undercover police work; Pingara had thrice agreed to a trial date over an eight-month period, which had been thrice continued with his consent; his attorney had negotiated a very favorable plea bargain; Pingara acknowledged, and the docket showed, that there had in fact been a hearing on his offer to plead guilty and that at the hearing the police reports had been read setting forth in specific detail Pingara\u2019s role in the crimes charged (which evidence the motion judge deemed sufficient to establish both a conspiracy and a joint venture to distribute cocaine as well as the firearms charge); Judge Banks was an experienced judge who sat extensively in the Superior Court and took many guilty pleas; and three weeks after the pleas Pingare initiated proceedings to revise his sentence on the cocaine distribution convictions, during the course of which he gave no hint of dissatisfaction with either his guilty pleas or his counsel and additionally made a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of his separate motion to revise or revoke with respect to the conspiracy indictment and guilty plea.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Relying particularly on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duest, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 137, 146-147 (1988) <em>(Duest I), </em>the judge concluded that \u201c[i]t is reasonable to infer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>from the evolving history of Pingaro\u2019s disposition of these cases that he made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Pingaro\u2019s appeal to this court rests entirely on the premise that the reconstructed contemporaneous guilty plea record fails to demonstrate sufficiently the knowing and voluntary nature of his guilty pleas and on his contention that the judge committed error in allowing the Commonwealth to supplement that record with material not contemporaneous with the plea (specifically, his motion to revise his distribution sentence). Such supplementation is, he claims, expressly prohibited by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. at 103, 108, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>414 Mass. 423, 431-432 (1993).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the Commonwealth, however, that Pingaro\u2019s motion was correctly denied, whether or not the judge\u2019s reconstruction of the plea record passed muster under <em>Foster </em>and its progeny.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>An attack on the validity of a guilty plea is properly made by and treated as a motion for a new trial pursuant to Mass.R. Crim.R 30(b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huot, </em>380 Mass. 403, 406 (1980). Like all such motions, it is addressed to the sound discretion of the motion judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>381 Mass. 141, 142 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fanelli, </em>412 Mass. 497, 504 (1992). The judge\u2019s disposition of the motion will not be reversed unless it is shown to be an abuse of discretion that produces a manifestly unjust result. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>384 Mass. 262, 269 (1981). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMarco, </em>387 Mass. 481, 484, 487 (1982). The judge may decide the motion solely on affidavits. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 259-260 (1981). The credibility, weight, and impact of the affidavits in support of the motion are entirely within the judge\u2019s discretion. He is not required to believe them even if they are undisputed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>370 Mass. 746, 752 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>413 Mass. 707, 716 n.9 (1992). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986) (the same deference is accorded credibility determinations even if the motion judge did not preside at trial).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In the specific context of a new trial motion based on a sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>posedly defective plea colloquy, a motion judge is not \u2014 contrary to Pingare\u2019s fundamental premise \u2014 required to afford an evidentiary hearing or impose a burden of going forward on the Commonwealth, much less grant relief, simply because the defendant files an affidavit alleging that he never received a plea colloquy and no transcript of the plea colloquy exists to gainsay him. The mere unavailability of the transcript, through no fault of the Commonwealth but rather as the result of protracted delay in a defendant\u2019s attack on his guilty plea, does not, in and of itself, rebut the normal presumption of regularity accorded the earlier proceedings; nor does it raise the inference that a guilt-pleading defendant was not advised of his constitutional rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 926 (1997). <em>Parke </em>v. <em>Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 29-31 (1992).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The relevant analysis in such situations was succinctly stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fanelli, </em>412 Mass. at 504:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">\u201cA judge may grant such a motion [as Pingara\u2019s] only \u2018if it appears that justice may not have been done\u2019 .... \u2018Judges are to \u201capply the standard set out in Mass. R.Crim.P. 30(b) [as to whether justice may not have been done] rigorously\u201d . . . and should \u201conly grant a postsentence motion to withdraw a plea if the defendant comes forward with a credible reason which outweighs the risk of prejudice to the Commonwealth. \u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McWhinney, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 444, 446 &amp; n.4 (1985) (The Commonwealth has no burden to show the sufficiency of a reconstruction of trial proceedings in the absence of stenographic notes, which had been stolen, until \u201cthe defendant has come forward with an articulable claim\u201d of reversible trial error.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">A defendant\u2019s naked claim that he did not receive a constitutionally adequate guilty plea colloquy does not automatically thrust upon the Commonwealth the burden of proving the existence of a contemporaneous record establishing that the plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily. Rather, the initial burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>is on the moving defendant to present some articulable reason which the motion judge deems a credible indicator that the presumptively proper guilty plea proceedings were constitutionally defective, above and beyond a movant\u2019s \u201ccredulity straining\u201d contentions regarding \u201cquestions the judge did <em>not </em>ask\u201d almost sixteen years earlier, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duest, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 623, 627 (1991) <em>(Duest II), </em>and reliance upon the mere nonexistence of a transcript of the plea proceedings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In light of the judge\u2019s total disbelief of Pingaro\u2019s affidavits, Pingaro failed to satisfy his burden of surmounting that initial, mandatory threshold of credibility.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The denial of his motion was accordingly correct on that basis alone, as was the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>implicit subsidiary ruling that Pingare had failed to present any substantial issue requiring an evidentiary hearing. The judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in repudiating Pingaro\u2019s factual assertions as unworthy of belief was amply supported by the relevant circumstances revealed by \u201ca survey of the whole case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>384 Mass. at 269, quoting from <em>Sharpe, petitioner, </em>322 Mass. 441, 445 (1948).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Chief among the circumstances negating the credibility of Pingaro\u2019s unlikely tale that he received no plea colloquy whatsoever were the very ones emphasized by the motion judge. Uppermost in depriving Pingara\u2019s assertions of probative force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>was his status as an admitted multiple perjurer, as well as a convicted felon on other charges involving dishonesty in judicial proceedings. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>416 Mass. 90, 93 (1993).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Reinforcing the damning inference against Pingaro\u2019s good faith and credibility was his unexplained fifteen and one-half year delay in bringing his motion, despite his necessary possession of all relevant facts from the date he entered his guilty pleas, the known applicability of the requirements of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238 (1969), in Massachusetts for over six years prior to those pleas, and Pingaro\u2019s several opportunities to raise the issue while the plea transcript was still in existence. See <em>Huot </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 91, 99-101 (1973). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>414 Mass. at 435; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 888, 888 &amp; n.1 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 21-22 (1986); <em>Duest I, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 148; <em>Duest II, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 627, 629. Cf. <em>Malone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>299 F.2d 254, 256 (6th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 863 (1963); <em>Oksanen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 F.2d 74, 79 (8th Cir. 1966); <em>LaClair </em>v. <em>United States, </em>241 F. Supp. 819, 824 (N.D. Ind. 1965) (the unexplained lapse of many years between motion and plea is a firm basis for doubting a defendant\u2019s contentions in Federal proceedings).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The police report read into the record at the plea hearing, and detailing the defendant\u2019s active role in arranging, executing, and protecting the drug transactions, entitled the judge to reject Pingaro\u2019s implied ignorance of the offenses charged and the claimed lack of evidence linking him to the crimes to which he admitted guilt. The scheduling and rescheduling of jury trial dates over the course of eight months gave the lie to his suggestion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>unawareness of his right to jury trial. The active and productive efforts of his privately retained counsel over the course of many months in plea negotiations and in ultimately obtaining a relatively light sentence for Pingare undercut his affidavit\u2019s insinuation of dissatisfaction with counsel\u2019s effectiveness and ignorance of counsel\u2019s competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Even if the new claims regarding his counsel\u2019s supposed conflict of interest and \u201cpressures\u201d on Pingare to plead guilty, contained in Pingara\u2019s \u201csupplementary affidavit,\u201d were not subject to waiver (see note 4, <em>supra), </em>the judge could, as she did, justly dismiss them as \u201cdisingenuous,\u201d filed as they were over seven months after his motion and original supporting affidavit, one week after the Commonwealth\u2019s opposition had pointed out his motion\u2019s failure to allege any coercion or ineffectiveness of counsel but only the purported lack of a colloquy, and one day before the scheduled hearing on the motion. Apart from the suspect nature of their timing and their inherent implausibility (in light of the favorable disposition counsel achieved and Pingara\u2019s lengthy, presumably satisfactory retention of him), the uncorroborated allegations of the supplementary affidavit were properly rejected by the judge because they presented no colorable, much less substantial, issue of either coercion<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or conflict of interest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>425 Mass. 382, 389 (1997); <em>Duest I, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 149 (no conflict of interest will be inferred simply from defendant\u2019s allegation regarding the existence of joint representation). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>390 Mass. at 719-720 (defendant who had no criminal record presented affidavits tending to show in circumstantial detail that his unprepared counsel had coerced him into pleading guilty by telling him he had no defense and would be sexually molested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>in State prison if he failed to plead guilty so as to receive a house of correction sentence, after counsel had failed to bring a potentially meritorious motion to suppress the incriminating evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Finally, the motion judge\u2019s reliance upon Judge Banks\u2019 reputation and plea-taking experience as subversive of Pingare\u2019s claims seems to have been founded upon the judge\u2019s personal knowledge and is not reflected in the record (except for the conceded fact that a plea hearing of some sort did occur). It was, nonetheless, a relevant factor, compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>414 Mass. at 432 n.6, for which circumstances contemporary with the plea proceedings provide inferential support. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>363 Mass. 601, 603-605 &amp; n.3 (1973), decided six years prior to Pingaro\u2019s plea proceedings, stressing the applicability of <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, to all subsequent guilty plea proceedings and laying out an example of a sufficient colloquy. See also Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 453 (1970 ed. &amp; Supp. 1979), the authoritative treatise which has since 1970 made the judiciary and the legal profession aware of the requirements of <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>and provided full guilty plea colloquies as models to insure compliance therewith; and ABA Standards Relating to the Function of the Trial Judge \u00a7 4.2 &amp; commentary (Approved Draft 1972), setting forth the obligations of the trial judge in insuring plea colloquies consistent with <em>Boykin </em>and the matters of which the judge must advise the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In sum, taking the entire circumstances into consideration, we conclude that the motion judge\u2019s refusal to give credence to any of the improbable and essentially formulaic allegations on which Pingare based his supposititious new trial motion was a valid exercise of her discretion and warranted the denial of the motion without further inquiry into the content of the 1979 guilty plea colloquy. Weighed against so flimsy a showing, several important policies decisively tip the balance against Pingare and buttress the denial: first, avoiding unfair prejudice to the public and the Commonwealth caused by a movant\u2019s unexplained lengthy delay, which inevitably results in faded memories, destroyed or otherwise unavailable documents, and missing witnesses, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMarco, </em>387 Mass. at 485-486 &amp; n.12; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. at 888 n.1; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 840, 844-845 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>(1989); cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glines, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 95, 100 (1996) (\u201cordering a new trial on the facts presented would acquiesce in and invite opportunistic and mischievous manipulation of the plea process\u201d); and second, affirming the community\u2019s interest in finality, which insures the integrity and predictability of our procedures and is of especial weight in regard to convictions on guilty pleas. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>19 Mass.

With respect to the validity of the judge\u2019s reconstruction of the record, we observe that it was in fact based almost exclusively on the \u201ccontemporary record\u201d as defined by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. at 108 n.6, relying on the docket sheets, the grand jury minutes, the police reports (which the prosecutor read at the plea hearing and which established the criminal charges against Pingaro, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soffen, </em>377 Mass. 433, 441-442 [1979]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colantoni, </em>396 Mass. 672, 679-682 [1986]), and \u201cthe evolving history of Pingaro\u2019s disposition of these cases,\u201d including defense counsel\u2019s discovery activity, the length of time the case was marked for trial, the agreed-to continuances, the extensive plea negotiations, and the favorable \u201cdeal\u201d that was agreed to which resulted in the guilty pleas. The only post-plea matter considered in this regard by the judge was Pinga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ra\u2019s effort, initiated three weeks after the plea hearing, to revise his sentence on the distribution charges (to match the more favorable sentence a codefendant had received) without mentioning any other alleged defect in his conviction and sentence. That motion to revise the judge thought a clear reflection of the knowing and voluntary nature of Pingara\u2019s conduct at or about the critical time, particularly in conjunction with Pingare\u2019s express waiver of his separate motion to revise or revoke with respect to the conspiracy offense. It is not at all clear that the consideration of such a single, \u201croughly contemporaneous,\u201d <em>Duest II, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 625, post-plea circumstance, so close in time to the plea itself as arguably to be essentially contemporaneous, violates the <em>Foster </em>principle. Compare <em>Duest I, </em>26 Mass.

App. Ct. 137, for the supposed rule of automatic burden on the Commonwealth. Those cases do not, however, support his position, but rather reflect the new trial principles just discussed. In <em>Foster, </em>the defendant contended, and the extant, complete trial transcript confirmed, that there had been no inquiry whatsoever by the judge as to the knowing and voluntary nature of the guilty plea, a patent defect which the Commonwealth was compelled to acknowledge, 368 Mass. at 100-102, and one which amply satisfied the defendant\u2019s obligation to come forward with a credible and articulable claim of error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>390 Mass. 714, 716-718 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 716-717 &amp; n.4 (1997) (transcript of colloquy existed and showed no adequate inquiry by judge). In <em>Quiriones, </em>the defendant had, unlike Pingaro, attempted to obtain a copy of the relevant transcript within a few months after his plea (unsuccessfully, because the stenographer\u2019s car containing her notes of the plea proceeding was stolen), which enhanced the plausibility of his claim that his guilty plea had been the result of coercion and improper advice by his trial counsel, whom he had tried to discharge but was compelled to rely upon at the plea stage because the judge had denied his request for the appointment of new trial counsel. 414 Mass. at 423-424, 436. In <em>Duest 1, </em>the defendant, unlike Pingaro, presented affidavits from his counsel and the court reporter reflecting his diligent efforts to locate the stenographic notes of his plea proceedings (which appear to have been destroyed) so as to support his contention that he was never advised of and never understood the mens rea requirement for the crime to which he pleaded guilty on the advice of his lawyer, who had a conflict of interest. On the strength of those factual showings, the court noted that the \u201cdefendant has shown a basis for challenging his pleas\u201d sufficient to put the burden on the Commonwealth of establishing their constitutional validity. 26 Mass. App. Ct. at-141-142 &amp; n.6, 144 &amp; \u00f1.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Additionally supporting the imposition on Pingaro of an initial burden of persuasion is the procedural posture of his case, a variant example of a collateral attack on a guilty plea in a \u201csentencing enhancement context.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>414 Mass. at 432-433 n.7; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. at 716; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>43 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Ct. at 926. It is perfectly clear from the background and timing of Pingaro\u2019s motion and the contents of his original submission that, despite several opportunities to do so, he registered no complaints about his plea colloquy and never sought to withdraw his pleas until he became aware, over fifteen years after the fact, of the collateral consequence of sentencing enhancement under Federal law based upon his prior State convictions. Upon questioning by the motion judge, defense counsel admitted as much at the hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. Nor did his motion claim or even intimate that he had in fact been unaware of the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty, or had for any reason been unable to understand what occurred at the plea hearing, or had actually been subjected to any form of coercion or threats. Compare note 18, <em>infra. </em>Pingare thus failed to contend, let alone demonstrate, that it would have made any difference to him in deciding about a plea if the judge had engaged in the ftdlest conceivable guilty plea colloquy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 499 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 662, 664 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 152, 157 (1994). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correa, supra </em>at 718-719. Much less did he make any suggestion that he ever had any defense to the charges against him, i.e., \u201ca triable case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>390 Mass. 714, 720 (1984). In such a virtual \u201csentencing enhancement context,\u201d both Federal and State authorities recognize \u201cthat the burden is on the defendant... to rebut the presumption that [his] prior convictions [on his guilty pleas] are valid.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>414 Mass. at 433 n.7, citing to <em>Parke </em>v. <em>Raley, </em>506 U.S. at 29-32. We observe that neither <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones </em>nor <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. 100, upon which Pingara principally relies for automatically placing the burden of validating plea proceedings on the Commonwealth, were cases that could be characterized as arising in a sentencing enhancement context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Even were we to assess the strength of Pingaro\u2019s assertions independently with no deference to the motion judge, because of necessity the motion was heard by a judge who did not preside at the 1979 proceeding, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 626 (1994), we would find no error or abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s determinations because we, too, discern no credibility in Pingaro\u2019s suspiciously tardy and essentially perfunctory allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Pingaro\u2019s disingenuousness was underscored when, in his motion for reconsideration of the judge\u2019s order denying his motion to withdraw guilty plea, he conceded that the judge could properly discredit his affidavit because of his perjury convictions, but insisted that it was an abuse of discretion for the judge to disregard the affidavit \u201cof an independent and unbiased witness, Peter M\u00f3dica.\u201d The judge was, of course, entitled to disbelieve that infirm affidavit of Pingaro\u2019s close relative.
