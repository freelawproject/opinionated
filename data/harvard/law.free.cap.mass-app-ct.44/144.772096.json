L. c. 265, \u00a7 24), the defendant appealed raising a solitary issue: whether the Commonwealth\u2019s proof was sufficient to sustain the conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In an unpublished decision entered on April 24, 1997, we concluded that the indictment at issue essentially was tried on a theory of attempted anal rape and that there was no evidence in our record to support a conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>sion that there had been such an attempt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we determined that the defendant\u2019s trial motion for a required finding of not guilty wrongly had been denied and ordered the verdict to be set aside and the judgment reversed and entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">On May 19, 1997, the Commonwealth filed a motion to stay the issuance of a rescript pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 23, as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975), \u201cpending the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for rehearing.\u201d In support of that motion, the Commonwealth contended that the transcript of the trial was missing two pages of testimony which contained the victim\u2019s description of an attempted anal rape.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 21, 1997, we stayed the issuance of the rescript until June 23, 1997, and ordered that any petition for rehearing be filed by that date. After allowance of the Commonwealth\u2019s timely filed petition for rehearing, the appeal was reheard on July 29, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In the interim, the trial judge conducted a hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to correct the record. In a written memorandum and order, dated June 19, 1997, he allowed the motion, indicating that he was \u201caware of no right of the defendant that would be violated by allowing the omitted testimony to be added to the record, so that the Appeals Court may rehear the case with the benefit of the complete lower court testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">At the rehearing in this court, appellate counsel argued that his claim of insufficient evidence was so clearly dispositive on the earlier record, that he did not attempt to argue other issues. On that basis, the defendant was granted leave to file a supplementary memorandum on or before September 12, 1997, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>to permit presentation of issues not previously raised, and the Commonwealth was permitted an opportunity to file a response on or before October 14, 1997. By notice received on September 15, 1997, the defendant informed the court \u201cof his choice not to file a supplemental brief.\u201d The Commonwealth on the next day noted that the notice \u201cobviates the need for a responsive pleading.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In reviewing the order allowing the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to correct the record, we are guided by the principle that \u201c[t]he decision of the trial judge under rule (8)(e) is usually conclusive.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Letch </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>401 Mass. 65, 68 n.3 (1987). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nighelli, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 590, 598 (1982) (treating the trial judge\u2019s correction \u201cas essentially conclusive\u201d). See also <em>Bechtel </em>v. <em>Paul Clark, Inc., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 693 (1980). Any doubt that the two pages of testimony offered by the Commonwealth with its rule 8(e) motion were missing from the record is dispelled by the extent to which the content of those pages fills the apparent gap in the transcript first considered by the court. See Appendix. Moreover, the missing testimony demystified why the experienced judge, in both his original and supplementary instructions to the jury, explained that the crime alleged by the Commonwealth was \u201cattempted anal intercourse\u201d and \u201can assault to commit an unnatural penetration of the anal cavity.\u201d Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robles, </em>423 Mass. 62, 74 (1996). As we noted in the unpublished decision, \u201c[t]he correctness of either the main jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>charge or the supplementary instructions on the offense of assault with intent to rape was not challenged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Augmented by the missing testimony, the record amply supports the jury\u2019s verdict and the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motions for a required finding of not guilty. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). Accordingly, the sole issue before us and essentially the only one argued by the defendant at the rehearing was whether, in the circumstances, it was error to correct the record pursuant to rule 8(e). \u201cIt is explicitly provided in the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure that the trial judge shall settle any difference as to whether the record truly discloses what occurred in the lower court. Mass.R.A.P. 8(e) . . . .\u201d <em>Homed, </em>v. <em>Fadili, </em>408 Mass. 100, 104 (1990). The defendant argues, as he did to the judge, that the record could not be corrected after we rendered our unpublished decision. He relies on the following language in Homed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u201cThat rule [8(e)] has never been applied in this jurisdiction subsequent to an appeal in what amounts to a collateral attack on the appellate decision. It is implicit in the rule and in the very nature of the appellate process that any correction to the record must take place before the appeal has been decided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\n<em>Ibid.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The Supreme Judicial Court in that case was confronted with a situation which clearly is distinguishable from the present case. There, the court addressed an attempt \u201cto supplement the record on appeal with the trial judge\u2019s postappeal revised findings and rulings,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>while the case was being considered on further appellate review after a decision of this court. Essentially, the holding in that case is that: \u201cFurther appellate review will proceed on the same record on which the Appeals Court based its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105. The dispositive distinction from <em>Homed </em>is that the case before us does not involve \u201ca collateral attack\u201d on an appellate decision. <em>Id. </em>at 104. Rather, we are reviewing for error after ascertaining \u201cwhat occurred in the lower court.\u201d Mass.R.A.P. 8(e), <em>supra. </em>The critical factor in <em>Homed </em>is not that a rescript had not issued when the record correction was attempted. It is that a rational system of further appellate review best fulfills its function if both appellate courts deal with the same record. Similarly, direct appellate review is best served by procedures assuring the integrity of the trial record.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Massachusetts Rule of Appellate Procedure 23, as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975), states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">\u201cThe rescript of the court shall issue to the lower court twenty-eight days after the date of the rescript unless the time is shortened or enlarged by order. The timely filing of a petition for rehearing . . . will stay the rescript until disposition of the petition . . . unless otherwise ordered by the appellate court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Here, acting on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, we stayed the issuance of a rescript until June 23, 1997, and ordered that any petition for rehearing be filed by that date. The timely filing of such a petition further stayed the issuance of a rescript pursuant to rule 23. Neither the distribution of an opinion of this court nor its publication seals the rights of the parties or is binding upon them until the rescript is issued to the trial court. Whether the written opinion of this court is styled, for procedural purposes, as a decision or even a rescript, as it is in rule 23, a binding \u201cdecision\u201d does not come into existence as matter of law until the document embodying the order contained within that writing is transmitted to the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Original Transcript</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">Q. \u201cExplain to us exactly what he did.
