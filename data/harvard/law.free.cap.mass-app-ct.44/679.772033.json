After answering the third amended complaint, the defendant moved for summary judgment. It defended by reference to the immunities of public employers from suit set out in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(6) (exercise of discretionary function) and \u00a7 <em>10(f) </em>(nonresponsibility for third person\u2019s violent act).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendant\u2019s motion without explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>tory memorandum, and the plaintiff appeals from the adverse judgment. We reverse on the ground that the motion was not supported by adequate proof and did not establish either immunity as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">As appears from the record appendix in the present appeal, the materials on which the defendant based its motion consisted of little more than the complaint and the text of the \u201cBoston Public Schools Code of Discipline\u201d which, among other things, condemns students\u2019 possession of weapons on school premises and describes the sanctions available for that and other infractions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is possible from the record as made to glean that at 11:30 a.m., December 11, 1990, Robert Reynolds, a student at Boston High School, wielding a knife, fatally stabbed Allen, a fellow student, as the culmination of a tussle or altercation between the two in the third-floor hallway of the school building.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is perhaps assumed that no employee of the school was aware that Reynolds had a knife at the time. Allen did not have a weapon. As to Reynolds\u2019s prior history, in 1988, while a student at a city school, he was found in possession of a knife and was sent to a diagnostic program at Jamaica Plain\u2019s Barron Assessment Consulting Center; in 1990, also for possession of a knife, Reynolds was suspended from a second city school he was then attending. Thereafter he was enrolled at Boston High School, now his third school.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s grievance is in substance that in handling Reynolds the public employer was negligent to the point of causing Allen\u2019s death. The city\u2019s \u00a7 10(6) defense asserts in effect that even if it were negligent through the actions or inactions of the school employees, it is immune from suit because it was in the exercise of discretionary functions partaking of \u201cweighing alternatives and making choices with respect to public policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>and planning\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the educational, social, or economic fields \u2014 this in distinction to merely acting ministerially in implementing established policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To sustain such a defense on a motion for summary judgment, one would expect the moving party to demonstrate by deposition, affidavit, or otherwise how the school considered and acted upon the \u201cplacement\u201d questions for a student with Reynolds\u2019s history \u2014 whether to enroll Reynolds at the school; if enrolled, should Reynolds be \u201cmainstreamed,\u201d i.e., integrated with the general -school population, or dealt with specially; how in fact did the school oversee or supervise Reynolds\u2019s day-to-day attendance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Again, as to \u201csecurity\u201d questions \u2014 the threat of harmful conduct posed by Reynolds\u2019s previous behavior \u2014 we would expect the defendant to show what safety measures existed at the school and how the school employees confronted the immediate problem.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, on both \u201cplacement\u201d and \u201csecurity\u201d all the defendant offered of record was reference to court decisions indicating that a public employer might in given situations properly approach such questions on a policy basis and thus sustain a \u00a7 10(6) defense of immunity. On the present record the defense is insufficiently supported. The same lack of factual support impairs the defendant\u2019s treatment of the claimed \u00a7 10(/) immunity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Community Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, 369 </em>Mass. 550, 554 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">We are not suggesting that these defenses are maintainable only by heroic amounts of evidence on the part of the public employer. On the contrary, the cases show that the evidence can often be readily assembled and presented where it exists. Of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>course we cannot and do not intimate an opinion on the ultimate merits of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">For the point that reality is preferred over empty theorizing in adjudging claims of immunity under \u00a7 10, see <em>Horta </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>418 Mass. 615, 620 (1994); <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>422 Mass. 406, 412-413 (1996); <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>43 Mass.
