Newhall, the testatrix, had three children, one of whom, a son, Cheever Newhall, had three biological children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 1, 1968, she executed a will by which, in Article Fourth, she devised her seventy-acre vacation property in New Hampton, New Hampshire, in trust for the benefit of those three grandchildren, designated by name. In Article Fifth she gave her residuary estate in trust for the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of her \u201cissue,\u201d in language set out in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cheever New-hall married his third wife in 1971, and on November 30 of that year he adopted her two sons, Mark and Michael, who were then fifteen and seventeen years old, respectively. Alice Newhall died in 1972.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the death of Cheever (senior) in 1993, the trustees under the will of Alice J. Newhall sought instructions whether the two adopted sons, Mark and Michael, were to share the income distribution to \u201cissue\u201d under Article Fifth. From a decree ruling that the adopted sons were not entitled to share in the income distribution with Cheever\u2019s three biological children, Mark and Michael appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">When Alice J. Newhall executed her will in 1968, the law governing the rights of adopted children was G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8, as it had been amended by St. 1958, c. 121, \u00a7 1. Prior to the 1958 amendment, \u00a7 8 established a presumption that adopted children of the testatrix were included in a devise or bequest to \u201c \u2018children]\u2019 or [the] equivalent,\u201d but children adopted by one other than the testatrix were not so included. Under that \u201cstranger to the adoption\u201d principle, added in 1876,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mark and Michael, because they had been adopted by Cheever, not by Alice, the testatrix, would be presumed not to be included in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>bequest by Alice to Cheever\u2019s \u201cchildren,\u201d by that term or any equivalent. <em>New England Merchs. Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Groswold, </em>387 Mass. 822, 824 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The 1958 amendment abolished the stranger to the adoption rule, effective August 26, 1958. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hannam, </em>369 Mass. 26, 29-30 (1975). Applicable (by \u00a7 2 of the 1958 statute) to wills executed after the statute\u2019s effective date, the 1958 act amended \u00a7 8 to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201cThe word \u2018child,\u2019 or its equivalent, in a grant, trust, settlement, entail, devise or bequest shall include an adopted child to the same extent as if bom to the adopting parent or parents in lawful wedlock unless the contrary plainly appears by the terms of the instrument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Alice\u2019s will, because it was executed after the effective date of the 1958 statute, would be deemed to include the adopted children of her descendants, just as if they had been bom in lawful wedlock, in any provision of her will using the general term \u201cchild\u201d or its equivalent, unless the contrary plainly appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">It was, in our view, clear beyond reasonable dispute in 1968, when Alice executed her will, that the word \u201cissue,\u201d used in Article Fifth, was the equivalent of the word \u201cchild,\u201d so as to carry the presumption established by the 1958 statute. The opening words of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8 \u2014 \u201cThe word \u2018child,\u2019 or its equivalent, in a . . . devise or bequest\u201d \u2014 were left unamended by the 1958 statute and had, prior to its passage, been judicially construed to include the word \u201cissue.\u201d In <em>Wyeth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>144-Mass. 441, 443-444 (1887), the court, construing those words, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">\u201cWe think the intention was to provide, that if, by a settlement, deed, or will, property is given by terms which embrace and include a child bom in wedlock, and which, in their application to existing facts, have the same effect and mean the same thing as child or children, such as the terms \u2018issue,\u2019 \u2018descendant,\u2019 or \u2018heir at law,\u2019 the rules provided by this- section shall apply in the construction of the instrument. Any other construction would give the statute a very narrow scope, and to a great extent defeat its purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">The same construction \u2014 that \u201cissue\u201d when used in application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>to child or children, included adopted children \u2014 was followed in <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Frasier, </em>153 Mass. 525, 527-528 (1891). Two decisions by New York courts, called upon to determine whether the word \u201cissue\u201d included adopted children under Massachusetts law, treated the question as settled by G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8, <em>Wyeth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>and <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Frasier </em>in favor of inclusion. <em>In re Vail\u2019s Estate, </em>200 Mise. 1032, 1036 (N.Y. Surr. Ct. 1951) . <em>In re Cheney\u2019s Estate, </em>109 N.Y.S.2d 704, 706 (Sup. Ct. 1952) .<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> All of these decisions, of course, because written before the 1958 amendment, treated \u201cissue\u201d as including adopted children only when they had been adopted by the testator or testatrix; but the point is that, when the word \u201cissue\u201d was used in a context that denoted the children of the testator or testatrix, the word \u201cissue\u201d was treated as equivalent to the word \u201cchild\u201d so as to include adopted children in accordance with the 1876 statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Thus, when the 1958 statute amended G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8, to abolish prospectively the stranger to the adoption rule, the subject of the sentence \u2014 \u201cThe word \u2018child,\u2019 or its equivalent, in a . . . devise or bequest\u201d \u2014 left unchanged from the 1876 statute, must be read as having carried the same meaning as it carried in the 1876 statute, that is, as including the word \u201cissue\u201d when used in reference to the children of the testator or testatrix or (as amended in 1958) of the testator\u2019s or testatrix\u2019s lineal descendants. It cannot reasonably be contended that the Legislature in 1958, when it left those words unaltered, intended to narrow their judicially approved meaning, so as to exclude the word \u201cissue\u201d from the connotation of the words, \u201c \u2018child,\u2019 or its equivalent.\u201d Thus, when Alice Newhall executed her will in 1968, as well as her codicil in February, 1969 (see note 4, <em>supra), </em>her gift to her \u201cissue\u201d in Article Fifth must be read as having included any adopted children of her son Cheever, as if they were Cheever\u2019s biological issue. Although Mark and Michael were not adopted until two years later, and thus, we assume, were not within Alice\u2019s comprehension when she executed the will, the word she used, \u201cissue,\u201d would pick up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>children later adopted by one of her children, exactly as it would pick up any later-bom biological grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">By St. 1969, c. 27, \u00a7 1, effective (by \u00a7 3) on September 1, 1969, the Legislature undertook to broaden the rights of adopted children by making the 1958 abolition of the stranger to the adoption rule apply retroactively, except where interests or rights had vested prior to September 1, 1969.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the course of doing so, the subject of the operative sentence, as worded in 1876 and 1958, was amplified to read: \u201cThe words \u2018child,\u2019 \u2018grandchild,\u2019 \u2018issue,\u2019 \u2018heir\u2019 or \u2018heir-at-law,\u2019 or their respective equivalents, in a . . . devise or bequest . . . .\u201d This change of wording represented, in our view, a possibly inartful attempt to incorporate in the wording of \u00a7 8 the broad connotation that had consistently been given to the phrase, \u201c \u2018child,\u2019 or its equivalent,\u201d since <em>Wyeth </em>v. <em>Stone </em>in 1887. The 1969 amendment has been so treated (i.e., as a clarifying amendment) in commentaries. See, e.g., Newhall, Settlement of Estates and Fiduciary Law in Massachusetts \u00a7 24.14, at 59-60 &amp; n.81 (5th ed. 1997). In 1975 the Legislature thought the better of retroactivity and amended the 1969 statute so that the changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>language of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8, only applied to instruments executed after the effective date of the 1969 statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The 1969 statute and its partial repeal in 1975 would be of no concern to us \u2014 the 1975 statute limited the applicability of the 1969 amendment to instruments executed after September 1, 1969, and Alice\u2019s will and codicil were executed prior to that date \u2014 except for the fact that occasional decisions, noting the change in wording in 1969, have suggested, by way of dictum, that the 1969 amendment may have broadened (rather than merely clarified) the 1958 statute, with the implication that, prior to 1969, the word \u201cissue,\u201d used in a will, did not include adopted children. Cheever\u2019s biological children rely particularly on such a statement in <em>Callan </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>404 Mass. 198, 202 (1989), set out in the margin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But the holding of that case, which was concerned with a bequest to \u201cissue\u201d in a will executed in February, 1958, before the 1958 statute abolished the \u201cstranger to the adoption\u201d rule, was that \u201cthe 1975 amendment barred the retroactive application of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8 [as amended in 1969], to an instrument executed before August 26, 1958 [the effective date of the 1958 statute], and that, accordingly, the four adopted children [of a grandnephew] are not entitled to share in the distribution of the trust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. Alice Newhall\u2019s will, in contrast, having been executed <em>after </em>August 26, 1958, must be read as having included adopted children when it used the word \u201cissue,\u201d without regard to the \u201cstranger to the adoption\u201d rule. This result is in accord with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>New England Merchs. Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Groswold, </em>387 Mass. at 827: \u201cWe think that the 1958 amendment, taken together with the amendments in 1969 and 1975, indicates the Legislature\u2019s intent to draw 1958 as a bright line for the application of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new judgment is to be entered directing the trustees to treat Mark Newhall and Michael Newhall as Alice Newhall\u2019s issue in the administration of the trust under Article Fifth of her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b331-16\">The appellees: Cheever Newhall, Jr.; Gail Cross; and Stephen Newhall.
