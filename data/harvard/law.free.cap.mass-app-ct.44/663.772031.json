Upon receiving notice through a newspaper story of the judgment Elizabeth had obtained, the division filed a lien of $334,178.12 against the settlement proceeds. Elizabeth moved to discharge the Commonwealth\u2019s lien, and the Superior Court judge who presided over the underlying malpractice trial denied that motion. This appeal followed. Elizabeth resists the lien, asserted under G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 5G, and a superseding statute enacted in 1993, G. L. 118E, \u00a7 22, on the ground that her action against the obstetrician claimed compensation for damages that would accrue <em>after </em>the time during which the division had made Medicaid payments on Elizabeth\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial judge ruled that the Commonwealth, under the statutory scheme, is entitled to its lien. On that central question, we affirm his order. We make a minor modification to allow for inquiry into whether the figure of $334,178.12 is accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The theory of Elizabeth\u2019s case against the obstetrician was that his negligence caused her to suffer brain damage at birth and possibly in \u00fatero.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The obstetrician\u2019s defense was that Elizabeth\u2019s deficits were congenital in origin. Elizabeth had, indeed, been bom with .a diaphragmatic hernia that all parties agree was a congenital anomaly and of a kind sometimes associated with brain anomalies. The hernia was surgically repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Under the governing statutes, G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 5G, and G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 22, a Medicaid beneficiary is required to notify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>division<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in writing of the commencement of an action against a third party to recover damages arising out of the injury that called forth Medicaid benefits. Elizabeth did not so notify the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">1. <em>The statutory framework. </em>Any State that chooses to participate in the Medicaid program must \u201ctake all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties ... to pay for care and services available under the plan.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(A) &amp; (B) (1994). See <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Chin, </em>405 Mass. 697, 720-711 (1989); <em>Shweiri </em>v. Commonwealth, 416 Mass. 385, 388-389 (1993). The response of Massachusetts to that requirement first appeared in G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 5G, inserted by St. 1977, c. 363A, \u00a7 52. Until 1993, the dispensing agent for Medicaid payments and for recovery under \u00a7 5G was the Department of Public Welfare.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Statutes 1993, c. 161, \u00a7 1, established the Division of Medical Assistance and conferred on that new agency the responsibility for running Medicaid. Provisions for reimbursement of Medicaid payments from recoveries having their source in third-party liability, analogous to the provisions of \u00a7 5G, appeared in \u00a7 22 of a new c. 118E, inserted by St. 1993, c. 161, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">When Elizabeth began receiving Medicaid benefits in 1989, G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 5G, was the applicable statute. On July 16, 1993, G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 22, became applicable. Those two statutes are the same in design and substantially similar in language. By the time of the verdict, the settlement, and the assertion of its lien by the division in November, 1995, the Legislature had further amended \u00a7 5G and \u00a7 22 (see St. 1995, c. 38, \u00a7\u00a7 33 and 131). It is enough, for the moment, to observe that the 1995 amendments both simplify and refine some of the provisions, and do not alter the reciprocal rights of Elizabeth Whelan and the division. Under all versions of the statute, the division is entitled to recover from a third party liable to a Medicaid beneficiary all Medicaid disbursements to that beneficiary to the extent the Medicaid benefits were provided as a result of an injury that gave rise to the third-party liability. To illustrate, if a person receives Medicaid assistance in connection with a broken leg, that injury having been caused by the negligence of a tortfeasor, then the Commonwealth has a claim, to the extent of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Medicaid outlays, against the recovery of the injured party from the tortfeasor. Pertinent provisions of \u00a7 5G, in the form applicable in 1989, \u00a7 22, as enacted in 1993, and \u00a7 22, as amended in 1995, are set out in an Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">2. <em>Extent of Commonwealth\u2019s lien. </em>All versions of the statutes also confer on the Commonwealth a lien against proceeds from a third party for Medicaid benefits paid in connection with the injury for which the third party is liable. Elizabeth, as we have noted, contends that her settlement with the obstetrician is beyond the reach of the statutory lien because the damages she recovered did not include past medical expenses. The Massachusetts Medicaid recovery statutes, however, do not carve out any past-future damages distinction. They provide for recovery, in the 1982 and 1993 statutes, of an \u201camount equal to the benefits provided ... to the extent that such benefits were provided as a result of the . . . injury . . . suffered by the claimant.\u201d The 1995 statutory language is, if anything, more inclusive. It provides for repayment to the Commonwealth of \u201cthe total of all public assistance benefits, both financial and medical, provided . . . to or on behalf of the claimant . . . .\u201d The lien is to operate on \u201cany amounts received by the claimant from the insurer or third party.\u201d <em>Shweiri </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>416 Mass. at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The entire design of the Federal-State statutory apparatus is to replenish Medicaid funds when a benefit recipient recovers compensation for the injury from the person who caused it. Elizabeth\u2019s view that prospective damages limit reimbursement for earlier Medicaid payments allows easy subversion of the statutory purpose. All a lawyer need do, as here, is ignore previous loss and demand of the third party only prospective loss. That, as our English brethren would say, is too clever by half. Elizabeth\u2019s position is the more untenable because she failed to comply with the statutory requirement of notifying the division that she was bringing a third-party negligence action. Had she done so, the division could have intervened and made demand in the malpractice case for past as well as anticipated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Three cases from other States from which Elizabeth seeks support are based either on different statutory language or no applicable statute at all. See and contrast <em>Department of Human Serv. </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>412 N.W.2d 613, 616 (Iowa 1987); <em>In re Estate of Jackson, </em>79 NJ. 517, 527-528 (1979); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>39 N.Y.2d 397, 402-406 (1976). Elizabeth recognized the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>monwealth\u2019s call on potential recovery from third parties by subscribing, when applying for Medicaid benefits, to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201cIf you are applying for or receiving Medical Assistance because of an accident at your job, an auto accident, or any other incident for which you will sue the person responsible for your injury, then by signing this application, you promise to repay that medical assistance out of any money which you receive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">On appeal, Elizabeth for the first time claims exemption for the settlement proceeds because they have been placed in a Supplemental Needs Trust (\u201cSNT\u201d). Parties may not bring before an appellate court an issue that they did not present to the trial court. <em>Trustees of Stigmatine Fathers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>369 Mass. 562, 565 (1976). <em>Aronoff v. Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>420 Mass. 830, 834 n.5 (1995). <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 502, 503-504 n.3 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 805, 808 n.3 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Prescinding from the further difficulties that there is no record support for the existence of an SNT and there is no explanation as to how the funds found their way into such a trust in the face of the division\u2019s lien, an SNT would not provide the Whelans with a refuge. An SNT is a trust set up under statutory authorization for a disabled person to pay for that person\u2019s necessary expenses not covered by public assistance. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(4)(A) (1994). It has to do with the determination of an individual\u2019s Medicaid eligibility and does not negate the recovery provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(A). The Massachusetts statutes, which we have discussed, enacted to comply with the directive of \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(A), contain no exemption for SNT assets. Contrast <em>Matter of Gibson, </em>162 Mise. 2d 530, 535-536 (N.Y. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">3. <em>Amount of the Commonwealth\u2019s lien. </em>Elizabeth argues that, to the extent the division has a lien, there should be subtracted from the total of Medicaid payments those that are attributable to needs of hers not traceable to the obstetrician\u2019s negligence. To support this position, Elizabeth posits congenital brain defects that she would have had in any event, pointing to the diaphragmatic hernia as an indicator of such defects. Yet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>battleground of the malpractice action had been whether the origin of Elizabeth\u2019s brain defect was genetic or the result of medical malpractice. Elizabeth, as plaintiff in that case, urged that the cause was malpractice, and the jury so found. It is somewhat unsettling to have the plaintiff change ground in this fashion from one phase of the litigation to the next to avoid reimbursement to the Commonwealth. See the discussion of judicial estoppel in <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Westwood, </em>427 Mass. 176, 184-185 (1998). More to the point, Elizabeth has pointed to no plausible way by which she could show that her brain deficit requiring medical assistance was divisible.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The possibility of such division could at least have been explored had Elizabeth given the Commonwealth the required notice of the malpractice action. Principles of fairness and careful use of limited judicial resources prohibit a further round of litigation to resolve a question that should have been resolved in the first round. Cf. <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Moxley, </em>407 Mass. 633, 636 (1990); <em>Bendetson </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Revere, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 615, 618-619, 621 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">At trial, Elizabeth requested and was denied a hearing to determine whether the amount claimed by the Commonwealth, i.e., $334,178.12, had in fact been expended over the six-year period on medical assistance to Elizabeth in connection, broadly, with her brain deficit. Elizabeth is entitled to a hearing to test the correctness of the lien figure. In such a hearing, however, Elizabeth may not relitigate what caused her brain deficit, and the division\u2019s records shall be entitled to a presumption of regularity. <em>Newburyport </em>y. <em>Thurlow, </em>324 Mass. 40, 44 (1949). Cf. <em>Planning Bd. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Springfield, </em>338 Mass. 160, 163 (1958). Should Elizabeth choose to dispute the validity of any expenditure, it will be her burden to rebut the presumption of regularity. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\"><em>4. Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Elizabeth argues that the division should be required to pay a share of the attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with obtaining the settlement and payment under it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Such a claim is not discordant with principles governing the allocation of fees when a party is subrogated to the rights of a claimant. See <em>General Exch. Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>315 Mass. 360, 366 (1944). Once again, however, Elizabeth is raising the point for the first time on appeal, and we decline to consider it. Had Elizabeth notified the Commonwealth of the third-party action as the statute required and had the Commonwealth sat back to see what Elizabeth could reel in from the action, there might have been room for discussion that a request for apportionment of legal fees between Elizabeth and the division should be considered on equitable grounds, even though not raised before the case reached the appellate level. As the case lies, however, we do not think there is an occasion for such late consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order of the Superior Court is affirmed insofar as it confirms the validity of the division\u2019s lien against the settlement fund. Elizabeth Whelan, if she so desires, may have a hearing, conformably with the criteria set forth in this opinion, to establish the accuracy of the lien figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">1.

The jury returned a verdict in Elizabeth\u2019s favor of $6,900,000, causing the ceiling of the \u201chigh-low\u201d settlement, $2,000,000, to be applicable.
