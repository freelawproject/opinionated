That is the narrow issue of this case. The city would have us answer in the affirmative, pointing to the statement of G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16 (as amended through St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 37), that, commencing on July 1, 1990, municipal employees shall contribute a minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>of ten percent toward their HMO premiums. On the other hand, the unionized employees urge us to look at their collective bargaining agreement dated September 1, 1989, through August 31, 1992, and to St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 218,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which \u201cgrandfathered\u201d HMO contribution rates \u201cdetermined by a collective bargaining agreement\u201d before January 4, 1990, until the expiration of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">On September 25, 1990, after the city commenced the with-holdings, Boston Teachers Union (BTU) filed a complaint in Superior Court on the grounds just mentioned, seeking a declaration and injunction against the city and the school committee, named as defendants. The defendants answered that the collective bargaining contract, though dated and funded from September 1, 1989, had not been fully funded by the Boston city council as of January 4, 1990, and therefore the HMO contribution rates were not then \u201cdetermined by a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d The parties submitted a set of stipulated facts and copies of the 1989-1992 collective bargaining agreement and a previous one dated 1986-1989 and filed cross motions for summary judgment. The Superior Court judge ruled that the employees\u2019 HMO contribution rates had been \u201cdetermined\u201d before January 4, 1990, and thus \u00a7 218 prohibited the city from withholding the ten percent of HMO premium costs until the expiration of the collective agreement on August 31, 1992. We read \u00a7 218 to the same effect and affirm the judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">1. <em>Narrative, </em>a. <em>Bargaining. </em>The city of Boston, as a municipal employer, has elected to provide health insurance coverage to its employees, see G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 3, including the several thousand teachers, paraprofessionals, and other professional educators employed by the Boston school department. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Coverage is provided to these school employees through indemnity plans, see G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 7A, and through HMO plans, see \u00a7 16. The city\u2019s contributions to these plans are fixed by statute with certain leeways for collective negotiation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Boston Teachers Union (BTU), as certified bargaining representative of those school employees, following negotiations, entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the school committee for the period September 1, 1986, to August 31, 1989 (the three-year maximum period allowed by G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7[\u00ab]). This agreement required Boston to contribute 75% of the premium costs under an identified indemnity plan, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Master Medical Plan, or, where an employee chose an HMO plan (listed in the agreement as \u201cHarvard or other plan\u201d), with benefits different from the indemnity type, then \u201cthe employer contribution . . . shall be equal in dollar amount to the dollar costs of the employer\u2019s aforesaid percentage contribution\u201d under the indemnity plan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the indemnity plan\u2019s premium costs as negotiated in the agreement were in fact significantly higher than those of the selected HMOs, employees electing HMO coverage made no contribution to the premium costs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In June, 1989, BTU and the school committee began negotiating a successor agreement to the one expiring by its terms on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>August 31, 1989. The parties executed a \u201ctentative agreement\u201d which stated that the 1986-1989 agreement \u201cis amended as set forth below.\u201d And \u201c[t]he amended contract shall be effective from September 1, 1989, through August 31, 1992,\u201d provided it was ratified by the parties and the Boston city council voted a supplemental appropriation to the budget of the Boston school department sufficient to fund the contract for the first year.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[S]et forth below\u201d was an agreement by which teachers were to receive a 7% salary increase for each of the three years of the contract (together with 5% yearly increases for paraprofessionals, and certain other increases for bonuses and contributions to BTU\u2019s \u201chealth and welfare fund\u201d). There was no amendment of the health insurance provisions of the 1986-1989 text including those describing contributions under the indemnity and HMO plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The tentative agreement was ratified on June 15, 1989, by BTU and on July 15, 1989, by the school committee, and was submitted to the Boston city council, see G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>1(b). </em>In November, 1989, the city council refused the necessary appropriation, evidently because it considered the salary increases too steep. When the city council rejects \u201cthe request for an appropriation necessary to fund the cost items, such cost items shall be returned to the parties for further bargaining.\u201d G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>1(b), </em>as appearing in St. 1977, c. 937, \u00a7 3. The bargaining occurred in January, 1990, at meetings attended by Edward Doherty, president of BTU; James Burke, president of the school committee (he took office on January 1, 1990); Laval Wilson, Boston school superintendent; and Raymond Flynn, the mayor of Boston. On January 22, 1990, BTU and the committee executed a second \u201ctentative agreement\u201d stating that the first tentative agreement, \u201cto be effective from September 1, 1989, through August 31, 1992, shall remain in effect except as modified below.\u201d The only \u201cmodification\u201d was a reduction in the teachers\u2019 salary increases from 7% each year to 4.5, 4.25, and 4.5% corresponding to each of the three years of the contract (and including a \u201creopener provision\u201d for the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>year).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The agreement was ratified on January 23, 1990, and February 14, 1990. The negotiators named above had entered into a side agreement that, \u201c[u]pon receipt of a request from the Boston School Committee for a supplemental appropriation sufficient to fund the cost of this agreement, the Mayor . . . shall submit such request to the Boston City Council and support its passage.\u201d On February 6, 1990, Mayor Flynn transmitted to the city council \u201ca proposed supplemental appropriation . . . in the amount of . . . $13,600,000 ... to fund the FY [fiscal year] 1990 cost of the 1990 tentative agreement.\u201d On March 14, 1990, the city council voted to appropriate that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The final contract between BTU and the school committee incorporates the agreed upon amendments to the 1986-1989 agreement, does not alter the words of the latter agreement about employer contributions to the indemnity and HMO plans, and states that it is \u201ceffective from September 1, 1989, through August 31, 1992.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no reference to St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 37, or \u00a7 218, requiring employee contributions to HMO premium costs but grandfathering the rates determined by a collective bargaining agreement as of the date of the enactment, January 4, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">b. <em>New legislation. </em>While BTU and the school committee were negotiating the salary increases and looking to a supplemental appropriation for that purpose, the Legislature, warned about fiscal difficulties ahead by reports in November and December, 1989, of the Senate Committee on Post Audit and Oversight, 1989 Sen. Docs. Nos. 2125, 2130, was in the process of considering proposals to curtail budget expenditures. A budget control bill, 1989 House Doc. No. 6472, voted by the House on November 18, 1989, did not touch on State or municipal employees\u2019 contributions to insurance costs. A Senate bill, 1989 Sen. Doc. No. 2136, passed on December 13, 1989, required (in \u00a7 205) the State and those municipalities electing to provide HMO coverage to their employees under G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16, to contribute the \u201csame percentage\u201d of the costs of HMO premiums as they did correspondingly under indemnity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>plans.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A conference committee report, 1989 House Doc. No. 6565, rewrote the Senate proposal; it changed the \u201csame percentage\u201d provision for municipal employees to what became St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 37, \u2014 establishing a \u201cfloor\u201d of 10% and a \u201cceiling\u201d of 50% of HMO premium costs to be borne by the employees. (The \u201csame percentage\u201d formula, however, continued for State employees, see St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 36, amending G. L. C. 32A, \u00a7 14.) This committee report also set out the \u201cgrandfather\u201d provision, which became St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 218.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Both houses approved the committee report in late December, 1989, and the measure, containing over 200 sections, was signed by the Governor on January 4, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">2. <em>Meaning of \u00a7 218. </em>There appears to be no conventional statutory history that illuminates \u00a7 218, which turns up in the midst of a large number of budget control items. The case of <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Local 1656, Intl. Assn. of Firefighters, </em>411 Mass. 361, 366 (1991) <em>(Everett I), </em>offers the general background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">\u201cIn enacting St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 218, the Legislature was undoubtedly aware of the following: (a) that there was no prior legislative authorization mandating contribution from employees for the cost of HMO premiums; (b) that existing collective bargaining agreements were likely to contain provisions which required governmental units to contribute on an equal dollars basis ... to the payment of premium costs for both group indemnity and HMO plans; (c) that some protection for these provisions was necessary to avoid a claim that the new assessment authorized by \u00a7 37 unlawfully impaired rights protected by existing collective bargaining agreements . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-7\"><em>Everett 1 </em>does not consider the particular meaning or operation of \u00a7 218, except.as it says that \u00a7 218 is \u201cunambiguous in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>providing protection from the effect of \u00a7 37 to employees whose health care contributions are determined by an existing collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365. Rather, the case examined the ambiguous language of a collective bargaining agreement between firefighters and the city of Everett under which Everett was providing insurance benefits through \u201cBlue Cross/Blue Shield Municipal Master Medical Plan ... or its equivalent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363. The court confronted the question whether \u201cor its equivalent\u201d referred to an HMO plan thus importing the protection of the grandfather clause, \u00a7 218. <em>Id. </em>at 366. This question the court decided to remit for interpretation to the Labor Relations Commission with its special familiarity with labor contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 362, 367-370. The commission then read the agreement as setting HMO premium contribution rates, whence it followed that \u00a7 218 protected the employees and forbade the city to withhold from their salaries while the contract was in effect, July 1, 1988, to June 30, 1991. The Supreme Judicial Court upheld this decision in <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>416 Mass. 620 (1993) <em>(Everett II).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Brockton Educ. Assn., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 171, 172-173 (1994), despite the existence of a collective bargaining agreement in effect from September 1, 1989, through August 31, 1992, Brockton commenced withholding the 10% contribution of c. 32B, \u00a7 16, as amended, from the salaries of employees subscribing to HMO coverage. The bargaining agreement, like that in <em>Everett, </em>had muddy language about HMO contribution rates, in fact referring only to \u201cBlue Cross and Blue Shield\u201d in its insurance provisions. The court decided that the contract could be interpreted in light of the conduct of employees who had been selecting HMO coverage (apparently with Brockton making contributions to premium costs) while the agreement was in effect. Contractual interpretation under the collective bargaining agreement constituted a \u201cgrievance\u201d with arbitration as the fourth level of the grievance procedure spelled out in the contract. In this posture of the case, the court decided that arbitration was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>right procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 175-176. As for \u00a7 218, the court noted (at 173): \u201c[I]f employees have the benefit of a collective bargaining agreement that allows them to pay less than ten percent of the cost of HMO coverage, they will enjoy that benefit for the life of the agreement, notwithstanding the ten percent minimum generally applicable as a consequence of the 1989 legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Most recently, in <em>Yeretsky </em>v. <em>Attleboro, </em>424 Mass. 315, 315-316 (1997), two retired city employees who selected HMO coverage sought injunctive and declaratory relief in the Superior Court to the effect that, under c. 32B, \u00a7 16, they were to pay only 10% of their HMO premium costs. The employees based their argument on the fact that \u00a7 16, as amended, required a 10% \u201cminimum\u201d employee contribution to HMO premiums but \u201cparties to a collective bargaining agreement\u201d could agree to a higher employee contribution rate (to the \u201cceiling\u201d of 50%). Since they were not \u201cparties to a collective bargaining agreement\u201d (and resultingly did not have much negotiating power), they were required to pay only the minimum of 10%. <em>Id. </em>at 318. A Superior Court judge agreed with the plaintiffs and the city appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The Supreme Judicial Court examined the relevant language of c. 32B, \u00a7 16, as amended, finding it to be somewhat ambiguous. To help resolve it, the court looked to the provenience of the amendment, St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 37. The long run purposes were to reduce budget expenditures and to lessen employees\u2019 financial incentive to elect HMOs which, by adverse selection, had threatened the security of indemnity plans. <em>Id. </em>at 319-321. The court reasoned (at 319) that the long run legislative purposes would be served by an interpretation that allowed municipalities to seek \u201cthrough the local political process\u201d to set the contribution of nonbargaining employees, including the plaintiff retirees, between 10 and 50%. As for \u00a7 218, the court observed that it \u201clessened\u201d the impact of amended \u00a7 16 because it \u201c \u2018froze\u2019 contribution rates for unionized employees at current levels so long as existing collective bargaining agreements remained in effect unless the parties agreed otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The cases bearing on \u00a7 218 have not engaged the narrow issue here, which arises on a singular set of facts and is without long run significance \u2014 whether the grandfather provision \u2022protected the parties\u2019 pretty clear expectation and understanding that HMO contribution rates would not change in the 1989-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>1992 contract period, although \u2014 as commonly happens in public sector contracting \u2014 formalities were postponed and had not been concluded by \u00a7 218\u2019s effective date, January 4, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">3. <em>City\u2019s contract based argument. </em>In urging us to reverse the judgment of the Superior Court, the city argues: according to the terms of the initial \u201ctentative agreement,\u201d it was to become effective \u201cprovided that\u201d it was ratified and the city council voted a supplemental appropriation; so, the argument goes, until March, 1990, when the council appropriated the money to fund the second tentative agreement (with reduced salary increases) there was no enforceable contract; hence it cannot be said that the HMO contribution rates were \u201cdetermined by a collective bargaining agreement\u201d as of January 4, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The argument ignores that the parties from the start expressed their intention, which they never abandoned, to leave intact the health insurance provisions of the 1986-1989 bargaining agreement. The fact that the second tentative agreement was not executed and funded until after January 4, 1990, should not be held controlling where the parties agreed to date and apply the contract with retroactive force from September 1, 1989. (No one disputes that BTU members received salary increases retroactive to that date.) In <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Dracut, </em>374 Mass. 619, 629 (1978), the court left \u201cunresolved\u201d whether a collective bargaining agreement, dated January 1, 1972, to December 31, 1974, and funded on January 27, 1973, \u201cwas implemented from January 27, 1973, forward or whether it was effective retroactively to sometime in 1972.\u201d There retroactive salary increases were at stake. Subsequent cases reveal a practice of agreeing to the retroactive effectiveness of bargaining agreements. See, e.g., <em>Somerville </em>v. <em>Somerville Mun. Employees Assn., </em>418 Mass. 21, 22 (1994); <em>Gloucester Fire Fighters, Local 762, </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 106, 107 (1979). Cf. <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>414 Mass. 323, 328 (1993) (parties, operating under \u201crollover\u201d provisions in a contract which was being renegotiated, assumed that a collective bargaining agreement could be made retroactively applicable).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Professor Cox reminds us: \u201cThe governmental nature of a collective bargaining agreement should have predominant influence in its interpretation. The generalities, the deliberate ambiguities, the gaps, the unforeseen contingencies, the need for a rule although the agreement is silent \u2014 all require a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>creativeness quite unlike the attitude of one construing a deed or a promissory note or a three-hundred page corporate trust indenture.\u201d Cox, The Legal Nature of Collective Bargaining Agreements, 57 Mich. L. Rev. 1, 25 (1958). There is need to take account both of the practical necessity to avoid uncontracted-for gaps of time between bargaining agreements and of the often uncomfortable and sometimes unpredictable passage of time while steps of ratification are taken: hence parties assure continuity by contractual provision for retroactivity. The city would have the 1986-1989 contract \u201cexpire\u201d on August 31, 1989, and the new contract take on life only when funded in March, 1990. But life continued between these dates: teachers were working and received their salaries and insurance coverage as governed by the old contract; the only open question was the rates of increase in salaries (and incidentals). Bargaining on that question continued<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the solution, when reached, was made retroactive to the commencement date of the new contract coinciding with the rest of the agreement. On this view the insurance contribution provisions, as carried over continuously from the earlier bargaining agreement, were grandfathered by \u00a7 218. A contrary result appears inequitable in a situation where any BTU member reading the collective bargaining agreement dated 1989-1992 would believe the HMO cost provision continued unchanged and may have made personal decisions accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">4. <em>Statute based arguments. </em>The city points to G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>1(b): </em>where the city council as \u201cthe appropriate legislative body\u201d rejects the request \u201cfor an appropriation necessary to fund the cost items, such cost items shall be returned to the parties for further bargaining.\u201d G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>1(b), </em>as appearing in St. 1977, c. 278, \u00a7 4. Of course, a cost item, although agreed to in a collective bargaining agreement, will be of no force if in the end it remains unfunded because a relevant appropriation has not been secured. See <em>Alliance, AFSCME/SEIU </em>v. <em>Secretary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number><em>of Admn., </em>413 Mass. 377, 384 (1992); <em>Billerica </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, Local 1495, </em>415 Mass. 692, 696 (1993); <em>County of Suffolk </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 127, 132-133 (1983). From this premise the city seeks to argue that when the city council declined to fund the salary and other increases and remitted the situation to further bargaining, there was no agreement of any sort that could qualify for \u00a7 218 purposes \u2014 this despite the existence of the first (June, 1989) \u201ctentative agreement.\u201d Otherwise stated, the city\u2019s contention is that all the cost items of a collective bargaining agreement must have been fully funded before any of them may be considered effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The city\u2019s argument is not persuasive when attention is paid to the facts of this case: the city presents only a hollow theory in opposition to the realities, as they appeared to the parties at the time. The \u201ccost items\u201d submitted to the city council for \u201csupplemental appropriation\u201d and rejected by the council in November, 1989, were increases in salary and other benefits that were entirely unrelated to expenditures for insurance premiums \u2014 hence the return of \u201csuch\u201d cost items to the bargaining table, as provided in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>l(b).</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The city insists that, with the return to the bargaining table, the insurance contribution rates (as well as the salary increases) became open to renegotiation. If true at all as a technical matter, the city\u2019s observation again belies the realities. The insurance contribution rates were not the \u201ccost items\u201d rejected by the city council and in fact these rates were not renegotiated in January, 1990; any attempt to do so would have upset the whole applecart of the prior understandings. By the second \u201ctentative agreement,\u201d the parties agreed that the first \u201ctentative agreement\u201d would remain as ratified (in June, 1989) except as \u201cmodified.\u201d The only financial \u201cmodification\u201d was the reduction in the size of teachers\u2019 salary increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>Where the parties had agreed to continue the contribution rates from the 1986-1989 contract, the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>money for that contribution was bespoken (see note 12), and the parties to all appearances regarded the issues as settled, there is no difficulty in holding that the particular HMO rate for 1989-1992 was \u201cdetermined by a collective bargaining agreement\u201d before January 4, 1990.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The judge below in finding the rate \u201cdetermined\u201d before January 4, 1990, rested quite simply on the fact that the parties had expressly agreed before that date to continue the rate from the 1986-1989 contract. And the parties never swerved from that purpose; in fact, they expressly wrote it into the collective bargaining agreement dated, and funded from, September 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The judgment appealed from, allowing the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and declaring rights in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A6x\">Section 218 reads in relevant part as follows: \u201c[T]he percent contribution to the total monthly premium cost or rate for coverage under [c. 32B, \u00a7 16] for any employees of any governmental unit where such percent contribution is determined by a collective bargaining agreement as of the effective date of this act shall not be altered until the expiration date of said collective bargaining agreement, unless the parties to said agreement agree otherwise, and in no event shall the provisions of said section sixteen be construed to require any governmental unit to reduce the percent share contributed to such coverage by its employees below the percent share contributed as of the effective date of this section until such time as a different percent contribution is in fact determined by a collective bargaining agreement and such collective bargaining agreement becomes effective.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The city\u2019s election of \u00a7 7A requires it to pay at least 50% of the premium costs of indemnity plans chosen by employees. By electing \u00a7 16 (as in effect prior to its 1989 amendment), the city was required to pay the \u201csame amount\u201d for HMO premiums as it did for indemnity premiums. Section 16, as amended through St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 37, now requires the city to pay between 50 - 90% of HMO premium costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">This wording accorded with G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16, as it existed before the 1989 amendment: \u201cThe governmental unit\u2019s contribution toward the total monthly premium cost or rate for coverage under this section shall be the same amount as and shall not exceed the governmental unit\u2019s contribution for the health insurance programs provided under sections three, five and eleven C . ...\u201d In <em>Hemman </em>v. <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 70, 72-73 (1984), this court ruled that the \u201csame amount\u201d meant the same dollar amount, not the same percentage of the total premium due.

The record reveals that by January 4, 1990, the city had met its \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement by agreeing to continue the health insurance provisions from the 1986-1989 contract. At no time following January 4, 1990, did the parties bargain over health insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\">One of the stipulated facts states that the $13,600,000 supplemental appropriation ultimately approved by the city council was to fund the FY 1990 costs of the second tentative agreement (January 1990). This second tentative agreement contains only increases in salaries and incidentals. Presumably the funds previously provided, to which the $13,600,000 was supplemental, covered the city\u2019s contribution to the HMO premium costs as estimated without the reduction for employees\u2019 contributions called for by the new legislation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\">We do not agree with the city\u2019s argument that affirming the judgment of the Superior Court will frustrate the purpose of the 1989 amendment. As mentioned above, the facts are singular. Nor is there any suggestion that the parties improperly were attempting to circumvent the amendment. See <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>410 Mass. 165, 173 (1991) (\u201cMunicipal employers and employees may not negotiate to avoid complying with laws of general applicability, including insurance regulations\u201d). Moreover, the city could lawfully collect 10% of HMO premium costs (or a larger negotiated contribution rate) from BTU members commencing on September 1, 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
