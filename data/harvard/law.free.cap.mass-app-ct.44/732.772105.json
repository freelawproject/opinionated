A Florida court entered two orders on May 31, 1996, one denying the motion of the former wife (wife) to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and the other ordering, inter alia, that the wife send the parties\u2019 two children to Texas for five weeks during the summer of 1996. Several weeks later, on July 9, 1996, the wife filed a complaint in Massachusetts to modify the Florida judgment. A probate judge allowed the husband\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The wife appeals, claiming that Mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>sachusetts is the home State of the children under G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 <em>2, </em>and that Florida lost jurisdiction over the custody of the two daughters because the husband has moved to Texas. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(d) (1994); note 3, <em>infra. </em>We affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In her affidavit, which is not contested, the wife alleges, among other things, that she and the children moved to Massachusetts with the permission of a Florida court, that the children have lived in Massachusetts since January, 1993, and that the husband moved from Florida to Texas in 1995. In addition to complaining about the conditions of the children\u2019s previous visit in Texas, the wife asserts that the husband does not have a permanent address in Houston, Texas, and \u201ckeeps moving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">We assume that Massachusetts, the home State of the children, has jurisdiction under the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (MCCJA), G. L. c. 209B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As \u201cthe second court to be called upon to adjudicate [this] custody dispute,\u201d Massachusetts must also satisfy the jurisdictional demands of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A (1994). <em>Delk </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>421 Mass. 525, 531 (1995). <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>Hillier, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 486, 488 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Subsection (f) of PKPA, set forth in full in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> permits modification of a decree properly made in another State if the later court has jurisdiction <em>and </em>\u201cthe court of the other State no longer has jurisdiction, or . . . has declined to exercise such jurisdiction to modify such determination.\u201d Florida has not declined jurisdiction. Thus, the question is whether the Florida court is vested with continuing jurisdiction under the PKPA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>other relevant parts of which are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This determination depends on whether, under Florida law, the Florida courts have continuing jurisdiction under \u00a7 1738A(c)(l) and, if so, whether one of the conditions of subsection (c)(2) is met. The only pertinent condition is subsection (c)(2)(E) which refers to subsection (d). That subsection requires that Florida remain \u201cthe residence of the child or of any contestant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">That determination, too, must be evaluated by Florida law. As stated in <em>McDougald </em>v. <em>Jenson, </em>786 F.2d 1465, 1483 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 860 (1986), \u201cin the absence of a [statutory] definition [of \u2018residence\u2019], Congress should be considered to have intended that a litigant\u2019s residence for the purposes of section 1738A would be his or her legal residence or domicile. Further, the party\u2019s legal residence should be determined in accordance with the state law applicable. . . .\u201d See Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1979: Joint Hearing on S. 105 Before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice of the Committee on the Judiciary and the Subcommittee on Child and Human Development of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 96th Cong. 2d Sess. 147 (1980) (prepared statement of Russell M. Coombs).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The wife argues that the husband no longer resides in Florida.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That argument is, however, not open to her in Massachusetts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>The Florida court not only refused to decline jurisdiction, but in May, 1996, entered an order denying the wife\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. In that order, the Florida court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">\u201cTHIS CAUSE having come before this Honorable Court upon the Former Wife\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction, the Court having reviewed the file and having heard testimony of the parties and their respective attorneys and being otherwise duly advised, it is hereby ORDERED</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Thus, the matter of Florida\u2019s jurisdiction was litigated in Florida and the \u201cdetermination on this point by a [Florida] court must be dispositive.\u201d <em>Delk </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>421 Mass. at 533. <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>Hillier, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 489. See <em>MacDougall </em>v. <em>Acres, </em>427 Mass. 363 (1998). The wife did not appeal from the Florida determination, nor has she shown anything to suggest that the question of jurisdiction was not fully litigated. <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Duke, </em>375 U.S. 106, 112-113 (1963). See <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>406 Mass. 88, 90 (1989). Accordingly, the Massachusetts probate judge was correct in dismissing the wife\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">\n<em>Judgment of dismissal affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Massachusetts is the home State under G.

See, e.g., <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>160 Fla. 410 (1948).

The wife\u2019s allegations are insufficient to show that the husband has acquired a domicile in Texas because she asserted in her affidavit, \u201c[he] does not have a permanent address in Houston, Texas and keeps moving.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b767-9\">The wife\u2019s complaint also claimed a failure of the husband to comply with an order to pay medical bills.

If she is pursuing the claim, she may, within thirty days of the rescript, file a motion to let stand in the Probate Court count 5 of her complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
