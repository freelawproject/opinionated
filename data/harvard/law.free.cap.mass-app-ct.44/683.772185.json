We address each of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">1. <em>Appeal from the motion judge\u2019s refusal to reduce the bond. </em>The plaintiffs filed a timely appeal from the tribunal judge\u2019s denial of their motion to reduce the bond. The clerk\u2019s office was required to process the appeal pursuant to the procedures set forth in G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D, but failed to do so. <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Baystate Ambulance &amp; Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc., </em>413 Mass. 670, 677-678 (1992). However, the failure to do so does not warrant reversal because we conclude that the tribunal judge was correct in denying the motion on the ground that no reasonable person would expend his own funds in pursuit of this action in light of the plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">2. <em>Dismissal while appeal pending. </em>The plaintiffs argue that the action should not have been dismissed while the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the denial of their motion to reduce the bond was pending. The defendants argue that the dismissal was proper because thirty days had elapsed from the tribunal judge\u2019s ruling on the motion to reduce the bond, see and compare <em>St. Germain </em>v. <em>Pfeifer, </em>418 Mass. 511, 521-522 (1994), and a justice of the Superior Court had denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to stay the proceedings pending a ruling from the single justice of the Appeals Court on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Although the Supreme Judicial Court in the <em>St. Germain </em>case held that the thirty-day period for posting a bond begins to run from the tribunal judge\u2019s ruling on the motion to reduce the bond, <em>id. </em>at 522, there had been no ruling in that case by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>tribunal judge on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to reduce the bond and consequently no appeal could have been lodged. In the <em>St. Ger-main </em>case, the Supreme Judicial Court noted that \u201c[a]ny other result would render the statute\u2019s bond reduction provisions for indigents meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, where the plaintiffs\u2019 only avenue of appeal is to the single justice of the Appeals Court, whose decision is final, G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D, to hold that the action may be dismissed for failure to post the bond while an appeal from the tribunal judge\u2019s denial of a motion to reduce the bond is pending, would render indigents\u2019 rights of appeal from a tribunal judge\u2019s decision on a motion to reduce the bond of little consequence. The judgment of dismissal should not have been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">3. <em>Tribunal\u2019s findings. </em>Based upon our review of the record, the tribunal properly found that the plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof was insufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability. The plaintiffs contend that the defendant Nepomuceno failed to conform to good medical practice by not obtaining plaintiff James F. O\u2019Leary\u2019s informed consent to the surgery performed, specifically in failing to inform him that there was a viable alternative to the surgery performed, i.e., observation. However, the plaintiffs presented no expert testimony that there was a viable alternative. Instead they relied on the defendant Nepomuceno\u2019s own testimony in which he clearly indicated that observation was not a viable alternative, for without surgery serious injury or death might occur. In addition, plaintiff James F. O\u2019Leary signed an informed consent form in which he indicated that he was fully informed of the risks of and options to the surgery and that he consented to the procedure. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">4. <em>Rulings on motions for discovery and amendment of pleadings. </em>The plaintiffs argue that various judges of the Superior Court erred in permitting the defendants to conduct discovery prior to the convening of a medical malpractice tribunal. They also assert that a Superior Court judge erred in allowing the defendant Nepomuceno to amend his pleading to include a request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The plaintiffs filed their complaint on April 20, 1993. On December 2, 1993, a Superior Court judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for relief from discovery requests of the defendants and ordered discovery to proceed according to the tracking schedule of the Superior Court even though no medical malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>tribunal had been convened. In April, 1995, another Superior Court judge allowed the defendant Nepomuceno\u2019s motion for disclosure of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses. A medical malpractice tribunal was finally convened on May 15, 1995. In light of the inexplicable delay in convening the medical malpractice tribunal and the possibility of the loss of evidence with the passage of time, the judges (fid not abuse their discretion in ordering the discovery. In any event, the plaintiffs have demonstrated no prejudice from those rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The plaintiffs also complain that a justice of the Superior Court abused his discretion in allowing the defendant Nepomuceno, after the convening of the tribunal, to amend his answer to include a request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. Although the pro se status of the plaintiffs may well preclude any such award, see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, we do not conclude that the allowance of the amendment constituted an abuse of discretion, for there remains the possibility that the plaintiffs in the future might secure legal representation to prosecute their claims. In any event, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated any prejudice by the allowance of this amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the defendants is affirmed unless a bond in the amount of $6,000 is posted in the Superior Court within thirty days of the entry of the rescript in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint also contained claims for deceit, breach of contract, violation of G. L. c. 93A, and assault and battery. The plaintiffs do not argue on appeal that dismissal of those claims was error; we therefore do not reach the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
