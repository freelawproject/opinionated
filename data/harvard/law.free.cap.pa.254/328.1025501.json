A resident of Massachusetts who owned an automobile manufacturing business in Pennsylvania, directed by will that the business be conducted by his executors after his death. A Michigan creditor, who had furnished automobile axles to the business obtained judgment against the executors in this State for want of an affidavit of defense, and thereafter three automobiles belonging to the estate were levied upon. The executors petitioned the Common Pleas for stay of execution alleging that the assets in their hands should be employed for payment of Pennsylvania creditors; plaintiffs claimed a preference on the ground that the axles sold by them had been.used in the automobiles levied upon. Without determining the question, the court empowered the executors to sell the automobiles and hold the fund so realized until the court should determine whether the cars were liable to such execution. In proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court for the settlement- of the estate it appeared that the sum realized from the sale of the cars exceeded the amount of plaintifE\u2019s claim, but no formal request was made to the Orphans\u2019 Court to hold the funds so as to give the claimant an opportunity to have the Common Pleas speed the determination of the question, hut request was made that the claim for a preference he allowed by the Orphans\u2019 Court. It was not shown that the particular axles furnished were not paid for although there was a balance due the claimant. The Orphans\u2019 Court directed that after the payment of Pennsylvania creditors, the remaining assets of the estate in Pennsylvania should be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>mitted to the Massachusetts executors for distribution in Massachusetts, where the decedent was domiciled. <em>Held, </em>no error.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b355-4\">Argued May <em>2, </em>1916.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqj\">Appeal, No. 93, Jan.

The plaintiff claimed that, \u201cin carrying on the said automobile manufacturing business,\u201d the defendants bought of it merchandise in the amounts set forth in certain attached book entries. Judgment was taken \u201cby default for want of an affidavit of defense.\u201d August 24, 1912, the defendants filed a petition in the Common Pleas in which they recited this judgment, that execution had been issued thereon, that the sheriff had levied upon certain automobiles in their hands, that the decedent\u2019s estate, as a whole, was solvent, and that these assets \u201cshould be held for the payment of the debts of the creditors of said decedent residing in Pennsylvania\u201d; they prayed for a stay of execution. The axle company filed an answer in which it averred, inter alia, that \u201cthe three automobiles levied upon......were manufactured and made up entirely of material and parts purchased by said executors after the death of the said Joseph Middleby and while the said executors were carrying on the business......, and the materials purchased from said plaintiff...... having gone into the said automobiles, the said plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>avers that, as to the said automobiles, the creditors whose claims so accrued.....' .constituted a class having a priority......and said plaintiff should not be deprived of the said priority by a stay of or interference .with the execution......issued.\u201d No hearing was had upon the petition and answer, but on October 26, 1912, the Common Pleas entered an order to this effect: \u201cPermission is given said executors to sell the automobiles levied upon......and the proceeds thereof shall be retained......until such time as the petition for the stay of said executions shall be acted upon by the court, and if it shall be determined that said automobiles are subject to and liable for said executions......then the said ......executors shall pay over to the constable and the sheriff the amounts received......from such sales, as their respective interests may appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">While the above quoted order evidently was intended to cover more than the execution here under discussion, and refers to \u201cthe constable and the sheriff,\u201d yet there is nothing else before us indicating any execution other than the one in question, or what interest the constable had in the matter; but, however that may be, so far as the record shows, it appears that no further effort was made to have the Court of Common Pleas determine whether or not the automobiles levied upon were \u201csubject to and liable for said executions,\u201d or, if so, \u201cthe respective interests\u201d of the constable and sheriff. Furthermore, the record shows that when the estate came on for adjudication in June, 1914, about seventeen months after the stay was applied for, although it was then admitted that the sum realized from the sale of the automobiles levied upon exceeded the plaintiff\u2019s claim, yet no formal request appears to have been made of the Orphans\u2019 Court to hold the fund in controversy so as to give the claimant an opportunity to have the Common Pleas speed the determination of the questions just indicated; on the contrary, the request was that the claim for a preference be forthwith allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>by the Orphans\u2019 Court, and, when this was declined, the exceptions filed by the claimant, the dismissal of which is assigned for error, did not specifically complain of any refusal to hold the fund,'but, simply, because the court \u201cerred in not distributing to the said Timken-Detroit Axle Company the amount of its claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Under the circumstances at bar, we cannot say the court below erred when it refused to make an exception of the claim in question and ruled that, after payment of Pennsylvania creditors, \u201csince this is a solvent estate, the general rule will be followed (see Barry\u2019s App., Poster\u2019s Est., 88 Pa. 131) and the balance of the fund remitted to Massachusetts where the non-Pennsylvania claimants may present their claims.\u201d In this connection, it is to be noted that, although the executors bought axles from the claimant, yet it was proved they had made payments exceeding the amount of their purchases, and, as stated by the adjudicating judge, it was by no means shown the axles in the cars levied upon were not paid <em>for; </em>further, it was not proved whether these particular axles were purchased before or after Mr. Middleby\u2019s death. While judgment was obtained against the executors by default in the Common Pleas, yet it will be observed from the record of that court, as we have recited it, that none of the points above indicated was there determined, and, in addition, it will be noticed that not only was there a failure to ask the Orphans\u2019 Court to hold the fund pending a further application to the Common' Pleas, but, as just suggested, the claimant also failed to prove the salient facts upon which he relied to show his right to a preference, when given the opportunity so to do in the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In Middleby\u2019s Est., 249 Pa. 203, we held that \u201csuit brought by a foreign creditor against the estate of a decedent upon which ancillary letters have been granted in Pennsylvania, does not make such foreign creditor a domestic creditor,\u201d and that \u201cit is a general rule that, where ancillary administration has been raised in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>State, the fund in the hands of the accountant will be applied to the payment of domestic creditors and the balance remitted to the domiciliary jurisdiction.\u201d The court below very properly accepted these rulings as its guide in the present case, and decided that the Act of March 31,1905, P. L. 91, relied upon by the claimant \u201cto demonstrate that foreign creditors of the decedent should be taken care of by this court (the Orphans\u2019 Court of Berks County), \u201cshould be construed to direct a distribution to foreign creditors only as an incident to the distribution to resident legatees and devisees\u201d; this is in accord with what we said in discussing the Act of 1905 in Bertin\u2019s Est., 215 Pa. 256, 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The assignments of error are overruled, and the decree is affirmed; the appellant to pay the costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
