In the latter case the plaintiff being disqualified to institute an action, at the time of bringing it, he is wrong <em>ab </em>initio, and the restoration of peace cannot set him right; but in the former case the right to sue being originally good, the plea of <em>alien </em>enemy, which is never favoured, merely suspends the action, and on the removal of the disability, it revives in full force. This distinction is well founded both in reason and authority. <em>Le Brett </em>v. <em>Papillon,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Lady Faulkland </em>v. <em>Stanion,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> Co.
