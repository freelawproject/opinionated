A mark to be used in connection with the sale of wine, consisting of the representation of a vineyard, a herd of camels, and two men bearing a grape, is so similar to a mark to be used in the same manner, consisting of the picture of two men, with dress similar to that in the other mark, and bearing a bunch of grapes between them, as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b23-10\">2, In a trademark case in which a wine company, in opposing an application for the cancelation of its trademark, and claiming prior use, established by its officers a use of the mark since 1895, and the only testimony against its contention was a photograph, being one of its exhibits, purporting to have been taken in that year, showing some of its employees seated upon and about several barrels of its goods, upon the ends of which was stenciled a mark somewhat similar, but essentially different, mark, it was <em>held </em>that the stenciling of the barrels might have been an experimental variation of the mark in question, and that the priority of the use claimed had been sufficiently shown.</syllabus>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b23-12\">No. 739.</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"Ajh\">Patent Appeals.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"Am\">Submitted November 20, 1911.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Av\">Decided December 4, 1911.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Hearing on an appeal from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents sustaining a petition for the cancelation of a trademark registration.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Au\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-5\">The facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-6\"><em>Mr. Walter E.

S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1275), and, if so, whether appellee is entitled to priority of adoption and use. Appellant\u2019s mark is a label containing certain pictorial representations \u201cthe essential feature of which,\u201d as stated in its application, \u201cis the representation of a vineyard, a herd of camels, and two men bearing a grape.\u201d These men are apparently garbed in the costumes of Bible times, and this particular feature of the mark was undoubtedly inspired by the allusion in Numbers XIII. 23, to the cutting of a cluster of grapes and the bearing of it between two upon a staff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-11\">An examination of appellant\u2019s mark shows that the \u201ctwo men bearing a grape\u201d is its most striking feature. The figures of the men are considerably larger than the figures of the camels, and even the bunch of grapes carried by the men looks larger than any of the camels.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-12\">The mark claimed by appellee is a label containing a pictorial representation of two men with dress similar to that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>appellant\u2019s mark, these men bearing a bunch of grapes between them as in appellant\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">We think it is apparent, without argument, that the two marks are deceptively similar within the meaning of the statute. It goes without saying that one has no right to incorporate the mark of another as an essential feature of his mark. Such a practice would lead to no end of confusion, and deprive the owner of a mark of the just protection which the law accords him.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Appellant\u2019s mark was first used in this country in about 1898. We will here briefly review the evidence introduced by the appellee as to when it first adopted and used its mark. Fred. J. Keisel, a man sixty-seven years of age, the organizer of the California Winery Company, in the summer of 1895, and familiar with its affairs since that date, testified that upon the organization of the company he visited an engraver in Sacramento, California, and there selected from among the designs shown him \u201cthe picture, or design, of Joshua and Caleb carrying between them, suspended on a pole, a large bunch of grapes;\u201d that this design, was immediately used as the company\u2019s trademark, and soon thereafter, at the suggestion of the witness, it was registered in Mida\u2019s Criterion, a liquor trademark registry bureau. A certificate of this registration w'as issued by this bureau under date of September 16, 1895. The witness further testified that he had personal knowledge that this \u201cJoshua and Caleb\u201d mark had been in continuous use by appellee since its adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Fred W. Keisel, a son of the previous witness, and a banker by occupation, testified that he was the president of the appellee company; that he was first connected with the company in 1894, as manager; that he was sent there by his father, who then had an option to purchase the winery, which option was taken up early in July of 1895; that this \u201cJoshua and Caleb\u201d mark was immediately thereafter adopted, and has ever since constituted the company\u2019s mark. The witness gave the names and addresses of individuals and firms to whom his company had shipped goods under this mark from 1895 to the present time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>He identified a circular bearing this mark and containing in writing \u201cJuly 10th, 1895.\u201d This notation, be testified, was in bis own handwriting and presumably made on the date it appears to have been made. The witness further testified that when the cement sidewalk in front of the premises occupied by the winery company was constructed, in December, 1895, be procured a woodcut of his trademark about <em>12 </em>inches square, and impressed the mark in the sidewalk in two or three places, and that the impression has been there ever since. This last testimony was directly corroborated by the elder Keisel and also by a Mr. Sheehan, who testified that at the time the impression was made in the sidewalk be lived within two or three blocks of the winery, frequently passed the premises, and observed this \u201cJoshua and Caleb\u201d mark, with the date 1895, stamped in the walk. There is considerable other testimony tending to show prior adoption and use of this trademark by appellee, but we do not deem it necessary to review it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Notwithstanding tbe above briefly outlined evidence in favor of appellee, in contradiction of which no testimony has been introduced, appellant contends that tbe mark first adopted and used by appellee was not tbe mark of tbe issue, but a mark containing a pictorial representation of two men dressed as hunters and bearing a large bunch of grapes between them. Tbis contention grows out of an exhibit introduced by appellee. Tbis exhibit is a photograph which purports to have been taken in November of 1895, and shows employees of appellee seated upon and about several barrels of appellee\u2019s goods, upon tbe ends of Avhich was stenciled a mark of two hunters bearing a large bunch of grapes between them. Tbe evidence above outlined is of two convincing a character to be overcome by tbis photograph. It may well be that tbe stenciling of these barrels was an experimental variation of tbe \u201cJoshua and Caleb\u201d mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the decision of tbe Commissioner was right, and must be affirmed. Tbe clerk will certify tbis opinion according to law. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
