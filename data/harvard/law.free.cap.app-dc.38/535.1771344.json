A. Gambrill Manufacturing Company, priority of use and registration of a trademark for flour, consisting of the words \u201cOrange Grove,\u201d together with a pictorial representation of a twig bearing two oranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Appellee made application for the registration of its mark under the ten-year clause (sec. 5) of the trademark act of February 20, 1905. It was thrown into interference with appellant\u2019s mark \u201cOrange Mills,\u201d registered in 1881. On hearing, appellant, H. Becker &amp; Company, directed its testimony to combatting the right of appellee to register its mark, on the ground that it had not enjoyed exclusive use for the ten-year period. The Commissioner of Patents, however, held appellee\u2019s mark to be a technical trademark, and that its use antedated appellant\u2019s use of its mark, and awarded priority and registration to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Counsel for appellant strenuously urges that, inasmuch as appellant was cited into the Patent Office to combat appellee\u2019s right to registration under the ten-year provision, and as that was the issue to which its testimony was directed, the finding is at variance with the pleadings and the evidence, and cannot therefore be sustained. We think, however, that the case can be disposed of without reference to this feature of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">An interference was declared under sec. <em>1 </em>of the trademark law, which provides that \u201cwhenever application is made for the registration of a trademark which is substantially identical with a trademark appropriated to goods of the same descriptive properties, for which a certificate of registration has been previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>issued to another, * * * he [the Commissioner] may declare that an interference exists.\u201d [33 Stat. at L. 726, chap. 592, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1279.] In granting the interference the Commissioner recognized that the marks wre \u201csubstantially identical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The dominating feature of both marks is the word \u201cOrange.\u201d The pictorial representation of the twig and the two oranges tends to emphasize the word \u201cOrange\u201d as the striking feature of appellee\u2019s mark. Flour bearing either of the marks would soon become known to the trade as the \u201cOrange Brand.\u201d Stencils used by appellee in marking barrels were exhibited, which omitted the twig and oranges, indicating that these were not regarded by it as essential features of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The word \u201cOrange\u201d and the words \u201cOrange Grove\u201d are geographical, and not subject to registration as technical trademarks. In fact, appellee\u2019s mill is located at Orange Grove, Maryland. This narrows appellee\u2019s right to registration to the ten-year clause of the trademark act. It failed to establish exclusive use as against appellant, for the ten years prior to the enactment of the present law, and is therefore barred from registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">This sufficiently disposes of the appeal. The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed, and the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by law required. <em>Reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
