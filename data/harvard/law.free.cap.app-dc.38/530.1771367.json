Registration of a mark applied to canned fruits and vegetables, and consisting of the word \u201cEvergreen\u201d over the representation of green string beans and accompanied by another representation of a field of green growing vegetables, is properly refused under sec. 5 of the trademark act of Congress, where it is shown that within ten years of the passage of that act, a company other than the applicant had been using the word \u201cEvergreen\u201d as a mark for goods of a similar character, as the use of the mark by the applicant for registration was not exclusive. (Eollowing <em>Worster Brewing Corp. </em>v. <em>Rueter &amp; Co. </em>30 App. D.

That the same mark has been continuously used since, and it is not- true that applicant has had exclusive use of said mark upon canned vegetables. That as he has established a valuable good will in the business of packing and selling peas under said mark and brand, he will be seriously damaged by the registration of said trademark by the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The testimony shows that Brakeley had commenced the packing and sale of canned peas, with said brand affixed, in July, 1897; that he had sold his goods with that brand in New Jersey and Pennsylvania; and that he had continued to use the same mark. Applicant\u2019s testimony showed that it, and its predecessors from whom the mark had been acquired, had used the vrord on its canned goods since some time prior to the year 1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Registration was rightly denied as a technical trademark, because the word \u201cEvergreen,\u201d as used, is clearly descriptive. See <em>Re Meyer Bors. Coffe &amp; Spice Co. </em>ante, 520; and the cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Nor is the mark entitled to registration under section 5 of the trademark act by virtue of actual and exclusive use of the mark for ten years prior to the adoption of the act, for the testimony shows that such use was not exclusive. <em>Worster Brewing Corp. </em>v. <em>Rueter &amp; Co. </em>30 App. D. C. 428-431.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The decision is right, and will be affirmed. The clerk will certify this decision to the Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
