The defendant was a resident of Massachusetts at the time of the marriage and has been so ever since. An order of notice was served upon him by registered mail. He did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>appear and the matter was heard ex parte. The court rendered judgment dismissing the action for lack of jurisdiction and the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The parties were married on December 18, 1945. They lived together in Massachusetts as man and wife until May 10,1948. On that date the defendant left the plaintiff. They continued to live in the same town but remained apart until October 1,1950, when the plaintiff moved to Connecticut. Her intention was to remain here permanently. Ever since then, she has maintained both her residence and her domicil in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The plaintiff had resided in Connecticut for less than eight months when suit was commenced. She alleged in her complaint that the cause of divorce had arisen subsequently to her removal into this state. She was thus attempting to bring the action within one of the exceptions to the statutory three-year residential requirement. This is found in \u00a7 7334 of the General Statutes, the pertinent part of which is quoted in a footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The narrow issue presented by this appeal is whether the court erred in holding that the aforementioned allegation had not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention is this: The provision of \u00a7 7334 requiring a plaintiff to reside in Connecticut for the three years next before instituting suit becomes inoperative when, as the statute recites, \u201cthe cause of divorce shall have arisen\u201d subsequently to the removal into the state; the word \u201ccause\u201d in the quoted expression must be construed to mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u201ccause of action\u201d and the word \u201carisen\u201d to mean \u201caccrued\u201d; hence the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued after she came to Connecticut, since the three-year period of continuous desertion expired on May 10, 1951. It follows, she maintains, that her action falls squarely within the statutory exception. This argument is hardly persuasive since it requires us to give to words a meaning which the legislature did not intend them to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The word \u201ccause\u201d is one of many meanings. See 6 Words &amp; Phrases (Perm. Ed.) 322. As employed in \u00a7 7334, it has the same connotation as that in which it is used in \u00a7 7327. This latter statute provides that the Superior Court may grant a divorce \u201cfor any of the following causes\u201d and then proceeds to list eight of them, including \u201cwilful desertion for three years with total neglect of duty.\u201d A \u201ccause of divorce,\u201d as that phrase is used in \u00a7 7334, refers to the ground upon which a plaintiff rests his cause of action and predicates his right to relief. It is the reason for which the legislature permits an aggrieved spouse to obtain a decree. In no sense is the phrase \u201ccause of divorce\u201d synonymous with \u201ccause of action for divorce,\u201d as the plaintiff maintains. Then again, the meaning which she attributes to the word \u201carise\u201d cannot be justified. \u201cArise\u201d means to \u201cspring up; originate.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The complaint set forth that the desertion took place on May 10, 1948, and that it continued until the date of the writ. These were essential allegations. Desertion consists not only in a specific act but also in a continuing course of conduct. <em>Colt </em>v. <em>Colt, </em>90 Conn. 658, 660, 98 A. 292; <em>Tirrell </em>v. <em>Tirrell, </em>72 Conn. 567, 570, 45 A. 153. The plaintiff\u2019s cause of divorce arose in part from what had happened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>before she acquired an abode in this state. The exception under discussion does not apply if a plaintiff, seeking a divorce on the ground of desertion, is forced to rely upon events occurring before he came to live in Connecticut. Since the act of abandonment and a substantial period of its continued existence took place while the plaintiff was domiciled in Massachusetts, it cannot be said that her cause of divorce arose after she removed to this state. See <em>Sawtell </em>v. <em>Sawtell, </em>17 Conn. 284, 287. The court was correct in dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\"> \u201cSec. 7334. WHAT residence necessary to give jurisdiction. If the plaintiff shall not have continuously resided in this state three years next before the date of the complaint, it shall be dismissed unless the cause of divorce shall have arisen subsequently to the removal into this state. ..</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
