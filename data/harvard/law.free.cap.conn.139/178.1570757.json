Hill, Jr. There are two groups of defendants. One is composed of the grandchildren of the testator. The other includes his great-grandchildren and the unborn issue of his children, all of whom are represented by a guardian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>ad litem. The case has been reserved for the advice of this court upon certain questions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Nicholas S. Hi'll, Jr., died on October 18, 1936, leaving a will dated October 7, 1932, which was admitted to probate. His widow, Florence Adheson Hill, then forty-seven years of age, survived. She died on September 9, 1942. His only children, Isabelle Hill Guthrie, a widow forty years old at the time of her father\u2019s death, and Nicholas S. Hill, 3d, then thirty-eight years of age, married and living with his wife, also survived. There were four grandchildren living at the time of the testator\u2019s death. Three of these were the children of Mrs. Guthrie, the youngest of whom was a son born September 8, 1925. The other grandchild was the son of Nicholas S. Hill, 3d, born April 22,1923. No additional grandchild has been born since the execution of the will. There are five great-grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The testator made certain specific bequests. He gave $30,000 to his daughter and $5000 to his son, outright. In the fourth article of his will he gave $50,000 to trustees with the provision that the income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>be paid to his widow for life and that at her death the principal be paid into a trust fund established for his grandchildren in the thirteenth article of the will. In the tenth article he gave $20,000 to trustees, the income therefrom to be paid to his sister for life, and upon her death the principal to be paid in equal shares to his grandchildren \u201cwho may be living at that time, per capita and not per stirpes.\u201d In the twelfth article he gave the residue of his estate to the plaintiff and to his widow, as trustees, and directed that the income be paid to his widow for life. The thirteenth article provided that upon her death the plaintiff, as the surviving trustee, should \u201cpay the principal of the above trust fund into a trust, in equal shares, per capita and not per stirpes, for the benefit of my grandchildren\u201d; that the plaintiff and the testator\u2019s daughter, Mrs. Guthrie, should be trustees of this fund; and that the income should be paid to Mrs. Guthrie, \u201cto be used in equal shares for the benefit of my grandchildren as may in her judgment be deemed proper.\u201d He further directed \u201cthe surviving executors and trustees, or executor and trustee, of this trust to pay the principal of this trust fund to each of my grandchildren, in equal proportion, when the youngest of my grandchildren then living shall have reached the age of twenty-five years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We have already held that the gift to the testator\u2019s grandchildren was a class gift. <em>Hills </em>v. <em>Birmingham, </em>131 Conn. 174, 177, 38 A.2d 604; see also <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>128 Conn. 12, 19, 20 A.2d 388. Such a class would remain open to admit any grandchild born after the execution of the will and before the event occurred or the time arrived for the closing of the class. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Welton, </em>53 Conn. 183, 184, 1 A. 633; <em>Jones\u2019 Appeal, </em>48 Conn. 60,67.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The first question posed by the reservation is whether the class is closed, and if so, on what date it closed. The grandchildren claim that the class closed when the testator\u2019s widow died on September 9,1942. If that be so, the distribution should be made as of September 8,1950, the date when the youngest of the four grandchildren, the son of Mrs. Guthrie, reached twenty-five years of age. The guardian ad litem claims on behalf of the great-grandchildren and the unborn issue of the testator\u2019s children that the class would include any grandchild whenever born. He further alleges that it would not close until the testator\u2019s daughter and son were both dead and the youngest living grandchild reached his twenty-fifth birthday, with a possible further extension of nine months if the widow of Nicholas S. Hill, 3d, was enceinte.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The resolution of these claims is to be found by applying certain recognized principles of testamentary interpretation. The cardinal rule to be followed in construing a will is to find and effectuate the intent of the testator. <em>Swole </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>111 Conn. 120, 121, 149 A. 229; <em>White </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>87 Conn. 663, 668, 89 A. 272; <em>Reaney </em>v. <em>Wall, </em>134 Conn. 663, 666, 60 A.2d 505; <em>Budington </em>v. <em>Houck, </em>134 Conn. 72, 76, 54 A.2d 671. In seeking that intent, the court looks first to the will itself. <em>Hoenig </em>v. <em>Lubetkin, </em>137 Conn. 516, 519, 79 A.2d 278. It examines the words and the language used in the light of the circumstances under which they were written. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>114 Conn. 152, 157, 158 A. 224. It studies the will as an entirety. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>123 Conn. 549, 556, 196 A. 785. The quest is to determine the meaning of what the testator said and not to speculate upon what he meant to say. <em>Swole </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>supra, 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The testator\u2019s direction in the thirteenth article of his will that, upon the death of his wife, the executor and trustee should pay the principal of the trust fund into a trust, in equal shares, per capita and not per stirpes, for the benefit of his grandchildren, expressed an intent to allocate a portion of the principal to each of his grandchildren individually at the time of the widow\u2019s death. The portion so allocated to each could be determined only if the total number of grandchildren who were to participate was definitely known. That number could not be fixed unless the class closed as of that time. Furthermore, this same article directed that the principal of the trust fund be paid to each of the testator\u2019s grandchildren, \u201cin equal proportion, when the youngest of my grandchildren <em>then living </em>shall have reached the age of twenty-five years\u201d (italics supplied). Do the words \u201cthen living\u201d refer to the event of the death of the widow and the establishment of the trust as terminating the period wherein there could be additions to the class of beneficiaries, or do they refer to the time when the youngest living grandchild who might be born to the children of the testator reaches the age of twenty-five years?</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The word \u201cthen\u201d as used in a testament may be employed to express a point in time or to designate an event. It is more frequently used in the latter sense. <em>State Street Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>228 Mass. 411, 413, 117 N.E. 832; <em>People </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>286 Ill. 511, 518, 122 N.E. 43; see <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>Somers, </em>106 Conn. 267, 275, 137 A. 737; <em>Fitzpatrick\u2019s Estate, </em>233 Pa. 33, 35, 81 A. 815. The testator\u2019s widow was forty-three years of age when the will was drawn and forty-seven when the testator died. She was only seven years older than the testator\u2019s daughter, Mrs. Guthrie, and nine years older than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>his son Nicholas, 3d. The youngest child of Mrs. Guthrie was seven years old, and the only child of Nicholas, 3d, was nine, when the will was executed. It is fair to assume that the testator intended to fix some definite and reasonable limitation on the closing of this class. It would have been logical for him to choose the death of his widow and the termination of the trust in her favor as the time when the trust for his grandchildren should become fully operative. It is reasonable to believe under the circumstances that the testator contemplated that his widow would live for a number of years and, in all probability, beyond the time when it could be expected that his daughter or his son would have any more children. Therefore, his failure to provide for the contingency of the early death of his widow does not militate against the conclusion that the class closed upon her death. Furthermore, he nominated his daughter, Mrs. Guthrie, as eotrustee with the plaintiff to administer the trust created for the benefit of his grandchildren and he gave her discretion in administering the trust. However, he gave no discretion to the survivor of these trustees, which is indicative that the testator did not expect that the closing of the class would be deferred for a long period of time but expected that his daughter would in all probability still be alive to administer the trust when the youngest living grandchild in the class reached the age of twenty-five.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Then, too, in the tenth article the testator created a trust for his sister with provision that upon her de'ath the principal should be paid in equal shares to his grandchildren \u201cwho may be living at that time.\u201d In that article he chose the event of the death of his sister and the termination of the trust for her benefit as the time for closing the class of grand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>children who would benefit as well as for the distribution of the principal of the trust fund. He made no provision in that article for any grandchild who might be born thereafter. By the fifth article, the testator bequeathed $30,000 to his daughter, and by the sixth, $5000 to his son, with the qualifying wrords, \u201cas evidence that I bear him no ill will.\u201d His son had been divorced and had remarried. See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Birmingham, </em>131 Conn. 174, 177, 38 A.2d 604, which involves an earlier construction of the same will. The son\u2019s child was born of his first marriage. In the light of these specific bequests, it is difficult to believe that the testator intended to prefer possible future grandchildren yet unborn, offspring of the son and his second wife in numbers unknown, to the three living grandchildren of Ms widowed daughter. While his widow may have died earlier than the testator contemplated, nevertheless, so far as the birth of additional grandchildren is concerned events have taken place much as he anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We conclude that the intent of the testator expressed in his will was that the class of beneficiaries comprised of the grandchildren should close upon the death of his widow. Consequently, distribution should be made as of September 8,1950, when Mrs. Guthrie\u2019s son, the youngest living grandchild, reached the age of twenty-five years. Casner, \u201cClass Gifts to Others than to \u2018Heirs\u2019 or \u2018Next of Kin\u2019\u2014 Increase in the Class Membership,\u201d 51 Harv. L. Rev. 254, 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">This conclusion effectuates the intent of the testator. To adopt the construction claimed by the guardian ad litem would lead to unreasonable results. Such a construction conceivably could mean postponing the closing of the class of beneficiaries until the testator\u2019s son lived to reach a very advanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>age, for the law may presume a man capable of parenthood so long as he is alive. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Root, </em>86 Conn. 90, 96, 84 A. 295. It would operate to delay the outright possession of the gift by the beneficiaries for a longer period of time than the testator could have intended, to prolong the period of administration and to lessen the value of the gift by reason of the additional expense involved. Our law has always been solicitous that there be a complete settlement of a decedent\u2019s estate as soon as that is possible. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Merriam, 9 </em>Conn. 225, 228; 2 Locke &amp; Kohn, Conn. Probate Practice, \u00a7 262, p. 39. The construction claimed by the guardian ad litem requires clearer language to that effect than that contained in the will before the court. <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Protestant Orphan Asylum, </em>76 Conn. 560, 564, 57 A. 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We answer the first question, \u201cYes, on September 9, 1942.\u201d The answer to the first question makes it unnecessary to answer the second and third.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">No costs will be taxed in this court to any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\"> \u201c[!.] Has the elass of grandchildren of the testator entitled to the principal of said trust fund closed, and if so, what is the date as of which said elass closed?</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u201c[2.] If the elass of grandchildren of the testator entitled to the principal of said trust fund has not closed, what will be the determinative date or event as of whieh said class will close and the principal of said trust will be distributable?</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">\u201c[3.] Has the question as to the date as of whieh the class of the testator\u2019s grandchildren entitled to the principal of said trust fund closed been so determined by the decision of the [Superior] Court in Case Number 57812, \u2018Nicholas S.
