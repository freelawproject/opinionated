Plaintiff Bowles's claims in Count I are dismissed with prejudice, except as to any claims that relate to the TCR Provision, which are dismissed without prejudice. Plaintiffs' recordkeeping claim in Count I is also dismissed with prejudice. The rest of Count I and Counts II-VI are dismissed without prejudice. Plaintiffs are given until April 15, 2019 to file an amended complaint consistent with this opinion. The case is set for further status on April 23, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. Finally, Defendants' request for oral argument [63] is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

There shall be no reduction in the amount of training costs owed by you in the event your employment is terminated during the first year of service as a financial advisor of Edward Jones. This obligation shall be reduced by $ 9,375.00 for each full quarter year of service beginning the thirteenth month of your employment as a financial advisor of Edward Jones.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.] During the first or \"self-study\" stage, trainees study for industry licensing exams using written online materials on computers loaned to them by Defendants.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.] At the end of that stage, trainees take and must pass the FINRA Series 7 and 66 licensing exams.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Series 7 and 66 licenses are essential to the successful completion of the training program, and FA Trainees must pass the exams on their first try or be fired.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The second or \"door knock\" stage, begins with one week of on-site training in either St. Louis, Missouri or Tempe, Arizona, followed by seven weeks of knocking on doors in a designated neighborhood to obtain individuals' contact information. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.] This stage ends with another on-site week, designated as \"Evaluation/Graduation,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   where Defendants determine whether trainees \"can sell\" to prospective clients. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During this Study Calendar period, trainees are paid on a bi-weekly basis. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.] The trainees also qualify as overtime eligible. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Although Defendants expect trainees to work 45 hours during the first stage and 60 hours during the second stage, the projected bi-weekly pay does not vary between the two periods. [39-3, at 2.] Rather, Defendants adjust the hourly rate between the two periods such that individuals like Plaintiffs are paid an almost identical amount in both periods.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] This \"projected gross pay\" includes the overtime trainees are expected to work. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] However, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants neither track nor compensate trainees for the hours that they actually work. [35, \u00b6 20.] Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants' policy and practice \"knowingly discourages * * * [trainees] from accurately reporting all of the hours they work and fails to pay * * * [trainees] wages and overtime for the work they perform.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon achieving \"can sell\" status, trainees become \"new financial advisors\" and Defendants classify them as overtime \"exempt.\" [35, \u00b6 23; 39-3, at 2.] Financial Advisors are salaried, though the salary begins to fluctuate based on performance after four months. [39-3, at 2-3.] However, a financial advisor's salary includes a \"minimum guaranteed salary\" (\"MGS\") that does not fluctuate and is paid regardless of performance. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] What amount of a financial advisor's salary is composed of MGS \"is determined by the applicable federal and state guidelines where [the advisor's] branch is located.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As new financial advisors, individuals such as Plaintiffs solicit \"door knock\" contacts to become clients. [35, \u00b6 23.] They receive little training during this period, which primarily constitutes \"access to a Regional Trainer and wholesaler presentations by 'preferred partner' firms whose products the Firm pushes [new financial advisors] to sell to clients.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] However, their primary duty is to sell financial products. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In fact, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants instructed them to \"sell these financial products without regard to the clients' individual needs, financial circumstances, or investment objectives.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.] Nor were Plaintiffs placed in job positions \"whose primary duty was to perform work directly related to the management or general business operations of Edward Jones or clients * * *.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs worked for Defendants at various offices around the country and at various periods between January 2014 and June 2016.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 45, 54, 63.] Specifically, each alleges that he or she worked (1) more than 45 hours during the \"self-study\" stage, (2) more than 60 hours during the\n   \"door knock\" stage, and (3) more than 40 hours a week after achieving \"can sell\" status. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 46, 55, 64.] Plaintiffs allege that they were never compensated for all the hours that they worked and did not receive the meaningful training and/or \"lucrative career\" that they were promised. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40, 47-48, 56-57, 65-66.] Instead, Plaintiffs allege that they were each constructively discharged or otherwise forced to leave, and that Defendants later demanded that they pay either all or some portion of the $ 75,000 required under the TCR Provision that exceeds the amount they were paid during their entire employment with Defendants. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41, 49-50, 58-58, 67-68.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In response to this conduct, Plaintiffs filed this purported collective and class action suit alleging multiple violations of the FLSA and various Illinois and Missouri statutes on March 13, 2018.

As in\n   <em>\n    Park\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs explicitly agreed that the reimbursable amount \"bears a reasonable relationship to the computed damages Edward Jones would suffer from a breach by you and that Edward Jones will suffer demonstrable loss as result of your breach.\" [39-2, \u00b6 21.] Although the Court is somewhat skeptical that the actual costs of training totaled $ 75,000-especially considering that the contract explicitly notes that the $ 75,000 includes \"the cost of selection and hiring\"-the Court cannot infer from the contract that Defendants seek reimbursement for the tools of the trade or costs incurred in the performance of Plaintiffs' jobs.

[39-2, \u00b6 21.] Moreover, unlike the purported training in\n   <em>\n    Ketner\n   </em>\n   , the training here did result in Plaintiffs' receiving portable credentials-namely, Series 7 and 66 licenses.

Plaintiffs have not cited, nor has this Court located, any case that suggests employers may not act to collect a debt incurred for an employee's benefit at the termination of their employment on the basis that such a collection is a kickback that would reduce Plaintiffs' wages below the statutory minimum. In fact, courts have held just to the contrary. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Vazquez v. Tri-State Mgmt. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%2058718\">\n    2002 WL 58718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 14, 2002) (counterclaim against employee to recover on loan used to purchase a vehicle for the employee's use, at the employee's request, was not an impermissible set-off under \u00a7 531.35 ). Moreover, Defendants never reduced Plaintiffs wages below the minimum wage while they were employed, so all the case law stating an employer may not do so is inapposite. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Calderon v. Witvoet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11960155\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/1101/#p1107\">\n    999 F.2d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1107 (7th Cir. 1993) (noting employers \"may not reduce the wage below the statutory minimum to collect a debt to the employer\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   All the arguments that Plaintiffs raise against the TCR Provision-that $ 75,000 does not bear a rational resemblance to the costs Defendants actually incurred in their training, that Defendants used the threat of the TCR Provision to force Plaintiffs to work extra allegedly uncompensated time,\n   <em>\n    etc.\n   </em>\n   , see, e.g. [35, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26]-are either potential defenses to the enforcement of the contract that Plaintiffs could\n   raise if and when Defendants attempt to enforce the provision or possible reasons to invalidate the contract as a matter of state law. They are not reasons to find that the TRC Provision violates the FLSA. The TCR Provision does not violate the FLSA because it is not a kickback, but rather constitutes to a loan that Plaintiffs' accrued when they achieved \"can sell\" status. Consequently, any payment under the TCR Provision is not a kickback that would reduce the Plaintiffs' wages to below the statutory minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Because Plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the TCR Provision, and in any event fail to state a claim, the Court grants Defendants' motion as to Plaintiffs' claims in Count I regarding the TCR Provision.

In addition to their claims for overtime during their non-exempt employment addressed above, Plaintiffs assert Defendants should have continued to pay them overtime once they achieved \"can sell\" status because they were misclassified as \"exempt\" under both the \"salary basis\" and \"job duties\" tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Plaintiffs' fail to allege that they worked overtime\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Before examining either of those claims, however, the Court must determine whether Plaintiffs' have adequately alleged that they worked overtime once they were classified as exempt given that for the affirmative defense to apply there must have been an underlying offense. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ottaviano v. Home Depot, Inc., USA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3936049\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/701/1005/#p1007\">\n    701 F.Supp.2d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1007-08 (N.D.

Plaintiffs simply allege (1) that they \"routinely worked in excess of 40 hours per week after their 'can-sell' date, without receiving proper overtime pay\" and (2) that each Plaintiff \"[a]fter achieving 'can-sell' status, * * * continued to work long hours, well in excess of 40 hours per week * * *.\" [35, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 38, 46, 55, 64.] As the Court previously explained, without more, such formulaic and conclusory allegations are simply not enough to state a claim for overtime. Moreover, even if Plaintiffs had properly alleged an overtime violation after Plaintiffs achieved \"can sell\" status, they have not yet alleged facts to show that they were misclassified as exempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Plaintiffs' allegations do not show they fail the salary basis test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they were not paid a guaranteed, predetermined salary within the meaning of the regulations above because (1) Defendants \"paid Plaintiffs and those similarly situated wages on the condition that Plaintiffs and those similarly situated pay 'training costs' up to $ 75,000 under certain circumstances\" and (2) Plaintiffs' \"wages were subject to reduction because of alleged variations in the quality or quantity of work performed.\" [35, \u00b6\u00b6 84-85.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   First, as explained above, the TCR Provision has no effect vis-\u00e0-vis the FLSA's wage and hours requirements. It is not a kickback of Plaintiffs' salaries, but a contractual debt owed by Plaintiffs. Thus,\n   Plaintiffs cannot show that they fail the salary basis test by claiming their employment was subject to the TCR Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiffs' citation to\n   <em>\n    Ketner\n   </em>\n   and the Department of Labor Opinion Letters that it addressed are unavailing. First, the Court has already explained why it disagrees with\n   <em>\n    Ketner\n   </em>\n   's conclusion that the TCR Provision constitutes a kickback with implications under the FLSA. See Section III(A)(1)\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the Department of Labor Opinion Letters on which\n   <em>\n    Ketner\n   </em>\n   relied and that the additional letters cited by Plaintiffs also are unpersuasive. Each of the letters involved either a purposed deduction from an employee's paycheck to recover a previous payment that the DOL concluded did not constitute a loan or other inapposite situation. See U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Opinion Letter (Nov. 27, 2006),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203832994\">\n    2006 WL 3832994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 n.5 (\"What matters is that the employee receives no less than the weekly-required amount as a guaranteed salary constituting all or part of total compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction due to the quality or quantity of the work performed, and that the employee is never required to repay any portion of that salary even if the employee fails to earn sufficient commissions or fees\"); U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Opinion Letter (Mar. 10, 2006),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20940663\">\n    2006 WL 940663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (\"deductions from the salaries of otherwise exempt employees for the loss, damage, or destruction of the employer's funds or property due to the employees' failure to properly carry out their managerial duties * * * would defeat the exemption * * *\"); U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Opinion Letter (Feb. 20, 2001),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%201558760\">\n    2001 WL 1558760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (concluding that the two programs at issue were both incentive programs, and not bona fide loans or cash advances, which precluded the company from deducting amounts related to those programs from the pharmacists' last paychecks).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As explained above, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Ketner\n   </em>\n   or the DOL letters examined above convinces the Court that it should treat the TCR Provision as a kickback of the Plaintiffs' salaries designed to punish them if they failed to perform to a certain level. Rather, it is an education loan which only requires repayment if an individual attempts to use that education for the benefit of a competitor. As explained above, an employer may enforce such a provision without falling afoul of the FLSA. Plaintiffs therefore cannot ground their salary basis challenge on the TCR Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiffs' second allegation likewise fails to plausibly allege that their compensation did not meet the salary basis test. While Plaintiffs reference a compensation plan in their complaint and allege that their compensation was contingent on performance and decreased within a few months of achieving \"can sell\" status during the transition to commission pay [35, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 23], that compensation plan-which Defendants attached to their motion-provides that Plaintiffs' compensation shall never fall below $ 455 a week. [39-3, at 3 (explaining that Plaintiffs are guaranteed at least $ 23,660 annually, or $ 455 a week).] The Court may properly consider such an exhibit attached to a motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

Plaintiffs' allegations do not show they fail the job duties test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they do not meet the job duties test because their primary duties \"did not include the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.\" [35, \u00b6 85.] Rather, they were encouraged \"to sell [ ] financial products without regard to the clients' individual needs, financial circumstances, or investment objectives.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Specifically, they were instructed to sell financial products, mostly Defendants' proprietary products and those pre-picked and designated as \"preferred product partners,\" which generated additional fees for Defendants.

To the extent that Plaintiffs argue that their allegations explaining that their role was simply to sell financial products, the Court finds persuasive both the DOL opinion letters and opinions holding sales activities by licensed financial advisors are exempt because such sales inherently involve their professional judgment given FINRA's requirements. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Hein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696925\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/511/563/#p566\">\n    511 F.Supp.2d at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the DOL \"has sought to exempt from the FLSA investment advisors in the financial services industry-including those engaged in 'sales'-provided their sales activities are a function of their professional judgment respecting their clients' best interests\"). Plaintiffs' allegations that they sold \"financial products without regard to the clients' individual needs, financial circumstances, or investment objectives\" do not change the Court's conclusion.

Bowles's argument that he did not know of his harm until he received the notice seeking payment under the TRC Provision, and that the statute of limitations should therefore be tolled is inapposite given that argument only applies to Plaintiffs' claims under the TCR Provision. Thus, the Court grants Defendants' motion to dismiss Bowles from Count I with prejudice as to any claims that do not pertain to the TCR Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Plaintiffs' recordkeeping claim in Count I is also dismissed with prejudice. The remainder of Count I and Counts II-VI are dismissed without prejudice.

Consequently, the Court understands Plaintiffs as alleging only a failure to pay overtime during the non-exempt period, and not that plaintiffs also failed to receive the minimum wage.
