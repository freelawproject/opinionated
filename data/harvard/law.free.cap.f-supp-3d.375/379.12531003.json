Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Before the court is one of the first cases arising under the First Step Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-391,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%205194\">\n    132 Stat. 5194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (\"the First Step Act\" or \"the Act\"). Defendant Cheyenne Simons was sentenced over a decade ago to a twelve-year term of imprisonment for his role in a criminal conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine. He now moves to have his sentence reduced pursuant to Section 404 of the First Step Act. The Act permits courts to retroactively lower the sentence of a defendant convicted of certain Controlled Substances Act violations involving crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The United States concedes that Simons is eligible for resentencing but argues that the court should decline to revisit its original sentence. \"Nothing in the First Step Act,\" it contends, \"changes the court's\n   original assessment of the Section 3553(a) factors or suggests that a sentence should be arbitrarily reduced.\" Gov't Letter 5, ECF No. 754, Mar. 27, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The government is mistaken. We now have two well-considered statements of federal policy by Congress since the defendant was originally sentenced-the First Step Act and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111-220,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Stat.%202372\">\n    124 Stat. 2372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (\"the Fair Sentencing Act\"). Both favor sending fewer people to prison, imposing shorter sentences for drug crimes, and reducing the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. The court must consider this new governmental policy when deciding whether a reduction of defendant's sentence is warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sent. Hr'g Tr., Apr. 22, 2019,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   An extra year, day, or moment of freedom from prison, when warranted, is worth pursuing by a prisoner, and, if justified by the law, should be granted by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant's motion is granted. His sentence is reduced to time served. An amended judgment and conviction shall be filed forthwith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After serving more than 136 months of his 144-month original sentence, Simons is now eligible for immediate release. While this decision does not substantially shorten his sentence, justice favors freedom over unnecessary incarceration. Every day of imprisonment that can be appropriately shortened in a case like this should be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shaila Dewan &amp; Alan Binder,\n   <em>\n    Just How Much of an Overhaul Is This Overhaul of the Nation's Criminal Justice System?\n   </em>\n   N.Y.

Mar. 6, 2019) (denying request to impose a below-time-served sentence because it \"would result in an overserved sentence, which ... will not [be] permit[ed] for public safety and deterrence reasons.\"); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(C) (instructing that a reduction of a term of imprisonment because of an amendment to the guidelines \"[i]n no event may ... be less than the term of imprisonment the defendant has already served\"). He is sentenced to four years of supervised release on all counts concurrent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sent. Hr'g Tr., Apr. 22, 2019. He will be subject to extensive monitoring while on supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Probation is directed to take immediate control over defendant's reentry into lawful life, with close supervision for sixty days as requested by probation. Probation shall work to secure for him: housing, food, employment, and other requirements of a lawful life. This period of extra help for defendant is the equivalent of the time provided by the Bureau of Prisons at the end of a long prison term for reentry into freedom from prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Simons has served more than eleven years in federal custody. An eight-month reduction of his sentence does not provide less than just punishment nor does it undermine general or specific deterrence. It promotes respect for the law while reflecting society's changing views about incarceration and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities between similarly-situated defendants. It helps close the sentencing gap between crack and powder cocaine offenses and eliminates the disparity between defendant and those sentenced after the Fair Sentencing Act was enacted in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In imposing a reduction of defendant's sentence, this court considered Congress's intention, first with the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 and now with the First Step Act of 2018, to limit government spending on incarceration and to decrease the number of inmates in federal custody.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). Public safety is not served by a defendant spending more time in prison than necessary. An overly harsh sentence may prove counterproductive, increasing a defendant's likelihood to recidivate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Dewan &amp; Binder,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The money it costs to keep defendant behind bars can be better spent on other means of crime control and prevention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 115-699, at 23 (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Defendant Cheyenne Simons's motion to reduce his sentence is granted. His term of incarceration is reduced to time served. The term of supervised release shall be four years, concurrent on all counts. The original sentence remains unchanged in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Probation shall take immediate steps to assist the defendant in adjusting to his new freedom and to live a lawful, productive life after so many years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   An amended judgment and conviction reflecting the terms of this memorandum and order shall be filed forthwith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
