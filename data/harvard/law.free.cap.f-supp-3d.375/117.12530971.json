According to Plaintiff, this assignment was meant to end in August 2015. Plaintiff was initially interviewed for the position over the phone by Ms. Dagg. When she began her employment, and Ms. Dagg learned Plaintiff's race, Plaintiff was placed at a \"countertop space\" to work with the only other person of color in the office even though there were several cubicles available. She was assured this was only a temporary arraignment, but it did not change. For the duration of her employment, Plaintiff was\n   largely ignored. Ms. Dagg did not respond to her emails which contained inquiries about the position and its responsibilities. In addition, Ms. Dagg did not assign Plaintiff any work. On May 22, 2015, Ms. Dagg terminated Plaintiff's contract, purportedly due to her lack of technical skills. Plaintiff believes these reasons were pretextual and that she was in fact treated differently and fired because of her race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff brought her claim to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\") which found lack of probable cause.

It is plausible that she was qualified for her position since Ms. Dagg hired her after reviewing her credentials and conducting a phone interview.

Finally, Plaintiff alleges that after Ms. Dagg learned her race, she was ostracized in the office. Her emails were ignored, she was never trained to do her\n   job, and she was made to work in a separate and smaller workspace. Subsequently, Plaintiff's employment was terminated earlier than agreed upon. Taking these allegations as true, it is plausible that Plaintiff was treated differently, and ultimately fired, because of her race. At this stage, a \"plaintiff must allege a series of facts which at the very least gives rise to an inference of discriminatory animus.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.
