(collectively, \"Appaloosa\") on the other, over the distribution of approximately $ 700 million in proceeds from the October 2015 sale of the Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town property (\"Stuy Town\"). In Appaloosa's view, a portion of the funds that are currently allocated to CWC should instead be deposited into a Gain-on-Sale Reserve Account for the benefit of Certificateholders. In March 2018, this Court denied CWC's and Appaloosa's cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the governing agreements (and, in particular, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (\"PSA\") ) are ambiguous. Shortly thereafter, Appaloosa filed an Amended Answer, in which it asserted a cross-claim against CWC. Before the Court is CWC's motion to dismiss the cross-claim for lack of standing. Here, unlike those provisions discussed in the Court's March 2018 Opinion and Order, the relevant provisions of the PSA are unambiguous. For the reasons stated below, the Court grants CWC's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court's Opinion and Order of March 9, 2018, provides a thorough review of the relevant facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re the Trusts Established under the Pooling &amp; Servicing Agreements\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 Civ. 1998 (KPF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201229702\">\n    2018 WL 1229702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    PSA I\n   </em>\n   \"). As a result, this Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and will only discuss what is necessary to resolve the instant motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 11, 2018, approximately one month after the Court denied the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings, the parties appeared before the Court for a conference. (Am. Answer \u00b6 205). During that conference, Appaloosa stated its intention to assert a cross-claim against CWC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 206). In response, CWC expressed \"disbelief that Appaloosa actually had acquired over 25% of the Voting Rights,\" as required for Certificateholders to bring any action under the PSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 207). That issue is at the heart of the instant motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Generally speaking, only the Trustee is authorized to act on behalf of the Trusts. However, individual Certificateholders are allowed to assert claims on behalf of the Trusts so long as they comply with the No Action Clause in Section 11.03(c) of the PSA, which requires, among other things, that Certificateholders with at least 25% of the Voting Rights provide the Trustee with a written notice of default and give the Trustee an opportunity to take the action requested to address the default. (PSA \u00a7 11.03).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Several days prior to the conference with the Court, on April 6, 2018, Appaloosa had sent CWC and the Trustee written notice of default. (Am. Answer \u00b6 175). \"Specifically, among other things, Appaloosa informed CWC that its failure to allocate approximately $ 764 million of the Stuy Town sale proceeds as Gain-on-Sale Proceeds for deposit into the Stuy Town CMBS Trusts' respective Gain-on-Sale Reserve Accounts violated relevant portions ... of the PSA[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44). On May 5, 2018, after CWC failed to cure the defaults of which it was notified, Appaloosa sent a written direction to the Trustee that advised the Trustee of what it perceived to be a continuing default and requested that the Trustee bring a direct action on behalf of the C30 Trust against CWC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 230). In that letter, Appaloosa also offered to provide a reasonable indemnity to the Trustee, as required by the PSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 10, 2018, the Trustee responded to Appaloosa's letter, indicating that it did not intend to commence suit as directed. (Am. Answer \u00b6 235). Accordingly, Appaloosa sought the Court's permission to amend its Answer to assert a cross-claim against CWC. (Dkt. # 231). The Court granted Appaloosa's request based \"in large part on Appaloosa's representations that [ ] it holds sufficient voting rights to satisfy the no-action clauses in the pooling and servicing agreements such that it may properly bring the contemplated cross-claim against CWC.\" (Dkt. # 236). As a result, Appaloosa filed its Amended Answer on June 16, 2018. (Dkt. # 239).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 1, 2018, CWC filed a motion to dismiss Appaloosa's cross-claim. (Dkt. # 244-46). Appaloosa filed its opposition on August 22, 2018 (Dkt. # 256-58), and the motion was fully briefed with the filing of CWC's reply on June 26, 2014 (Dkt. # 261). The Court now considers the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Appaloosa Lacks Standing to File Its Cross-Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   CWC mounts a facial challenge to Appaloosa's standing to file its cross-claim. Specifically, CWC argues that Appaloosa has not plausibly alleged standing because it is not in compliance with the PSA's No Action Clause, and, thus, is unable to bring its cross-claim under the PSA. (CWC Br. 5-13). CWC's argument hinges on the textual interpretation of several provisions of the No Action Clause, as well as a related section of the PSA specifying how Voting Rights are calculated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Each party argues that all relevant provisions are unambiguous and should be interpreted in its favor. The Court begins by addressing the No Action Clause Language, and then proceeds to determine the proper method by which to calculate Appaloosa's share of Voting Rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The No Action Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To review, the No Action Clause requires that prior to instituting an action under the PSA, a Certificateholder must fulfill certain conditions. (PSA \u00a7 11.03). Specifically, the No Action Clause dictates that (i) a Certificateholder must give the Trustee written notice of a continuing default under the PSA; (ii) Certificateholders who own at least 25% of the Voting Rights must direct the Trustee to institute an action and offer the Trustee a reasonable indemnity in connection therewith; and (iii) the Trustee must fail to file suit within 60 days of receiving the direction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Only when those three conditions are met may a Certificateholder initiate an action under the PSA. In full, the No Action Clause states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   No Certificateholder shall have any right by virtue of any provision of this Agreement to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Agreement or any Mortgage Loan, unless, with respect to any suit, action or proceeding upon or under or with respect to this Agreement, such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee a written notice of default hereunder, and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also (except in the case of a default by the Trustee) the\n   <em>\n    Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 25% of the Voting Rights shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee\n   </em>\n   hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee, for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (PSA \u00a7 11.03 (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In brief, CWC asserts that Appaloosa has not satisfied the No Action Clause's conditions, and therefore is barred from bringing its cross-claim. (CWC Br. 2). Appaloosa disagrees for two reasons. (Appaloosa Opp. 8-16).\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , according to Appaloosa, the No Action Clause does not require Certificateholders to hold 25% of Voting Rights at the time a suit is filed (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-16); and\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , the Clause does not require every certificateholder who provided written notice to the Trustee to be a named plaintiff in a subsequent action (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-13). The Court agrees with Appaloosa's analysis on both points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The No Action Clause Does Not Require Holders of Certificates to Hold 25% at the Time a Suit Is Filed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As its first line of argument, CWC asserts that Appaloosa's cross-claim is are barred because it did not have 25% of the Voting Rights on June 18, 2018, when it filed its amended Order and Answer. (CWC Br. 6). However, the PSA contains no such requirement. Instead, the No Action Clause states that the Certificateholders must hold at least 25% of the Voting Rights when directing the Trustee to initiate the action under its own name. (PSA \u00a7 11.03). At no point does the No Action Clause indicate, as CWC claims, that the Certificateholders must continue to hold at least 25% of the Voting Rights at the time of filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   New York law is clear that, when interpreting a PSA, courts should be \"extremely reluctant to interpret an agreement as impliedly stating something which the parties have neglected to specifically include.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACE Sec.

If these sophisticated parties, represented by counsel, intended to make the bringing of a Certificateholder action conditioned upon holding 25% of the Voting Rights at the time of filing, they easily could have included a provision to that effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fundamental Long Term Care Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cammeby's Funding LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754393\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/20/438/#p439\">\n    20 N.Y.3d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 439,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754393\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/20/438/#p439\">\n    962 N.Y.S.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754393\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/20/438/#p439\">\n    985 N.E.2d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). This Court cannot, under the guise of interpretation, read in an additional term that distorts the PSA's meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In its counterargument, CWC bypasses the language of the No Action Clause, insisting instead that \"New York courts interpreting identical no-action clause language consistently require compliance with\n   the no-action clause as of the filing date and dismiss claims as a matter of law where certificate holders have not so complied.\" (CWC Br. 7). This argument is both distracting and incorrect.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , neither party disputes that Appaloosa must be in compliance with the No Action Clause as of the date of filing. What is in dispute is what conditions a Certificateholder must satisfy in order to be in compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , neither of the two cases cited by CWC stands for the proposition that a party would have to maintain a certain percentage of the Voting Rights at the time of filing. (CWC Br. 7). In\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New York United Hotels\n   </em>\n   , the First Department dismissed the action because Plaintiff, a bondholder who held his securities subject to the conditions of an underlying trust agreement, did not include in his complaint any \"allegations showing compliance with these provisions of the trust agreement.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5028055\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad/236/647/\">\n    236 A.D. 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=260%20N.Y.S.%20405\">\n    260 N.Y.S. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 407 (1st Dep't 1932),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2005281\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/261/698/\">\n    261 N.Y. 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20N.E.%20798\">\n    185 N.E. 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1933). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Greenwich Financial Services Distressed Mortgage Fund 3, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Countrywide Financial Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs argued that they were not bound by the procedural requirements of the No Action Clause in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Index No. 650474/08,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%209525799\">\n    2010 WL 9525799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-4 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Oct. 7, 2010). The court disagreed and dismissed the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Neither case discusses whether parties must maintain the requisite Voting Rights percentage at the time of filing, and, thus, neither case is applicable to the issue at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The No-Action Clause Does Not Require Azteca to Be a Party to the Cross-Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Next, CWC argues that a separate entity, Azteca Partners LLC (\"Azteca\") must be a named plaintiff in the instant action in order for Appaloosa to be in compliance with the No Action Clause and for the cross-claim to move forward. (CWC Br. 5). Additional background is needed to fully understand CWC's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As previously discussed, on May 7, 2018, Appaloosa - in coordination with another investment fund, Azteca - issued a direction to the Trustee to initiate litigation on behalf of the C30 Trust against CWC. (Am. Answer \u00b6 230; Appaloosa Opp., Ex. A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Per the No Action Clause, the written direction to the Trustee must be made by Certificateholders who have at least 25% of the Voting Rights. (PSA \u00a7 11.03). Appaloosa alleges that as of May 7, 2018, the combined Voting Rights of Appaloosa and Azteca exceeded 25 percent. (Am. Answer \u00b6\u00b6 178 n.1, 233-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   CWC's argument, which is based on a misinterpretation of the No Action Clause, is simple: All Certificateholders constituting part of the 25% Voting Rights block who provide written direction to the Trustee must be named plaintiffs in the subsequent suit. (CWC Br. 5-6). Therefore, CWC asserts, because Azteca is not named as a plaintiff and because Appaloosa does not independently own 25% of the Voting Rights, the cross-claim must be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Once again, CWC reads into the No Action Clause a requirement that is not there. There is no requirement in the No Action Clause that a suit must be instituted by all of the Certificateholders who made up the 25% Voting Rights block. Instead, the language in the No Action Clause specifically moves from the singular to the plural: \"No\n   <em>\n    Certificateholder\n   </em>\n   shall have any right ... to institute any suit,\" unless, \"such\n   <em>\n    Holder\n   </em>\n   previously shall have given the Trustee a written notice of\n   default hereunder, ... and unless also ... the\n   <em>\n    Holders of Certificates\n   </em>\n   entitled to at least 25% of the Voting Rights shall have made written request upon the Trustee to initiate such action.\" (PSA \u00a7 11.03 (emphases added) ). If the drafters of the PSA had intended to include a requirement that all members of the 25% Voting Rights block be named as plaintiffs, they would not have included the distinction between those\n   <em>\n    Holders of Certificates\n   </em>\n   , plural, who must make the written request upon the Trustee, and any\n   <em>\n    Certificateholder\n   </em>\n   , singular, who may initiate the approved, follow-on suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Furthermore, the plain reading of the PSA is not incongruous with the general purpose of No Action Clauses: to make it more difficult for individual investors to bring suits that are either frivolous or otherwise not in the interest of their fellow investors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quadrant Structured Prod. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vertin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223209\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/23/549/#p565\">\n    23 N.Y.3d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223209\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/23/549/#p565\">\n    992 N.Y.S.2d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223209\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/23/549/#p565\">\n    16 N.E.3d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Allowing Certificateholders, who may individually have less than 25% of the Voting Rights, to bring an action would not open the floodgates to large numbers of frivolous claims. That is because individual Certificateholders would still need to muster a similarly-minded group that, in the aggregate, holds at least 25% of the Voting Rights to initiate the process through written notification to the Trustee. Then, those individual investors are only authorized to bring \"such action, suit or proceeding\" that was initiated by the larger group. (PSA \u00a7 11.03). For that reason, in addition to the plain language of the PSA, Azteca does not need to be a named plaintiff to this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The PSA's Language Regarding the Method of Calculation for Voting Rights Is Unambiguous\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Having determined that the language of the No Action Clause is unambiguous, the Court turns to the methodology by which Voting Rights are calculated under the PSA. To review, according to the plain reading of the No Action Clause, if Appaloosa and Azteca had a combined 25% of the Voting Rights as of May 7, 2018, Appaloosa will have sufficiently alleged standing to bring its cross-claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Voting Rights are defined in the PSA as \"[t]he portion of the voting rights of all of the Certificates which is allocated to any Certificate.\" (PSA \u00a7 1.01). Pursuant to that definition, Voting Rights are calculated as a fraction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   the numerator of which is equal to the aggregate Certificate Balance of the related Class of Certificates\n   <em>\n    (adjusted as provided in the immediately succeeding provisos)\n   </em>\n   and the denominator of which is equal to the aggregate Certificate Balances of all Classes of Certificates referenced above, determined as of the Distribution Date immediately preceding such time);\n   <em>\n    provided that solely for the purpose of determining the Voting Rights of the Classes of Sequential Pay Certificates, the aggregate Appraisal Reduction Amount (determined as set forth herein) shall be treated as Realized Losses with respect to the calculation of the Certificate Principal Balances thereof\n   </em>\n   ; provided, further, however, the aggregate Appraisal Reduction Amount shall not reduce the Class Principal Balance of any Class for purposes of determining the Controlling Class, the Controlling Class Representative or the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphases added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   CWC and Appaloosa dispute whether both the numerator and the denominator in the Voting Rights fraction should be adjusted by the Appraisal Reduction Amount (\"ARA\"). The ARA itself \"reflects\n   a comparison of the appraisal value to the overall loan exposure (including not only the unpaid principal balance, but also unpaid interest, unpaid fees and expenses, advances, and other amounts).\" (CWC Br. 11 (citing PSA \u00a7 1.01) ). CWC argues the ARA should be applied only to the numerator; Appaloosa believes it should adjust both the numerator and denominator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Determining whether the ARA should be applied to the denominator, in addition to the numerator, again requires application of familiar contract principles. To review, under New York law, \"a written agreement that is complete, clear, and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms\" because \"[t]he best evidence of what parties to a written agreement intend is what they say in their writing.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellington\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    EMI Music, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999120\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/24/239/#p244\">\n    24 N.Y.3d 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 244-45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999120\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/24/239/#p244\">\n    997 N.Y.S.2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999120\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/24/239/#p244\">\n    21 N.E.3d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Here, the language of the PSA unambiguously indicates that the ARA should only be applied to the numerator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In the PSA's definition of Voting Rights, the word \"numerator\" - but not \"denominator\" - is followed by the following parenthetical: \"(adjusted as provided in the immediately succeeding provisos).\" (PSA \u00a7 1.01). The proviso itself reads, \"solely for the purpose of determining the Voting Rights of the Classes of Sequential Pay Certificates, the aggregate Appraisal Reduction Amount ... shall be treated as Realized Losses with respect to the calculation of the Certificate Principal Balances thereof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20). Those rights that require Certificateholders to own a certain minimum percentage of Voting Rights include the rights to remove the Trustee and amend the PSA.

In response to Appaloosa's argument, CWC notes that the ARA has never been this high, even during the last decade's real estate crisis. (CWC Br. 9). Furthermore, as CWC explains, even if the ARA were that high, appraisal reduction is a dynamic process, and the scenario proffered by Appaloosa, in addition to being unrealistic, \"is simply not sustainable.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188727\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/209/579/1188727/#p296\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Each side argues that its interpretation of the PSA, as CWC puts it, \"makes perfect commercial sense.\" (CWC Br. 10). But the Court is not allowed to deviate from the plain meaning of the PSA.

Appaloosa Did Not Have 25% of the Voting Rights on May 7, 2018\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Calculating the relevant Voting Rights shares as prescribed above, the Court finds that Appaloosa's and Azteca's combined holdings did not reach 25% as of May 7, 2018, the date on which Appaloosa sent a written direction to the Trustee to initiate the action. In point of fact, Appaloosa and Azteca owned 14.96% of Voting Rights in the C30 Trust as of May 7, 2018. (CWC Br. 7 n.4). However, Appaloosa makes one last-ditch effort to obtain standing and asks the Court to calculate its Voting Rights share using the March - as opposed to the April - ARA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appaloosa Opp. 15). According to Appaloosa, in April 2018, just six days after Appaloosa announced its intention to assert a direct claim against CWC, the ARA for the C30 trust was suspiciously raised by 54 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). For its part, CWC rejects Appaloosa's insinuation that it had any part in manipulating the ARA as \"simply made up.\" (CWC Br. 11-12). Regardless, the Court need not decide the issue at this juncture. Even if the Court were to disregard the April ARA and use the March ARA in its calculations, Appaloosa and Azteca would still only have 23.1% of Voting Rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For that reason, Appaloosa does not have standing to bring its cross-claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the reasons detailed above, CWC's motion to dismiss the cross-claim filed by Appaloosa is GRANTED.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Appaloosa Opp. 16 n.4). As previously discussed, applying a different methodology would cut against the plain language of the PSA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The Court declines to address the remaining two issues mentioned in CWC's motion to dismiss as moot.\n    <em>\n     First\n    </em>\n    , Appaloosa argues that it is entitled to damages on behalf of the other four Trusts, other than the C30 Trust. (Am. Answer \u00b6 253). In support of its argument, Appaloosa contends that it only needs to hold 25% of Voting Rights in the C30 Trust to recover amounts allegedly owed to all five Trusts under the Co-Lender Agreement. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 188-90). Because this Court finds that Appaloosa did not hold a 25% Voting Rights share as of May 7, 2018 - and Appaloosa does not argue that it satisfied the preconditions on Certificateholder actions contained in the PSAs governing the other four Trusts - the issue is moot.\n    <em>\n     Second,\n    </em>\n    CWC asks the Court to strike Appaloosa's demand for a jury trial on its cross-claim. (CWC Br. 15-18). Because Appaloosa's request for a jury trial is limited to its cross-claim, no issues remain for jury determination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
