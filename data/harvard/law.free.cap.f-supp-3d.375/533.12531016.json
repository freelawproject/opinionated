The asserted claims, for example, require a tangible RFID tag and a limited-access door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). They also require a device capable of recording a video. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Methods with real-world impact, implemented on physical devices, are not rendered abstract merely by the ability of a human to achieve a similar result (e.g. keeping watch) via different means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, I find the asserted claims of the '158 Patent are not directed at an unpatentable abstract idea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As I find that the claims are not directed to unpatentable subject matter, I need not consider whether the claims contain an inventive concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (D.I. 13) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Defendant also challenges the unasserted claims of the '158 Patent as unpatentable under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . There is no indication that Plaintiff intends to assert those additional claims in this action. Thus, whether the unasserted claims are patent ineligible has no bearing on the outcome of this motion to dismiss and need not be addressed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
