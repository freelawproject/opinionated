Statutory Directive to Investigate Incidents of Abuse and Neglect\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The P &amp; A Acts provide the authority for a P &amp; A system, like DRO, to \"investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of persons with mental illness if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010805\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). As such, both DRO and Buckeye Ranch agree that DRO is within its federal mandate to commence an investigation of abuse and neglect (1) \"if the incidents are reported to\" DRO, \"or\" (2) \"if there is probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Buckeye Ranch argues that, while only one of these triggering events is necessary, neither occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There is no dispute that DRO received from the Ohio Department of Mental Health five reports of abuse and neglect of four youth who reside at Buckeye Ranch. DRO opened investigations into these reports. Buckeye Ranch contends that DRO exceeded its statutory authority by opening these investigations because the P &amp; A Acts require that \"a report be made\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   the P &amp; A System\" directly, by for instance a parent or the youth him or herself, instead of coming from another agency. (Buckeye Ranch's Opp. to DRO Second Supp. to Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 9, ECF No. 18.) Buckeye Ranch maintains that its mandatory \"self-reports [to the Ohio Department of Mental Health] were not made to DRO and therefore are not complaints for triggering DRO's right to investigate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   DRO responds that the P &amp; A Acts do \"not confine the obligation and right of P &amp; A's to conduct investigations based on the source of the report of abuse and neglect,\" and that \"[n]o common sense reading of the language of the statute can lead to the insertion of such a restriction.\" (DRO's Second. Supp. to Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 9-10, ECF No. 15.) This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Neither the statutory and regulatory scheme nor the case law provides any support for the proposition that the P &amp; A system must treat differently reports of abuse and neglect based upon the source of the report. Indeed, DRO's receipt of reports of abuse and neglect from the Ohio Department of Mental Health is the exact same procedure this Court has previously accepted as sufficient to constitute incidents reported\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   a P &amp; A system. In\n   <em>\n    Ohio Legal Rights Services v. Buckeye Ranch, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9011244\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/365/877/#p883\">\n    365 F.Supp.2d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 883 (S.D. Ohio 2005) (\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio Legal Rights\n   </em>\n   \"), the precursor agency to DRO commenced an investigation based on reports it received from the Ohio Department of Mental Health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, this process of not differentiating the reports of abuse and neglect by their source is supported by the Department of Health and Human Services (\"DHHS\") in the Final Rule, which provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The Act states that a P &amp; A system has the authority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect that are either reported to the system or where there is probable cause to believe that the incidents have taken place. The Department believes that\n   <em>\n    media accounts and newspaper articles can be viewed as the equivalent of a complaint\n   </em>\n   when they provide details about a specific incident of abuse or neglect.\n   <em>\n    While such reports are not specifically directed at the P &amp; A system\n   </em>\n   , they are published with the expectation that public officials responsible for conditions will act to stop abuse. P &amp; A systems have that role. This does not preclude a P &amp; A system from acting on behalf of an unnamed client or on behalf of a class of people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; Requirements Applicable to Protection and Advocacy of Individuals with Mental Illness\n   </em>\n   ; Final Rule, 62 FR 53548-01 at 53551 (emphasis added). If media reports not specifically directed at a P &amp; A system are sufficient to constitute a report to the P &amp; A, certainly reports from a governmental agency are also adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, this conclusion is also in accord with the P &amp; A Acts' purpose of protecting some of society's most vulnerable members. As DRO appropriately highlights, while the youth with disabilities in facilities like Buckeye Ranch \"are particularly vulnerable, they have fewer natural supports in place because they have limited contact with their families and support systems,\" causing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , many of them to be \"unaware of their rights and unfamiliar with DRO's role as the P &amp; A Agency.\" (DRO's Mot. for Prelim. Inj. At 5, ECF No. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thus, regardless of the source of the reports of abuse and neglect obtained by the P &amp; A system, it has been given the statutory authority to investigate those reports.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010805\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). Accordingly, the reports of abuse and neglect DRO received from the Ohio Department of Mental Health triggered DRO's statutory right and obligation to investigate those reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Access to Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Initially, the Court notes that Buckeye Ranch has appropriately and timely provided many of the records DRO has requested, including video recordings of the events. Both Buckeye Ranch and DRO appear to sincerely desire to meet their obligations of providing services to the youth who reside at Buckeye Ranch. The Court encourages the parties to continue to work together, which should prove an easier task once there is in this case a determination of rights and obligations under the P &amp; A Acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   DRO contends that it is substantially likely to succeed on the merits of its claim that Buckeye Ranch is violating the P &amp; A Acts by failing to provide DRO access to all of the records it has requested as part of its investigation of the reports of abuse and neglect at Buckeye Ranch. DRO asserts that it is entitled to the records it seeks based on its authority to conduct investigations of abuse and neglect under the P &amp; A Acts. DRO maintains that the records it requests are incident to and/or directly related to reports of abuse and neglect DRO has received, or that have been conveyed to DRO's investigator during the investigations.

Inj. at 14, ECF No. 18.) Simply because a P &amp; A system evaluates whether there is probable cause to investigate reports of abuse and neglect does not excise the requirement from the statute nor render any part of the statute meaningless. The requirement of probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred is given effect by requiring that a P &amp; A make that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court notes that Congress enacted numerous qualification provisions for P &amp; A systems so that the important decisions, such as probable cause to trigger an investigation, are made by qualified agencies. For example, each state's P &amp; A system must have a \"governing authority responsible for its planning, designing, implementing and functioning,\" including the setting of annual \"[p]rogram priorities and policies.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2051.22\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 51.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 51.24(a). In addition, a P &amp; A system must establish an \"advisory council\" that is charged with, among other responsibilities, \"[p]rovid[ing] independent advice and recommendations to the [protection-and-advocacy] system\" and \"[w]ork[ing] with the [system's] governing authority in the development of policies and priorities.\" 42. C.F.R. \u00a7 51.23(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Further, a P &amp; A system's determination of probable cause is not analogous to that required in the investigation and prosecution of crimes. No P &amp; A can charge a facility with a crime and must rely upon state and federal agencies to take action in that respect, certainly after making their own probable cause determination. There is no suggestion that DRO is a subterfuge for a law enforcement agency.

Buckeye Ranch asserts that these other investigations found the reports of abuse and neglect unsubstantiated. DRO responds that \"[a]lthough [Buckeye Ranch] alleges that there have been investigations of the incidents by state and county agencies, and that they have found that the allegations of abuse are not substantiated, [Buckeye Ranch] has provided to neither DRO nor the court any evidence that such investigations occurred, and that they led to findings that the allegations were not substantiated.\" (DRO's Mot. for Prelim.

Therefore, DRO is entitled to the remainder of the records it requests related to the investigation of these five reports of abuse and neglect. These records include the requests for grievances and complaints made by the youth, restraint logs and denial of privileges logs of the youth, information regarding the staff involved in the incidents, and video recordings of the hour before and after the reported incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In this next section, the parties move to a different category of records. Specifically, DRO contends that through its investigation, it has determined that not only is there probable cause to believe that the individuals who were the subjects of the reports were exposed to abuse and neglect, but also that there is widespread and systemic abuse at Buckeye Ranch. DRO, therefore, requests certain records that would provide information about the use of restraints on youth at Buckeye Ranch for whom DRO does not have a complaint or report. For example, DRO requests for a particular period of time that encompasses the period of time that incidents of abuse and neglect occurred for which it does have reports, the restraint logs, logs reflecting denial of privileges, peer review logs, video recordings of an entire day, and information\n   about the staff who were involved in the restraints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Buckeye Ranch argues that \"records that pertain to other children as well as general operations and policies of The Buckeye Ranch.... are not records available to the DRO under the PAIMIA or Ohio law.\" (Buckeye Ranch's Opp. to DRO Second Supp. to Mot. for Prelim.

In that case, this Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   [P &amp; A] OLRS presented its requests for access to the logs as part of an attempt to collect data for a statewide database on the use of seclusion and restraint techniques.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   The Court agrees with the Buckeye Ranch. Upon reviewing the letters sent by OLRS to the Buckeye Ranch,\n   <em>\n    the Court finds that OLRS based its requests on a need to\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    develop a statewide seclusion and restraint baseline.\n   </em>\n   \" Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. A. There is\n   <em>\n    no evidence\n   </em>\n   that, at the time it made its requests, OLRS had determined\n   <em>\n    there was probable cause\n   </em>\n   to believe that abuse or neglect had occurred at the Buckeye Ranch. Ms. Knight's finding of probable cause was based in part on the\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Enquirer\n   </em>\n   articles, which were published after OLRS had already made several requests for the logs. Even once the articles were published, OLRS never conveyed to the Buckeye Ranch its determination that probable cause existed to believe one or more children had been abused or neglected during incidents of seclusion and restraint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   The Court is certainly aware of OLRS's important mission of defending mentally-ill individuals from abuse and neglect. Nonetheless, OLRS's requests for the seclusion and restraint logs were not based on a finding of probable cause. It is unclear exactly when OLRS did find probable cause, but the Buckeye Ranch was not informed of it. The Buckeye Ranch cannot be faulted for refusing to produce the logs when it did not know OLRS had probable cause to believe\n   that incidents of abuse or neglect had occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    Ohio Leg.

In other words, this Court found that the P &amp; A was not entitled to the requested records because it had not determined there was probable cause to believe incidents of abuse and neglect had occurred. That is not analogous to the situation currently before the Court; DRO has made such a determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   This brings the Court to Buckeye Ranch's argument that providing DRO with the requested documents, with no available review, may raise constitutional concerns. Buckeye Ranch relies upon the explanation provided by\n   <em>\n    Disability Law Center\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   To accept the [P &amp; A]'s argument [that \"the Academy has no recourse to prevent what may be an unwarranted investigation\"] would require the court to interpret the law as allowing an advocacy center to determine, without any checks or balances of its demand, when it may conduct what is effectively a search and seizure of the defendants' records and information. To find that the PAIMI would authorize such unlimited discretion in the [P &amp; A] would raise the constitutional concerns addressed in\n   <em>\n    Donovan\n   </em>\n   . In that case the Court upheld the constitutionality of warrantless regulatory searches, in part, because the act at issue did not allow forcible entries and the subject of the search had recourse to the federal district court should the requested search exceed constitutional limits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    Disability L.

In the Court's view, this evidence is sufficient to support DRO's probable cause finding - under any standard Buckeye Ranch argues applies (from probable cause to believe that abuse has occurred\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015043\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(I)(ii),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010805\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794e(f)(2) to probable cause to believe that an individual's health or safety is in serious and immediate jeopardy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015043\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(I)(iii),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010805\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(C), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794e(f)(2) ).

Thus, this regulation's triggering events have occurred and DRO must therefore be provided reasonable unaccompanied access to residents at all times necessary to conduct a full investigation of the incident reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   DRO, however, avers that Buckeye Ranch \"has insisted throughout Plaintiff DRO's attempts to investigate that DRO obtain the approval of county children's services agencies having custody before making children available for interviews, and have either denied or considerably delayed DRO's access to the children.\" (DRO's Second. Supp. to Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 2, ECF No. 15) (citing Yoder Decl., ECF No. 15-2).

[and therefore] [DRO] is not able to complete a timely investigation of very serious allegations of abuse and neglect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. DRO explains why,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , its investigations are, in its view, significantly impeded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   Children who may have knowledge of the incidents are being discharged from the facility before [DRO] has the opportunity to interview them.

The Congressional intent was not to confer such access as it was not provided in PAIMIA itself. In the Committee Report recommending passage of the PAIMIA, the Committee on Labor and Human Resources expressly stated that \"the Committee intends that the scope of this bill should not be broadened or narrowed through the regulatory process.\" (Exhibit B, p. 9.)

This factor weighs in DRO's favor. Issuance of an injunction against Buckeye Ranch does not subject it to a penalty or hardship because it only requires compliance with the P &amp; A Acts.

And, as to harm to any third parties, the Court finds none. DRO routinely conducts investigative visits of facilities in Ohio without adverse effects.

In these actions, Congress has expressed that the public interest is satisfied by allowing P &amp; A systems, like DRO, access to the records and individuals it seeks from Buckeye Ranch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   DRO requests, and Buckeye Ranch does not oppose, waiver of the bond that is a required requisite to the issuance of a preliminary injunction. Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that no \"preliminary injunction shall issue except upon the giving of security by the applicant[.]\" Fed. Civ. P. 65(c). \"While [the Sixth Circuit] recognize[s] that the language of Rule 65(c) appears to be mandatory, and that many circuits have so interpreted it, the rule in our circuit has long been that the district court possesses discretion over whether to require the posting of security.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <em>\n    Moltan Co. v.

No bond is required of a governmental agency. DRO stands in the stead of a governmental agency. Further, this preliminary injunction imposes no significant financial burden on Buckeye Ranch. The equitable circumstances of the present case support a conclusion that the posting of a bond is not warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Sys. Consulting, Inc. v. Devier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871615\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/514/1001/#p1010\">\n    514 F.Supp.2d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1010 (S.D. Ohio 2007) (finding that a bond was not warranted after an equitable analysis).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   DRO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Case No. 18-cv-894, ECF No. 7, 9) and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Buckeye Ranch's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (Case No. 18-cv-906, ECF No. 2 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, all docket references are made to the docket in case number 218-cv-894.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    The Court views guardianship by the \"state\" as the same as guardianship in the hands of a county children's services agency, as in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    Buckeye Ranch, however, does argue that neither a court that has found the P &amp; A Acts constitutional under the Fourth Amendment, nor any other court, has \"considered its interference with a person's rights under the Fifth Amendment.\" (Buckeye Ranch's Opp. to DRO Second Supp. to Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 23, ECF No. 18.) DRO has not had the opportunity to address this argument, which Buckeye Ranch first raised in the last brief filed. Additionally, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.1, when a party files a pleading or motion \"drawing into question the constitutionality of a federal ... statute,\" and no federal agency or official is a party to the case, the filing party \"must promptly: (1) file a notice of constitutional question stating the question and identifying the paper that raises it,\" and \"serve the notice and paper on the Attorney General of the United States.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.1(a)(1). The Attorney General may then intervene within 60 days after the notice is filed or after the court certifies the challenge, unless the court sets a later time.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    5.1(c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    In the instant action, no notice under Rule 5.1 has yet been served on the Attorney General regarding the constitutional challenges made by Buckeye Ranch. DRO filed a\n    <em>\n     Notice\n    </em>\n    indicating that because no notice was provided pursuant to Rule 5.1, it \"provided information on this case to officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the P &amp; A programs under the\" P &amp; A Acts. (Notice at 1, ECF No. 52.) Since then, the United States has filed a\n    <em>\n     Notice of Potential Participation\n    </em>\n    , indicating that it may seek to intervene to defend the constitutionality of the P &amp; A Acts. (ECF No. 53.) While this Court may reject the constitutional challenges without formal notice, certification, and the opportunity for the Department of Justice and/or the Ohio Attorney General to intervene, a ruling finding any of the statutes to be unconstitutional would be premature. Consequently, the Court will not herein address Buckeye Ranch's arguments related to the Fifth Amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
