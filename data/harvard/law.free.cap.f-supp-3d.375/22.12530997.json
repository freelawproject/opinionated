KELLY, United States District Judge\n      Plaintiff Tingzi Wang, a Chinese national, sought a visa for entry into the United States through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, which grants legal resident status to qualified foreign nationals that invest capital in a new commercial enterprise. Wang applied for the visa based on his million-dollar investment in a Florida restaurant, for which he received an equity stake. Wang claimed that his investment was fully \"at risk\" as required by the EB-5 regulations. However, the United States Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied his petition because his investment agreement included a guarantee that the other restaurant owners would purchase his stake whenever he wished to end his investment, thereby returning a portion of his capital to him. This sell option, USCIS concluded, eroded his capital contribution below the minimum amount required to be \"at risk.\" This case is about whether USCIS reached that determination lawfully. Before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant Defendants' Amended Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 26, and deny Wang's Amended Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 25.\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      <strong>\n       I.

In contrast, like in\n      <em>\n       Matter of Izummi,\n      </em>\n      the Agreement provided Wang a\n      <em>\n       sell\n      </em>\n      option that guaranteed\n      <em>\n       him\n      </em>\n      the right to exit the investment at any time.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      JA 23-27. For this reason, those cases are inapposite.\n      <footnotemark>\n       6\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-54\">\n      Wang presses another reason why USCIS's \"at risk\" determination was arbitrary and capricious: its purported misunderstanding of the term \"book value.\" Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 12. He points to a portion of USCIS's denial letter in which it stated that, because the sell option guaranteed that Wang may sell his shares at their \"book value,\" as opposed to \"fair market value,\" he \"made the investment with the knowledge that his shares will be worth the same amount for the life of the investment, regardless of when he intends to sell them.\" JA 325. And as Wang points out,\n      under Section 6.13, the Agreement defines book value as \"the value of the stock of the Corporation after deducting the sum of all the liabilities of the Corporation from the sum of all the assets and property of the Corporation.\" JA 27. Therefore, he asserts, book value does not reflect \"a static price,\" but \"is tied to the current financial status of the company\" and is \"subject to the same fluctuations in value as the company itself.\" Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 14. Accordingly, Wang argues, even if he were to sell his shares back to the Corporation, \"the price he would receive in return would not necessarily be the amount he originally invested in exchange for the shares, but would depend on the company's property, assets, and liabilities at the time of his withdrawal.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 15.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-55\">\n      The Court agrees that that portion of USCIS's denial letter appears to reflect a misunderstanding of the term \"book value.\" As noted above, under Section 6.13, the Agreement defines \"book value\" as the sum of the Corporation's assets and property, subtracted by its liabilities. JA 27. And if Wang exercised the sell option, the share price guaranteed to him would be based on the book value of the Corporation at the time of his exit, in accordance with Section 6.11 of the Agreement. Therefore, given the fluctuating nature of corporate liabilities, assets and property, USCIS's characterization of Wang's shares as \"worth the same amount for the life of the investment\" appears accurate only in the sense that the price would always be set by the formula in the Agreement. But the value of those shares, of course, would change over time.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-56\">\n      The problem for Wang, though, is that USCIS's reasoning did not hinge on its understanding of the term \"book value\" or on any specific price Wang would receive for his shares if he exercised his sell option. As explained above, under\n      <em>\n       Matter of Izummi\n      </em>\n      , it turned on the presence of the sell option itself.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-58\">\n      USCIS referred to \"book value\" in its denial of Wang's petition only\n      <em>\n       after\n      </em>\n      it thoroughly described the basis for that denial: that his sell option guaranteed him a return of a portion of his investment. JA 324-25. In that reasoning, USCIS did not mention the term \"book value.\" Moreover, USCIS referred to \"book value\" only in the context of addressing Wang's argument, discussed below, that the Amended Agreement was a non-material change to his petition, and, more specifically, only in response to Wang's characterization of the Agreement as requiring the Corporation to pay him\n      <em>\n       fair market value\n      </em>\n      for his shares. JA 325. Finally, USCIS did not mention \"book value,\" or characterize Wang's shares as being worth the same over the span of the investment, when it denied his appeal. JA 389-92. In fact, USCIS acknowledged\n      Wang's argument that it had \"erroneously\" concluded that he \"made the investment with the knowledge that his shares will be worth the same amount for the life of the investment,\" but reaffirmed that, \"[i]n spite of the new evidence and arguments presented,\" he still had not \"demonstrated that the required minimum amount of capital was placed at risk for the purpose of generating a return in accordance with applicable law.\" JA 390-91. On this record, and in light of\n      <em>\n       Matter of Izummi\n      </em>\n      's reasoning discussed above, the Court cannot conclude that USCIS relied upon a misunderstanding of the term \"book value\" to deny Wang's petition.\n      <footnotemark>\n       8\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-60\">\n      <strong>\n       2.

Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 24. In the Amended Agreement, Wang added a provision stating that he could not \"sell, transfer or assign, in any manner, all or any part of his shares in the Company, prior to receiving final adjudication of his Form I-829 Immigrant Petition.\" JA 94. At the time he submitted it, Wang informed USCIS that the new provision \"does not materially change the Shareholder Agreement\" and that \"the further restrictions as amended are not inconsistent nor do they conflict with the existing terms of the Shareholder Agreement.\" JA 86. However, USCIS declined to consider the Amended Agreement on the basis that it \"constitute[d] [a] material change because it add[ed] a restriction that was not formally (at the time of filing) written in the agreement, and d[id] so for the sole purpose of conforming to EB-5 requirements.\" JA 325.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-62\">\n      Wang now asserts that USCIS (1) \"failed to provide pertinent reasoning as to why the submission constituted a 'material change,' \" (2) incorrectly determined that \"a change to a company's offering documents\" could be a \" 'material change' in any sense,\" and (3) prematurely made such a determination in violation of its regulations. Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 24. None of these arguments prove that USCIS acted arbitrarily or capriciously.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-63\">\n      First, Wang alleges that USCIS's explanation was arbitrary and capricious because it \"provide[d] no rationale as to why the clarification was a material change rather than an immaterial one.\"\n      <footnotemark>\n       9\n      </footnotemark>\n      Pl.'s MSJ\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-64\">\n      Br. at 27.

For the reasons explained in Section III(A)(2), USCIS reasonably deemed that restriction to be a \"material change\" because it modified a provision of the Agreement that it had previously advised him was objectionable under\n      <em>\n       Matter of Izummi\n      </em>\n      in a way that appeared to try to address those concerns.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-78\">\n      Wang argues that USCIS exceeded its statutory authority when it determined that a change to a petition is \"material\" if \"its 'sole purpose' was to 'conform[ ] to EB-5 requirements.' \" Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 33.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2045\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      (quoting JA 325).

And the regulations and decisions cited above do not suggest that the established standard for materiality is that any such change must succeed in making an unapprovable petition approvable. In fact, such a standard makes no sense. The whole point is that USCIS does not consider material changes to a petition at all-thus precluding it from determining whether the change would make the petition approvable-because such changes cannot, by definition, establish that the petitioner was \"eligible for the requested benefit at the time of filing the benefit request.\"\n      <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20103.2\">\n       8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.2\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (b)(1).

Wang then describes several purportedly-new arguments put forward by Defendants in support of USCIS's decision that, according to him, are barred from consideration by the Court.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at 13-16. But the Court need not address this point, as it need not consider any of these arguments in granting Defendants' motion.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-99\">\n      For this reason, Wang's argument that USCIS failed to \"consider dispositive evidence\" on \"the meaning of the term book value\" also fails. Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 19-20. In its denial of his appeal, USCIS acknowledged that it had considered Wang's additional arguments and his submission of an affidavit by \"an expert in accounting and business evaluation\" on the proper valuation of \"book value.\" JA 390. Wang's insistence that it failed to consider this evidence rests on his contention that, if it had, USCIS would have reversed its determination that his investment was not \"at risk.\"\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 20-21. But the record does not show that such evidence was \"dispositive\" because it did not undermine the primary rationale for USCIS's denial-that the Agreement provided Wang an option to sell his shares back to the Corporation.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-100\">\n      Wang also argues that USCIS's application of the \"material change\" standard was arbitrary and capricious because USCIS \"did not base its finding of 'material change' on any statute or regulation.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 25-26. He concedes, however, the USCIS relied on\n      <em>\n       Matter of Izummi\n      </em>\n      's holding that \"[a] petitioner must establish eligibility at the time of filing,\" and therefore \"may not make material changes to a petition that has already been filed in an effort to make an apparently deficient petition conform to [USCIS] requirements.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 26;\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20169\">\n       22 I. &amp; N.

Wang provides no reason why it was arbitrary and capricious for USCIS to rely on its precedential decision.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-101\">\n      Wang also argues that USCIS failed \"to provide a basis for differentiating among similar cases.\" Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 27. And under the authority he cites, an agency must \"treat like cases alike\" and if it \"makes an exception in one case, then it must either make an exception in a similar case or point to a relevant distinction between the two cases,\"\n      <em>\n       Westar Energy, Inc. v.

But Wang does not identify any similar cases that USCIS should have distinguished.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-102\">\n      Wang also advances an argument based on the nature of the documents at issue. He argues that because \"[a] change to the terms of an offering document ... can be made\n      <em>\n       at any time\n      </em>\n      ,\" his amendment to the agreement could not be considered material.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 24 (emphasis added). However, he cites to no legal authority in support, and\n      <em>\n       Matter of Izummi\n      </em>\n      appears to foreclose this argument.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      22 I. &amp; N. at 175 (holding that \"material changes\" made to a partnership agreement could not be considered).\n     </p>\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
