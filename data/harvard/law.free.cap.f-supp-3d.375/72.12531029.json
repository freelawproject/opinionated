KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As part of its responsibility over the management of marine resources, the National Marine Fishery Service (\"the Service\") adopts and implements fishery management plans designed to promote the conservation and sustainable use of the Nation's fisheries. After promulgating these plans, the Service then periodically amends them, often in response to changes in the industry, the environment, or the applicable regulatory and legal framework. In 2016, the Service adopted just such an amendment-Amendment 113-to the management plan for Pacific cod in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands archipelago. The Service concluded that previous conservation measures had led to more vessels in the region processing their catch at sea, and fewer vessels delivering catch to onshore processing plants in two nearby island fishing communities-Adak and Atka. To mitigate that impact and allow those communities to develop sustainable cod-processing enterprises, Amendment 113 sets aside a portion of the Pacific cod fishery off the coast of the Aleutian Islands each year for exclusive harvest by vessels that intend to deliver their fish to onshore processing plants located within the specific geographic span of the Aleutian Islands that encompasses Adak and Atka.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Several trade associations and commercial fishing groups operating in the Aleutian Islands region sued to challenge the amendment, arguing that it exceeded the Service's statutory authority under the Magnuson-Stevens Act and is otherwise inconsistent with applicable law. Adak and Atka intervened as defendants. The parties each filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Although the Court finds that the Service did not exceed its statutory authority in imposing a harvest set-aside with an onshore delivery requirement, it nonetheless determines that the Service failed to demonstrate that the amendment satisfied the requisite standards for such regulatory measures set forth by the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Accordingly, and for the reasons explained below, Plaintiffs' motion will be granted, and Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   and Intervenors' motions will be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

As stated in the final rule, A113 \"modifies the BSAI Pacific cod fishery to set aside a portion of the Aleutian Islands Pacific cod [TAC] for harvest by vessels directed fishing\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   for Aleutian Islands Pacific cod and delivering their catch to Aleutian Islands shoreplants for processing.\" AR 1000272; 81 Fed. Reg. at 84,435. And the amendment specifically defines \"Aleutian Islands shoreplants\" as only those \"processing facilit[ies] that [are] physically located on land west of 170\u00b0 W. longitude within the State of Alaska,\" encapsulating the two fishing communities of Adak and Atka. AR 1000273; 81 Fed. Reg. at 84,436.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To accomplish its stated goal, the amendment imposes certain measures: (1) each year, the Service calculates the A-season AI Pacific cod \"directed fishing allowance\" (DFA), which is equal to the portion of the AI Pacific cod TAC for the A season available for vessels that are \"directed fishing\" for Pacific cod; (2) 5,000 mt of the DFA-or the entirety of the DFA if it totals 5,000 mt or less that year-is then set aside until March 15 for harvest by only those \"catcher vessels that deliver their catch of [AI] Pacific cod to [AI] shoreplants for processing\"; and (3) until March 21 of each year, the harvest of Pacific cod in the Bering Sea by the \"trawl CV sector\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the largest sector participating in the AI Pacific cod fishery, AR 1000792-is limited by the same amount of the AI set-aside for that year, AR 1000273-75;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20679.20\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 679.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7)(viii) (codification of A113). That final measure seeks to ensure that BSAI CVs do not exhaust their A-season TAC allocations in the BS region where the set-aside requiring delivery to onshore processors is not in place-since their TAC allocations can be used in either the BS region or the AI region-rather than fish in the AI region and have to deliver harvested cod to AI shoreplants. AR 1000796-97; 81 Fed.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In their complaint, Plaintiffs bring five claims alleging that enactment of A113 violated both the MSA and the APA, each of which are subject to the outstanding motions for summary judgment. As stated previously, Plaintiffs' first claim contends that A113 exceeded the Service's authority under the MSA. They insist that the Service may only regulate conduct that qualifies as \"fishing\" under the MSA, but A113, they contend, exceeded that authority by regulating onshore processing activities. Plaintiffs' second, third, and fourth claims challenge A113's compliance with the requirements of National Standards 4, 5, and 8, respectively. And Plaintiffs' final claim asserts that the Service failed to articulate a rational basis for adopting A113. On Plaintiffs' first claim, which questions the very authority of the Service to impose this type of harvest restriction, the Court finds that the MSA does not categorically preclude the Service from implementing the measure at issue here. But because the Court finds that the Service failed to demonstrate that A113 complied with both National Standard 8 and National Standard 4, the Court need not proceed to address Plaintiffs' remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

MSJ at 14. It restricts which vessels may harvest Pacific cod in the Aleutian Islands during the set-aside period based on where they intend to deliver their harvest for processing. And there is nothing in \u00a7 1853(a)(1) or elsewhere in the MSA to suggest that the term \"fishing\" somehow further limits the measures that the Service may implement, even if it has determined that they are \"necessary and appropriate for the conservation and management of the fishery,\" simply because those measures direct where a vessel may deliver its harvested fish for processing.

By implication, Plaintiffs argued, a \"\n   <em>\n    fishery\n   </em>\n   management plan\" may only regulate the biological stock of fish or the activity of \"fishing.\" Hrg. Rough Tr. at 7-9. But again, Plaintiffs read far too much into the definition of \"fishing.\" Nothing in \u00a7 1853 or in the definition of \"fishery\" suggests that a conservation and management measure, as long as it accords with the requirements of the MSA and is necessary for the conservation and management of the fishery, cannot allocate harvesting privileges based on where a harvester intends to deliver its catch for processing. In other words, the Court cannot conclude that by including the activity of \"fishing\" in the MSA's definition of \"fishery,\" Congress sought to foreclose the use of a measure that the Service considered necessary for the conservation and management of the fishery simply because it indirectly regulated activity that fell outside the Act's definition of fishing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs appealed to the overall framework of the MSA, arguing that the Act's central purpose-of ensuring the sustainable use of the Nation's fisheries-shows that Congress never intended to grant the Service the authority to regulate onshore processing in the manner undertaken by A113. Hrg. Rough Tr. at 6-7. But if anything, the text of the MSA suggests precisely the opposite. Repeatedly, the MSA directs the Service to consider onshore processors as part of its broader task of managing the Nation's fisheries.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201853\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) (requiring that FMPs \"assess and specify ... the capacity and extent to which United States fish processors, on an annual basis, will process [the] portion of [the] optimum yield [of fish] that will be harvested\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201853\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1853(a)(9) (requiring that FMPs include\n   \"a fishery impact statement\" analyzing the impacts of conservation and management measures on \"fishing communities,\" defined to include \"United States fish processors that are based in such communit[ies],\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201853\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1802(17) ). In fact, and perhaps most notably, the MSA expressly grants the Service the discretion to impose permitting requirements on onshore fish processors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201853\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1853(b)(1)(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, the Court cannot conclude, as Plaintiffs urge, that the MSA's definition of \"fishing\" categorically precludes the Service from adopting A113. The Court observes nothing in the MSA, and Plaintiffs have pointed to no provision, suggesting that Congress, through the definition of \"fishing,\" sought to place a strict limitation on the Service's authority to regulate and manage the Nation's fishery resources as Plaintiffs contend. Moreover, Plaintiffs have identified no relevant ambiguity for the Court to resolve here. And even if Plaintiffs' arguments were enough to raise an ambiguity in the statutory text, the Court, for the same reasons identified above, would conclude that Defendants' interpretation is a reasonable-indeed, the most reasonable-reading of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Compliance with the National Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Although the Court finds that the definition of \"fishing\" does not preclude the Service from enacting A113, that does not end the matter. The amendment must also comply with the other limitations Congress imposed on the Service's authority, including those expressed in the National Standards. Plaintiffs point to three of those standards in their challenge to A113-National Standards 4, 5, and 8. Because the Court finds that the Service failed to adequately demonstrate that A113 satisfies National Standards 8 and 4, the Court will address only those two standards here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The Secretary, through the advisory guidelines, has interpreted this provision to require that, \"[a]ll other things being equal, where two alternatives achieve similar conservation goals, the alternative that provides the greater potential for sustained participation of [fishing] communities and minimizes the adverse economic impacts on such communities [should] be the preferred alternative.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.345\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

MSJ at 25 (edits to capitalization). They contend that because no shoreplant is \"entitle[d]\" to any amount of fish under the set-aside provision, and thus that the provision does not create an \"exclusive\" privilege for any one community, A113 does not run afoul of National Standard 8.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. Intervenors take a similar tack, arguing that A113 does not allocate resources to \"a specific fishing community\" because \"there are\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   ... shoreplants, on Adak and Atka,\" that will benefit from the set-aside. Intervs.' MSJ at 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   But accepting Defendants' and Intervenors' explanations for why A113 is consistent with National Standard 8 would require the Court to ignore the realities of the record, the text of National Standard 8, and the Secretary's clear instructions. A113 expressly singles out and directs harvested Pacific cod to Adak and, to a lesser extent, Atka. The very impetus for the amendment was a desire to increase those two communities' participation in the Pacific cod fishery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1000272-73; 81 Fed. Reg. at 84,435 -36 (\"Since 2008, Aleutian Islands fishing communities, and specifically the community of Adak and its shoreplant, have seen a decrease in the amount of Pacific cod being harvested and delivered.\"). And to accomplish this, the Service adopted a rule requiring that a specific amount of harvested cod, varying depending on the applicable TAC for that year, be delivered to the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   available onshore processing plant at the time of promulgation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1000272; 81 Fed.

The Service has, in effect, converted National Standard 8's mandate that the Service \"take into account\" impacts on affected fishing communities when pursuing the MSA's conservation objectives into a tool to affirmatively reallocate fishing privileges to benefit specific fishing communities. This is precisely what the Secretary has concluded National Standard 8 does not empower the Service to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.345\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (\"This standard does not constitute a basis for allocating resources to a specific fishing community.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Recreational Fishing All. v.

They assert, as the Service did below, that A113 complied with National Standard 8 and the advisory guidelines because it is open to any Aleutian Islands shoreplant located west of 170\u00b0 W. longitude.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' MSJ at 27; Defs.' Reply at 12; AR 1000121. But this claim is easily dismissed. There are only two fishing communities-Adak and Atka-that fit that remarkably specific criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1000090 (\"[A]t this time only two cities meet that requirement.\"). And the Service did not hide the fact that the amendment was designed specifically to benefit those two communities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1000793-94; 81 Fed. Reg. at 50,448 -49. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   those two communities were given the ability to even trigger the set-aside.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1000275; 81 Fed. Reg. at 84,438.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Nor does it make any difference, in the Court's view, that the Service singled out two fishing communities for beneficial treatment as opposed to one. As mentioned above, when the Service adopted A113, it was clear that vessels would be able to deliver their catch to only one facility-the plant in Adak. And thus A113 immediately gave Adak the power, simply by notifying the Service, to ensure that a portion of harvested cod would be delivered to its plant. The Court is hard-pressed to see how, on that basis alone, A113 does not constitute an allocation of resources to a specific fishing community. But even if Atka does develop the ability to process Pacific cod, the Court fails to see how that cures the defect. A113 still directs a set portion of harvested cod to two\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   fishing communities. This is not a case in which the Service was presented with two alternative conservation and management measures that might lead to varying effects on fishing communities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11452688,3673764\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/209/747/\">\n    209 F.3d at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is only when two different plans achieve similar conservation measures that the Service takes into consideration adverse economic\n   <em>\n    consequences.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ). Rather, the Service affirmatively\n   <em>\n    chose\n   </em>\n   to redirect fish to two communities it identified as in need of economic assistance. The Court takes no position on the merits of that choice as a policy matter, but the Court cannot endorse the Service's conclusion that A113 is an exercise of authority consistent with National Standard 8 and the\n   Secretary's explanation of what that standard permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For similar reasons, the explanation that A113 is consistent with National Standard 8 because it does not create \"exclusive\" privileges for Adak and Atka cannot withstand scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' MSJ at 25-26; Intervs.' MSJ at 30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   81 Fed. Reg. at 84,446 (explaining in response to a comment about National Standard 8 that under A113 \"no exclusive opportunity to receive any portion of the set-aside is provided to any Aleutian Islands shoreplant\"). In the first place, it is not clear to the Court why \"exclusivity\" should be the touchstone of whether a measure complied with National Standard 8 and the Secretary's guidelines. That language does not appear in the text. Indeed, elsewhere in the guidelines, the Secretary defines an allocation as a \"direct and deliberate distribution,\" which does not seem to require that each recipient be guaranteed a sum certain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.325\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (defining \" 'allocation' or 'assignment' of fishing privileges\" under National Standard 4). Moreover, as explained above, when the Service adopted this amendment, only Adak would receive the Pacific cod harvested under the set-aside; that is an \"exclusive\" allocation of resources by any understanding of the term. And if and when Atka also develops the ability to process Pacific cod, A113 will still, by design, direct harvested Pacific cod to the two plants specifically identified by the Service. That neither plant is guaranteed a specific portion of that harvest, or even the unlikely possibility that one of the two plants receives the\n   <em>\n    entirety\n   </em>\n   of that harvest, does not change the fact that A113 uses National Standard 8 as a justification to allocate resources directly to two particular fishing communities, despite the Secretary's explicit guidance otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that the Service's decision to approve A113 was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with applicable law. The Court so finds even in light of the deference due to the Service on this issue. The Service's failures arose not in the minutiae of its scientific and technical analyses, but in its inadequate explanation of how A113's obvious, practical effect-in fact, its\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   effect-of allocating resources to Adak and Atka is consistent with the plain language of National Standard 8.

According to Intervenors, because the \"community impacts\" of those two prior measures could not reasonably be predicted, the Service properly \"cho[se] to wait and see what the final outcome of those prior actions would be,\" and then proceeded to develop A113 in response.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201851\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting AR 500009). But again, regardless of the merits of that decision as a policy matter, A113's harvest set-aside is admittedly an\n   <em>\n    allocation\n   </em>\n   , and thus it must be reasonably calculated to \"promote\" conservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   That it seeks to mitigate the effects on AI communities of a prior conservation measure cannot circumvent Congress's clear requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Given the standard's directive, the Service's conclusion that A113 complied with National Standard 4 cannot withstand review under the APA. The Service stated many times during the development of the amendment that the harvest set-aside satisfied the second requirement of A113 because it made no changes to the total TACs for Pacific cod in the BS or AI and did not modify any other existing measures protecting fishery resources.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 1000099, 1000143, 1000158. And the Service affirmed this in promulgating the final rule enacting A113.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1000281 (noting that \"the set-aside is reasonably calculated to promote conservation\" because it \"do[es] not modify\" existing total catch limitations or allocations and because the Service \"will continue to manage the fishery so that harvests stay within the specified and allocated amounts\"). And that conclusion, as explained, is simply not rational in light of the text of National Standard 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Despite their claims-and the Service's below-that A113 complied with National Standard 4 because it was conservation-neutral, Defendants and Intervenors also take the seemingly inconsistent position that A113\n   <em>\n    does in fact\n   </em>\n   promote conservation. They argue it does so because A113 was designed to provide social benefits to the Atka and Adak communities-which they insist is a legitimate \"conservation\" purpose under the MSA, citing to the Secretary's advisory guidelines for National Standard 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.325\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(ii) (stating that an allocation may \"promote conservation (in the sense of wise use) by optimizing the yield in terms of size, value, market mix, price, or economic or social benefit of the product\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Service, however, did not make that claim in adopting A113. Rather, the Council in its Regulatory Impact Review stated that A113 was \"reasonably calculated to promote conservation\" as required by National Standard 4 because it \"would not change the TACs for Pacific cod in the BS or AI or modify any measures currently in place to protect living marine resources.\" AR 1000158. The Service specifically reaffirmed that position when adopting A113 in response to a comment arguing that the harvest set-aside did not comply with the conservation requirement of National Standard 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1000281 (\"[The Service] has also determined that the set-aside is reasonably calculated to promote conservation\" because it \"do[es] not modify the process for specifying [catch limitations] for the Bering Sea and Aleutian\n   Islands Pacific cod fishery [or other existing BSAI allocations].\"). In fact, the Service did so despite previously recommending to the Council while it was developing A113 that it should explain how the set-aside would provide \"social benefits to the local fishing communities,\" such that the Council could then \"clearly, explicitly, and more thoroughly articulate the conservation objectives of the proposed action\" and comply with National Standard 4. AR 3000536-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   At the hearing, Defendants acknowledged that the Service did not explicitly link its findings on the potential socio-economic benefits to Adak and Atka with A113's compliance with National Standard 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hrg.

In response to a comment about National Standard 8, the Service did state that it found A113 to be \"consistent with the management objectives of the FMP\" because of its \"potential societal benefits, such as providing socially and economically viable fisheries for the well-being of fishing communities.\" AR 1000283; 81 Fed. Reg. at 84,446. Yet even then, the Service never mentioned the\n   <em>\n    conservation\n   </em>\n   objectives of the FMP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court does not question those analyses, nor does it doubt Defendants' insistence that these goals were the driving purpose in implementing this harvest set-aside. Indeed, as discussed, the Service framed A113 as \"directly responsive to National Standard 8.\" AR 1000795. Even so, the Court, in reviewing the Service's conclusion that A113 complied with National Standard 4, is limited to the rationale put forth by the Service.\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[C]ourts may not accept ... counsel's\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalizations for agency action.

And the Court is wary of endorsing a \"magic words\" requirement here. But the Court, for several reasons, will not equate the Service's general conclusions that A113 will benefit the communities of Adak and Atka with fulfillment of the Service's statutory duty to explain how the amendment comports with National Standard 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   At the outset, as noted, the Service in approving A113 took the position that the amendment complied with National Standard 4 because it made no changes to the existing regulatory scheme for total catch limits and harvest allocations, not because it benefitted Adak and Atka.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1000281; 81 Fed. Reg. at 84,444 (noting that A113 \"do[es] not modify\" the existing framework and \"continue[s] to promote and do[es] not undermine the conservation measures established under\" other regulatory schemes). The Court questions why\n   the Service would need to characterize this amendment as \"promot[ing] conservation\" because it did not undermine existing conservation measures if its central purpose-assisting Adak and Atka-was, all along, a legitimate \"conservation\" goal in its own right under National Standard 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Furthermore, the Court struggles to see what purpose National Standard 8 would serve if, as Defendants contend, the \"importance of fishery resources to fishing communities [based on] economic and social data\" that the Service must \"take into account\" under National Standard 8-considerations that admittedly drove the Service's decision to adopt A113-constitutes a \"conservation\" objective of the type contemplated in National 4.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201851\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8). If anything, Congress's inclusion of National Standard 8 appears to suggest that the socio-economic benefits to the communities of Adak and Atka identified by the Service are\n   <em>\n    distinct\n   </em>\n   from the \"conservation\" objectives contemplated in National Standard 4. In fact, this distinction is reflected in the Secretary's own advisory guidelines. For example, under National Standard 8, he instructs that \"[d]eliberations regarding the importance of fishery resources to affected fishing communities ...\n   <em>\n    must not compromise\n   </em>\n   the achievement of\n   <em>\n    conservation\n   </em>\n   requirements and goals.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.345\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (emphasis added). And for National Standard 4, he refers to \"[\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ther\n   </em>\n   factors\"-that is, apart from \"conservation\"-that include \"economic and social consequences of the scheme, food production, consumer interest, [and] dependence on the fishery by present participants and coastal communities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 600.325(c)(3)(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court cannot be altogether sure what National Standard 4's guidelines mean when they state that an allocation can promote conservation \"in the sense of wise use\" by \"optimizing the yield in terms of size, value, market mix, price, or economic or social benefit of the product.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 600.325(c)(3)(ii). But it need not wrestle with that question here, because the Service, in explaining why A113 complied with National Standard 4, did not rely on that guidance. And for the reasons explained, the Court cannot accept Defendants' argument that the socio-economic benefits identified for purposes of National Standard 8 are a sufficient substitute for the Service's obligation to provide a rational explanation of how A113 is consistent with the requirements of National Standard 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   At bottom, the Court finds that the Service failed to show that A113 complied with National Standard 4-and specifically, the requirement that an allocation of fishing privileges be \"reasonably calculated to promote conservation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201851\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B). The Service's conclusion that A113 is consistent with National Standard 4 because it made no changes to the various existing measures protecting fishery resources is simply not rational in light of the text of that standard and the facts in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C &amp; W Fish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3491540,1801887\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/931/1556/\">\n    931 F.2d at 1562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And it finds the memorandum of little use in determining whether Congress \"directly spoke[ ] to the precise question[s]\" for purposes of applying the\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    framework.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n     467 U.S. at 842\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n     104 S.Ct. 2778\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The parties spent little time addressing the appropriate framework for reviewing the Service's conclusions that A113 was consistent with the National Standards, and each appeared to proceed under the assumption that the Court should review those determinations under the familiar \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard set forth in\n    <em>\n     State Farm\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n     463 U.S. 29\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n     103 S.Ct. 2856\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.'

Defendants in particular never claimed that those conclusions, or the understanding of the National Standards on which they are based, should be reviewed under\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    's two-step framework. Indeed, they raised\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    only in response to Plaintiffs' arguments as to the definition of \"fishing.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Reply at 4-5. But even if Defendants had invoked\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    , and the Court found it applicable and recognized an ambiguity in the statutory text, that would not save them here. The Service's explanations of what the National Standards require, as discussed in more detail below, are so divorced from the statutory text that they would necessarily fail under\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    's second step.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    As previously noted,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    note 10, Defendants have not claimed any entitlement to deference under\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    on this issue. That framework appears most applicable, if anywhere, on the matter addressed here. But again, even if Defendants were to claim\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    deference, and even if the Court were to determine that an ambiguity exists in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201851\">\n     16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1851\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(4)(B), the Court finds that Defendants' understanding of what this prong of National Standard 4 requires is entirely foreclosed by the clear text of that provision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Defendants and Intervenors also point to\n    <em>\n     NRDC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211399\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/35/#p40\">\n     71 F.Supp.3d 35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , in support of their claim that A113 need not itself have a conservation purpose as long as it does not undermine the broader conservation goals of the FMP.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' MSJ at 25; Intervs.' MSJ at 28. In that case, the court upheld the Service's decision to rescind an existing conservation measure that it found in practice had not had a beneficial effect on the health of the fishery, and to justify its decision by pointing to the negative economic effects the measure had on industry participants.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     NRDC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211399\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/35/#p40\">\n     71 F.Supp.3d at 53-54\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But the plaintiffs in that case challenged the amendment under National Standard 8, which does not specifically address allocations of fishing privileges and does not include the same directive that an allocation \"promote\" conservation in National Standard 4.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211399\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/35/#p40\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 59-60 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201851\">\n     16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1851\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(8) (requiring only that conservation and management measures remain \"consistent with the conservation requirements of\" the MSA when taking into account effects on fishing communities). To be clear, Defendants and Intervenors cited to\n    <em>\n     NRDC\n    </em>\n    in arguing that A113 complied with National Standard 8. But they relied on the same rationale in defending the amendment under National Standard 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
