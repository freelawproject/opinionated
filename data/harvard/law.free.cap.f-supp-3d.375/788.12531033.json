[DE 20-1, at 2]. \"As part of its obligations as general contractor, Denham-Blythe contracted with several Contractors to complete the design and construction process[,]\" including BlueScope, Varco Pruden Buildings (\"Varco\") (a division of BlueScope), and Arrow Metals and Coatings, Inc.

On March 2, 2012, the roof of the Building was damaged by severe winds and was subsequently repaired by Denham-Blythe. [DE 20-1, at 2]. Again, on March 1, 2017, the roof of the Building sustained damage from severe winds, and Denham-Blythe completed both the temporary repair work and permanent repair work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the roof was damaged on March 1, 2017, Asahi submitted property damages claims to its insurer, Plaintiff Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance USA, Inc. (\"Mitsui\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"According to the Complaint, Mitsui Sumitomo made payments to Asahi in response to the claims in the amount of $ 1,315,092.00 under policy PKG3126694 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Policy') with effective dates of October 1, 2016 through October 1, 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing [DE 20-3] ).

BlueScope's Motion for Judgement on the Pleadings [DE 28] is nearly identical to Denham-Blythe's Motion to Dismiss [DE 20].

Mitsui does not dispute Denham-Blythe's assertions that Kentucky jurisprudence and federal policy favor arbitration and arbitration clauses are enforceable. [DE 25]. Instead, while acknowledging Denham-Blythe referred to sections A.4.3.1 and A.4.4.1, Mitsui contends, \"[Denham-Blythe] omits discussion of \u00a7 A.4.2.2 which in fact precludes the parties from engaging in alternative dispute resolution.\" [DE 25, at 17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Section A.4.2.2 of the Contract states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   If the parties have not identified a Neutral in Section 6.1 of the Agreement or elsewhere in the Design-Build Documents then, except for those claims arising under Sections A.10.3 and A.10.5, the Owner shall provide an initial decision. An initial decision by the Owner shall be required as a condition precedent to mediation of all Claims between the Owner and Design-Builder arising prior to the date final payment is due, unless 30 days have passed after the Claim has been referred to the Owner with no decision having been rendered by the Owner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [DE 20-2, at 32].

The initial decision shall be final and binding on the parties but subject first to mediation under Section A.4.3 and thereafter to such other dispute resolution methods as provided in Section 6.2 of the Agreement or elsewhere in the Design-Build Documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9248217\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/134/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mitsui correctly asserts Sections A.10.3 and A.10.5 \"concern claims regarding hazardous materials which are irrelevant here.\" [DE 25, at 18 (citing [DE 20-2, at 42] ) ]. Regarding Section 6.1 of the Agreement, the contracting parties were directed to appoint an \"individual to serve as a Neutral pursuant to Section A.4.2 of Exhibit A, Terms and Conditions,\" but the contracting parties chose not to do so. [DE 20-2, at 6]. Since the contracting parties failed to identify a Neutral, Section A.4.2.2 required Asahi, the Owner, to provide an initial decision. [DE 20-2, at 32].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   According to the plain meaning of Section A.4.2.2, Asahi was required to make an initial decision as a condition precedent to the mediation of claims\n   <em>\n    arising prior to the date final payment was due or within thirty (30) days of the claim being referred to Asahi for an initial decision\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9248217\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/134/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The claim in question did not arise prior to the date final payment was due. However, more than thirty days have passed since the claim was submitted to Asahi for an initial decision. Mitsui's argument that \"the parties cannot proceed to other alternative dispute resolutions of the Construction Contract since Asahi's [initial] decision in this case was to have its carrier file this suit in lieu of mediation\" is unavailing. [DE 25, at 18]. A legal action, such as the present case, is not an initial decision as intended under Section A.4.2. Instead, pursuant to Sections A.4.2.2, A.4.2.3, A.4.3.1, and A.4.4.1, the initial decision was meant to be a written decision by Asahi that would have been final and binding but first must have been subject to mediation, and ultimately, if mediation did not resolve the matter, the claim would be subject to arbitration. [DE 20-2, at 32-33].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mitsui correctly asserts, \"Courts must 'place arbitration agreements on equal footing with other contracts ... enforce[ing] them according to their terms.' \" [DE 25, at 17-18 (citing\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Pursuant to the terms of the present dispute resolution provisions, absent an initial decision from Asahi, and thirty (30) days having passed after submission of the claim to Asahi for initial decision, the claim was subject to mediation then arbitration. [DE 20-2, at 32-33]. In lieu of the contracting parties mediating as directed by the Contract, Mitsui, as subrogee of Asahi, brought this action. As Denham-Blythe correctly asserts, to allow Asahi to ignore the express dispute resolution provisions found in the Contract that require mediation and arbitration and file a lawsuit instead would run afoul of both Kentucky and federal precedent and policy and render dispute resolution provisions \"null and void.\" [DE 26, at 8-9]. If a contracting party could avoid mediation and arbitration by opting to file a lawsuit, dispute resolution provisions requiring mediation and arbitration would serve no purpose because parties who do not favor mediation or arbitration would simply file a lawsuit to avoid alternative dispute resolution. Accordingly, the Court will grant Denham-Blythe's Motion to Dismiss [DE 20], dismiss this action without prejudice, and direct Mitsui to comply with the dispute resolution provisions set forth in the Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     B. DEFENDANT BLUESCOPE'S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Like Defendant Denham-Blythe, Defendant BlueScope argues the following: (1) \"Kentucky law recognizes the sacred right to contract;\" (2) \"[t]he claim is barred by the waiver of subrogation clause contained in the design build contract between Denham-Blythe and Asahi Bluegrass Forge Corporation, under which BlueScope is a defined Contractor;\" and (3) \"[t]he insurance policy issued by Plaintiff to Asahi Bluegrass Forge Corporation granted Asahi the right to waive subrogation.\" [DE 29]. Unlike Denham-Blythe, BlueScope does not argue the claim is barred by the dispute resolution clauses in the contract. Since BlueScope fails to make the dispute resolution clause argument that required Denham-Blythe's Motion to Dismiss [DE 20] be granted, the Court will deny BlueScope's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings [DE 28]. Nevertheless, Mitsui's claims against BlueScope, Varco, and all other Defendants shall be dismissed without prejudice because the Contract required the Parties to mediate this claim, and if mediation did not resolve the issue, to participate in arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Therefore, having considered the matter fully, and being otherwise sufficiently advised,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (1) Defendant Denham-Blythe Company, Inc's Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) [DE 20] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED;\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (2) Defendant BlueScope Buildings North America, Inc.'s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings [DE 28] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED;\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (3) This matter is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE;\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (4) This is a final and appealable order; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (5) Plaintiff Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance USA, Inc. shall\n   <strong>\n    COMPLY\n   </strong>\n   with the dispute resolution provisions set forth in the Contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    To support these assertions, Denham-Blythe cites to both\n    <em>\n     Frear v.
