The Complaint contains graphic and disturbing details of violence and allegations of severe mistreatment. Plaintiff's allegations are not taken lightly by this Court. At this time, Plaintiff moves to proceed anonymously. It is Plaintiff's desire to litigate this case under a pseudonym in an effort to protect herself from future harms including retaliation and emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In deciding a motion to proceed anonymously, a court must balance the interest of the plaintiff with the interests of both the defendants and the public. The general public enjoys a common law right of access to judicial proceedings, and thus, the burden a plaintiff must satisfy in order to proceed under confidentially is exacting. Without ruling on the merits of Plaintiff's case moving forward, an analysis of the submissions by the Parties indicates that Plaintiff has failed to meet the burden required by law. Thus, Plaintiff's instant Motion to Proceed Anonymously is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Jane Doe (hereinafter, \"Plaintiff\") brings this action against Defendants Skyline Automobiles (\"Skyline\"), doing business as Toyota of Manhattan, Freddy Velez, Kevin Primus, and Anthony Namias (collectively, \"Defendants\") alleging discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and New York state law.

Allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously would disadvantage Defendants at all stages of litigation, including settlement, discovery, and trial. Plaintiff's anonymity would make it more difficult to obtain witnesses and witness testimony, Defendants would have less leverage in settlement negotiations, and Defendants would not be able to fully and adequately cross-examine the Plaintiff. For those reasons, the sixth\n   <em>\n    Sealed Plaintiff\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

If a plaintiff's confidentiality has not been maintained throughout the proceedings, there is less of a risk of harm should the plaintiff not be permitted to proceed under a pseudonym. Some courts have indicated that if the identity of a plaintiff was previously disclosed in judicial or administrative proceedings, then the request to proceed anonymously should be denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Rep. at 3. Plaintiff\n   now claims that the risks of physical and emotional harm as well as retaliation will increase should the public be made aware of her identity, without citing any evidence to support that fear of harm from the general public. Thus, because of the disclosure of Plaintiff's identity to Defendants through various administrative proceedings, as well as the lack of evidence corroborating the alleged risk of harm and retaliation from the general public, the seventh factor weighs against allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.

Any analysis and litigation in this case will be factual in nature, and the public interest in sexual assault and discrimination is very high.

Alternative Mechanisms for Protecting Confidentiality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, in consideration with the previous nine factors, courts are to determine \"whether there are any alternative mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of the plaintiff ...\"\n   <em>\n    Sealed Plaintiff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129785\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/185/#p189\">\n    537 F.3d at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, Plaintiff could seek a protective order, or the parties could enter a confidentiality agreement. Due to the existence of alternate means of protecting Plaintiff from the alleged future harms, the final factor weighs against allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff's allegations of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and discrimination are highly sensitive and of a personal nature. Plaintiff's desire to proceed anonymously is understandable, and that desire is one that unfortunately prevents many victims of sexual violence from sharing their story and seeking justice for the harms inflicted upon them. Although Plaintiff's allegations are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, in this case,\n   <em>\n    Sealed Plaintiff\n   </em>\n   factors two through ten either fail to support or weigh against granting Plaintiff's Motion.
