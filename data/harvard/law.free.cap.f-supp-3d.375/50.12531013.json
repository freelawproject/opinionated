MOSS, United States District Judge\n   This matter is before the Court on Plaintiff American Oversight's motion for attorneys' fees. Dkt. 23. In 2017, American Oversight submitted two requests to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , seeking (1) records relating to Attorney General Jeff Sessions's disclosure of any contacts with Russian officials in connection with his security clearance process (\"the Sessions request\") and (2) documents relating to reported communications between White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the FBI regarding press reports of contacts between Russian nationals and individuals associated with the Trump campaign (\"the Priebus request\"). Both requests were resolved without any substantive motions practice. American Oversight has now moved for an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(E).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 23. For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that American Oversight is both eligible and entitled to an award of attorneys' fees. But, in light of the modest amount of work needed to achieve the result that American Oversight sought, its fee request is excessive and must be reduced. The Court will therefore\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   in part American Oversight's motion for attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 9, 2017, Plaintiff submitted a four-part FOIA request to the FBI seeking \"all communications\" exchanged between the FBI and then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, any news media, or any member of Congress or congressional staff regarding reports of \"an FBI investigation dating back to summer 2016 into affiliations between then-candidate Donald J. Trump (and his associates) and Russians known to intelligence officials.\" Dkt. 1 at 5 (Compl. \u00b6 26). Less than two weeks later, on March 20, 2017, American Oversight submitted a second request, seeking \"[a] copy of the Standard Form 86 (SF-86) form prepared by or on behalf of\" then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions \"in connection with his security clearance or background investigation for his appointment to the position of United States Attorney General.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 36(1) ). Plaintiff clarified that it sought \"only the information contained in Section 20B.6 of the SF-86 form relating to contacts with any official of the Russian government\" and that it had \"no objection to the redaction of any other personal information contained in Mr. Session's SF-86 aside from Mr. Sessions's name, the signature line, signature date, and any disclosures regarding contacts with any official of the Russian government.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That request also sought \"[a] copy of any interview notes or summary prepared during the course of Mr. Sessions's background check,\" again stating that it did not oppose \"the redaction of any other personal information regarding Mr. Sessions contained in the background interview notes or summaries aside from any disclosures regarding contacts with any official of the Russian government, the date of the interview, and the name of the interview subject.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 36(2) ). American Oversight requested expedited processing for both the Priebus request and the Sessions request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 5, 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 37). The FBI acknowledged receipt of both,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 24-2 at 9, 23, but did not otherwise respond to\n   the requests within the 20-day statutory time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 19, 2017, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the FBI to produce all non-exempt records responsive to both requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1. (Compl.) Defendants filed an Answer on May 24, 2017, noting that FBI had granted expedited processing of the Priebus request on April 18, 2017, and of the Sessions request on May 4, 2017. Dkt. 8 at 4, 5 (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 30, 40). That same day, the Court set an initial status conference for June 12, 2017, \"to discuss the schedule for further proceedings in this matter.\" May 24, 2017 Minute Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the initial conference on June 12, 2017, counsel for Plaintiff agreed that, because the FBI had since granted expedited processing on both requests, Counts I and IV of the Complaint were moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 19 at 2 (June 12, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). The Court then heard from the parties regarding schedules for processing, producing, and potentially challenging both the Priebus and Sessions requests. American Oversight requested that productions related to the Priebus request \"begin on a rolling basis on July 12th with final production by August 11th.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (June 12, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). Plaintiff further proposed that Defendants split the Sessions request into two separate tracks, completing processing and production of the SF-86 form by June 23, 2017 and producing all remaining non-exempt documents by July 12.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (June 12, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). Defendants, in turn, represented that the agency \"will have completed all of the searches for the Priebus request within 30 days,\" or by July 12, and proposed a schedule based on that date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (June 12, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). Counsel further represented that the FBI had located records responsive to Part 1 of the Sessions request-that is, the SF-86 form-and proposed that the agency complete productions on both parts of the request by July 12, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 5, 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (June 12, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). Following that scheduling conference, the Court ordered that (1) Defendants \"shall\" produce all non-exempt records responsive to the Sessions Request by July 12; (2) Defendants \"shall\" complete searches for records responsive to the Priebus Request by July 12; and (3) the parties must appear for a further status conference on July 13, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 12, 2017 Minute Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 12, 2017-the date of production ordered by the Court-the parties exchanged multiple emails regarding the timing of the FBI's production of records related to the Sessions request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 23-1 at 2-3 (Cafasso Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-15). Plaintiff's counsel attests that, over the course of the day, the FBI gave \"shifting representations\" regarding the timing of the forthcoming production and the reasons the records had not yet been produced.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Cafasso Decl. \u00b6 14). The FBI ultimately issued its response to the Sessions request that evening, withholding a single page in its entirety pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(6), (b)(7)(C), and (b)(7)(E).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 10-1 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The next morning, however, shortly before the Court's status conference, the FBI, \"in consultation with the Attorney General ... consented to a discretionary release of this record\" and voluntarily provided Plaintiff with a copy of the single SF-86 page the agency had withheld.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11 at 1. At the status conference later that day, Plaintiff objected to the production of the form without any \"identifiable information on it\"-specifically, without the page containing Mr. Sessions's name and signature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 20 at 5 (July 13, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). Counsel for Defendants responded that they had not produced that page because they \"d[id] not read\" the\n   original Sessions FOIA request \"to ask for a signature page.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (July 13, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). Without ruling on the issue, the Court suggested-purely as a matter of efficiency-that Defendants \"see if [the signature page] can simply be produced,\" so that \"the issue [could] go away\" without further briefing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (July 13, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). The Court made clear, however, that should an issue arise regarding the signature page, the Court would resolve it at a later date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (July 13, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). The parties also represented that they would confer to narrow the Priebus request, which had generated more than 8,300 potentially responsive documents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (July 13, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). Following the July 13 hearing, the Court issued a Minute Entry setting a further status conference for August 14, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 13, 2017, Minute Entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties returned to the Court for a final status conference the next month. At that status conference, Plaintiff confirmed that the Department of Justice had produced the signature page of the SF-86 form on August 1 and, accordingly, American Oversight \"[didn't] see any additional issues with the Sessions request.\" Dkt. 21 at 3 (Aug. 14, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). Plaintiff's counsel also informed the Court that Defendants had produced \"four pages responsive to item number four [of the Priebus request] ... and [had indicated] that there were no records responsive to item one\" of the Priebus request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Aug. 14, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). Plaintiff further explained that \"the parties [were] very, very close to [agreeing on] a production schedule\" with respect to Parts 2 and 3 of the Priebus request, having \"agreed to a 90-day production with an interim production at 45 days\" but with \"one remaining issue\" for the Court to decide.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Aug. 14, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). Plaintiff asked the Court to order that Defendants process and produce half of the records potentially responsive to the remaining two parts of the Priebus request within 45 days, and Defendants asked that they be allowed to complete an interim production of unspecified size within 45 days.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Aug. 14, 2017 Hrg. Trans.). Following the status conference, the Court issued a Minute Entry, ordering that Defendants \"shall make an interim production on or before [September 28, 2017], with completion of production by [November 13, 2017]\" and that the parties should submit a further status report \"by [November 21, 2017], which shall include a joint proposed schedule for briefing, if there are outstanding issues to be resolved.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 14, 2017 Minute Entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 28, 2017, Defendants produced to Plaintiff all remaining non-exempt records responsive to Parts 2 and 3 of the Priebus request, totaling 239 pages in full or with partial redactions, and a single withheld duplicate page.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 13. On November 21, 2017, the parties submitted a joint status report informing the Court that no further substantive briefing would be required in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs now seek an award of \"reasonable attorneys' fees and costs\" in the amount of $ 24,092.94 in attorneys' fees, $ 8,252.42 in \"fees-on-fees,\" $ 474.04 in costs, and $ 295.65 in supplemental costs. Dkt. 25 at 30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 23. As explained below, the Court concludes that American Oversight is both eligible and entitled to an award of attorney's fees.

For support, Defendants rely on the declaration by David Hardy, Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section of the FBI, averring that \"the FBI had already begun working on both requests at the time Plaintiff filed suit.\" Dkt. 24-1 at 5 (Hardy Decl. \u00b6 14). As a result, Defendants argue, American Oversight \"has not demonstrated that, had it simply allowed Defendants to continue processing its request, ... Defendants would not have completed their processing of the Sessions [r]equest by July 12 and their searches for the Priebus [r]equest by the same date.\" Dkt. 24 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As a threshold matter, even if Defendants were already \"processing\" the records, nothing in the Hardy declaration suggests that the FBI planned to produce the relevant records on the same timeline as the one adopted by the Court, absent this litigation. But, more importantly, Plaintiff could still satisfy the judicial-order requirement by showing that the Court issued an order adopting an existing production schedule. The D.C. Circuit has explained that, once a judicial order requires the \"timely production of nonexempt documents\" by an agency, any subsequent production \"could no longer be described as a voluntary change\" in the agency's conduct-and the order thus constitutes a \"judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Davy I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560331,3349982\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/162/\">\n    456 F.3d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted). In\n   <em>\n    Davy I\n   </em>\n   , for example, the parties entered into a joint stipulation agreeing to a mutually acceptable schedule for production, which the court then \"memorialized\" in an order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560331,3349982\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/162/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560331,3349982\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/162/\">\n    at 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

American Oversight's FOIA requests satisfy this standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The question whether Attorney General Sessions listed any contacts with Russian government officials on his SF-86 form was a matter of substantial interest in the media, and the release of his SF-86 was the focus of extensive reporting. American Oversight, for example, points to nineteen news reports relating to the release of the relevant portion of the form. Dkt. 23 at 14-16. Defendants, for their part, do not dispute that the question whether Attorney General Sessions had reported any contacts with Russian government officials\n   was a matter of substantial public interest. But they contend that the release of the SF-86 form did not benefit the public because the Department of Justice \"had already made a public, official statement about ... 'what was actually included or not in the SF-86 on that issue[.]' \" Dkt. 24 at 27 (quoting June 12, 2017 Tr.). Defendants then point to a May 25, 2017 statement from the Department of Justice spokesperson, \"explaining that '[i]n filling out the SF-86 form, the Attorney General's staff ... was instructed not to list meetings with foreign dignitaries and their staff connected with his Senate activities.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants' rejoinder fails for two reasons. First, American Oversight served its FOIA request seeking release of the SF-86 on March 20, 2017 and brought the present lawsuit on April 19, 2017-both weeks before the Department spokesperson explained on May 25, 2017 that Attorney General Sessions's staff had been advised not to include meetings with foreign dignitaries connected with his Senate activities. As a result, although the press statement was not required by court order, American Oversight can plausibly maintain that its FOIA request played a role in prompting the Department publicly to address the contents of the SF-86. Second, as the public reporting demonstrates, the public interest in the contents of the SF-86 did not fade after May 25, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The question whether the FBI was persuaded by White House Chief of Staff Priebus \"to push back against news stories about contacts between Trump aides and Russians during the presidential campaign,\"\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ken Dilanian &amp; Kristen Welker,\n   <em>\n    Trump Aide Reince Priebus Asked FBI to Knock Down Russia Stories\n   </em>\n   , NBC News (Feb. 24, 2017, 12:09 PM), https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-aide-reince-priebusasked-fbi-knock-down-russia-stories-n725261, was also an issue of substantial public interest. Dkt. 23 at 17 &amp; n.5 (listing press reports). Again, Defendants do not dispute that the topic was one that might have been of public interest. But they note that American Oversight's FOIA request failed to yield any records of public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This contention also fails for two reasons. First, the absence of evidence that the FBI commented on the press reports about Russian contacts at the behest of the White House Chief of Staff is itself a matter of public interest. The fact that the press had previously reported that the \"FBI rejected a recent White House request to publicly knock down media reports about communications between Donald Trump's associates and Russians known to US intelligence during the 2016 presidential campaign,\" Jim Sciutto et al.,\n   <em>\n    FBI Refused White House Request to Knock Down Recent Trump-Russia Stories\n   </em>\n   , CNN (Feb. 24, 2017, 12:19 AM), http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/23/politics/fbi-refused-white-house-request-to-knock-down-recent-trump-russia-stories/, moreover, is beside the point. American Oversight sought to confirm the accuracy of that statement, and the fact that it found no contrary evidence was itself of public value. Second, the D.C. Circuit has held that courts must assess the potential public value of information sought under FOIA, as opposed to the public value information that is actually disclosed.

Second,\n   <em>\n    Morley\n   </em>\n   did not hold that a delay in responding to a FOIA request or in releasing records should have no bearing on a court's decision whether to award fees, only that missing \"the 20-day mark\" does not invariably \"require\" that the court award fees.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517490\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/389/#p392\">\n    894 F.3d at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted). Third, the Court must consider the delay at issue in light of \"the purposes behind the fourth factor,\" which \"is meant to 'incentiviz[e] the government to promptly turn over-before litigation is required-any documents that it ought not withhold.' \"\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529281\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/356/155/#p167\">\n    356 F.Supp.3d at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Davy II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865849,5883933\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1155/\">\n    550 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1166 ). That consideration, moreover, bears special emphasis in the present context, where the FBI eventually agreed that expedited processing was warranted because the requests touched on matters \"of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exists possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence,\" Dkt. 24-2 at 12, 26, but missed the deadline for even making that preliminary determination by a month or more as to both requests. Dkt. 8 at 4, 5 (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 30, 40). Finally, even after granting expedited processing, the FBI took over two months to release the portion of the SF-86 that American Oversight sought,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 10, it and took over five months to complete the Priebus request productions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court is cognizant that the Department \"voluntarily\" released the portion of the SF-86 at issue and that the Court never held that the release was required by FOIA. For present purposes, however, the Court has not been asked-and it would not constitute a prudent use of judicial resources-to adjudicate the merits of a claim that was mooted by the Department's agreement to produce the record.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

That does not explain, however, the delay in releasing the records responsive to the Priebus request, and it does not explain why the FBI took a month to decide even whether expedited processing of either request was warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In sum, this is not a case in which fees are unavailable because the government's position was \"correct as a matter of law,\"\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817763,11311639\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/11/211/\">\n    11 F.3d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , nor it a case in which\n   the government acted in bad faith or in a defiant or intractable manner. The reasonableness of the FBI's actions, moreover, must be assessed in light of the fees that American Oversight seeks.

Rather, it seeks fees for the cost of bringing suit and then pressing the Department to release records of potential national importance as promptly as possible.

The Court therefore need not-and should not-scrutinize every billing entry. The Court will, however, address American Oversight's fee request, and Defendants' objections, in broad strokes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants first argue that American Oversight \"systematically billed excessive numbers of hours for simple tasks attendant to all FOIA litigation-involving little to no complex litigation strategy, substantive expertise, or legal research and argument-and routinely overstaffed these straightforward tasks with multiple attorneys.\" Dkt. 24 at 38. As a result, Defendants urge the Court to apply \"a minimum of a one-third reduction in fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. The Court agrees that a one-third reduction is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants first contend that American Oversight overstaffed the matter when it assigned three lawyers to assist in preparing the complaint, and they argue that American Oversight's claim for $ 5,324.30 for the cost of preparing the complaint is unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. The Court, however, disagrees. As American Oversight indicates, it reduced the hours for which it is seeking reimbursement of its own accord. Dkt. 23-1 at 21-25. As a result, even though Defendants are correct that three lawyers are not required to prepare a routine FIOA complaint,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267741\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/149/#p158\">\n    80 F.Supp.3d 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158 (D.D.C. 2015), American Oversight has already accounted for that fact by reducing the hours claimed for all three lawyers. Portions of the time attributed to preparing the complaint, moreover, included filing the complaint and preparing and filing the affidavit of service. Reviewing time records, of course, is not a precise science, but fees of slightly over $ 5,000-at billing rates of between $ 440 and $ 717 per hour-for preparing, filing, and serving a complaint appear reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court is unpersuaded, however, that attorneys' fees of almost $ 20,000 for attending three status conferences and\n   conferring with opposing counsel is reasonable. The Court recognizes that American Oversight, once again, reduced the number of hours for which it is seeking fees of its own accord. But, even with that reduction, American Oversight's fee request includes some overstaffing and unnecessary efforts. American Oversight's time records, for example, reflect numerous conferences among American Oversight lawyers about the status of Defendants' production, preparation for the status conferences, and debriefings about the status conferences. They also reflect \"moots\" for the status conferences and the attendance of two attorneys at a status hearing on one occasion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 23-1 at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Extensive preparation is, of course, a good thing. But Defendants should not be required to foot the bill for preparation above and beyond what was reasonably necessary. Even assuming that American Oversight required four hours preparation to attend each of the three status conferences, each lasting no more than an hour including travel time, and assuming an average billing rate of $ 600 (the lead lawyer on the matter billed her time at $ 440), reasonable attorneys' fees for the three status conferences would amount to only $ 9,000. If the Court then adds to that amount the $ 5,324.30 in fees incurred in preparing and filing the complaint, and adds another $ 1,250 for reviewing and analyzing the FBI's responses to the Priebus request, (American Oversight seeks $ 1,276.32,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267741\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/149/#p158\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) the total fees should amount to less than $ 16,000-or approximately two-thirds of the amount claimed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court will therefore discount the fee award by one-third to address overstaffing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Success on the Merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendants also argue that \"a 50% reduction in fees overall would be appropriate to reflect the very limited success American Oversight obtained in this lawsuit.\" Dkt. 24 at 40-41. This reduction is, according to Defendants, appropriate \"\n   <em>\n    in addition to\n   </em>\n   the reduction for Plaintiff's inefficiencies and overstaffing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267741\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/149/#p158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 41 n. 5. They contend that this reduction is warranted because \"every single oral request that American Oversight made to the Court at the status conferences in this case ... was rejected by this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The government is correct that \"[a] plaintiff's overall success on the merits also must be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee award.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Cir. 2006). The Court is unpersuaded, however, that American Oversight suffered the litigation setbacks that Defendants posit. As discussed at greater length above, American Oversight succeeded in obtaining judicial orders that ensured that the FBI would expeditiously respond to their FOIA requests. The fact that the Court did not adopt the specific scheduled proposed by American Oversight at the status conferences does not substantially undercut that victory. In one sense, the Court agrees that American Oversight's victory was limited: American Oversight did not obtain a court order compelling the FBI to release records that it had decided to withhold. But that limitation is already reflected in the fees that American Oversight is requesting. It is not, for example, seeking fees for substantive motions practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that the fee award should not be reduced based on the results that American Oversight achieved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Fees on Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, Defendants briefly argue that American Oversight should not be\n   awarded \"fees on fees,\" or, at the very least the Court should discount that fee award by \"[w]hatever percentage reduction the Court applies to the merits fees.\" Dkt. 24 at 41. Given that American Oversight prevailed in this case and has prevailed at least in part on its fees petition, the Court sees no basis to depart from the \"settled\" rule in this circuit that \"[h]ours reasonably devoted to a request for fees are compensable.\"\n   <em>\n    Noxell Corp. v.
