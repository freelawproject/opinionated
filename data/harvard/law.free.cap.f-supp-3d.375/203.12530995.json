(\"Plaintiff\") brought this action against Defendants Highmark Blue Shield (\"Highmark\") and Reed Smith LLP (\"Reed Smith,\" collectively \"Defendants\") for under-reimbursement for surgical services pursuant to the Employment Retirement Income Security Act. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendants motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. (\"Rule\") 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following relevant facts come from the Amended Complaint (\"Am. Compl.\") and are assumed true for purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This matter concerns a 4-year old girl (\"Patient\") who is allegedly insured through a Group Benefits Program sponsored by Defendant Reed Smith. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 1 - 2.) Defendant Highmark is the \"Claims Administrator\" and the \"Third-Party Administrator\" for Reed Smith's insurance plan (\"Plan\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1, 12). On January 12, 2016, the Patient was\n   admitted to Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park (\"Hospital\") with multiple sutural synostosis and degenerating cranial deformity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) A physician, Dr. Schneider, examined the Patient and determined she required surgery to treat her condition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Schneider performed the surgery the same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Dr. Schneider was the only pediatric neurosurgeon with privileges at the Hospital who could perform the complex surgery the Patient required, which is to say that there were no \"in-network\" surgeons who could perform the surgery at the Hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) In fact, Defendant Highmark has no in-network pediatric neurosurgeons anywhere in Nassau County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently submitted an invoice that it summarizes as follows: \"(i) CPT Code 21175 with modifier 80 in the amount of $ 24,166.50, but Highmark allowed only $ 888.23 thereof; (ii) CPT Code 15732 (2 units at $ 16,500 each) in the total amount of $ 33,000, but Highmark allowed only $ 2,461.10 thereof; and (iii) CPT Code 61559 with a modifier 22 in the amount of $ 66,000, but Highmark allowed only $ 5,489.70 thereof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, out of the $ 123,166.50 billed, the total amount allowed was $ 8,839.03. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Defendant Highmark's explanation of benefits dated February 29, 2016 stated that Plaintiff was out of network and that the Patient was responsible for the amount not covered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Plaintiff filed an initial appeal on April 7, 2016, explaining that the rates were based on the \"usual and customary treatment charges for the specialty and the geographic region where the treatment was provided.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Plaintiff requested the applicable policy language that justified the reduction as well as the data used to establish the reduction rate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Highmark never provided the additional documentation requested and denied the request for additional reimbursement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed a Second Level Appeal on October 7, 2016, reiterating that it had never received the applicable fee schedule or policy guidelines to support the payment method. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Defendant Highmark denied the Second Level Appeal on October 7, 2016, again failing to provide any of the requested information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) On January 6, 2017, Highmark sent a letter to Plaintiff indicating that the Patient was only entitled to two levels of appeal and that all appeals were exhausted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) In this letter, Defendant Highmark further stated that when covered services are provided outside of the geographic area by non-participating providers, the Plan allowance is based upon the prices established by the local Highmark licensee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Highmark established the rates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Around this time, Dr. Schneider sent a letter explaining the surgery to Defendant Highmark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) On February 21, 2017, Defendant Highmark responded to Dr. Schneider's letter stating that the claim was reviewed and that the additional information submitted by Dr. Schneider did not substantiate the complexity or necessity for extended time to warrant additional reimbursement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In all of Defendant Highmark's communications with Plaintiff and its employees, Highmark never explained how it processed the claim or the terms of the Summary Plan Description (\"SPD\") that controlled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 5, 2017, Plaintiff's outside counsel sent an appeal letter to Defendant Highmark requesting that it reprocess the claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Defendant Highmark did not respond for almost eight months - finally sending a letter on December 4, 2017, stating that the claim was \"processed correctly in accordance with the non-contracted provider allowance established under\n   the member's benefits agreement[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Highmark did not provide a copy of the referenced agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At some time between the surgery in 2016 and the time this action was commenced, the Patient's parents signed an Assignment of Insurance Benefits that gave Plaintiff the right to file claims and appeals, and institute necessary litigation on the Patient's behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) The Patient further designated Plaintiff her Authorized Representative under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.5031\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.5031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff commenced the instant action on December 8, 2017, by filing a Complaint in State Court. On January 5, 2018, Defendant Highmark removed the action to Federal Court. Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on February 28, 2018, and Defendants Highmark and Reed Smith moved to dismiss the action on June 19, 2018. On June 22, 2018, Plaintiff requested leave to file a sur-reply on the single issue of whether the Administrative Service Agreement (\"ASA\") is an ERISA Plan Document. The Court granted such leave and Plaintiff filed its sur-reply on July 20, 2018. The Court will analyze this threshold question first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I. Whether the ASA is a Plan Document\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants' entire argument advanced in support of this motion to dismiss hinges on their assertion that the anti-assignment provision in the ASA precludes assignment by the Patient of her rights to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply Mem. in Supp. [ECF No. 21] at 2.) Plaintiff asserts that the ASA was never distributed or available to the Patient or other Plan beneficiaries. (Sur-reply [ECF No. 24] at 3.) Defendants do not say otherwise in any of their papers. Moreover, Defendants effectively concede that there is\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   anti-assignment provision in the SPD that was provided to Plaintiff's family as beneficiaries of the Plan. Plaintiff, in turn, concedes that if there is a valid anti-assignment provision that is applicable, Plaintiff is barred from bringing the instant action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp [ECF No. 20] at 4.) Thus, the determinative question in this matter is whether the anti-assignment provision in the ASA applies to the Patient's assignment of her rights and benefits under the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that there is a dispute over whether Third Circuit or Second Circuit case law should control. Defendants argue that the ASA provides that Pennsylvania substantive law should apply, so the Court should look to Third Circuit precedent. (Mem. in Supp. at 4.) Plaintiff, on the other hand, cites to Second Circuit precedent throughout its papers. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mem. in Opp. at 4 et seq.) Neither side provides the Court with any authority as to whether the Pennsylvania choice of law provision extends to how this Court should interpret an ERISA document - an inquiry that falls squarely within the purview of federal law. However, the Court need not decide this issue for apparently neither Circuit has decided the question of whether an ASA is a plan document for these purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Third Circuit has recently held that \"anti-assignment clauses in ERISA-governed health insurance plans as a general matter are enforceable.\"\n   <em>\n    Am. Orthopedic &amp; Sports Medicine v. Independence Blue Cross Blue Shield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516958\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/445/#p453\">\n    890 F.3d 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 453 (3d Cir. 2018). Likewise, the Second Circuit has held that \"an assignment is ineffectual if the [ERISA benefit] plan contains an unambiguous anti-assignment provision.\"\n   <em>\n    McCulloch Orthopaedic Surgical Svcs., PLLC v. Aetna Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276489\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/141/#p147\">\n    857 F.3d 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Physicians Multispecialty Grp. v.

However, neither the Second nor the Third Circuit has decided whether an ASA is a \"Plan Document\" under ERISA such that an anti-assignment provision in an ASA would be binding on Plan participants. Accordingly, the Court looks elsewhere for guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For ERISA-purposes, a plan document \"is one which a plan participant could read to determine his or her rights or obligations under the plan\" and not one that merely \"memoralize[s] the obligations [the administrator] and Defendant Company owed to each other.\"\n   <em>\n    Local 56, United Food and Commercial Workers Union v.

The First Circuit has also considered whether the Court could look to an ASA to cure ambiguity, and found that \"[a]ny terms that concern the relationship between the claims administrator and the beneficiaries cannot be held against the beneficiaries where, as here, the terms appear in a financing arrangement between the employer and the claims administrator that was never seasonably disseminated to the beneficiaries against whom enforcement is sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Stephanie C. v.

The Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) is Denied\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court should dismiss this action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) because Plaintiff lacks standing to bring this suit in light of the ASA's anti-assignment provision. The Court has already found that this anti-assignment provision is not binding on the Patient. Thus, when the Patient assigned her rights to Plaintiff, Plaintiff was vested with standing to bring the instant action. As such, Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III. Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants state in their introduction to their Memorandum in Support that they also move to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). However, Rule 12(b)(6) is never mentioned again in either their Memorandum in Support or in their Reply Memorandum in Further Support, and they do not advance any arguments in support of such motion. As Defendants abandoned their motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), it is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6) is denied in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
