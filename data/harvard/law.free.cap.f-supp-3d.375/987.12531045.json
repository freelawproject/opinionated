MB Financial's banking services include the issuance of debit cards associated with its customers' checking accounts. The debit cards allow MB Financial's customers to have electronic access to their checking accounts for purchases, payments, withdrawals, and other electronic debit transactions. Boone is an Illinois citizen who has an account and debit card with MB Financial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. MB Financial's Debit Card Transaction Procedure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Boone alleges that MB Financial maintains a running account balance in real time, tracking funds consumers have for immediate use. This running account balance is adjusted, in real-time, to account for debit card transactions at the precise instant they are made. When a customer makes a purchase with a debit card, MB Financial sequesters the funds needed to pay the transaction, subtracting the dollar amount of the transaction from the customer's account balance. The sequestered funds are not available for any other use by the customer. At a later point, which can be several days after the transaction, the sequestered funds are transferred from the customer's account to the merchant's account, a process known as settling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Underlying Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Boone's alleges that from 2015 to 2017, MB Financial assessed her overdraft (\"OD\") fees in purported violation of its checking agreement and Illinois law. In asserting her claim, Boone relies on the \"Overdraft Disclosure\" and \"Fee Schedule\" (collectively, the \"Checking Agreements\"). The Overdraft Disclosure states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   An overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money available in your account to cover a transaction, but we pay it anyway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Our standard overdraft practice comes with your account and allows us to use our discretion when paying items that will overdraw your account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ATM or everyday debit card transactions that overdraw your account may be declined, unless you sign up for Guard My Card, a service that, at our discretion, pays these types of transactions (overdraft related fees apply). If your transaction is declined, no fee is charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Fee Schedule states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Insufficient Funds and Overdraft Related Fees Overdraft Fee (PD NSF/OD or Paid UCF/DR) $ 37 per time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Returned Item Fee (Ret NSF/OD or Ret UCF/DR) $ 37 per item.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   These fees are not charged unless your account is negative by more than $ 10 and will be deducted from the account the business day following the overdraft. A combined maximum of 5 overdraft and returned item fees are charged per day. The overdraft fee does not apply to ATM and everyday debit card transactions unless you have requested Guard My Card authorizing MB to pay these types of transactions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   To determine your available balance, subtract (1) deposits that are not yet available for withdrawal under our Funds Availability Policy, (2) debit card or other transactions that we are legally obligated to pay or have already paid out in cash, (3) other pending transactions such as ACH transactions, and (4) any holds on your balance, such as holds on funds to comply with court orders or other legal requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Boone challenges three aspects of MB Financial's OD fees. Boone's first challenge is predicated on MB Financial's assessment of OD fees on certain debit-card related transactions. Specifically, she alleges that when a customer makes a purchase using a debit card, MB Financial tentatively approves the transaction and purportedly \"sequesters\" an amount of funds from the customer's account to cover the transaction while it remains pending. If the customer's account has a negative balance on the date of settling due to intervening charges that settle sooner than the challenged transaction, MB Financial charges\n   an OD fee on the challenged transaction (\"Authorize Positive, Purportedly Settle Negative,\" or \"APPSN\"). Boone alleges that because MB Financial \"sequesters\" funds in the checking account at the time of purchase for the debit card transactions, an assessment of an OD fee on an APPSN transaction violates MB Financial's contractual obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Boone's second claim challenges MB Financial's assessment of the Continuous Daily Overdraft fee (\"CDOF\"). A CDOF \"is charged beginning on the second consecutive calendar day the account is negative by more than $ 10.\" Boone claims this language prevents MB Financial from assessing CDOF \"until two full calendar days after the day an account goes negative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Boone's third claim challenges MB Financial's discretion over whether to pay an overdraft fee. Boone argues that MB Financial has abused its discretion by charging too many overdraft fees, in effect maximizing its profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 12, 2018, Boone filed her three-count putative class action complaint against MB Financial, alleging: (1) breach of contract stemming from her APPSN and CDOF claims; (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (3) Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practice Act. On July 13, 2018, MB Financial filed the instant motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. MB Financial seeks dismissal of all three counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\"tests the sufficiency of the complaint, not the merits of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    McReynolds v.

Therefore, the sole issue we must evaluate is whether Boone has sufficiently alleged that MB Financial breached the Checking Agreements. We evaluate each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. APPSN Transactions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Boone's first breach of contract claim alleges that MB Financial improperly assesses OD fees on APPSN transactions. Boone alleges MB Financial breached the terms of their Checking Agreements by charging OD fees on transactions that were authorized as sufficient funds, but whose available balances were allegedly insufficient at the time the transaction settled. MB Financial alleges the Checking Agreements expressly permit this conduct. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Boone invokes the following language to support her position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   An overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money available in your account to cover a transaction, but we pay it anyway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   ATM or everyday debit card transactions that overdraw your account may be declined, unless you sign up for Guard My Card, a service that, at our discretion, pays these types of transactions (overdraft related fees apply). If your transaction is declined, no fee is charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   To determine your available balance, subtract (1) deposits that are not yet available for withdrawal under our Funds Availability Policy, (2) debit card or other transactions that we are legally obligated to pay or have already paid out in cash, (3) other pending transactions such as ACH transactions, and (4) any holds on your balance, such as holds on funds to comply with court orders or other legal documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Boone alleges that MB Financial's assessment of OD fees on APPSN Transactions are inconsistent with the underlying language. Specifically, Boone first claims\n   that the underlying language allows MB Financial to solely assess OD fees on transactions with insufficient available funds to pay a given transaction and that the bank will immediately deduct or place a hold on her funds for such transactions. However, we agree with MB Financial's assertion that this occurs when an APPSN transaction is presented for settlement. On the date MB Financial pays the transactions - the settlement date - there are \"insufficient available funds\" because the customer in the interim has chosen to make additional, intervening payments from her account that caused it to have a negative balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Boone next focuses on the Overdraft Disclosure, which states that \"[a]n overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money available in your account to cover a transaction, but we pay it anyway.\" Boone argues that the terms \"to cover\" and \"pay\" are ambiguous, preventing dismissal of her claims. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Boone first alleges that the term \"to cover\" cannot reasonably be read to allow OD fees on APPSN transactions, and urges the Court to follow the reasoning adopted in\n   <em>\n    Lloyd v. Navy Fed. Credit Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201757609\">\n    2018 WL 1757609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (S.D. Cal. 2018). In\n   <em>\n    Lloyd\n   </em>\n   , the court evaluated whether the term \"to cover\" was ambiguous in a contract term identical to Boone's.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201757609\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court found the term ambiguous because the agreements did not \"clearly identify how funds sequestered for a transaction authorized with positive funds are to be used when the transaction is paid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201757609\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court explained that \"if the term 'to cover' means that funds sequestered from a positive account balance will be used to pay for the transaction when it settles ... no overdraft fee could be charged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201757609\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, if \"the term 'to cover' means that sequestered funds are to be used to pay for the transaction when it settles, then [the defendant] presumably does pay for the transaction, which triggers its contractual authority to assess an overdraft fee on the transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201757609\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Based on\n   <em>\n    Lloyd\n   </em>\n   , Boone claims that there are always funds available to \"cover\" a APPSN transaction because the bank \"sequesters\" the funds when it approves the debit transaction. However, MB Financial correctly guides us to the Contract's out-of-order payments provision, which states that the bank will pay transactions in a given order and warns customers that \"[t]he order in which items are paid is important if there is not enough money in your account to pay all of the items that are presented.\" The provision, as MB Financial correctly points out, does not suggest that the Bank will use a different payment order or method only for debit card transactions by \"sequestering\" funds at the time of authorization and then applying the funds at settlement regardless of the intervening changes to the account balance. In fact, the Overdraft Page fails to make any reference to a debit-card transaction or \"debit holds.\" Therefore, we find Boone's argument unavailing and decline to follow the rationale adopted by\n   <em>\n    Lloyd\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Boone next alleges that the Checking Agreements fail to clearly define what it means to \"pay\" an overdraft. Boone argues that \"pay[ment]\" should be understood to mean the time a debit card transaction is authorized. On the other hand, MB Financial argues that payment means the bank's settlement of the transaction with a merchant. We agree with MB Financial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To support her interpretation of the term to \"pay,\" Boone relies on\n   <em>\n    Roberts v. Capital One, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201750445\">\n    2017 WL 1750445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2017). In\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs alleged that their account agreements with defendant bank foreclosed the defendant from assessing OD fees if a customer's\n   balance was positive at the time a merchant requested purchase authorization, but negative when the merchant was paid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The Second Circuit evaluated a provision nearly identical to that which Boone disputes here and determined that the term \"transaction\" could plausibly refer to the consumer's transaction with the merchant or the bank's settlement of the transaction with a merchant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The source of ambiguity in\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   was the contract's \"elect to pay\" language, which suggested two different payment periods. We find this case distinguishable because the Checking Agreements do not state than an OD is created when MB Financial \"decides to pay\" or \"elects to pay a transaction.\" Instead, the Checking Agreements unambiguously provide that an OD occurs when MB Financial pays, and not merely authorizes, an amount in excess of Boone's available balance. Therefore, we find that the Checking Agreements unambiguously support MB Financial's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Boone next argues that the phrase \"ATM or everyday debit card transactions that overdraw your account\" prohibits the assessment of OD fees on APPSN transactions. Boone interprets this phrase as a clear indication that whether a transaction \"overdraws\" the account is made at the time Bank decides whether to pay or decline a transactions, which for electronic, immediate debit transactions can only occur at the time of authorization. However, we agree with MB Financial that this provision merely explains that MB Financial may decline to authorize debit card transactions where the account does not have a sufficient balance to pay the transaction. The phrase does not articulate whether MB Financial will charge an OD fee if it approves a debit card transaction that then overdraws the account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Boone next points to the Fee Schedule, which states that \"[t]o determine your available balance, subtract (1) deposits that are not yet available for withdrawal under our Funds Availability Policy, (2) debit card or other transactions that we are legally obligated to pay or have already paid out in cash.\" Boone interprets this language to mean two things: (1) for purposes of determining OD fees, MB Financial will use the \"available balance,\" which itself is a real-time, running balance that is immediately adjusted when a debit card transaction is authorized; and (2) MB Financial is \"legally obligated to pay\" pending debit card transactions once they are authorized. Again, we find Boone's assertions unavailing because MB Financial correctly points out that the Fee Schedule explains how to determine the available balance for purchases subsequent to a debit card transaction. Indeed, we find that the Fee Schedule does not articulate that an OD is assessed at any time other than settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Accordingly, we find that that Boone has failed to sufficiently plead a breach of contract claim on her APPSN assertions because the Checking Agreements are unambiguous and expressly permit MB Financial's conduct. Therefore, MB Financial's motion to dismiss Boone's APPSN claim is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B. CDOF Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Boone next alleges that MB Financial prematurely charges her CDO Fees. Specifically, Boone claims that MB Financial breached the Checking Agreements by charging CDO fees before the expiration of two business days. MB Financial argues the Checking Agreements expressly permit this conduct. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Fee Schedule assesses a $ 6.50 CDO Fee if an account balance is negative\n   for two days. The Fee Schedule states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Continuous Day Overdraft ... This fee is charged beginning on the second consecutive calendar day the account is negative by more than $ 10.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Boone interprets this provision to mean that MB Financial is unable to assess the CDO fee until two full calendar days after an account goes negative. In reaching this erroneous assertion, Boone argues: (1) \"[I]n our legal system and in our culture more broadly, counting begins on the day after a triggering event;\" and (2) MB Financial should begin counting on the day after the overdraft because MB Financial does not determine initial overdrafts until the end of the business day and assesses OD fees on the day after the overdraft transaction has posted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We find the Fee Schedule's language unambiguous and straight forward. \"Consecutive\" means \"following one after the other in order.\" Merriam-Webster https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consecutive (last visited April 2, 2019). The Court agrees with MB Financial's position that if an account goes into overdraft status on Day 1 and remains in overdraft status on Day 2, then Day 2 is the \"second\" consecutive day that the account is negative, because Day 2 follows in order after the first negative-balance day. The Fee Schedule does not refer to \"full business days,\" but \"consecutive calendar days.\" Thus, the Fee Schedule allows MB Financial to assess CDO fees on the \"second consecutive calendar day the account is negative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Pertaining to Boone's second argument, MB Financial correctly points out that the Fee Schedule does not refer to the time of day that the bank determines whether there is an overdraft. Nor does it refer to the date on which an OD fee is deducted from the account. Instead, it solely refers to the account's negative status, the \"second consecutive calendar day the account is negative.\" Therefore, we find the Fee Schedule unambiguous and Boone's claim implausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In Count II, Boone alleges MB Financial has \"breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the contract through its overdraft policies and practices\" (\"discretion-to-pay\"). Specifically, Boone claims that MB Financial \"harms consumers by abusing its contractual discretion in a number of ways which no reasonable consumer would anticipate.\" Illinois law, however, does not recognize an independent cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <em>\n    Voyles v.
