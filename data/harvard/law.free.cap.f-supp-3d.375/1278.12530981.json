ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion seeks to dismiss Defendants' counterclaims because they are permissive - not compulsory - and the Court lacks supplemental jurisdiction to consider them. Alternatively, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' counterclaims should be dismissed because Defendants should not be allowed to clutter this case with a purely state law dispute. Finally, Plaintiffs seek to strike two of Defendants' affirmative defenses because they cannot be used as a set-off in a FLSA case. For these reasons, Plaintiffs request that the Court dismiss Defendants' counterclaims and strike two of Defendants' affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We will address the latter issue first, as it relates to the pending answer, then turn to the counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.\n     <em>\n      Whether Defendants' Affirmative Defenses Should be Stricken\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument - related to the pending answer - is that two of Defendants' affirmative defenses should be stricken. Plaintiffs claim that affirmative defense two is improper because it seeks a set-off for any wage amounts owed to Ms. Nicopior based on \"amounts she unlawfully converted from Defendants by wrongfully voiding transactions and giving restaurant patrons food and beverage that they did not pay for.\" [D.E. 20]. Plaintiffs also contend that affirmative defense six should be stricken because it seeks a set-off for Ms. Nicopior's conversion of property and Mr. Gamboa's possession of that property. Therefore, Plaintiffs concludes that these set-offs must be stricken because - if a set-off results in an employee's wages falling below the required minimum wage rate - they are not allowed in FLSA cases and run afoul of binding Eleventh Circuit precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brennan v.

The Court denied the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the defendant's conversion counterclaim because it was compulsory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The Counterclaim alleges that Plaintiff stole Defendant's property while employed by Defendant. Moreover, Defendant argues in its Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss that Plaintiff was stealing rather than working during the hours that she claims to have been working. Defendant's counterclaim, therefore, requires the Court to evaluate the same evidence that it will evaluate to resolve Plaintiff's FLSA claim. In other words, Defendant's conversion claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of Plaintiff's FLSA claim. Because Defendant's conversion claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of Plaintiff's FLSA claim, the conversion claim is a compulsory counterclaim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Rosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203008827\">\n    2010 WL 3008827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The same reasoning applies to the facts of this case because Plaintiffs' FLSA claim arises from the same transaction or occurrence as Defendants' counterclaims for conversion and unjust enrichment.

Moreover, the resolution of these facts will involve much of the same witnesses and evidence.

The court initially found that the counterclaims were permissive in relation to plaintiff's FLSA claim and that the court lacked jurisdiction. However, the court did not stop its analysis there. The court then determined that - irrespective of whether the counterclaims were compulsory or permissive - the counterclaims were not viable because the defendant did not \"allege that it overpaid Plaintiff,\" meaning \"any reduction of Plaintiff's FLSA damages would violate the\n   <em>\n    Brennan\n   </em>\n   Rule by reducing Plaintiff's compensation below the FLSA statutory minimum.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20666108\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Leite,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204049962\">\n    2012 WL 4049962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The same reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   applies to the facts of this case because any recovery on Defendants' counterclaims - in the absence of an allegation of overpayment or prepayment - would run afoul of\n   <em>\n    Brennan\n   </em>\n   which is \"to assure to the employees of a covered company a minimum level of wages,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brennan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"203920\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/491/1/#p4\">\n    491 F.2d at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and \"would delay and interfere with the process of bringing the employer into compliance with the FLSA's overtime requirements,\"\n   <em>\n    Pioch v.
