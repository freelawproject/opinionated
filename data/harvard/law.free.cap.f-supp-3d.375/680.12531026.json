Gilliland, Jr. Defendants' Motion seeks dismissal of all claims against HHG, dismissal of the fraud claim against Gilliland, and dismissal of the request for specific performance of the collateral demand by Plaintiff Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America (\"Travelers\"). The motion is fully briefed. Having considered the submissions of the parties, the record, and relevant law, the Court determines that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss should be granted in part and\n   denied in part. The Motion will be granted insofar as it seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's fraud claim against Gilliland and will otherwise be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of a series of performance bonds and related indemnity agreements involving Dirtworks, HHG, Gilliland, and Travelers. Dirtworks is a general contractor in the business of construction work. Gilliland is the CEO of Dirtworks and the sole member of HHG, a Mississippi limited liability company. Travelers is a surety company that issues payment and performance bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 5, 2004, Travelers, Dirtworks, and Gilliland executed a General Agreement of Indemnity (\"GAI\"), by which Dirtworks and Gilliland agreed to indemnify Travelers against all anticipated and real losses and expenses incurred in connection with Travelers' issuance of surety bonds related to construction projects undertaken by Dirtworks. An Additional Indemnitor Rider (\"the Rider\"), which purported to add HHG as an indemnitor under the GAI, was signed by Gilliland on behalf of HHG on August 17, 2015. Travelers contends that the Rider was properly executed even though Travelers never signed it. HHG says the absence of Travelers' signature renders the Rider void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 2, 2017, Gilliland contacted Travelers to request financial assistance because Dirtworks had insufficient funds to continue its operations, including the completion of outstanding bonded projects. Dirtworks refused Travelers' demand to review Dirtworks' books, which Travelers required before it would consider advancing additional funds to Dirtworks, and which the GAI provided Dirtworks must do upon Travelers' demand. Travelers has received payment claims totaling at least $ 1,926,972.26 from unpaid subcontractors and suppliers on the various bonded projects headed by Dirtworks. Travelers anticipates that it faces exposure to claims and losses that will total $ 3,397,751.70 and has demanded the same from Defendants as posted collateral under the GAI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   To date, Defendants have failed to satisfy this collateral demand in whole or in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Travelers filed its initial Complaint on November 8, 2017. The operative complaint, and the subject of the instant Motion to Dismiss, is Travelers' [48] Third Amended Complaint. Travelers asserts claims against all defendants for breach of contract,\n   <em>\n    quia timet\n   </em>\n   , and contractual indemnity, and a fraud claim against Gilliland. Travelers seeks specific performance of the GAI's collateral security obligations, damages, and indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 28, 2019, Defendants filed the instant Motion to Dismiss. The Motion argues that HHG should be dismissed as a defendant because (1) the Rider is not signed by Travelers and (2) no valid consideration is alleged to have existed for the execution of the Rider. The Motion also argues that Travelers has failed to state a claim for fraud against Gilliland and that Travelers is not entitled to the specific performance or injunctive relief it seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.

Ex. 1, at 3, ECF No. 1-3.) Because Travelers never signed the Rider, Defendants maintain that HHG was never an indemnitor under the GAI and therefore must be dismissed. Travelers makes several arguments against dismissal of HHG: (1) no signature by Travelers was required because the Rider did not modify Travelers' right or remedies under the GAI, (2) the Rider is valid because Travelers manifested its acceptance by continuing to issue numerous bonds on behalf of Dirtworks since HHG signed the Rider, and (3) HHG is an indemnitor pursuant to the terms of the GAI regardless of the Rider's validity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Travelers' first argument - that its rights and remedies were not modified because the Rider merely allowed Travelers to pursue existing rights and remedies against a new entity - is unpersuasive. Relevant to the present circumstances, Black's Law Dictionary defines a \"right\" as \"[a] legally enforceable claim that another will do or will not do a given act.\"\n   <em>\n    Right\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). \"Remedy\" is defined as \"[t]he means of enforcing a right or preventing or redressing a wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Remedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). The Rider purports to afford Travelers a new right - the right to pursue indemnification and collateralization from HHG. Only the remedy remains the same. The GAI does not provide a narrower definition of rights under the contract, and the Rider's language stating that the Rider \"shall ... not limit [Travelers'] rights and/or remedies under the Agreement\" ( Compl. Ex. 2, at 1, ECF No. 1-4 ) is of no matter here, where the Rider would fashion a new right. Because the Rider would modify Travelers' rights under the GAI, paragraph 16 applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The second argument - that Travelers' signature was not required because Travelers manifested its acceptance of the Rider through its conduct - also fails. When HHG tendered the Rider with its signature to Travelers, HHG made an offer to contract. \"Unless otherwise indicated by the language or the circumstances, an offer invites acceptance in any manner\n   and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Heritage Bldg.

The GAI expressly provides that Travelers' rights under the GAI may not be modified without a written rider signed by Travelers. Travelers did not sign the Rider. The Rider would modify Travelers' rights. Therefore, the Rider is not a valid contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heritage Bldg. Prop.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7342360\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/43/1138/#p1143\">\n    43 So.3d at 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying a contractual provision that said no modification of the contract shall be valid unless it is \"in writing and signed by the party against whom the enforcement ... is sought\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court need not address Defendants' remaining argument concerning the absence of consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nevertheless, Travelers' third argument against dismissal of HHG - to which Defendants do not respond in their rebuttal brief - appears to provide a legal basis for seeking relief against HHG under the GAI. Paragraph 1 of the GAI provides specific definitions of various terms used throughout the agreement. \"Indemnitors\" are defined to include the following legal persons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Undersigned, all new indemnitors added to this Agreement by rider, their present future direct and indirect subsidiaries, affiliates, and parent companies, and all of their successors and assigns, and any joint venture, co-venture, consortium, partnership, trust, association, limited liability company or other legal entity in which one or more of them are involved, whether in existence now or formed or acquired hereafter, and any entity that obtains Bonds from [Travelers] at the request of any of the aforementioned parties, or any combination of the above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ( Compl. Ex. 1, at 1, ECF No. 1-3.) Gilliland does not dispute that he is a signatory to the GAI. This definition of \"indemnitors\" would include any limited liability company or other legal entity in which Gilliland is involved. Gilliland is the sole member of HHG. Pursuant to the GAI's definition of \"indemnitors,\" HHG is a proper party to an action seeking to hold indemnitors to their contractual obligations. Therefore, claims against HHG will not be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Travelers Fails to State a Claim for Fraud Because the Rider is a Legal Nullity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In Defendants' Answer to Travelers' Second Amended Complaint, Defendants asserted that Gilliland had no authority\n   to enter into any agreement on behalf of HHG, including the Rider. Because Gilliland signed the Rider on behalf of HHG, and the language of the Rider expressly affirmed the signer's authority to bind HHG, Travelers maintains that, should the Court find the Rider void for Gilliland's lack of contractual capacity, Gilliland committed fraud. The Court has already determined that the Rider is not an enforceable agreement because Travelers did not sign it. Thus, Travelers cannot establish that any misrepresentation by Gilliland of his capacity to bind HHG was a proximate cause of any injury resulting from the unenforceability of the Rider.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Rider is void for reasons unrelated to any alleged misrepresentation made by Gilliland. Moreover, it appears that Travelers may assert claims against HHG regardless, by virtue of the GAI itself. Travelers cannot, therefore, claim damages resulting from Gilliland's alleged misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Travelers States Actionable Claims for Indemnification and Collateralization Under the GAI\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants argue that Travelers' claim for indemnity fails because Travelers seeks recovery for anticipated losses rather than any losses actually incurred. Defendants also maintain that Travelers' breach of contract claim and\n   <em>\n    quia timet\n   </em>\n   claim are effectively claims for preliminary injunctive relief, which should be rejected because Travelers has not satisfied the high burden necessary to warrant a preliminary injunction. As an initial matter, it is unclear how or why Defendants have construed Travelers' Third Amendment Complaint as seeking a preliminary injunction. Nowhere does Travelers ask for relief before a final decision on the merits. These concerns raised by Defendants are misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In their briefing, Defendants also conflate claims for indemnification with claims for breach of contract and the sought-after specific performance remedy of collateralization. To be clear, Travelers asserts separate claims for breach of contract,\n   <em>\n    quia timet\n   </em>\n   , and indemnification. Different remedies are available for different claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Turning first to the indemnification claim, it is not clear that Defendants contest whether Travelers successfully states such a claim. Travelers must prove (1) that it was legally liable to a third party, (2) that it paid under compulsion, and (3) that the amount it paid was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v. Knostman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11107154\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/783/694/#p698\">\n    783 So.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 698 (Miss. 2001) (citing\n   <em>\n    Keys v. Rehab. Ctrs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7506130\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/574/579/#p584\">\n    574 So.2d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 584 (Miss. 1990) ). Although Travelers appears to demand more in collateralization than it alleges it has actually paid on claims ($ 3,397,751.70 in anticipated losses versus $ 2,098,230.67 paid on claims), this does not undermine Travelers' ability to state a common-law indemnity claim. Travelers alleges that it was legally liable to the subcontractors and suppliers who made claims for unpaid work and materials on Dirtworks' bonded projects, and Travelers alleges that it was compelled to make these payments. Travelers\n   has stated a claim for indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A plaintiff asserting a breach of contract claim has the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, \"1. the existence of a valid and binding contract; and 2. that the defendant has broken, or breached it.\"\n   <em>\n    Bus. Commc'ns, Inc. v. Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7032853\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/90/1221/#p1224\">\n    90 So.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1224-25 (Miss. 2012). Defendants do not dispute that Travelers has successfully alleged the existence of a valid contract - the GAI - and that Defendants breached the GAI. The fact that Travelers seeks specific performance in the form of the collateralization demanded under the GAI does not change the fact that Travelers states a claim for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, turning to Travelers' claim for\n   <em>\n    quia timet\n   </em>\n   , Defendants' argument concerning the lack of recent Mississippi caselaw on the matter does not establish that such a claim is not viable. Indeed, a federal district court in Mississippi granted\n   <em>\n    quia timet\n   </em>\n   relief in 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Renpetco II, LLC v.

But then, in this case, the surety is compellable to deposit the money in court for the payment of the creditor; and it is, in fact, but an indirect subrogation to the rights of the creditor, upon the virtual payment of the debt by such a deposit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1655609\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/31/632/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1655609\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/31/632/#p635\">\n    at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Travelers' allegations satisfy the pleading requirements for\n   <em>\n    quia timet\n   </em>\n   relief. Defendants' concerns analogizing such relief to a preliminary injunction are unavailing.
