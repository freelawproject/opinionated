INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Long Oil Heat, Inc., doing business as Long Energy (\"Long Oil\"), brings this diversity action against Defendants William Spencer (\"William\"), Thomas Spencer (\"Thomas,\" together with William, the \"Spencers\" or the \"Spencer Defendants\"), North East Freightways, Inc. (\"NEF\"), and Phillip J. Palker to recover unpaid balances for fuel oil services Long Oil provided to Land-Air Express of New England, Ltd. (\"LAE\") until May 2016. (Dkt. No. 2). Although the Complaint also named LAE as a defendant, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), LAE stipulated to entry of judgment, (Dkt. No. 50), and partial judgment was entered against it in the amount of $ 204,733.58 on December 7, 2018, (Dkt. No. 51). Plaintiff's claims against the remaining Defendants include claims for: (1) breach of contract against NEF (third cause of action), (Dkt. No. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 29-33, 62); (2) personal guaranty against Palker (fourth cause of action), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-36, 62); (3) account stated against NEF and Palker (fifth cause of action), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38, 62); (4) improper dissolution against William and Thomas Spencer (sixth cause of action), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-43, 62);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (5) fraudulent conveyance against all Defendants (seventh cause of action), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-51, 62); and (6) unjust enrichment against NEF and Palker (eighth cause of action), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-62).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff has moved for summary judgment on all its claims against the remaining Defendants, (Dkt. No. 64); the motion is opposed by Defendant NEF,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 73), and the Spencer Defendants, (Dkt. No. 75-1). Defendants NEF and Palker have cross-moved for summary judgment against Plaintiff on all claims, (Dkt. No. 67); Plaintiff opposes the cross-motion, (Dkt. No. 70). For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's motion is granted in part and denied in part, and Defendants NEF and Palker's cross-motion is denied in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. LAE's Business and Commercial Relationship with Long Oil\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff Long Oil is a New York corporation based in Albany County, New York, that provides fuel oil and other petroleum products to residential and commercial customers. (Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6 1; Dkt. No. 67-3, \u00b6 12). From 2012 to 2016, Long Oil provided LAE, a transportation company, with fuel for its trucks at LAE's Capital Region facility in Colonie, New York. (Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6 2; Dkt. No. 67-3, \u00b6 13). The fuel was stored until needed in a 3000-gallon fuel oil tank owned by Long Oil and maintained by it under a permit from the Town of Colonie. (Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   LAE is a Vermont corporation headquartered in Williston, Vermont, and founded in 1990 by Defendant William Spencer and his father. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4; Dkt. No. 67-3, \u00b6 7; Dkt. No. 64-8, at 18). It operated as a regional transportation company in the \"less than truckload\" (\"LTL\") sector in New England, New York, and New Jersey. (Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6 5; Dkt. No. 67-3, \u00b6 7). The LTL sector covers shipments for more than 100 pounds but less than a trailer load, (Dkt. No. 64-8), and generally involves business-to-business transactions and some residential transportation, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6 5). LAE's real estate subsidiary, Land Air Terminals, Inc., owned four of the 13 facilities from which LAE operated-in Williston, Vermont; Windsor, Vermont; Londonderry, New Hampshire; and Pittsfield, Maine. (Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 40). Defendant Thomas Spencer, William's younger brother, joined LAE in 1993. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). Initially, William's father owned 100% of LAE, but he eventually transferred his ownership interest to his sons, granting each of them a 50% stake. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. No. 67-3, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10). William became LAE's president, and Thomas held various positions in operations and sales. (Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. LAE's Financial Difficulties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the end of 2015, LAE was in a \"[h]ighly leveraged\" financial situation, having borrowed to acquire a variety of assets. (Dkt. No. 64-8, at 20). After a \"thorough audit,\" the Federal Motor Carrier\n   Safety Administration (\"FMCSA\") revoked LAE's operating authority between December 28, 2015 and January 8, 2016. (Dkt. No. 64-8, at 21; Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6 8; Dkt. No. 67-3, \u00b6 24). The shutdown caught LAE \"off guard,\" (Dkt. No. 64-8, at 21), and caused the company further financial difficulty. (Dkt. No. 67-3, \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   William started looking for financial assistance within the industry. (Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6 8). He received a call from his friend Defendant Philip Palker, the founder of Defendant NEF, a New Hampshire company\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   involved in a different segment of the transportation industry in New England and surrounding regions-namely the \"full truckload quantity business\" (i.e., loads heavier than LTL) and \"dedicated logistics\" (i.e., \"providing a fleet of trucks for a customer ... [who] can then dictate what the logistics are with them\") in primarily business-to-business transactions. (Dkt. No. 64-8, at 22-24; Dkt. No. 64-16, at 12; Dkt. No. 67-4). In a January 8, 2016 email to Palker, William explained that his plan was to \"[c]lose out NJ operation to return to our routes in NE/NY,\" \"[p]roduce about 50M [in] revenue,\" and \"[f]ile for protection and move on with our business.\" (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 1). He added that he needed \"help to get over the days ... lost\" and was \"[w]illing to give equity of course.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After sending that email, William continued to have conversations with Palker and other possible investors about \"what any of them would be willing to do to help,\" and he sent Palker financial information on LAE. (Dkt. No. 64-8, at 27-28). In particular, William was looking for a loan to cover payroll. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33). On approximately January 13, 2016, William met with Palker and Dick Anagnost, NEF's co-owner,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   at Anagnost's Manchester office. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-8, at 33-34; Dkt. No. 64-16, at 21-22; Dkt. No. 64-13, at 29-31). William asked for a loan to cover payroll. (Dkt. No. 64-8, at 33). Anagnost further testified that William asked him to consider an investment in LAE. (Dkt. No. 64-13, at 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The meeting resulted in a January 13, 2016 agreement among Anagnost Investments, Inc., William, Thomas, and LAE, whereby Anagnost Investments agreed to provide LAE a $ 551,657.81 payroll loan secured by commercial mortgages on Land Air Terminals' four real properties and personally guaranteed by William and Thomas. (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 2-3; Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6 12; Dkt. No. 67-3, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30). Additionally, the agreement provided that William and Thomas would \"pledge all of their stock interest in Land-Air as collateral for the performance of the personal guaranties\" and \"convey sixty percent (60%) of their interest in Land-Air to Anagnost [Investments].\" (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 2). The parties agreed to \"restructure Land-Air such that the board of directors shall be comprised of five (5) individuals,\" with three individuals appointed by Anagnost Investments and two individuals appointed by William and Thomas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, \"Dick Anagnost ... shall be, and hereby is, appointed Treasurer of Land-Air and shall have sole and exclusive control over the financial affairs of the corporation with singular authority to execute checks and control all bank account[s] of the corporation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He could \"only be removed by a unanimous vote of the board of directors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to William,\n   however, no stock was ever conveyed to Anagnost Investments, LAE's board of directors was not restructured, Anagnost Investments did not exercise its option to purchase LAE's stock, and Anagnost never became treasurer of LAE. (Dkt. No. 64-8, at 35-36; Dkt. No. 67-2, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Communications with Vendors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the January 13 agreement, Palker and Anagnost's staff began communicating with LAE's lenders, vendors, customers; they also had extensive communications with LAE's comptroller, Melissa Adams, and other employees. (Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6 14). In his communications with vendors, Palker distinguished between accounts payable that became due before NEF's involvement and those that arose after. (Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6 15). Using LAE letterhead and signing as its representative, Palker sent letters to vendors stating that, on January 13, 2016, LAE had \"entered into an agreement with investors to strategically realign its regional operations\" and that \"[p]art of the agreement is that all existing vendors must establish a new vendor account with a net 30 day repayment term.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 64-7, at 7). Palker further represented that \"[a]ll invoices due and payable prior to January 13, 2016 will be reviewed and scheduled for repayment after a 120 day grace period from the date of this letter\" and that \"[p]ayment terms will be 5 years with a 3.0% interest rate starting 01 May 2016.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In communications with fuel vendors, Palker characterized the financial backing of LAE as an investment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-17, at 30, 55-58; Dkt. No. 64-7, at 22 (January 19, 2016 email from Palker to fuel vendor F.L. Roberts mentioning Anagnost Investments as an \"investor\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43 (January 26, 2016 email from Palker to fuel provider Goetz Energy, referring to \"the acquisition of 60% of [LAE's] stock by North East Freightways along with its investment team, Anagnost Investment[s]\") ). Similarly, an undated press release on joint LAE and NEF letterhead states that LAE's \"recent alignment with ... [NEF] and their associated financial investors provided a strong fiscal infusion that allowed Vermont based Land Air Express to regain its dominant share of the Northeast LTL markers.\" (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 33;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-17, at 28-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Palker testified that, at the time that these statements were made, he knew that NEF had not acquired 60% of LAE's stock. (Dkt. No. 64-17, at 55). But, according to his testimony, he still believed as of late March 2016 that a stock purchase arrangement was a possibility, and that the decision to proceed with an asset purchase agreement was made \"[s]ometime in April.\" (Dkt. No. 64-18, at 10). William testified that an asset purchase, instead of a stock purchase, was \"discussed from the beginning\" as a possibility, \"but [it was] not the first choice of route,\" and the decision to shift to an asset purchase was communicated to him by Palker or Anagnost in March. (Dkt. No. 64-10, at 24-25). At his deposition, however, Anagnost distinguished between loans and investments and stated that he \"[n]ever\" considered making an investment in LAE after the January 13 agreement. (Dkt. No. 64-13, at 36). Both Palker and Anagnost acknowledged that ultimately no investment was made in LAE. (Dkt. No. 64-15, at 51; Dkt. No. 64-16, at 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Palker informed William and Melissa Adams on January 25, 2016 that, starting that day, LAE \"will start using NEF accounts for road calls, oils, lubes and fluids for the interim as we rebuild relationships\" with vendors. (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 23). Vendor invoices sent to NEF would be emailed to LAE so that LAE could cut checks to the vendor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Palker explained\n   that this setup was necessary because vendors were \"cutting off Land Air Express\" and would only supply equipment or services to LAE if NEF was billed. (Dkt. No. 64-17, at 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-9, at 11-12, 26-27). The record contains a number of vendor invoices billed to NEF for orders made by LAE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-7, at 9-13). William Spencer testified that, from time to time, LAE received and paid for goods and services from NEF as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 24-25; Dkt. No. 64-9, at 27-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On February 4, 2016, Joseph Bosley, a senior accountant at LAE who was administering payroll, emailed William that Palker \"has been making promises to pay on some of these vendors which our cash flow will not be able to sustain and may cause larger issues in the near future,\" adding, \"I think we may need to discuss our script and plan of attack on some of these accounts.\" (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-9, at 66). Palker responded, \"Which specific customer are you referring to? I'm sure I have sound reasons for each one.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20). Bosley replied, \"I do not deny that, I just know we will not have the cash to make the payment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At his deposition, William stated that Long Oil was on a \"very long list\" of vendors to which he, Palker, and \"a lot of people\" at LAE made payment promises that \"cash flow would not support.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 64-9, at 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Palker testified that Melissa Adams sent him a schedule of accounts payable in early February 2016. Asked why LAE employees provided him that information, Palker said that \"they were trying to keep the company alive through the due diligence period,\" and he \"needed to find out if we were going to-if Land Air was going to go out of business.\" (Dkt. No. 64-16, at 47). Discussing what he meant in the previously described press release by a \"recent alignment\" between LAE and NEF, (Dkt. No. 64-7), Palker explained that \"we were trying to keep the company afloat until we could figure out if the company was able to float on its own, and we wanted to make sure that we maintained a solid customer base.\" (Dkt. No. 64-17, at 29). He was \"[t]rying to make it colorful so people\"-not only customers but also vendors-\"would stay on board with us.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Palker's Operational Role at LAE in Early 2016\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Several email chains in early 2016 show that Palker was involved in LAE operations. In a January 14, 2016 email, Palker told a LAE employee that \"[p]rior to ordering maintenance parts at ALL locations please put an email request through me.\" (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 18). About this email, Palker testified: \"I didn't tell him yes or no to order them. We just needed to understand where money was being spent so we could keep the company afloat.... [I]f Bill objected, we would have time to tell him not to order it.\" (Dkt. No. 64-16, at 57). The following day, Palker wrote an email to Melissa Adams, copying his accountant\n   Edward Baroody, William, and Anagnost, directing her to pay certain accounts. (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 14). According to his testimony, Palker was not authorized to direct Melissa Adams regarding which bills to pay, and he was only \"assisting Bill Spencer, as his friend, from time to time.\" (Dkt. No. 64-16, at 54). On January 26, 2016, after Melissa Adams asked whether she could pay pension and health insurance contributions, Palker instructed her to \"[p]ay fidelity and Let's [sic] hold off on these other payments.\" (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 15-17). At his deposition, Palker characterized these instructions as his \"recommendation\" as a friend of William. (Dkt. No. 64-16, at 55-56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Anagnost testified that Palker, when \"dealing with Land Air Express,\" was acting on behalf of NEF only in \"some capacities.\" (Dkt. No. 64-14, at 35). And when not acting on behalf of NEF, Palker was acting in \"[h]is own [capacity] in helping out his friend Bill Spencer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36). Anagnost further elaborated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q: It's your testimony that to the extent it wasn't something that you directed him to do, anything that Mr. Palker did, he was doing in his individual capacity?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A: Absolutely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q: Even if he was utilizing Northeast Freightways' resources, computers, and so forth and so on to do that, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A: Yes, correct. He acted in a consulting capacity or a friendship capacity or whatever he was up there doing, but he wasn't conducting Freightways' business when he was there a good portion of the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36). According to Palker's testimony, neither Anagnost nor William ever told him to stop using his NEF email when communicating to third parties about LAE matters. (Dkt. No. 64-17, at 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   An employee handbook last updated on April 30, 2016 bears the logos of LAE and NEF and lists William and Palker as co-presidents of \"North East Freightways/Land Air Express.\" (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 47-49). Palker testified that he created the document and \"suspect[ed] this was put on the cover of the handbooks\" but did not know when. (Dkt. No. 64-18, at 14). Similarly, an undated employment application bears both companies' logos and provides a joint address for \"North East Freightways, Inc. &amp; Land Air Express.\" (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 50). Palker stated that this form was used but did not know when. (Dkt. No. 64-18, at 14-15). Another document relating to the \"Health &amp; Safety Program\" of \"North East Freightways/Land Air Express\" bears the two companies' logos; Palker is mentioned as \"President North East Freightways/Land Air Express, Inc.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-53). William testified that \"all of these documents were conjured up about the same time\" and were \"probably\" timed to go into effect upon consummation of the asset purchase, but he found no records indicating that the above documents were ever actually used. (Dkt. No. 64-10, at 20-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Representations to Long Oil\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In his affidavit, Long Oil's president, Robert Long, Sr., asserts that he learned of LAE's shutdown \"at the very beginning of January\" 2016, and William called in mid-January to tell Long that \"a friend, Phillip Palker, and his company, [NEF], was going to be investing in Land Air Express.\" (Dkt. No. 64-1, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9). According\n   to Long, William assured him that Long Oil \"would get paid for not only current deliveries, but also the past due, if [Long Oil] would just 'hang in there' and continue to provide them with their fuel needs for the Colonie terminal on an open account basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Long was \"skeptical\" and asked to speak to Palker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). Palker contacted Long and \"described [NEF] as an 'investor' in Land Air Express, indicated that they either had or were in the process of buying 60% of the stock of Land Air Express along with their banker, Anagnost Investment Company and had already made a 'fiscal infusion.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Additionally, Long states that he \"received a letter from Mr. Palker concerning setting up a new account number for current deliveries with a promise of preferential repayment treatment on the past due balance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At his deposition, Palker described his conversation with Long as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   There were conversations about two different debts. One of the debts being an old debt of Land Air Express of New England, and the other one about what Long Oil could do for Land Air Express moving forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   So these conversations were, one, to try to get an understanding of what Land Air Express of New England's capability would be to purchase fuel moving forward, and the other one was a conversation that we would have to have at some point regarding the past dues, because Bob [Long] wanted to make sure that those old past dues were a part of moving forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (Dkt. No. 64-17, at 35-36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Long asserts that, when he spoke to Palker in mid-January 2016, he \"pressed [Palker] for payment on past due balance under account # 8077 and indicated initially that [he] would only provide current deliveries on a [cash-on-delivery] basis given the past due situation.\" (Dkt. No. 64-1, \u00b6 12). According to Long,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Palker then indicated that North East Freightways also operated in [Long Oil's] region and he could promise more business, not only in the form of continued purchases by Land Air Express as it moved forward under new ownership, but also from North East Freightways. Further, he stated that we could rely on North East Freightways to insure Land Air's past due balance would be paid and he would sign a personal guarantee for the new purchases. He told me that bills should be sent to Anagnost's office for processing and that payments for such new purchases would be maintained on a \"current\" basis. This made me feel there was now real financial strength behind Land Air.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   By the end of 2015, LAE owed Long Oil $ 147,000 under the existing account (# 8077). (Dkt. No. 67-3, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15). Long asserts that, based on Palker's representations, Long Oil opened a second account (# 101788) for sales of fuel to LAE after January 13, 2016. (Dkt. No. 64-1, \u00b6 14). On January 22, 2016, Palker applied to Long Oil for credit; he signed the credit application form on behalf of LAE and listed Anagnost as the company's owner. (Dkt. No. 64-17, at 41-44; Dkt. No. 64-7, at 136-37). Above Palker's signature, a statement read, \"In signing this document, I personally guarantee payment on the above account.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 137). Long Oil then received a payment on the past due account and a payment for a current delivery. (Dkt. No. 64-1, \u00b6 15; Dkt. No. 64-7, at 34-37; Dkt. No. 64-17, at 39-40; Dkt. No. 64-9, at 45-47). Long asserts that Long Oil \"continued to deliver fuel oil on credit through May 13, 2016\" but \"received no further payments.\" (Dkt. No. 64-1, \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Palker testified that he told Long about his intention that LAE continue to purchase fuel from Long Oil. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45). Nevertheless, he acknowledged that he \"was setting up backups for everywhere\" and authorized Steve Valle, LAE's Albany terminal manager, to apply to the Town of Colonie to replace Long Oil's fuel tank with one provided by Dennis K. Burke. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-49; Dkt. No. 64-7, at 120-33). Palker conceded that he was \"going through the permitting process to replace [Long] with Mr. Burke\" even while \"obtaining fuel on credit from Mr. Long.\" (Dkt. No. 64-17, at 50-51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Transfer of LAE's Personal Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As William testified, Palker or Anagnost informed him at the end of March 2016 that NEF was considering acquiring assets of LAE in exchange for assuming its secured debt. (Dkt. No. 64-10, at 25; Dkt. No. 67-3, at 6). As described by William, through this transaction, LAE would \"lose all the assets for the value of the debt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 64-10, at 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   LAE and NEF entered into an asset purchase agreement that is dated April 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 54). It provided for the transfer to NEF of LAE's equipment, intellectual property, customer list, accounts receivable, cash, telephone numbers, and books and records related to operations; but it excluded certain assets, such as LAE's contract rights, tax records and refunds, and insurance policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-7, at 56). In connection with the asset transfer, NEF \"assume[d] and agree[d] to pay, perform and discharge all\" of the encumbrances (defined as the \"mortgages, pledges, liens, claims, security interests, conditional sales agreements, leases or other encumbrances or changes of any kind, nature or description\") on the assets listed in a schedule attached to the agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-57;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 67-12, at 2-4). NEF, however, did not assume any other liabilities, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 57), and William understood that NEF did not assume trade debt, (Dkt. No. 64-10, at 31). Additionally, one of the terms of the agreement was that William would be given \"[a]n offer of employment ... on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to [NEF] and Mr. Spencer.\" (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 63). William and Thomas signed one-year consulting agreements with LAX, LLC-a company formed to operate the business\n   formerly carried on by LAE after the asset purchase-providing each of them with compensation of $ 218,400 per year; that consulting arrangement has continued past the one-year term. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-7, at 69-74; Dkt. No. 64-10, at 33-35; Dkt. No. 64-18, at 11, 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   William personally guaranteed some or all the secured debt assumed by NEF, and he testified that his \"personal guarantees would remain\" after the transaction. (Dkt. No. 64-10, at 32, 35-36). He conceded, nevertheless, that payment on those debts would reduce his exposure under the personal guaranties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-9, at 33-34). At his deposition, Anagnost agreed that a reduction of the loan balance would reduce William's exposure on the personal guaranties, but he noted that he \"required [the personal guaranties] to stay in place\" and that \"there would be no release of any personal guarantees as a result of the assignment or assumption.\" (Dkt. No. 64-14, at 26-27). Palker testified that, since May 2016, LAX or NEF had been paying down debt principal at a level of about $ 200,000 per month. (Dkt. No. 64-18, at 47-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   According to his affidavit, Long learned that \"the May 2016 transaction between Land Air and [NEF] was not a stock sale\" but an asset sale \"after it was complete and the new operation was ready to switch vendors.\" (Dkt. No. 64-1, \u00b6 18). He only obtained that information when he \"pressed Mr. Palker for further payments\" on the outstanding accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Transfer of LAE's Real Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Anagnost Investments' January 13, 2016 loan of approximately $ 550,000 to LAE to cover payroll was memorialized in a promissory note, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-7, at 78-79), and secured by commercial mortgages on Land Air Terminals' four real properties, (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 94-117).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the Spencers' representations, Anagnost believed that the mortgages granted were second in priority to secured bank lenders. (Dkt. No. 64-14, at 9-10). At the time, Anagnost was not aware of a mortgage purportedly granted to MidCap Business Credit LLC (\"MidCap\"), the primary working-capital lender for LAE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 64-13, at 47; Dkt. No. 64-14, at 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At his deposition, Anagnost was presented with a chart listing the four facilities previously owned by Land Air Terminals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-15, at 1-3; Dkt. No. 64-7, at 46). Anagnost testified that, based on representations made by the Spencers\n   during due diligence, he believed that there was equity in the four properties. (Dkt. No. 64-15, at 2-3). He did not recall how much equity there was, but he acknowledged that, excluding the MidCap loan and based on the difference between the fair market value and the loan balances on the four properties listed in the chart, the combined equity value was approximately $ 1.1 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). Asked whether that figure corresponded with \"what [he] believed based on the representations the Spencers made to [him],\" Anagnost responded that it was \"a reasonable assumption.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Anagnost testified that he acquired \"all of the mortgage debt on [LAE's] real estate\" assets in April 2016, a few weeks before the asset purchase agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20). He estimated paying \"in excess of $ 6 million\" to acquire the debt owed to the two first mortgage holders-BDC of New England and Merchants Bank-and MidCap, including interest, fees, and penalties, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21), although he then clarified that he paid about $ 5.6 million in cash to BDC of New England and MidCap and assumed the $ 400,000 Merchants Bank loan, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-24). At the time, the first mortgage holders' loans were in default, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20), and LAE had failed to make monthly payments on Anagnost Investments' payroll loan. (Dkt. No. 64-13, at 34-35; Dkt. No. 64-15, at 6-8). As part of the acquisition, Anagnost testified that all the mortgages, including the Anagnost Investment mortgages, were assigned to his separate company Santorini Real Estate Holdings, LLC (\"Santorini\"). (Dkt. No. 64-13, at 14; Dkt. No. 64-15, at 22). However, according to title searches conducted by Plaintiff's counsel in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, there is no record of an assignment of Anagnost mortgages to Santorini. (Dkt. No. 69, at 3-4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 69-1 to -3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Having acquired the real estate debt, Anagnost \"explained to [William] that there were two choices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41). \"He could go through foreclosure, because we had accelerated the debt as BDC had already accelerated, or we could enter into a deed in lieu of foreclosure and avoid all of that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Land Air Terminals ultimately opted for warranty deeds in lieu of foreclosure transferring the Londonderry property and the Williston property to Santorini.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 64-7, at 118-19; Dkt. No. 69-1, at 35-39; Dkt. No. 69-2, at 80-81). Asked whether this process was used for the other properties, Anagnost assumed that if his attorney \"did it for one he did it for all.\" (Dkt. No. 64-15, at 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Current Operation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The new entity, LAX, is owned by Anagnost, Palker and his wife, and their accountant Baroody. (Dkt. No. 64-18, at 38). Palker is the president of LAX (doing business as Land Air Express) and manages the business with William and Thomas, who serve as consultants overseeing operations and administration, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42). According to Palker's testimony, LAX operates in the same locations as LAE did in May 2016 (except that its Syracuse facility moved to a different location in that city), and it continues to use the same corporate phone number and customer list. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-45). The trailers and power equipment transferred to NEF were not retitled. (Dkt. No. 64-10, at 36; Dkt. No. 64-18, at 29-31). At their deposition, neither William nor Palker knew whether LAX or NEF had filed for authority to do business in New York. (\n   Dkt. No. 64-10, at 38; Dkt. No. 64-18, at 37). Long asserts that, \"based on [his] personal observation in the Capital Region, the business is still being operated as Land Air Express\n   <em>\n    of New England\n   </em>\n   and utilizing the same goodwill which was engendered prior to the asset sale of May 2016.\" (Dkt.

(Dkt. No. 64-20, \u00b6 33). This amount includes a $ 32,823.81 balance owed on account # 101788, payment of which Palker agreed to personally guarantee. (Dkt. No. 67-3, \u00b6 39; Dkt.

This evidence, however, does not incontrovertibly establish that the statement was delivered to Defendant NEF and Defendant Palker, that they accepted it as correct, and that they promised to pay the amount stated. At his deposition, Palker was not aware that LAE had conceded the balance due on account # 101788, did not \"know if it's inaccurate,\" and did not \"know who did the reconciliation for this.\" (Dkt.

This testimony indicates that the facts necessary to establish the elements of the accounts-stated claim are disputed.

No. 64-19, at 15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Plaintiff asserts that directors of LAE owed a fiduciary duty to its creditors concerning \"the manner in which the entity ceased business operation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Spencer Defendants counter that: first, LAE has not been dissolved; second, even if it had, payment of creditor claims followed the statutory order of priority, so LAE's directors cannot be personally liable; third, \"the creditors did receive notice of the transactions between LAE and NEF\"; and fourth, there is no evidence that the Spencers \"received any economic value from the sale of assets.\" (Dkt.

Generally, any alleged breach of a fiduciary duty by a director or officer is a question for the trier of fact. 3 Fletcher Cyc. Corp. \u00a7 837.50 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698773\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/188/245/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1030. And here, the parties dispute the factual predicates of the alleged breach. Plaintiff asserts that the Spencers acted in their own personal interest to maintain their managing roles in the business (albeit as consultants) and reduce their exposure on their personal guaranties to secured creditors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-7, at 63, 69-74 (asset purchase agreement and consulting agreements providing that the Spencers would be retained as consultants and compensated at $ 218,400 per year); Dkt. No. 64-9, at 33-34 (Anagnost acknowledging that payment on the secured debts assumed by NEF would reduce the Spencers' exposure under the personal guaranties); Dkt. No. 64-18, at 47-48 (Palker testifying that the secured debt balances were being reduced at a pace of about $ 200,000 per month) ). The Spencer Defendants, on the other hand, claim that they entered into the asset sale transaction to save William's \"life's work\" and prevent the \"unemployment of all the people\" who had worked for them. (Dkt. No. 64-10, at 25-26). Thus, even assuming that the May 2016 asset sale rendered LAE insolvent, there are triable issues of fact whether the Spencers breached any fiduciary duty owed to Plaintiff.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In its opposition to Defendants NEF and Palker's motion, Plaintiff cites record evidence for some of the badges of fraud. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 70, at 10-11). According to Palker's and Anagnost's deposition testimony, LAE President William was a friend of NEF President Palker, which indicates a close relationship between the parties to the conveyance. (Dkt. No. 64-16, at 54-56;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-14, at 35-36). Additionally, there is evidence that, before the asset sale, William and some of LAE's employees knew that LAE's cash flow would not suffice to pay vendors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-7, at 20-21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-9, at 17-18). Deposition testimony and the terms of the asset purchase agreement also tend to show that the asset sale deprived LAE of any significant assets to run a business or pay its trade debts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-7, at 56; Dkt. No. 64-10, at 27; Dkt. No. 64-15, at 30; Dkt. No. 64-18, at 22-24). The evidence further suggests that Palker, purportedly as a representative of LAE, made representations to vendors (including Long Oil) mentioning an investment by NEF in LAE and encouraging them to extend credit during the transition period before the asset sale, even though Palker apparently knew that NEF had not made an equity investment in LAE. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-1, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13; Dkt. No. 64-7, at 7, 22, 33, 43; Dkt. No. 64-17, at 28-30, 55-58). Notably, Long asserts that he was told about the asset sale only after it was complete, when he pressed Palker for payment on the outstanding accounts. (Dkt. No. 64-1, \u00b6 18). Defendants NEF and Palker, on the other hand, have mustered contrary evidence that the asset sale was a legitimate business transaction that enabled LAE's underlying business to survive and save jobs. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 64-10, at 25-26). Given these issues of material fact about Defendants' alleged intent to defraud Plaintiff, both summary judgment motions are denied as to the DCL \u00a7 276 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Under DCL \u00a7 273, \"[e]very conveyance made and every obligation incurred by a person who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent is fraudulent as to creditors without regard to his actual intent if the conveyance is made or the obligation is incurred without a fair consideration.\" Under DCL \u00a7 275, \"[e]very conveyance made and every obligation incurred without fair consideration when the person making the conveyance or entering into the obligation intends or believes that he will incur debts beyond his ability to pay as they mature, is fraudulent as to both present and future creditors.\" According to the statutory definition, a \"person is insolvent when the present fair salable value of [its] assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay his probable liability on his existing debts as they become absolute and matured.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Debt.%20%26%20Cred.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    N.Y.

The Second Circuit, however, has provided additional guideposts for special situations, like the one here, involving preferred-creditor transferees. A crucial principle in these situations is that \"a mere preference between creditors does not constitute bad faith\" because, while fraudulent conveyance law aims to ensure that \"the debtor uses his limited assets to satisfy\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of his creditors,\" \"it normally does not try to choose among them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9013936,9019452\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/43/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9013936,9019452\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/43/\">\n    at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

Further, it would not be beyond the ken of a jury to find that LAE's \"tax returns, tax records, rights to tax refunds\" and \"insurance policies,\" (Dkt.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 64-19, at 22-24). As an initial matter, the Court notes that successor liability does not constitute an independent cause of action but is merely a theory of recovery on an underlying liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Syracuse v.

Plaintiff and Defendant NEF both agree that New York law applies, (Dkt. No. 64-19, at 12; Dkt.

As discussed above, the stock purchase agreement raises factual questions about NEF's status as a shareholder of LAE prior to the asset sale.

Unjust Enrichment Claim (Eighth Cause of Action)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiff asserts as its eighth and last cause of action a claim for unjust enrichment against Defendants NEF and Palker. (Dkt. No. 2, at 15-17).\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both sides assume that New York law applies, a premise the Court again adopts. (\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.D). In its motion, Plaintiff describes the underlying allegations as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   [B]y [NEF] arranging with Long Oil to have continual credit advanced for the benefit of Land Air and fuel oil continually provided to Land Air during the period January through May 2016, [NEF] received the benefit of having Land Air continue to be an ongoing entity with goodwill. Therefore, when Land Air transferred intangible assets to [NEF] for no consideration, and [NEF], and its owner Phillip Palker, were able to operate an ongoing business because of the maintenance of\n   goodwill[,] [NEF] was unjustly enriched when the fuel oil bill due to Long Oil was not paid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   (Dkt.

Whatever the merit of that defense, it is unavailing since successor liability cannot be decided on the present record.
