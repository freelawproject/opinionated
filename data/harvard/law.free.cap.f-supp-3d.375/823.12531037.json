(collectively, \"Take-Two\") alleging: 1.) Direct Copyright Infringement in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) and 501 ; 2.) Indirect Copyright Infringement; 3.) Unjust Enrichment/Restitution; and 4.) Violation of the Visual Artists Rights Act (\"VARA\"). (ECF Doc. # 1). On March 14, 2018, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), and with the consent of Take-Two, Hayden filed his First Amended Complaint which included an additional claim for Declaratory Judgment of Fraud on the Copyright Office pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (ECF Doc. # 3).

Shortly thereafter, Hayden filed his Second Amended Complaint in which he dropped his claim under VARA. (ECF Doc. # 11). Three weeks later, Take-Two filed the present Motion to Dismiss Hayden's Unjust Enrichment and Declaratory Judgment claims as well as Hayden's request for statutory damages or attorney's fees on his Copyright claims. (ECF Doc. # 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. BACKGROUND FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   James Hayden is a successful artist and lifelong resident of Northeastern Ohio. Hayden's artistic creations include original tattoos for some of the most recognized basketball players in the world. Among Hayden's clients are National Basketball Association (\"NBA\") players LeBron James, Shaquille O'Neal, Kyrie Irving, Danny Green, Dion Waiters, Mo Williams and Tristan Thompson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Take-Two is a worldwide developer, publisher and marketer of interactive entertainment and video games. Take-Two's video games include the popular basketball simulation series\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K\n   </em>\n   series is released annually and depicts players from the NBA, some of whom are Hayden's clients, in its interactive simulations. On September 29, 2015, Take-Two released\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K16\n   </em>\n   . On September 20, 2016, Take-Two released\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K17\n   </em>\n   .

Hayden alleges that he obtained copyright registrations for six tattoos inked on Danny Green, LeBron James and Tristan Thompson (the \"Registered Tattoos\"). Hayden's Registered Tattoos with the U.S. Copyright Office have the following dates of registration and publication:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 \"Gloria\" (Reg.

Hayden also alleges that he inked a variety of other tattoos on the above-referenced NBA players that are featured in the\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K\n   </em>\n   series that he has not obtained registrations for from the U.S. Copyright Office (collectively, the \"Unregistered Tattoos\").

Both requirements must be met in order for Hayden's Unjust Enrichment claim to be preempted by the Copyright Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Subject Matter Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Hayden argues that it would be premature to decide at this stage whether the tattoos at issue in this lawsuit fall within the subject matter of copyright as specified in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20102\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103. Hayden, however, admits that he has already obtained copyright registrations for six tattoos. Therefore, with respect to Hayden's Registered Tattoos, there is no question that they fall within the subject matter of copyrightable material.\n   <em>\n    B.R. Knez Constr., Inc. v. Ensinger\n   </em>\n   , No. 07 Civ. 3376,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%2010688321\">\n    2009 WL 10688321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (N.D. Ohio Aug. 19, 2009) (finding subject matter requirement met where plaintiff's works were copyrighted architectural works).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   With respect to his Unregistered Tattoos, Hayden argues that they fall outside of the subject matter requirement for preemption because the issue is factually dependent on the nature of the tattoo. Specifically, Hayden claims that some of his Unregistered Tattoos contain \"typographical ornamentation\" and therefore are expressly uncopyrightable. Ex. B, Excerpt of U.S. Copyright Office, Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices \u00a7 101, 906.4 (3d ed. 2017) (\"As a general rule, typeface, typefont, lettering, calligraphy, and typographic ornamentation are not registrable.\") Thus, according to Hayden, the Copyright Act cannot preempt his Unjust Enrichment claim with respect to his Unregistered Tattoos because such a ruling would bar relief for those tattoos Hayden could not obtain copyrights for. Further, Hayden notes that many cases cited by Take-Two in which courts found preemption of state law claims by the Copyright\n   Act were decided at the summary judgment stage. Hayden claims that it would be premature to decide at the motion to dismiss stage whether his state law claims regarding his Unregistered Tattoos can or should be preempted by the Copyright Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The subject matter of Hayden's Unjust Enrichment claim, however, is the same as his claim under the Copyright Act; namely, tattoos. The Sixth Circuit has noted that the relevant question is not whether a copyright is registered, but rather, whether the work falls within the scope of the subject matter of copyright - a determination that is governed by the Copyright Act, regardless of whether or not the works are ultimately protectable. See\n   <em>\n    Murray Hill Publ'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9484328\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/622/#p636\">\n    264 F.3d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding first prong of preemption analysis satisfied where, although, works were not registered and \"lack[ed] the level of creativity necessary to come within the protection of the [Copyright] Act, each of them is the expression of an idea, which is the essence of the subject matter of the Act\"). The fact that Hayden did not register some of his tattoos and that some of them may not be copyrightable is not alone enough to save his Unjust Enrichment claim. Tattoos are generally within the subject matter of copyrightable works and, in the Copyright Act, Congress clearly intended for federal law to preempt state law claims predicated on copyrightable subject matter. Thus, the Court finds that both Hayden's Registered and Unregistered Tattoos fall within the subject matter requirement of the preemption provision in the Copyright Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Equivalency Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Stromback\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit explained that \"[c]ourts analyze equivalency by applying a 'functional test' to determine whether the state law right at issue is equivalent to any of the exclusive rights under Section 106 of the Copyright Act.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182039\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/283/#p300\">\n    384 F.3d at 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To avoid preemption, a plaintiff's claim must include an \"extra element\" beyond \"the acts of reproduction, performance, distribution or display\" that \"changes the nature of the action so that it is qualitatively different from a copyright claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182039\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/283/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Hayden argues that his Unjust Enrichment claim includes this \"extra element\" required by\n   <em>\n    Stromback\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, Hayden asserts that Take-Two has \"appropriated and exercised proprietorship over HAYDEN's tattoos without acknowledging him in any way for the use of his artwork in their products.\" (ECF Doc. # 12 at \u00b6 194). This, however, is merely a reformulation of the type of claim the Copyright Act was intended to preempt. In other words, Hayden's Unjust Enrichment claim depends on Take-Two's unauthorized use of Hayden's work. This is the essence of Hayden's claim under the Copyright Act. More importantly, it meets the Sixth Circuit's articulation of the equivalency requirement prong in\n   <em>\n    Stromback\n   </em>\n   because Hayden cannot point to any concrete action taken by Take-Two that would constitute an \"extra element.\" Thus, Hayden's Unjust Enrichment claim is functionally equivalent to his claim under the Copyright Act. As such, Hayden's Unjust Enrichment claim is preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Declaratory Judgment Claim - Fraud on the Copyright Office\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In Count IV of his Complaint, Hayden seeks a declaratory judgment that Take-Two's copyrights in\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K16\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K17\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K18\n   </em>\n   are invalid due to Fraud on the Copyright Office. In its Motion, Take-Two argues that Count IV should be dismissed for failing to allege an actual case or controversy as required by the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and Article III of the U.S. Constitution. Thus, the question before the Court is whether it has jurisdiction over Hayden's Declaratory Judgment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Declaratory Judgment Act provides, in part: \"In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction... any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

In fashioning such a rule, the Supreme Court rejected the Federal Circuit's prior, more strict, \"reasonable apprehension of imminent suit\" test for declaratory judgment standing as inconsistent with the Court's prior decisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 132 fn. 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   , a reasonable apprehension of suit can still serve as a basis for a valid Article III controversy, but it is only \"one of multiple ways that a declaratory judgment plaintiff can satisfy the more general 'all-the-circumstances' test to establish that an action presents a justiciable Article III controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Prasco, LLC v.

Rather, Hayden argues that he is the author of original works but that Take-Two has instead fraudulently held itself out as author and owner of those works. Hayden further alleges that Take-Two has benefitted from doing so and that Hayden has been injured because of Take-Two's conduct. Thus, according to Hayden, there is a substantial controversy between the parties having adverse legal interests of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment under the\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Hayden, however, has failed to demonstrate to the Court that there is an actual \"case or controversy\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) regarding the ownership of the Registered Tattoos and Unregistered Tattoos.

Further, Hayden has not alleged that Take-Two has in any way threatened Hayden with a lawsuit for\n   infringement or challenged his ownership of the Registered Tattoos or Unregistered Tattoos. Thus, there is no dispute regarding the ownership interest of the tattoos at issue in this lawsuit. Hayden's claim for Declaratory Judgment is accordingly dismissed due to the absence of an actual \"case or controversy\" as required by statute and Article III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Statutory Damages and Attorney's Fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Take-Two argues that Hayden's request for statutory damages and attorney's fees should be dismissed because Take-Two's alleged infringement began before the Registered Tattoos were registered with the Copyright Office. The Copyright Act forecloses the \"award of statutory damages or of attorney's fees\" for \"any infringement of copyright commenced after first published of the work and before the effective date of its registration, unless such registration is made within three months after the first publication of the work.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20412\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In his brief, Hayden acknowledges that he cannot obtain statutory damages or attorney's fees with respect to his Unregistered Tattoos or for Take-Two's alleged misuse of his Registered Tattoos in\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K16\n   </em>\n   . The issue before the Court is whether Hayden can seek statutory damages and attorney's fees for Take-Two's use of his Registered Tattoos in\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K17\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K18\n   </em>\n   ; in other words, whether the infringement of Hayden's Registered Tattoos in\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K17\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K18\n   </em>\n   \"commenced\" before the effective date of registration. This factual dispute turns on whether the\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K\n   </em>\n   series is viewed holistically or whether each annual release is to be considered a separate and distinct act of copyright infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court finds that, with respect to Hayden's Registered Tattoos depicted in\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K17\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    2K18\n   </em>\n   , further discovery is required to determine whether the\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K\n   </em>\n   games constitute a \"series of acts constituting infringement,\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

If the\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K\n   </em>\n   series constitutes a series of acts that are essentially the same infringement, relief in the form of statutory damages and attorney's fees would be foreclosed to Hayden. If, however, each annual release of\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K\n   </em>\n   constitutes a separate and distinct act of infringement, Hayden would be able to obtain statutory damages and attorney's fees for versions of\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K\n   </em>\n   released after Hayden registered his tattoos with the Copyright Office, specifically for\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K17\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K18.\n   </em>\n   In his Second Amended Complaint, Hayden sufficiently alleges that each annual release of\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K\n   </em>\n   is a distinct act of copyright infringement. Therefore, the Court will not dispose of Hayden's request for statutory damages and attorney's fees with respect to Hayden's Registered Tattoos at this time. Take-Two's Motion to Dismiss this relief is accordingly denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court grants Take-Two's Motion to Dismiss Hayden's Unjust Enrichment claim because it is preempted by the Copyright Act. The Court also grants Take-Two's Motion to Dismiss Hayden's claim for Declaratory Judgment due to the absence of an actual \"case or controversy\" as required by the Declaratory Judgment Act and Article III. Finally, the Court denies Take-Two's Motion to Dismiss Hayden's request for statutory damages and attorney's fees with respect to Hayden's Registered Tattoos depicted in\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K17\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K18\n   </em>\n   . Whether each annual release of\n   <em>\n    NBA 2K\n   </em>\n   is a \"series of acts constituting infringement\" or \"separate and distinct\n   acts of infringement\" is a factual issue that cannot be determined without further discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
