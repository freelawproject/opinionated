The Court granted FRTIB's and TSP's motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a) to join Mr. Hsieh's surviving spouse, Mrs. Wang. Mem. Op. and Order, ECF No. 16. The Court agreed that Mrs. Wang is a necessary party because, in short, she would be entitled to Mr. Hsieh's TSP funds if his designation of Mrs. Firestone were found invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.

Compl. \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In an Amended Complaint adding Mrs. Wang as a defendant, Mrs. Firestone pleads four claims against some combination of the three defendants. Am. Compl. In Count I, she seeks a Declaratory Judgment vis-\u00e0-vis all three defendants that she is the beneficiary of Mr. Hsieh's TSP account No. 6801147154539 and any other account where associated funds may currently be held. Count II alleges that FRTIB and TSP have breached a putative contract they had with Mr. Hsieh and of which Mrs. Firestone is allegedly a third-party beneficiary. In Count III, Mrs. Firestone requests specific performance of FRTIB's and TSP's alleged obligation to make a distribution to her from the subject TSP account. And Count IV asserts equitable estoppel to prevent FRTIB and TSP from withholding those TSP assets from Mrs. Firestone and distributing them to anyone else, and to prevent Mrs. Wang from attempting to claim those assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At Mrs. Firestone's and Mrs. Wang's request in June 2017, the Court postponed the deadline for Mrs. Wang's response to the Amended Complaint to permit those\n   parties to engage in mediation. Order, ECF No. 26. When mediation did not succeed, Mrs. Wang filed her motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. FRTIB and TSP followed shortly thereafter with their own such motion. Briefing having concluded, both motions are now ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

And there is no indication that Mr. Hsieh made the aforementioned election by choosing to draw from his TSP account while he lived.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208477\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8433(b).

There is no dispute that FRTIB and TSP are to make a distribution\n   to\n   <em>\n    someone\n   </em>\n   under this provision; accordingly, the Court need not evaluate portions of Section 8424 and cross-referenced provisions that define qualifying \"lump-sum benefits.\" Moreover, the Court understands that regulations identify the TSP record keeper, rather than the Office of Personnel Management (\"OPM\"), as the proper recipient for these purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208401\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (24) (defining \"Office\" as OPM);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201651.3\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1651.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"To designate a beneficiary of a TSP account, a participant must complete and file a TSP designation of beneficiary form with the TSP record keeper.\"); FRTIB Mem. at 7 n.2 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201651.3\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1651.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) ). The import of Section 8424(d) is that Mrs. Firestone qualifies as a beneficiary only if Mr. Hsieh so designated her in \"a signed and witnessed writing received [by the TSP record keeper] before [Mr. Hsieh's] death.\" Absent such a designation, the payment would go to the next individual in the order of precedence, namely Mr. Hsieh's widow, Mrs. Wang.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208424\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201651.2\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1651.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201651.5\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1651.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (recognizing participant's spouse as \"married even if the parties are separated, unless a court decree of divorce or annulment has been entered\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   FRTIB's regulations further specified what kind of writing Mr. Hsieh was required to submit if he wanted to designate a beneficiary.

Hsieh TSP-3 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FRTIB's Mem. at 2; Pl.'s Opp'n to FRTIB's Mot., Ex. 4 (Aff. of Carolan Bontje \u00b6 11). Under the plain text of the then-extant regulation, the form is not \"properly dated\" by Ms. Bontje.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201651.3\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1651.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) (2015). The simple fact is that page one called for a date, and she omitted that date. That reading is unchanged by the undisputed fact that Ms. Bontje\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   add a date to the Form TSP-3 when she signed a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   section on\n   <em>\n    page two.\n   </em>\n   Hsieh TSP-3 at 2. Nor is it changed by Ms. Bontje's affidavit, submitted during briefing, in which she\n   suggests that she intended to \"adopt[ ]\" the date of the witness who signed and dated above her own signature. Pl.'s Opp'n to FRTIB's Mot., Ex. 4 (Aff. of Carolan Bontje \u00b6 11). For the reasons that follow, compliance with the TSP statute and regulations must be strict, not merely substantial, and intent is insufficient to fill the gap. The Court's application of the plain text of the operative regulation is reinforced by a number of factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, the then-extant version of Section 1651.3(c)(3)(ii) dictated that \"[a]ll submitted and attached pages must be ... witnessed in the same manner (by the same witnesses) as the form itself.\" The contrast between \"submitted\" pages and \"the form itself\" created some ambiguity about whether there is a difference between the two. Presumably, \"all\" pages submitted to the TSP record keeper would include the form itself. However, the Court shall conservatively assume,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that submitted pages were in fact something that did or could differ from the form itself. Even so, this provision about submitted pages supports the Court's interpretation of Section 1651.3(c)(3) language that indisputably applied to the form itself. Because Section 1651.3(c)(3) required proper dating by both witnesses on the form itself, this requirement that each submitted page be witnessed in the same manner reaffirms the inference that\n   <em>\n    each page of the form itself\n   </em>\n   likewise needed to be dated by both witnesses. Otherwise an illogical result would occur: Every page of a participant's change of beneficiary submission would need to be dated except for a page in the form itself. Moreover, at the time, submitted pages had to \"follow the format of the TSP designation of beneficiary form.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201651.3\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1651.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) (2015). That is further reason to expect compliance with page one itself, else the illogical outcome that \"Date Signed\" portions of every page in the submission-except page one of the form-needed to be complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, the instructions in Section III of Form TSP-3 itself required Ms. Bontje to add the date on page one. That section instructed Mr. Hsieh that \"[y]ou and your witnesses must complete this section.\" Hsieh TSP-3 at 1. Omitting a portion of Section III would mean that Section III is not complete. Section III provided further that \"[t]his entire form is valid only if this page is witnessed by two persons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201651.3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, a failure to observe the witness requirement as to this page one rendered ineffective any attempt to remedy that deficiency elsewhere in the form. Next to the Witness 2 signature line are standard blocks above the language, \"Date Signed (\n   <em>\n    mm/dd/yyyy\n   </em>\n   ).\" Failure to add the date to those blocks plainly means that Section III is not complete, and that defect is fatal to the remainder of Form TSP-3, notwithstanding Ms. Bontje's addition of a date in a different section on the next page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third, instructions elsewhere on page one-immediately below Section III-made clear beyond cavil that the date of Ms. Bontje's signature was required in Section III. In an unnumbered section labeled in bold capital letters, \"\n   <strong>\n    REMEMBER TO:\n   </strong>\n   \", Mr. Hsieh was urged to \"[p]rovide your signature and your witnesses' signatures above, along with the dates signed.\" Hsieh TSP-3 at 1. Echoing Section 1651.3(c)(3)(ii) of the regulations, this section of Form TSP-3 reminded Mr. Hsieh to \"[h]ave the same two witnesses sign and date all pages that you submit to the TSP.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201651.3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Mr. Hsieh was to \"[c]omplete each section in accordance with the instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201651.3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is hard to conceive of more direct, yet concise instructions requiring the very date that Ms.\n   Bontje omitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Fourth, Mrs. Firestone herself puts into the record a page from FRTIB's website with instructions for participants who want to designate a beneficiary. Pl.'s Opp'n to FRTIB's Mot., Ex. 6, ECF No. 33-6 (containing webpage as of Sept. 29, 2017);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to FRTIB's Mot., Ex. 2 (Aff. of Walter E. Gillcrist, Jr. \u00b6 8) (indicating that Mrs. Firestone's counsel is unaware \"whether this website existed as such in 2015\"). That webpage instructs: \"Sign and witness each page of Form TSP-3 according to the directions.\" Pl.'s Opp'n to FRTIB's Mot., Ex. 6, ECF No. 33-6. As discussed above, those instructions dictate that \"witness[ing]\" each page requires dating each page. Still, the Court does not rely too heavily on this webpage because of the uncertainty of its existence at the time Mr. Hsieh and his witnesses prepared his Form TSP-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Fifth, the Court's interpretation of the operative version of Section 1651.3(c) is buttressed by FRTIB's own interpretation when it proposed to amend that provision. This is not the traditional instance in which the Court would use pre-enactment history to interpret a given enactment; rather, the Court considers the agency's subsequent statements about this regulation only insofar as they may further illuminate the Court's foregoing analysis of a regulatory scheme that is rather clear, albeit with somewhat peripheral ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The parties dispute whether it is proper to consider this post-enactment interpretation, which Mrs. Wang brought to the Court's attention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wang's Mem. at 8-9. Mrs. Firestone objects with case law about the limited circumstances in which a court may consult the pre-enactment legislative history of a statute, namely, only when the text is not clear. Pl.'s Opp'n to Wang's Mot. at 23-24 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ratzlaf v.

Cir. 2003) ). But her precedent is not on point. Here the Court is dealing with a regulation, and the parties have not cited any legislative history preceding that regulation itself; rather, the dispute concerns subsequent history of that regulation. Moreover, the text of the regulation at issue is rather clear, but in light of a little ambiguity about whether requirements for the form itself are the same as those for submitted pages-assuming some distinction between the two-the Court will consider FRTIB's subsequent interpretation of Section 1651.3(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In a proposed rule published in the Federal Register on March 30, 2017, FRTIB observed that \" Section 1651.3(c) currently requires a TSP beneficiary designation form to be witnessed by two people and\n   also requires each page of the form to be dated by the participant and both witnesses.\" Designation of Beneficiary,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015%2C642\">\n    82 Fed.

This statement in the Federal Register affirms the Court's reconciliation, above, of the slight ambiguity between expectations for the form itself and expectations for submitted pages, on the assumption,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that those submitted pages could be something different from the form itself. The agency gives this affirmation by linking \"each page\" language to the \"of the form\" interpretation. Although the proposed rule-eventually enacted-expressly intended to change only the number of required witnesses from two to one, that proposal also instituted the following clearer language about the signature requirement for the witness who remained: \"All submitted and attached pages of the form must be signed and dated by the same witness[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015%2C642\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Designation of Beneficiary,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2021%2C107\">\n    82 Fed.

FRTIB concurred in its closing remark that, aside from reducing the number of witnesses, \"[t]he other validity requirements, including the requirement that the same witness sign and date all pages of the beneficiary designation form, remain unchanged.\" Designation of Beneficiary, 82 Fed. Reg. at 15,642.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The statutory order of precedence, FRTIB's implementing regulations, the instructions on Form TSP-3, FRTIB's webpage during this litigation, and-to the extent proper to consider it-the agency's subsequent interpretation of its then-extant regulations, all reinforce the Court's conclusion that the TSP regime requires strict compliance with the change of beneficiary rules that were operative when Mr. Hsieh submitted his Form TSP-3. Moreover, this interpretation is consistent with the agency's own alleged response to Mr. Hsieh's Form TSP-3. The record contains a notice from TSP to Mr. Hsieh dated November 28, 2015, stating that the agency was \"unable to process\" his Form TSP-3 because \"[a] required signature date is missing or invalid.\" FRTIB's Reply, Ex. 2, ECF No. 34. Although Mrs. Firestone argues that there is no evidence that this rejection notice was sent to, or received by, Mr. Hsieh, the Court need not resolve that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to FRTIB's Mot. at 7; Pl.'s Opp'n to Wang's Mot. at 3-4.

The Court lacks briefing about FRTIB's and TSP's record-keeping practices, but the Court has no reason to believe that these agencies fraudulently manufactured the notice for this litigation. Accordingly, the language in the notice-whether or not it was sent-reflects the government's strict compliance with the requirement that Mr. Hsieh's Form TSP-3 required a date next to Ms. Bontje's signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Mrs. Firestone has not identified any case-either in this jurisdiction or any other-that permits less than strict compliance with the TSP statute and then-extant regulations.

In\n   <em>\n    Kriebel v.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Hewitt v.

In what appears to be one of the seminal cases on this issue, the Fourth Circuit was careful to cabin its holding: \"We do not hold that the federal common law of substantial compliance is applicable in any context other than that before the court in the instant case, the change of beneficiary provision in an ERISA plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Phoenix Mut.

In\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v.

However, the district court found the error harmless under Rule 37(c)(1) because the experts substantially complied by expressly adopting the contents of those disclosures in affidavits submitted after the fact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3106042\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/482/#p487\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3106042\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/482/#p487\">\n    at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There is no TSP equivalent of the Rule 37(c)(1) safe harbor for harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In short, Mrs. Firestone fails to persuade the Court that this is a context where substantial compliance is permissible. Mrs. Firestone has not shown that Congress gave FRTIB and TSP the discretion to deviate from its statutory and regulatory obligations, which in this case require payment to the surviving spouse absent a valid Form TSP-3 designating a beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208424\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201651.2\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1651.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (2) ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferguson v.

Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-25. She tries to ground this claim in the \"recover benefits\" and \"enforce any right\" language of Section 8477(e).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to FRTIB's Mot. at 15. But Mrs. Firestone does not furnish any authority for her argument, in effect, that Congress intended to provide TSP participants with contractual rights enforceable by them or their third-party beneficiaries through a breach of contract claim. Moreover, she does not identify precedent articulating the elements of such a claim, which would presumably derive from state common law, despite the incongruity with the federal statute from which the putative claim springs. Nor does Mrs. Firestone discuss whether and how the statutory definition of a beneficiary should accommodate this non-statutory notion of a third-party beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court need not puzzle further, however, about the nature of a breach of contract claim in this setting, because Mrs. Firestone has not established that the Court would have jurisdiction over any such claim. Section 8477(e) accords jurisdiction only over claims by participants and beneficiaries, of which Mrs. Firestone is neither. In an apparent attempt to salvage her claim, she argues that she is the \"\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   third-party beneficiary of the contract between FRTIB and Mr. Hsieh.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208477\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208477\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). But the Court does not accept this Trojan Horse for persuading the Court to rely on Mr. Hsieh's (presumed) intention. As discussed above, the TSP regime requires strict compliance. Mr. Hsieh did not comply with the requirements for a valid Form TSP-3; accordingly, he did not designate Mrs. Firestone as a beneficiary, and the Court would have no jurisdiction over any otherwise-valid breach of contract claim rooted in Section 8477(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   That leaves Mrs. Firestone's equitable estoppel claim. It is, of course, her burden to establish the Court's jurisdiction over that claim.\n   <em>\n    Am. Farm Bureau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11156260\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/121/84/#p90\">\n    121 F.Supp.2d at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Mrs. Firestone does not specifically discuss the grounds for jurisdiction over an equitable estoppel claim. Indeed, she says very little about this claim at all in her briefing. In opposing Mrs. Wang's motion, Mrs. Firestone briefly asserts that Mrs. Wang's challenge to the equitable estoppel claim \"is not only premature[,] it is unsubstantiated,\" in light of allegations in the Amended Complaint. Pl.'s Opp'n to Wang's Mot. at 13-14. Yet, elsewhere in that pleading, Mrs. Firestone effectively ceases pursuing that claim against Mrs. Wang altogether: \"Plaintiff is not aware presently of any conduct by Mrs.Wang that would draw in the doctrine [of equitable estoppel]. However, Plaintiff will address the merits of this claim if necessary in her response to the government's recently filed motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. FRTIB and TSP indeed challenge her equitable estoppel claim, but she says\n   <em>\n    nothing\n   </em>\n   in response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FRTIB's Mot. at 11-13;\n   <em>\n    see also generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to FRTIB's Mot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Ordinarily the Court hesitates to treat an issue as conceded.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Manning v. Esper\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 12-1802 (CKK),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20281278\">\n    2019 WL 281278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (D.D.C. Jan. 22, 2019) (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (discussing Circuit precedent). Here, however, there is good reason to do so. Mrs. Firestone is expressly aware that Mrs. Wang's motion challenges her equitable estoppel claim, and she clearly anticipated the same in FRTIB's and TSP's motion. Despite that awareness, the Court lacks Mrs. Firestone's counterarguments, if any, as to the legal merits of her equitable estoppel claim. While in response to Mrs. Wang's motion, Mrs. Firestone initially urges the sufficiency of the equitable estoppel allegations in her Amended Complaint, elsewhere she concedes that \"this case may not fall neatly into equitable estoppel jurisprudence.\" Pl.'s Opp'n to Wang's Mot. at 27 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4315143\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/885/294/#p299\">\n    885 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   298 ). She offers no further argument why the Court should recognize an equitable estoppel claim here if it is admittedly a somehow-unusual setting for such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Even if the Court does not treat the equitable estoppel argument as conceded, the Court still cannot identify the jurisdictional hook. Absent beneficiary status for Mrs. Firestone, there is no obvious basis for jurisdiction over her claim under Section 8477(e). And she has not argued that this Court has any other jurisdiction over her suit. Accordingly, Mrs. Firestone's equitable estoppel claims against Mrs.Wang, FRTIB, and TSP must be dismissed, if not by concession, then under Rule 12(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because Mrs. Firestone has not established that this Court has jurisdiction over any of her claims, the Court need not address any distinct issues of Mrs. Firestone's standing or FRTIB's and TSP's sovereign immunity, nor does it need to evaluate her claims under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Alternatively, Summary Judgment Under Rule 56\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , in the alternative that Mrs. Firestone could establish this Court's subject-matter jurisdiction, the Court nevertheless finds that the undisputed material facts warrant summary judgment for Mrs. Wang, FRTIB, and TSP. In their briefing, the parties comment on each other's (non-)compliance with the rules for statements of material fact accompanying summary judgment pleadings. The parties' briefing is, indeed, not a model of compliance in this regard. However, the record shows that the vanishingly few facts that are necessary to resolve the motion for summary judgment in the alternative are not genuinely disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As discussed above, it is undisputed that Ms. Bontje did not add a date next to her witness signature on the first page of Mr. Hsieh's Form TSP-3. The beneficiary designation was therefore ineffective. Without beneficiary status, Mrs. Firestone is not entitled to a declaratory judgment or specific performance. The foregoing discussion also shows that Mrs. Firestone did not sufficiently plead the elements of a valid breach of contract claim, and that she has conceded the legal merits of her equitable estoppel claim. Accordingly, Mrs. Firestone is unable to prevail, even on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   None of Mrs. Firestone's other arguments change the outcome. For example, discovery is unnecessary because the undisputed material facts show that she is not the beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    Contra\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to\n   FRTIB's Mot. at 8 (requesting discovery for purposes exceeding scope necessary to decide pending motions). Nor are the parties' disputes as to any other facts material to this outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   If, as the parties seem to agree, Mr. Hsieh really did intend to designate a beneficiary, it is unfortunate that he was unable to effectively do so. The Court understands why strict compliance is necessary to ensure justice in the aggregate. As FRTIB and TSP argue, the \"agencies\" abide by \"strict and clear rules\" in order to effectively \"administer many thousands of savings plans for current and former federal employees and ... distribute the funds in those plans to the correct beneficiaries.\" FRTIB's Reply at 1. The Court's faithfulness to the mandates of Congress and FRTIB regulations precludes recourse to any equities suggesting less than strict compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
