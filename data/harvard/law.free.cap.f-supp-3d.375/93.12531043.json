The agency released several redacted documents and argued the redactions were proper under FOIA Exemption 5.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528116\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/342/62/#p72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528116\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/342/62/#p72\">\n    at 77-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying the \"foreseeable harm\" standard, the court found that the agency had failed to explain how the disclosures of information withheld under Exemption 5 would harm the agency's deliberative process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528116\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/342/62/#p72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528116\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/342/62/#p72\">\n    at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court noted that the foreseeable harm requirement does not go \"so far as to require the government to identify harm likely to result from disclosure of\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   of its Exemption 5 withholdings\" but the government at least needed to do more than \"perfunctorily state that disclosure of all the withheld information-regardless of category or substance-would jeopardize the free exchange of information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528116\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/342/62/#p72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court finds the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Rosenberg\n   </em>\n   persuasive and agrees that the text and purpose of the Act both support a heightened standard for an agency's withholdings under Exemption 5. The text of the Act states an agency may only withhold information if \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by [a FOIA] exemption.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(A). In other words, even if an exemption applies, an agency must release the document unless doing so would reasonably harm an exemption-protected interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528116\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/342/62/#p72\">\n    342 F.Supp.3d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The purpose of the Act was to establish a \"presumption of openness,\" and its passing was based on the recognition that \"from the beginning, agencies have taken advantage of these exemptions to withhold any information that might technically fit.\" 162 Cong. Rec. H3714-01, H3717162 (2016)(noting that although some agencies \"have made an effort to comply with the letter of the law, very few have complied with the spirit of the law\"). To that end, Congress sought to require an agency to \"first determine whether [it] could reasonably foresee an actual harm\" before the agency claims an exemption.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528116\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/342/62/#p72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, an \"inquiry into whether an agency has reasonably foreseen a specific, identifiable harm that would be caused by a disclosure would require the ability to articulate both the nature of the harm and the link between the specified harm and specific information contained in the material withheld.\" H.R. REP. NO. 114-391, at 9 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Applying the standard to this case, the Court finds that the declarations and supporting Vaughn indexes fall short of what is required under the Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Mr. Graff's first declaration he explained that release of the withheld information \"could have a chilling effect on the discussion within the agency in the future\" and \"discourage[ ] a frank and open dialogue among agency employees.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Graff Decl., ECF No. 14-2 at 4. He further explained in his second declaration that the \"foreseeable harm\" in releasing the withheld information was that it \"could have a chilling effect on the discussions within the agency\" and added that these \"deliberations are essential to ensuring that the right information is delivered to [the] public\" and that failure \"to have these frank deliberations could cause confusion if incorrect or misrepresented climate information remained in the public sphere.\" Second Graff Decl., ECF No. 17-2 at 2-3. These general explanations of the possibility of a \"chilling effect\" fall short of articulating \"a link between the specified harm and specific information contained in the material withheld.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. REP. NO. 114-391, at 9 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Revised Vaughn Index, although seemingly more specific, contains comparable boiler plate language to justify the redactions. For each withheld document Commerce simply states that \"the redacted\n   material is being withheld under exemption (b)(5)\" and that the \"release of the redacted material would have the foreseeable harm of discouraging a frank and open dialogue among interagency staff.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Revised Vaughn Index, ECF No. 17-3 at 1-6 (using identical language to explain claim of exemption for each page). If the mere possibility that disclosure discourages a frank and open dialogue was enough for the exemption to apply, then Exemption 5 would apply whenever the deliberative process privilege was invoked regardless of whether disclosure of the information would harm an interest protected by the exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   However, in enacting the legislation, Congress intended that the technical application of an exemption was not sufficient without a showing that disclosure also harmed an interest the exemption sought to protect in the first place. Commerce has provided no explanation as to why disclosure is likely to discourage frank and open dialogue as to the specific withholdings-or categories of withholdings-in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528116\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/342/62/#p72\">\n    342 F.Supp.3d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a categorical approach in which an agency identifies the harm likely to result from each disclosure of certain categories of documents is sufficient). Commerce simply posits that such disclosures \"\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   chill speech\" and could have an effect on interagency discussion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Graff Decl., ECF No. 17-2 at 2 (emphasis added). The question is not whether disclosure could chill speech, but rather if it is reasonably foreseeable that it will chill speech and, if so, what is the link between this harm and the specific information contained in the material withheld. In other words, the Act requires more than speculation, which is all that Commerce has provided through its declarations and Vaughn indexes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because Commerce has failed to satisfactorily show that the redactions under Exemption 5 would result in reasonably foreseeable harm to its deliberative process, the Court denies Commerce's motion. However, the Court will allow Commerce to supplement its declaration on remand to satisfy the \"foreseeable harm\" standard, rather than grant summary judgment in Judicial Watch's favor. As the agency will have another opportunity to supplement its declarations as to Exemption 5, the Court need not address the issue of whether further segregation of the redacted information from information that may be disclosed is possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565051,6047422\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1106/\">\n    494 F.3d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1116 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (stating a district court must make specific findings of segregability regarding the documents to be withheld, \"before approving the application of a FOIA exemption\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Judicial Watch's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in PART, DENIED in PART\n   </strong>\n   , and\n   <strong>\n    HELD IN ABEYANCE in PART\n   </strong>\n   and Commerce's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .

However, after Judicial Watch filed its motion for summary judgment, Commerce released three documents to Judicial Watch with the redactions removed, 827, 817, 722. Second Graff Decl., ECF No. 17-2 at 2. Commerce has also released documents 70 and 75 with the redactions removed. Pls's Cross-Mot. ECF No. 15 at 19, n.11.
