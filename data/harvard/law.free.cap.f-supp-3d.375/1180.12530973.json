Dkt. 35. It argues that the supervision of doctors is not a \"medical, surgical, or dental or related function\" and so immunity has not been waived.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20233\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The United States takes an overly restrictive view on the coverage of \u00a7 233 (a). It argues that under cannons of statutory interpretation, the general term \"related function\" should be construed to only embrace subjects similar in nature to those enumerated by the specific terms that preceded it. That is, that \"related functions\" only include functions similar to the provision of \"medical, surgical, or dental functions.\" The statutory language does not stop there, however. It fully provides that it covers the \"performance of medical, surgical, dental, or related functions, including the conduct of clinical studies or investigation.\" The addition of the clause \"including the conduct of clinical studies or investigation\" expands the notion of what \"related functions\" includes - adding in activities that are not direct provision of medical services. These activities are tangential to direct health care services, but Congress expressly included them. The United States' argument, then, that Congress intended for \u00a7 233 to apply only to medical malpractice suits is unconvincing. \"When Congress has sought to limit immunity to medical malpractice claims it has done so explicitly.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuoco v.

This case is similar to\n   <em>\n    Brignac v.

There, a rape victim sued a federally funded health clinic for negligent hiring and retention of a doctor the clinic knew had sexually assaulted other patients who were in a prison complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The United States argued that Brignac's claims should be dismissed because they were not covered by \u00a7 233 (a). In rejecting the United States' overly restrictive view of the waiver of sovereign immunity contained in \u00a7 233 (a), the court noted that \"to become a 'deemed' entity in the first place, Family Health Centers is required to show that it has 'reviewed and verified the professional credentials, references, claims history, fitness, professional review organization findings, and license status of its physicians and other licensed or certified health care practitioners.' \"\n   <em>\n    Brignac\n   </em>\n   , at 1377 (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20233\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) ).
