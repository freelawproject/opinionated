Jorgenson, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the Court is the Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 63) filed by Defendant American Airlines, Inc. (\"American\"). Plaintiffs Iddy M. Pierre-Canel (\"Pierre-Canel\") and Emmanuel J. Simeus (\"Simeus\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") have filed a response (Doc. 65) and American has filed a reply (Doc. 67). Oral argument has been requested. However, the issues are fully presented in the briefs and the Court finds it would not be assisted by oral argument. The Court declines to schedule this matter for oral argument. LRCiv 7.2(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 8, 2016, Pierre-Canel's child Carm-Idrelle Casseus (\"Casseus\") died in Tucson, Arizona. Adair Funeral Home arranged for Casseus's remains to be flown from Tucson, Arizona to Snowden Funeral Home in Baltimore, Maryland for cremation and for memorial services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pierre-Canel's return flight to Tucson, with a layover in Dallas/Fort Worth, was booked with American for March 5, 2016. Simeus returned to Tucson a few days earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pierre-Canel had Casseus's cremated remains placed in a sealed screw top urn (\"the Urn\"). Plaintiffs assert Pierre-Canel packed the Urn, her daughter's pictures, jewelry box and jewelry, personal items, and a yellow envelope containing numerous sympathy cards and monetary gifts in her Louis Vuitton duffel bag (the \"LV Bag\"). During her deposition testimony, Pierre-Canel testified that the LV Bag contained the Urn, three suits, ten dresses,\n   two pairs of jeans, four pairs of dress pants, four pairs of shoes, cosmetics, one purse, two wallets, lingerie, undergarments, sandals and Casseus's $24,000 in jewelry. Simeus testified during his deposition that he did not know what Pierre-Canel packed. Pierre-Canel planned to carry the LV Bag and a red roller bag (the \"Red Bag\") as carry-on baggage on the aircraft. Pierre-Canel asserts she arrived at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport (\"BWI\") with three bags; she checked a large gray bag at the ticket counter. American asserts its baggage records indicate Pierre-Canel checked one bag at 4:20 p.m. at the ticket counter. Plaintiffs point out that this assertion by American assumes their baggage records are accurate. American's customer service records and an American Senior Investigator admit American mishandled the bag(s) in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pierre-Canel asserts she carried the remaining two bags (the LV Bag and the Red Bag) and proceeded towards the departure gate. At the TSA screening area, the TSA agent requested Pierre-Canel open the bags. The TSA agent noticed the Urn in the LV Bag and inquired about its contents. Pierre-Canel told the TSA agent the Urn contained the ashes of her daughter, Casseus; the TSA agent told Pierre-Canel not to carry the Urn outside the bag, just to keep it in her carry-on bag and proceed to the departure gate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the American departure gate, Pierre-Canel checked in. She asserts she then sat in the waiting area at the gate and, mourning the loss of her daughter, began crying quietly. Plaintiffs assert a gate agent approached Pierre-Canel three (3) different times and asked her if she could check Pierre-Canel's bags. Plaintiffs assert Pierre-Canel specifically told a gate agent that her daughter's ashes were in an urn in her LV Bag and refused to have her bags checked. As Pierre-Canel prepared to board the plane at the jetway door, a woman who was later identified as Gate Agent Rosann McCormack (\"McCormack\") took both carry-on bags from Pierre-Canel. Plaintiffs also assert that neither McCormack nor anyone else told Pierre-Canel to remove valuable items from her bags. Pierre-Canel states she believed the gate agent was going to carry Pierre-Canel's bags on the airplane for her. Plaintiffs assert that, after Pierre-Canel took her seat in first class and the plane doors closed, a Gate Agent gave Pierre-Canel two baggage claim tickets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   American asserts its baggage records indicate Pierre-Canel checked one bag at the gate at 4:57 p.m. Plaintiffs assert the bag shown on American's records to have been checked in at 4:57 p.m. likely belonged to a different passenger whose luggage was also mis-tagged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs assert, \"[American's] own records show that their baggage service operators had only six minutes time to manipulate the bags from the time it was checked and the time it was loaded onto the plane. Therefore, Pierre-Canel's luggage could not have been checked at 4:57, as alleged by [American.]\" Pl. SOF (Doc. 66, p. 5). The records further indicate the gate-checked bag was a red American Tourister bag and not a Louis Vuitton bag. American points out this was a full hour before the plane was boarded at 5:48 p.m. American also points out that Pierre-Canel testified that in all the times she has ever flown, she has never had a gate agent walk bags onto the plane for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Wendy Yang (\"Yang\"), McCormack, and Michael Bailey (\"Bailey\"), the American gate agents/customer service representatives working Pierre-Canel's flight, testified that they have no recollection of a woman from Pierre-Canel's flight telling them she was carrying an urn in a Louis Vuitton bag. They also testified that it would have stuck out in their minds if they had been told an urn was in a bag. However, neither McCormack nor Yang remember working Pierre-Canel's flight on March 5, 2016, and Bailey testified he was not at Pierre-Canel's gate on March 5, 2016. McCormack, the American employee identified by Pierre-Canel as the one who she believed would carry her bags onto the plane, testified that she has offered to carry a passenger's bags to the plane for them; however, McCormack also testified that, in her opinion, if a person had carried their bags from the ticket counter to the gate agent, they would not need assistance to carry those same bags onto the plane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Yang, McCormack, and Bailey also testified that, if a bag is checked there will always be a computerized record. However, Bailey testified that a computer record may not exist (for example, when there is no remaining overhead space or when systems are down). American asserts that even where there was an error (i.e., the wrong tag was placed on the Red Bag), a record is made of the event, unlike the alleged checking of the LV Bag, of which there is no record in American's computer system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The LV Bag and the Red Bag, which Plaintiffs assert were checked by American personnel, did not timely arrive at the Tucson International Airport (\"TIA\"). Pierre-Canel went to the baggage claim department and told the American baggage personnel her bags had not arrived. Pierre-Canel asserts she immediately requested assistance from American personnel to locate the Urn containing the ashes of Casseus, as well as her lost bags containing other valuable property. Plaintiffs asserts Pierre-Canel retrieved the LV Bag at TIA the next day. However, Plaintiffs assert the Urn was not in the LV Bag and that the bag had been torn and the zipper broken. Pierre-Canel hoped the Urn would be located because she asserts American personnel told her that, because the LV Bag had been damaged, the Urn and other belongings may have been placed in the Red Bag. Simeus testified that he went with Pierre-Canel to TIA that next day; he testified the LV Bag was at the airport, was damaged and a lot of stuff was missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pierre-Canel contacted American almost daily, but asserts American had no explanation and could not locate the Red Bag. A March 8, 2016 email from Pierre-Canel states, \"[u]pon checking in at BWI, I checked two bags. When I arrived to Tucson at approximately 11:20 p.m., I proceeded to luggage claims, where I could find only one of my two bags.\" Am. SOF, Ex. 10 (Doc. 64-10). Plaintiffs assert in context, this statement was referring to the two bags that were checked at the gate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pierre-Canel did not provide receipts for the property (e.g., jewelry) alleged to have been missing from the luggage. Pierre-Canel testified that some of the items had not been recently purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On or about March 11, 2016, American's Dallas warehouse informed Pierre-Canel that the Red Bag had been found but the Urn was missing. Plaintiffs assert American's employees also told Pierre-Canel she had been given the wrong baggage claim tickets for her carry-on baggage at BWI. Pierre-Canel received the Red Bag via Federal Express on or about March 16, 2016. Pierre-Canel asserts she discovered that not only was the Urn missing, but also\n   missing were the jewelry, the sympathy cards, and the monetary gifts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pierre-Canel continued to contact American on almost a daily basis, via emails and telephone calls, regarding the lost Urn. Plaintiffs assert American agreed to fix the damaged LV Bag. American asserts there is no evidence that the LV Bag was ever damaged - Although American issued a \"call tag\" for the LV Bag, Pierre-Canel never sent the bag to be examined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that, after the Urn was lost, the grief from the death of Casseus remarkably magnified and caused intense strain on Plaintiffs' relationship with each other. Simeus testified that Pierre-Canel was withdrawn, would not talk and spent hours by herself following the death of Casseus. When asked to specify the difference between the distress from the death of Casseus and the distress from losing the Urn, Simeus did not know how to separate the two. However, he did testify that both he and Pierre-Canel emotionally felt that they lost Casseus twice and that it was difficult to describe. American asserts Pierre-Canel and Simeus both testified that, as a result of losing the Urn, neither have seen a psychiatrist or psychologist for counseling and have not had to take any medication. Plaintiffs point out that Pierre-Canel and Simeus actually testified that they were not on medication and that American's attorney cut-off Pierre-Canel's response to this deposition question. Additionally, Pierre-Canel did receive counseling from church leaders. However, Plaintiff's counsel refused to allow Plaintiffs to testify as to the counseling they received from church leaders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   American asserts Plaintiffs admitted to not having experienced the \"necessary physical symptoms\" to constitute severe emotional distress. Plaintiffs object to the characterization of \"necessary physical symptoms\" to constitute severe emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   American's Conditions of Carriage states,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ...

Counsel for American asserts the following provision is also included in the Conditions of Carriage, but such language is not included in the exhibit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   American does not accept these items in or as checked baggage and assumes no responsibility or liability for such items, regardless of whether American knew or should have known of the presence of such items in checked or transferred baggage. If any such items are lost, damaged or delayed, you will not be entitled to any reimbursement under American's standard baggage liability, or under any declared excess valuation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Am. SOF (Doc. 64, p. 6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs assert, \"Defendant's Contract specifically states, 'When you travel with human remains, they'll be treated\n   <strong>\n    as carry-on baggage\n   </strong>\n   .' CSOF 24 (emphasis added).\" Pl. Resp. (Doc. 65, p. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 16, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint against American and unnamed Doe defendants for claims of breach of the Conditions of Carriage contract, negligence and gross negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and bailment. Plaintiffs' prayer for relief includes a request for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On May 30, 2018, American filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 63). Plaintiffs filed a response (Doc. 65) on June 29, 2018, and American filed a reply (Doc. 67) on July 16, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Summary Judgment Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Summary judgment may be granted if the movant shows \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

In support of this argument, American points to contradictions in Pierre-Canel's statements, documents and testimony. Similarly, American asserts there is no evidence to support some of Plaintiffs' claims.

Here, the quantity of items to which Pierre-Canel testified fit in a carry-on bag is simply incredible. The Court finds it likely that Pierre-Canel's explanation in the affidavit, that she could not state which items were in which bag, is more credible than the deposition testimony. The Court finds this deposition testimony does not warrant concluding that genuine issues of fact do not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, when placed in context, Pierre-Canel has maintained a consistent series of events. For example, although American argues that Pierre-Canel admitted \"that she had never had a gate agent carry her bags onto the plane before[,]\" Reply (Doc. 67, p. 3), Pierre-Canel's deposition testimony could be interpreted as meaning prior to the flight at issue. Am. SOF, Ex. 8, 65:4-14 (Doc. 64-8, p. 18 of 54). Further, discrepancies may be attributed to Pierre-Canel's use of English, as argued by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Additionally, while American's documentary evidence (e.g., baggage records) appears compelling, Bailey testified that there may be some circumstances where a computer record may not be generated. Moreover, McCormack testified that she has assisted passengers onto a plane and also carried carry-on bags to the plane for passengers. Where, as here, McCormack does not specifically recall Pierre-Canel's flight, a jury could reasonably conclude that Pierre-Canel was such a passenger. Lastly, although American argues that there is nothing to corroborate Pierre-Canel's version of events, Simeus does corroborate that the LV Bag was retrieved from the airport the day after Pierre-Canel's flight arrived. The significance of any bias or self-interest based on being Pierre-Canel's spouse or co-plaintiff is more appropriately weighed by a trier of fact. Similarly, it is up to a jury to weigh Pierre-Canel's testimony that she could have been mistaken as to which items were in a bag - i.e., the cremated remains were not in a checked bag as opposed to she does not recall which items were in the LV Bag or the Red Bag.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

While this arguably supports American's argument that if, anything such as a crying woman telling them she was carrying her daughter's cremated remains in an urn had occurred, they would have remembered the event, such evidence is not as strong as an affirmative memory. In other words, the weight to be placed on this evidence is better left to a trier of fact. Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that the choice to check the LV Bag and Red Bag was taken from Pierre-Canel when McCormack took the LV Bag and the Red Bag from her.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coughlin v.

If a jury were to accept Pierre-Canel's entire version of events, it follows they would conclude the bags were checked without Pierre-Canel's knowledge or consent. While Pierre-Canel did acknowledge that a gate agent was \"insisting\" she check her bags, Pierre-Canel consistently has stated that she repeatedly rebuffed those efforts. Although American argues this shows Pierre-Canel knew, based on the insistent gate agent, that her bags were being checked, a jury could just as reasonably conclude that Pierre-Canel believed that the gate agent had acquiesced to Pierre-Canel's insistence that she keep the bags with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   VI.\n   <em>\n    Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \"A plaintiff suing for intentional infliction of emotional distress must prove the defendant caused severe emotional distress by extreme and outrageous conduct committed with the intent to cause emotional distress or with reckless disregard of the near-certainty that such distress would result.\"\n   <em>\n    Watkins v.

If the jury believes the events occurred as asserted by Plaintiffs, there is a genuine dispute as to whether American's conduct warrants an award of punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   VIII.\n   <em>\n    Negligence/Gross Negligence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   American points out that Plaintiffs must show that any negligence or gross negligence actually caused harm to Plaintiffs for Plaintiffs to establish a claim for negligence or gross negligence.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quiroz v. ALCOA Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20560\">\n    243 Ariz. 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567094\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/824/#p827\">\n    416 P.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 827 (2018). American argues that Plaintiffs cannot establish that any negligence of American caused any harm to Plaintiffs because Plaintiffs cannot establish that American ever had possession of the LV Bag or its contents - that American may have negligently diverted Pierre-Canel's Red Bag to Dallas does not show any harm to Plaintiffs. Again, this fails to consider that a jury may accept Pierre-Canel's version of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   IX.\n   <em>\n    Breach of Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   A breach-of-contract claim requires a plaintiff to show (1) the existence of a contract, (2) breach of that contract, and (3) resulting damages.\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Montelucia Villas, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063103\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/92/\">\n    232 Ariz. 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063103\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/92/\">\n    302 P.3d 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621 (2013). American argues that, because the LV Bag, the Urn and the Jewelry were never checked, American did not breach the Conditions of Carriage by checking the LV Bag. As a genuine issue of material fact is in dispute, summary judgment of this claim is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   X.\n   <em>\n    Bailment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   To establish a bailment there must be \"a delivery by the bailor and acceptance by the bailee of the subject matter of the bailment. It must be placed in the bailee's possession, actual or constructive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Webb v. Aero Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710876\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/130/51/#p52\">\n    130 Ariz. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52-53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710876\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/130/51/#p52\">\n    633 P.2d 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1045-46 (Ct. App. 1981) (citation omitted). Although American argues Plaintiffs cannot, as a matter of law, establish bailment because Amerian never took custody or possession of the LV Bag, the Urn or the Jewelry, the Court finds that a material issue of fact is in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   XI.\n   <em>\n    Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   American asserts Plaintiffs cannot establish damages with any reasonable certainty. However, American has not cited any authority which indicates that documentary evidence, as opposed to testimonial evidence is needed to establish damages. The Court finds summary judgment as to damages is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   1. The Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 63) filed by American Airlines, Inc., is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   2. Summary judgment is awarded in favor of American Airlines, Inc., and against Plaintiffs as to Count III, the claim for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
