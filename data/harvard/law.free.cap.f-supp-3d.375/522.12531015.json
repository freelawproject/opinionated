(D.I. 4). For the reasons set forth below, the motion to intervene is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Intervenors are residents and property owners who reside within five miles of a poultry processing plant and disposal facilities owned and operated by Defendant Mountaire Farms of Delaware, Inc. and its related companies, Mountaire Corporation and Mountaire Farms, Inc. (collectively, \"Mountaire\"). (D.I. 4 at 1). The Intervenors allege that \"Mountaire has disposed of billions of gallons of highly contaminated wastewater and liquefied sludge on lands near the Intervenors' residences,\" which has seeped into the groundwater and caused nitrates to spread \"for miles\" and reach \"dangerously high\" concentrations in the surrounding area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). The Intervenors claim that the groundwater contamination has rendered their water undrinkable, caused adverse health effects and caused the Intervenors' property to lose \"substantial value.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 2, 2018, the Intervenors sent letters to Mountaire and the State of Delaware Department of Natural Resources &amp; Environmental Control (\"DNREC\") notifying them of Intervenors' intent to sue Mountaire for violations of the CWA and RCRA under the relevant citizen-suit provision of each statute. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 4-3 at pgs. 4-16 of 83;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 9 at 1). In their letter to DNREC, the Intervenors requested to meet with DNREC to discuss concerns about Mountaire's alleged misconduct and to offer assistance in investigating. (D.I. 9 at 1-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 4-3 at pgs. 15-16 of 83). DNREC declined to \"commit\" to a meeting. (D.I. 9 at 2). The Intervenors followed up with DNREC with requests for meetings and offers of the assistance of experts retained by Intervenors. (D.I. 9 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (follow-up requests sent on May 22, May 25 and May 30 of 2018) ). DNREC did not respond to the follow-up requests.

In its Complaint, DNREC requests that the Court declare Mountaire to be in violation of the CWA and RCRA, and DNREC seeks an injunction that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , prohibits Mountaire from further contaminating groundwater and requires Mountaire to investigate the contamination and provide residents with an alternative water supply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8 (Prayer for Relief) ). On the same day this case was filed, DNREC filed a parallel proceeding in the Superior Court for the State of Delaware, alleging violations of state environmental laws and referencing the same federal laws at issue in this litigation (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the CWA and RCRA).

DNREC admits that, in the state court action, it is ultimately seeking court approval of a Proposed Consent Decree between DNREC and Mountaire that would \"require[ ] Mountaire to pay a civil penalty and take corrective measures that will address its violations of Delaware environmental statutes and regulations, as well as its violations of the CWA and RCRA that are the basis for the Federal Case.\" (D.I. 8 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 29, 2018, Intervenors filed the present motion to intervene (D.I. 4) and proposed intervenor complaint (D.I. 4-2). The motion seeks intervention as a matter of right under Rule 24(a) primarily based on the statutory rights of intervention provided by the CWA and RCRA, and also seeks permissive intervention under Rule 24(b) in the alternative. (D.I. 4 at 3-4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 9 at 5-8).

Rule 24(a)(1) requires the Court to permit intervention as a matter of right to anyone \"given an unconditional right to intervene by a federal statute.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 24(a)(1). Similarly, Rule 24(a)(2) requires the Court to permit intervention to anyone who \"claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant's ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 24(a)(2). Unlike intervention as of right under Rule 24(a), Rule 24(b) affords the Court discretion in allowing intervention of anyone \"given a conditional right to intervene by a federal statute\" or anyone who \"has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.\" FED.

Instead, DNREC argues that citizen-suit provisions generally exist to permit intervention only where a pending enforcement action would bar citizens from bringing their own suit (D.I. 8 at 3-5), and Mountaire seems to suggest that diligent prosecution operates to bar intervention (D.I. 7 at 10-11). As to DNREC's argument, because DNREC filed this case prior to the expiration of the sixty-day notice period required by the CWA, Intervenors appear to be barred from filing their own suit under \u00a7 1365(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v.

As to Mountaire's argument, \u00a7 1365(b)(1)(B) provides that diligent prosecution by a State bars Intervenors from filing their own suit - not from intervening in a State's suit.

That is, intervention as a matter of right under \u00a7 6972(b)(2)(E) does not fit neatly under either Rule 24(a)(1) or (a)(2). Instead, to intervene as a matter of right under \u00a7 6972(b)(2)(E), a person need only claim an interest in the subject of the action and that the ability to protect that interest may be adversely affected by disposition of the action. In that situation, the burden is placed on the Administrator or State to demonstrate that intervention is not warranted or necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(E) (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     unless\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the Administrator or the State shows that the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties\" (emphasis added) ).

Intervenors are individuals who live near and have been impacted by Mountaire's poultry processing and disposal facilities, which are the subject of DNREC's enforcement action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 4 at 1-2; D.I. 9 at 7). Moreover, Intervenors notified DNREC and Mountaire of their intent to sue under the hazardous-waste provision of RCRA, the same provision that DNREC later used to sue Mountaire in this Court. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   D.I. 4-3 at pg. 4 of 83 (Intervenors providing requisite ninety days' notice of intent to sue under \u00a7 6972(a)(1)(B) ),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 31-33 (DNREC citing \u00a7 6972(a)(1)(B) in Complaint against Mountaire) ). Given that Intervenors and DNREC all sought to sue Mountaire under the same RCRA provision for substantially the same conduct relating to the same property, it is unclear to this Court how Intervenors could not have an interest in the subject of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court also finds that disposition of this action \"may, as a practical matter, impair or impede\" the Intervenors' ability to protect their interest.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(E). The Proposed Consent Decree (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.I. 7, Ex. B), if entered, could prevent Intervenors from obtaining remedial\n   measures that they contend are (and may in fact be) more effective than DNREC's proposals. Moreover, if this action is stayed\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   while Mountaire attempts to perform its obligations under the Proposed Consent Decree, Intervenors are likely barred from filing their own suit under RCRA during the stay. Such potential outcomes may impede or impair Intervenors' ability to protect their interests.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hudson Riverkeeper Fund, Inc. v. Atl.

After claiming that Intervenors' interests are different, DNREC conclusorily states that, even if common interests in the subject of the action exist, Intervenors are adequately represented by DNREC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 8 at 6 (\"To the extent [Intervenors'] interests may overlap with DNREC's interest in enforcing the CWA and RCRA, DNREC is adequately representing those interests by pursuing the Federal Case and State Case against Mountaire.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (\"[Intervenors'] interests in enforcing the CWA and RCRA are adequately represented by DNREC\") ). The Court finds this to be insufficient under \u00a7 6972(b)(2)(E), which requires the State -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , DNREC - to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     show\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   that Intervenors' interest is adequately represented in this case. DNREC failed to make the requisite showing under \u00a7 6972(b)(2)(E) and, as a result, Intervenors must be permitted to intervene in this case as it relates to DNREC's RCRA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court thus finds that Intervenors have a statutory right to intervene in this action as it relates to DNREC's claims arising out of RCRA, and Intervenors must be permitted to intervene as to those claims under Rule 24(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The Court Will Not Limit Intervenors' Participation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   DNREC and Mountaire both request that the Court limit Intervenors' participation in the case if intervention is allowed.

That is, there are no substantive aspects of DNREC's action where Intervenors have not been granted intervention. Moreover, this case is at its earliest stages.

It is unclear whether DNREC's open-dumping count against Mountaire is brought pursuant to the general enforcement provision of RCRA -\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 6972(a)(1)(A) - or pursuant to the hazardous-waste provision -\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 6972(a)(1)(B).

Because the Court finds that intervention must be permitted based on the right of intervention for hazardous-waste suits under RCRA, and because the right of intervention for general enforcement suits appears to be even broader, it is unnecessary to resolve which citizen-suit provision DNREC is using to enforce the prohibition against open dumping.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1) (intervention as a matter of right in general enforcement suits).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Language of \u00a7 6972(b)(2)(E) may arguably suggest a conditional right to intervene exists -\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , those claiming an interest in the subject of an action under \u00a7 6972(a)(1)(B) have a right to intervene only when their ability to protect that interest might be impaired or impeded by disposition of the action. In that scenario, however, \u00a7 6972(b)(2)(E) states that \"any person may intervene as a matter of right,\" thereby invoking Rule 24(a).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a) (\"Intervention of Right\"). Indeed, \u00a7 6972(b)(2)(E) includes much of the same language as in Rule 24(a)(2). Therefore, the Court does not believe \u00a7 6972(b)(2)(E) provides a conditional statutory right to intervene, or that it triggers a permissive-intervention analysis under Rule 24(b)(1)(A) (or otherwise).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    In its answering brief, DNREC asserts that, \"following entry of the Consent Decree in the State Case, DNREC and Mountaire anticipate requesting a stay of the Federal Case while Mountaire satisfies the Consent Decree's conditions.\" (D.I. 8 at 2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Because the Court finds that Intervenors must be permitted to intervene as a matter of right under Rule 24(a) given the statutory rights afforded by the CWA and RCRA, the Court need not address the remaining arguments for intervention under Rule 24(a)(2) or Rule 24(b).
