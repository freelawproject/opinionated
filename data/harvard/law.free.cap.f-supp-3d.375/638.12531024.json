The Court granted the parties additional time to complete extensive jurisdictional discovery. On February 5 and 6, 2019, the Court held a lengthy hearing to hear evidence and arguments concerning the various jurisdictional and related motions filed by Defendants. The Court ruled from the bench but hereby\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n   this Opinion and Order, along with a companion Opinion and Order, to further explain its decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At its core, this case involves a lending scheme envisioned by Mark Curry (\"Curry\"), whereby he and his corporate entities attempt to use the sovereign immunity of the Otoe-Missouria Indian Tribe (the \"Tribe\") to evade this lawsuit. Mindful of the strong federal policy favoring tribal immunity, self-governance, and a safe treasury, the Court cannot accept his arguments. Plaintiffs have produced enough evidence to show that Curry shifted all of the risk of his scheme to the Tribe and kept the lion's share of the revenue for himself, through a scheme that infringed upon the Tribe's self-governance and placed the Tribe's treasury at risk. In other words, Plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that Curry was acting for himself, not for the Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this Opinion and Order I, the Court will address the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1) Defendants American Web Loan, Inc., AWL, Inc., and MacFarlane's (\"AWL Defendants' \" or \"AWL's\") joint Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, Doc. 72;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2) Defendant Curry's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, Doc. 85;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3) Defendant Sol Partners' (\"Defendant Sol's\") Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, Doc. 86;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   4) AWL Defendants' Motion to Transfer Venue, Doc. 70;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   5) Defendants Curry and Sol's Motion to Transfer Case, Doc. 83;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   6) AWL Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration, Doc. 74; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   7) Defendants Curry and Sol's Motion to Compel Arbitration, Doc. 84;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   each of these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(\"Middlemarch\"), DHI Computing Service, Inc. d/b/a GOLDPoint (\"GOLDPoint\"), Sol Partners, Inc. (\"Sol\"), and John Doe Defendants (1-100), have pleaded the sovereignty of the Otoe-Missouria Indian Tribe (the \"Tribe\") as a defense to allegedly imposing usurious interest rates on short-term loans issued to individuals throughout the United States. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Altogether, Plaintiffs' complaint alleges nine (9) different causes of action against the various defendants.

At this hearing, Defendants called two witnesses, John Shotton, the Chairman of the Otoe-Missouria Tribal Counsel, and Mark Curry. Hearing Transcript, Day 1, at 7:4-5, 7:13-16, 70:16-117 (February 5, 2019).

On the second day of the hearing, counsel for AWL Defendants, Medley Defendants, Middlemarch Defendants, DHI, and Plaintiffs presented oral arguments. Hearing Transcript, Day 2, (February 6, 2019). Having reviewed the papers and considered the evidence and arguments in this case, the Court\n   <strong>\n    RULED\n   </strong>\n   from the bench.

Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Federal district courts are courts of limited subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Exxon Mobil Corp. v.

Therefore, a court must generally dismiss a claim against a defendant if the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear the dispute. However, unlike a traditional motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction concerning diversity or federal question jurisdiction, a motion to dismiss based on sovereignty can be overcome by consent.\n   <em>\n    Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v.

The Tribe\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Tribe is a federally-recognized Indian tribe located in Red Rocks, Oklahoma. Doc. 73-1 (\"Shotton Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 2, 13. Since the early 1700s, the Tribe has struggled to maintain its sovereignty due to western expansion, the spread of disease, and federal laws which forced the Tribe to relocate and alter its primarily hunter-gatherer lifestyle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-13. Because of the rural location of the Tribe, the Tribe has faced challenges employing its members and generating enough revenue to fund its government operations and provide services to its members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Tribal Regulatory Structure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As a separate sovereign, the Tribe operates under its own constitution. In 1984, the Tribe adopted and ratified its constitution to establish a seven-member governing body, called the Tribal Council, to perform executive and legislative functions for the Tribe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16; Doc. 73-2 (\"Tribal Const.\"). The Tribal Council members serve three-year staggered terms, and elections are held each November.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. The Tribal Council has the authority to \"transact business and otherwise speak on behalf of the Tribe ... [and] appoint subordinate committees and representatives and delegate to them any of the Tribal Council's powers.\" Tribal Const. Art. VIII, Sect. 1. In 2006, the Tribal Council passed an act creating the Otoe-Missouria Development Authority (\"OMDA\"). Doc. 294-4. One of the purposes for creating the OMDA was, in relevant part, to \"provide for the orderly creation and management of tribal business enterprises.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Beginning of Tribal Lending Operations and Creation of American Web Loan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After creating the OMDA, the Tribe began generating revenue by operating casinos. Doc. 250-5. However, the Tribe's revenue steadily dropped after other casinos, including one in a neighboring state, opened and began to increase competition. Doc. 246 at 3; Doc. 250-1 \u00b6 37. The Tribe's chairman John Shotton (\"Shotton\") first learned about online lending through other tribes in Oklahoma. Doc. 250-3 (\"Shotton Depo.\") at 45-46, Depo. Tr. 176:15-177:8. In the beginning of 2009, Shotton was introduced to Mark Curry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Approximately one year after his meeting with Curry, Shotton and the Tribal Council created the Consumer Finance Services Regulatory Commission to regulate the Tribe's lending operations. Doc. 249-7. Subsequently, the Tribal Council passed a resolution adopting the American Web Loan Act (the \"AWL I Act\"). Doc. 73-7 (\"AWL I Act\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The stated purpose of the Act was to organize American Web Loan, Incorporated\n   (\"AWL I\") and operate AWL I as a tribal corporation \"for the purpose of providing revenues with which the Tribe may address other pressing matters of public health, safety, and welfare, or other tribal purposes.\" AWL I Act, at 4, \u00a7 201. The AWL I Act described AWL I as a \"sub-agency of the Tribal Council and an agency of the Tribe\" and created a separate Board of Directors of five (5) members, at least three (3) of whom were required to be members of the Tribe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, \u00a7\u00a7 202-03. The Tribe entered into a contract with American Web Loan Holdings (\"AWLH\") to procure services necessary for its lending operations, and AWLH sometimes contracted with MacFarlane Group to perform those services. Shotton Depo. at 7, 24:23-25:12. During this time, Curry owned both AWLH and MacFarlane Group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    iv. Tribe's Acquisition of MacFarlane Group\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Toward the end of its contract with AWLH, the Tribe sent Curry a notice that they intended to renegotiate the contract. Shotton Depo. at 47, 181:4-9. Curry presented the tribe with three options, one of which included the sale of MacFarlane Group to the Tribe by way of \"seller take back financing\" by which \"[t]he seller would structure the sale over a 5-year period and a 2nd [International Financing Entity] may provide debt funding for the tribe.\" Doc. 250-7. After lengthy negotiations, the Tribe elected this option and formed another tribal entity, Red Stone, to purchase MacFarlane Group, AWLH and a company named Bullet Hole (collectively the \"Newcos\") from Curry. Docs. 250-13 (\"Promissory Note\"). To obtain part of the funding for the purchase, Red Stone entered into a promissory note (the \"Note\") with three Delaware corporations, all controlled by Curry: First Infinity CM Holdings, Inc.; First CM Holdings, Inc.; and First Mountain Holdings, Inc. (collectively the \"Note Holders\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The other portion of funding was provided by entering a consulting agreement with Sol Partners (the International Financing Entity referred to above), again controlled by Curry. Doc. 250-15. Simultaneously, Red Stone also entered into a Security Agreement with the Note Holders to provide Note Holders with a priority security interest in all of Red Stone's \"right, title and interest in and to all of [Red Stone's] assets ... whether now or hereafter existing ... tangible or intangible ... now owned or hereafter acquired.\" Doc. 250-14 at 2. Each of the Note Holder entities and Sol Partners is owned by Curry. After the merger, the Tribe renamed American Web Loan Incorporated, AWL, Inc. (\"AWL II\"), and Red Stone transferred the Newcos along with its rights and liabilities under the Note and Security Agreement to AWL II. Doc. 250-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    v. Terms of Promissory Note\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Note ensures that the Note Holders are paid $ 2,018,154.86 monthly over the five-year term of the Note, plus ten percent (10%) interest. Promissory Note at 24. The Note also sets forth \"Governing Covenants\" whereby the note requires the Purchaser (now AWL II) \"to be managed by a board of directors or managers ... with six (6) members,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   of which three (3) are appointed by the majority of the Note Holders and the other three (3) are appointed by the Tribe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The only way for the Tribe to appoint a majority of members on the board is for the Tribe to first pay off eighty-five percent (85%) of the Note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This results in\n   three (3) out of six (6) of the board members being appointed by the Curry-owned entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Note also requires that actions taken by the board have the consent of at least four (4) members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Note considers any change to this leadership structure, except as otherwise provided, a \"default\" under the loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Other events of default include \"Adverse Tribal Government Action\" and an \"Adverse Change of Tribal Law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Note also requires, as discussed in more detail,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , that AWL II's Net Revenues are first paid toward operating expenses, which include the Note plus the amount due to Defendant Sol under the consulting agreement: $ 199,333.33 per month, wages and payroll taxes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Further, without consent of the Board, the Tribe is prohibited from: increasing compensation to any employee, hiring any new employee making more than $ 50,000 a year, unless that employee is replacing someone who made less than $ 100,000 annually; incurring, assuming, or guaranteeing any debt except as permitted by the Budget approved by the Board; making capital expenditures or commitments in excess of $ 100,000 unless in accordance with the Budget; or assigning, transferring, or distributing any material portion of its assets or any of the Equity Interests as defined by the Merger Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    vi. Tribe's Consulting Agreement with Sol Partners\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Under the consulting agreement, Sol Partners agreed to provide advice to AWL II's executive management in regard to its operation of AWL II and other reasonable services, including engaging in lobbying and advocacy efforts on behalf of AWL II, providing guidance and expertise in AWL II's lending operations, and advising AWL II's executive management team.

At the evidentiary hearing, Chairman Shotton testified that the Tribe's revenue before the acquisition of AWLH, MacFarlane Group and Bullet Hole amounted to only one percent (1%) of what Defendant Curry received. Additionally, Curry testified that before the Tribe acquired MacFarlane Group, he received an estimated total of $ 110 million in profits, while the Tribe received only $ 8 million. Based on the distribution of revenue and profits to the Tribe, it appears that the purpose of AWL II primarily serves to benefit Curry, rather than benefitting the Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Nevertheless, AWL argues that this factor should weigh in favor of sovereign immunity as the AWL I Act states that AWL II was established \"to generate long-term and sustainable revenue ... so that the Tribal Council may better provide essential government services to the Tribe's membership.\" AWL II Act, \u00a7 204. AWL I had a similar purpose of providing revenue to address matters of public health, safety, and welfare for the Tribe. Doc. 73-7 \u00a7 201. AWL contends that AWL II functions to serve this purpose. In support of this point, AWL indicates that fifty percent (50%) of the dividends that the Tribe receives goes to the Tribe's general fund to help fund various educational and social programs, and fifty percent (50%) of the funds goes to the OMDA, which helps run the Tribe's other economic activities that\n   provide job opportunities and promote economic development for the Tribe. Doc. 246 at 19. AWL argues that the overall percentage of tribal employees employed by AWL II compared to outside employees is irrelevant to this consideration. Notwithstanding their argument, AWL notes that twenty percent (20%) of the employees that work from AWL II's Oklahoma location are \"enrolled in or affiliated with the Otoe-Missouria Tribe.\" Doc. 246 at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that while the tribal entities have a stated purpose to promote self-governance, the entities have generated little revenue for the Tribe compared to what non-members receive, there are few jobs for tribal members, and the entities \"primarily serve to enrich Curry and other non-tribal individuals and entities.\" Doc. 298-1 at 42. Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   which found that this factor weighed against sovereign immunity when a tribal lending agency's promissory note limited the funds available to the tribe to five percent (5%) of the monthly revenue for the tribal entity, and the tribal entity did not employ many members of the Tribe.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527037\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/329/248/#p269\">\n    329 F.Supp.3d at 275-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, Plaintiffs contend that the Tribe receives only 3.6% of the revenue generated by AWL II and that the Note ensures that the Curry entities (Sol and the Note Holders) receive $ 4,000,000.00 per month, not including any salary that Curry is separately paid as a board member or CEO of AWL II. This, Plaintiff argues, is in stark contrast to the\n   <em>\n    Breakthrough\n   </em>\n   entity, which provided one hundred percent (100%) of its revenue to various tribal services. Plaintiffs also highlight that: AWL II employs fifty people, of whom only six are members of the Tribe; neither Red Stone nor RS, LLC, who collectively employ 137 employees, employ a single member of the Tribe; and that the three tribal board members receive substantially greater compensation than other individuals employed by AWL II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   While it does appear that the Tribe receives some benefit, Plaintiffs' arguments are persuasive.

Thus, the Tribe could not effect a change without having at least one Curry-appointed member agree. Moreover, the Note has several requirements that undermine any Tribal autonomy notwithstanding the presence of three members on the board. For example, the Note requires that the tribal entity appoint three members from Curry's entities until the loan is eighty-five percent (85%) paid off, or the entity would be considered in \"default.\" Additionally, Curry, a non-tribal member, serves as both CEO and board member of AWL II; owns all the Note Holder entities that provided AWL II's loan; holds, through the Note Holder companies, a security interest in all of AWL II's assets; and owns Sol Partners with whom AWL II contracts to consult, at great expense, upon a substantial portion of AWL II's functions. All of these positions allow Curry to exercise authority over AWL II's day-to-day functions. The Tribe's autonomy is further limited by provisions in the Note which deem the tribal entity in default if there is any \"Adverse Tribal Government Action\" or \"Adverse Change of Tribal Law.\" These provisions weigh against any argument that the Tribe exercises meaningful control over AWL II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   AWL argues that the Tribe \"is [AWL II's] sole shareholder, operator, and regulator\" and that the power shared between the tribal officials and \"industry experts\" is equal, such that at least one Tribal member must consent for board action to occur.

First, Plaintiffs argue that they were never shown the loan documents, nor were they advised of key terms, including the purported arbitration provisions, prior to signing their loan agreements. Second, Plaintiffs allege that the Arbitration Agreement is invalid and unenforceable. Docs. 75, 112. With regard to the validity of the Arbitration Agreement, Plaintiffs argue that American Web Loan's Arbitration Agreement is unconscionable for the same reasons articulated by the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Hayes v.

Doc. 112 at 19, n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   This case is analogous to the previous cases decided by the Fourth Circuit, and Plaintiffs' arguments on this point are\n   persuasive. While the Loan Agreement does contain a solitary mention that it is governed by \"Tribal Law and such federal law as is applicable under the Indian Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution,\" the subparagraph titled \"Applicable Law and Judicial Review of the Arbitrator's Award\" states, in bold caps, \"\n   <strong>\n    THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY TRIBAL LAW,\n   </strong>\n   \" and goes on to explain that \"the arbitrator\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   apply Tribal Law and the terms of this Agreement, including this Agreement to Arbitrate and the waivers included herein.\" Doc. 75-2 at 17. The \"Applicable Law and Judicial Review\" subparagraph explains that the parties have a \"right to judicial review in a Tribal court of (a) whether the findings of fact rendered by the arbitrator are supported by substantial evidence and (b) whether the conclusions of law are\n   <em>\n    erroneous under Tribal Law\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184189\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/765/#p778\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even within its opt-out provision, the Loan Agreement provides that \"in the event that you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, any disputes\n   <em>\n    shall nonetheless be governed under Tribal Law\n   </em>\n   and must be brought within the court system of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Considering the provisions cited, it appears, that here, as in\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   , that the Plaintiffs were forced to \"renounce wholesale the application of any federal law to plaintiffs' federal claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   There are three additional factual grounds for invalidity of the arbitration clause. First, the Court has found that AWL II, Curry, and the entities he controls are not arms of the Tribe, as set forth in the contract document. The degree of control exercised by Curry individually, as CEO of AWL II and through the other entities that he controls, renders the Tribe an arm of Curry in the functioning of the lending scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Second, while the contract documents state that Tribal law applies universally to the exclusion of Federal (and State) law, it adopts the Federal ESIGN statutes in support of electronic signatures' role in the enforcement of the loans. This is another example of Curry's misplaced attempts to use the sovereign immunity at once as a sword and as a shield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Third, there is clear conflict between the functioning of the arbitration clause and the provision in the promissory note that a change in Tribal law or adverse governmental action, as broadly defined in the Promissory Note, is a condition of default upon the Note. An arbitrator's decision or an appellate process that results in a decision in favor of a borrower likely constitutes a change in Tribal law or adverse Tribal government action that would trigger a default on the Tribe's Note payable to the Curry entities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Promissory Note at 2. Thus, the Note creates a clear conflict of interest for a tribal arbitration process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the Motion to Compel Arbitration as it appears that the Arbitration Provision is unconscionable under Fourth Circuit precedent, invades the governance of the Tribe, and creates a conflict of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The evidence presented shows that instead of acting as an \"arm of the tribe,\" Curry and his entities were merely paying a contingent royalty to use the Tribe's immunity. The degree of control that Curry wielded over the scheme demonstrates that this was truly his scheme, rather than one controlled by the Tribe. While the Tribe was required to waive its immunity as to Curry, Curry seeks to use this immunity against the Plaintiffs. Such intentional avoidance of federal and state law is not a legitimate use of tribal immunity. Any argument by Defendants that they are otherwise\n   entitled to tribal immunity is without merit. Accordingly, the Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   1)\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   AWL Defendants' and Defendants Curry and Sol's Motions to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, Docs. 72, 85, 86;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   2)\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   AWL Defendants' and Defendants Curry and Sol's Motions to Transfer, Docs. 70, 83; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   3)\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   AWL Defendants' and Defendants Curry and Sol's Motions to Compel Arbitration, Docs. 74, 84.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The Clerk is\n   <strong>\n    REQUESTED\n   </strong>\n   to send a copy of this Order to all counsel of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   It is so\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    Responses to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification are due fifteen (15) days from the entry of this Opinion and Order.
