Tharp, Jr., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A group of self-described mom and pop investors brought a class action complaint in DuPage County Circuit Court against the defendants for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with investments in a mutual fund called \"KZSIX.\" The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to disclose their conflicts of interest relating to the fund, misrepresented KZSIX's susceptibility to market downturns, and transferred the plaintiffs' investments into KZSIX without the investors' affirmative and informed consent to do so. As a result of being invested in KZSIX, the investors allegedly lost millions of dollars and incurred fees that were far greater than industry norms. The defendants removed the case to this Court, contending that the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act (\"SLUSA\") requires both removal and dismissal of the lawsuit. Eight of the nine plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims without prejudice. Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, ECF No. 22. The remaining plaintiff, Theresa Portell, moved to remand, arguing that the lawsuit is based upon the mismanagement of an existing investment, not, as would be required for SLUSA preclusion, any material misrepresentation that induced investors to purchase, sell, or hold a security. Because the alleged misrepresentations and omissions of material facts are a linchpin of this suit and were made in connection with the purchase of the KZSIX shares, this case falls squarely within the ambit of SLUSA preclusion. Portell's motion to remand, ECF No. 17, is therefore denied and the defendants are granted leave to refile their motion to dismiss,\n   as to which the Court deferred consideration pending resolution of the remand motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Portell invested funds with defendant Brookstone Capital Management, LLC (\"BCM\"), of which defendant Nadim Khalil \"Dean\" Zayed serves as president and CEO.

In 2014, Zayed formed defendant Kaizen Advisory (\"Kaizen\") and created a mutual fund called the \"Kaizen Hedged Premium Spreads Fund\" (\"KZSIX\"). Zayed owns at least 95% of Kaizen and is the sole beneficial owner of BCM.

More specifically, the complaint alleges that BCM (and by extension Zayed) incurred trading expenses under HiPOS, but the structure of the KZSIX investment allowed them to push those expenses onto the fund investors.

The conduct alleged, the court held, necessarily involved misrepresentations and omissions that could support a securities fraud claim because disclosure was critical to the plaintiff's claim whether based on state or federal law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And because the complaint set forth facts that could give rise to a securities claim premised on nondisclosure, the court of appeals held that it falls within SLUSA's ambit: \"A statement along the lines of 'we will act in your best interest' plus nondisclosure of a competing private interest is the basis of many securities actions,\" and after SLUSA's enactment, \"a plaintiff cannot proceed by omitting the securities theory.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 932.

A central premise of the complaint is that the defendants \"had numerous\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     undisclosed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   conflicts,\" \u00b6 2 (emphasis added), and that as a consequence they never received \"affirmative informed consent\" to waive those conflicts, \u00b6 110(a), and invested in KZSIX without \"authority\" to do so, \u00b6 110(d). To have \"authority\" to make the KXSIX transfers, the defendants would have had to \"make a full disclosure,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45; the claim that the investors failed to provide informed consent is necessarily a nondisclosure claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldberg\n   </em>\n   , 846 F.3d at 920 (Flaum, J., concurring) (\"to have 'authorized' the fees, the Bank would have had to have disclosed them to him; so the 'authorization' claim was still fundamentally tied to a material misrepresentation or omission\"). In addition, Zayed was allegedly motivated to engineer the transfer of investments from HiPOS to KZSIX (and presumably also motivated to omit sharing details about his alleged conflicts) because he was able to \"double-dip\" when earning fees from both BCM and Kaizen on funds invested in KZSIX due to his ownership of both entities. Zayed also was allegedly driven by a desire to push trading expenses onto the putative class members and test the viability of the KZSIX fund before promoting it to prospective clients. Portell further alleges that KZSIX was more susceptible to market volatility than BCM represented it to be. These alleged misrepresentations and disclosure omissions fall well within the ambit of SLUSA preclusion because \"[a] fiduciary that makes a securities trade without disclosing a conflict of interest violates federal securities law.

Her claims are grounded in allegations that the defendants' failures to accurately represent information, such as Zayed's conflicts of interest and KZSIX's ability to withstand market downturns, duped the investors into going along with the KZSIX transaction and had a materially negative effect on their investments.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holtz\n   </em>\n   , 846 F.3d at 934 (\"[The plaintiff] herself deems the [defendant]'s incentives material to investments; that's the basis of this suit.\"). In fact, Portell expressly describes at least some aspects of Zayed's conflict of interest as material: \"Zayed benefitted from the payment of both advisory fees and fund management fees from Plaintiffs and the Class.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     This is a material conflict of interest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ....\" Compl. \u00b6 84 (emphasis added). Where, as here, misrepresentations and omissions concerning the defendants' alleged conflicts of interest constitute the foundation of the plaintiff's claim for relief, they are plainly material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. \"In Connection with\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To fall within SLUSA's ambit, the relevant misstatements and omissions must have been made \"in connection with\" the purchase or sale of a covered security. It is as to this requirement that Portell makes her principal stand. She says that her complaint is limited to an assertion that the defendants \"mismanaged an existing investment rather than induc[ed] any action whether to purchase, sell, or hold a security.\" Mem. 2. The defendants, she maintains, \"were negligent in implementing a complex strategy that they were not qualified to employ in order to maximize fees rather than return on Plaintiff's investment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a threshold matter, even that description belies the negligence characterization Portell ascribes to her claims, because it concedes that the defendants were engaged in an undisclosed scheme to maximize their fees rather than the return to their investors. That's intentional conduct that sounds in fraud, not negligence; Portell alleges not that the defendants acted inadvertently but that the defendants acted for their own benefit without telling the investors that they were doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   More importantly, Portell's contention that \"these claims simply boil down to Defendants['] negligence in employing a complex investment scheme,\" Mem. 7, ignores that the putative class members were not invested in that scheme until the defendants transferred their investments from another fund. Those transfers are alleged in the complaint to have been effected on the basis of misrepresentations and omissions (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , fraud). To invest the putative class members' money in the KZSIX fund, the defendants had to sell the investment in HiPOS and purchase shares in the KZSIX fund. Portell has not disputed that the securities that the defendants sold to exit the HiPOS investment or the securities purchased to enter the KZSIX investment were covered securities. Indeed, Portell alleges that KZSIX was an \"open fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,\" Compl. \u00b6 53, which meets the statutory definition of a covered security under SLUSA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(b)(2) (\"A security is a covered security if such security is a security issued by an investment company that is registered ... under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\"). Portell's unsupported contention that \"[t]here is no allegation in the Complaint regarding the purchase or sale of a security,\" Reply 1, is simply wrong. Although the putative class members did not personally place the KZSIX transaction, the defendants placed it as their agent after giving them the option to opt out. Defs.' Resp., Ex.

The complaint alleges that Zayed concealed his conflicts of interests from the investors \"at all times\" and that, specifically, Zayed had failed to make a full disclosure \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     [w]hen\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Zayed entered the trades for KZSIX on behalf of\" the investors. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45, 110, 122, 132 (emphasis added). And the July 2015 letter that contained various representations relating to the KZSIX investment-including\n   representations regarding KZSIX's ability mitigate losses during a market decline, which Portell alleges were untrue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 101-was sent to the investors about a month before the impending August 2015 KZSIX investment. Moreover, regardless of the timing of the alleged misrepresentations and omissions, the Supreme Court has interpreted the \"in connection with\" language of \u00a7 77p(b)(2) broadly, holding that even a decision to hold a security qualifies if the decision to continue holding the security is affected by the alleged fraud.\n   <em>\n    Dabit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p81\">\n    547 U.S. at 85-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p81\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So, even had the alleged misstatements and omissions followed, rather than preceded, the purchase of the KZSIX shares, they would still be subject to preclusion as having contributed to the investors' decision not to withdraw from that investment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This case is readily distinguished from\n   <em>\n    Gavin v.

In\n   <em>\n    Gavin\n   </em>\n   , the alleged \"fraud\" solely concerned a communication about how shareholders could exchange their shares of MediaOne, a company that had been merged into AT &amp; T, for shares of AT &amp; T. The Seventh Circuit held that the alleged fraud was not \"in connection with\" the purchase or sale of a security because the merger had been consummated before the alleged fraud, and the mechanical process of how to obtain the new shares, the Court held, had no more to do with the purchase or sale of a security (the merger) \"than if [defendant] had asked the MediaOne shareholders 'do you want your AT &amp; T shares sent to you by regular mail or by courier?' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730716\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/634/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730716\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/634/\">\n    at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But what is alleged here is not a misstatement about ministerial acts that were required to effect the transfer of HiPOS shares into KZSIX after investors had agreed to (or acquiesced in) that transaction but rather misstatements and omissions relevant to and contemporaneous with the decision about whether to accept the transfer.\n   <em>\n    Holtz\n   </em>\n   distinguished\n   <em>\n    Gavin\n   </em>\n   on precisely this basis,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   846 F.3d at 933, and\n   <em>\n    Gavin\n   </em>\n   itself made the point, noting that \"[t]his would be a different case from the standpoint of SLUSA had the MediaOne shareholders been induced by fraudulent representations by AT &amp; T to vote for the merger.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730716\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/634/\">\n    464 F.3d at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Portell's argument that the complaint doesn't allege that she was induced to invest in KZSIX takes us back to SLUSA's imperviousness to artful pleading. Portell contends that hers is really a negligence claim because it does not plead reliance and so would not support a securities fraud action under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5). As noted above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 8 n.6, that argument holds no water; \"a plaintiff cannot sidestep SLUSA by omitting allegations of\n   <em>\n    scienter\n   </em>\n   or reliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Holtz\n   </em>\n   , 846 F.3d at 930. SLUSA preclusion does not turn on whether federal law provides a cause of action. The Supreme Court expressly held in\n   <em>\n    Dabit\n   </em>\n   that SLUSA precludes not only state law class-action claims brought by plaintiffs who have a private remedy under federal law, but \"also pre-empts state-law class-action claims for which federal law provides no remedy.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p81\">\n    547 U.S. at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p81\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldberg\n   </em>\n   , 846 F.3d at 916 (contention \"that only state-law claims that overlap winning securities claims are affected\" by SLUSA is \"wrong\");\n   <em>\n    Holtz\n   </em>\n   , 846 F.3d at 933 (\"\n   <em>\n    Dabit\n   </em>\n   holds that SLUSA applies whether or not a federal securities theory would succeed.\"). SLUSA was designed to preclude securities class actions under any state law theory, not just those that are broad enough to subsume all of the requirements of a federal securities claim. If, as Portell argues, the complaint does not suffice to state a securities fraud claim under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5), but it still involves a misrepresentation or omission in connection with a securities transaction, that is a reason to conclude that the putative class claim is subject to SLUSA preclusion, not exempt from it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   SLUSA therefore authorizes removal of the complaint and the motion to remand is therefore denied. Portell's attempt to double-down on her remand motion by asserting that she should also be awarded fees because the removal was objectively unreasonable itself borders on the frivolous and is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Dismissal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court previously denied the defendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice to first address the remand motion, but denial of the remand motion seemingly also requires dismissal of this action. Title 15 Subsection 77p(c) authorizes removal when the lawsuit meets the criteria set forth in Subsection 77p(b), which requires dismissal. Having concluded that the allegations in the complaint meet the criteria set forth in Subsection (b), \"neither the district court nor the state\n   court may entertain [the action], and the proper course is to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276595\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/633/#p644\">\n    547 U.S. 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276595\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/633/#p644\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276595\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/633/#p644\">\n    165 L.Ed.2d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The dismissal required, moreover, is with prejudice. The Seventh Circuit has taken a skeptical view of dismissals that permit amendment of the complaint to remove allegations that would implicate the issue of whether there had been misrepresentations or omissions made in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, recognizing that \"almost all federal securities suits could be recharacterized as contract suits about the securities involved.\"\n   <em>\n    Holtz\n   </em>\n   , 846 F.3d at 930-31. In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the court of appeals further noted the problem with allowing amendments to SLUSA-precluded complaints:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [O]nce the case shorn of its fraud allegations resumes in the state court, the plaintiff-who must have thought the allegations added\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     something\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to his case, as why else had he made them?-may be sorely tempted to reintroduce them, and maybe the state court will allow him to do so. And then SLUSA's goal of preventing state-court end runs around limitations that the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act had placed on federal suits for securities fraud would be thwarted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861161\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/123/#p124\">\n    664 F.3d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). The\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   panel went on to hold that the forum manipulation rule applicable in removal cases required dismissal of the suit with prejudice following the SLUSA removal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861161\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/123/#p124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861161\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/123/#p124\">\n    at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (amendment of complaint \"to delete the passage that injected fraud into the case ... is contrary to the 'forum manipulation' rule recognized in\n   <em>\n    Rockwell Int'l Corp. v.

To the contrary, neither offered an opportunity to amend despite acknowledging that it might have been possible for the plaintiffs in those cases to have set forth claims that did not implicate misstatements and omissions. In\n   <em>\n    Holtz\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that \"Holtz would have a contract claim free of a securities component\" had she alleged that the Bank broke its promise by mistake, but affirmed the dismissal without opportunity to replead because she had failed to make such fraud-free allegations in the removed complaint. 846 F.3d at 932. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Goldberg\n   </em>\n   , Judge Flaum stated in his concurring opinion that the\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   panel (of which he was a member) did not address the question of whether SLUSA preclusion can be applied on a claim-by-claim basis, but nevertheless concluded that preclusion of the entire complaint was required because, although the plaintiff might have been able to plead a claim that did not involve a material misrepresentation or omission, he \"did not take this approach\" in the removed complaint. 846 F.3d at 920.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, it is also possible to imagine a complaint that does not involve misrepresentations or omissions. Portell has insisted (albeit unconvincingly) that her claim is really for negligence, not fraud, and a complaint that alleged only that the defendants negligently designed, tested, and managed the KZSIX fund, without relying on undisclosed conflicts of interest or otherwise implicating the information provided in connection with the KZSIX investment, might not fall within SLUSA's ambit. But that is not this complaint. As presented\n   here, the breach of fiduciary claims rely heavily on allegations of undisclosed conflicts of interest and lack of informed consent. And, for the reasons discussed, those claims are subject to SLUSA removal-which also appears to require dismissal of the putative class action complaint with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It bears noting that dismissal would not leave Portell without a remedy. If, after dismissal, she wishes to reassert any claims-even those that rely on the alleged misrepresentations and nondisclosures alleged her present complaint-she may do so in her own individual capacity; SLUSA simply precludes her ability to do so in a \"covered class action\"-that is, an action involving fifty or more identified plaintiffs acting in their individual capacities, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(f)(5)(B)(i)(I), or as a representative of other similarly situated individuals without regard to the size of the proposed class, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(f)(5)(B)(i)(II).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nielen-Thomas v.

A status hearing will be held on Friday, March 29, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. to address whether, in light of the denial of her remand motion, Portell seeks to contest dismissal of the putative class-action complaint. If Portell determines, in advance of the status hearing, that she does not wish to contest dismissal, per se, but wishes to appeal the denial of her remand motion, she may file a voluntary notice of dismissal with prejudice noting the reservation of her right to appeal the denial of her motion to remand. In the event of such filing, the status hearing will be stricken, the case will be terminated, and a final, appealable, judgment in favor of the defendants will be entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Portell's motion to remand [17] is denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The Court considers the entire July 2015 letter because it is central to Portell's claims and is both referenced in and attached to (in part) the complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin v.

Portell's characterization of\n    <em>\n     Spielman\n    </em>\n    as \"controlling\" is therefore inexplicable for reasons beyond the fact that cases from other circuits are not controlling on the courts of this circuit in any event.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <em>\n     Green v.

There, the Eighth Circuit held that fraud claims against a firm that provided stock quotes alleged not to have been, as advertised, \"real time\" quotes, was not subject to SLUSA preclusion because the complaint included no allegations that Portell or other putative class members \"used price information provided by the real-time quote service to purchase or sell any particular security.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9396125\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/590/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9396125\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/590/\">\n     at 597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It is unsurprising, then, that the court concluded that the alleged misrepresentations were not in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
