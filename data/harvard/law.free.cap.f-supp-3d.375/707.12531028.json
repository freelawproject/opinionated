On August 3, 2018, Defendant pleaded guilty to the charge. Defendant now requests this court to grant his Motion to Withdraw the Guilty Plea, Motion for Leave, and Motion to Dismiss the Indictment. (Dkt. No. 29). Defendant argues that the immigration court that issued the underlying order of deportation serving as the predicate for the illegal reentry charge lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the removal proceeding. Defendant largely bases his argument on the Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v.

No. 29) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant, a citizen of Mexico, entered the United States without obtaining legal status. While illegally in the United States, Defendant engaged in criminal conduct that led to his arrest and custody with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") on charges of unauthorized entry into the United States. On January 4, 2011, Defendant was served with a notice to appear in immigration court for a removal proceeding before an immigration judge. It is undisputed that the notice to appear did not include a time, date, or place for the removal proceeding. (Dkt. No. 31-2). Defendant signed the notice to appear and requested an expedited hearing. (Dkt. No. 31-2). Moreover, in a notice of rights and request for disposition Defendant admitted that he was in the United States illegally, conceded that he does not believe he faces any harm upon return to his country, and waived his right to a hearing before the immigration court. (Dkt. No. 31-3). On January 24, 2011, Defendant attended a deportation hearing before an immigration judge and was ordered deported. He waived any appeal (Dkt. No. 31-4) and was deported to Mexico the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 20, 2013, Defendant illegally re-entered the United States. Five years later, on June 1, 2018, immigration authorities found and detained Defendant near Laredo, Texas. On June 19, 2018, Defendant was indicted for illegal reentry into the United States, a felony, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On August 3, 2018, Defendant appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Diana Song Quiroga and pleaded guilty to the offense. Magistrate Judge Song Quiroga accepted the plea of guilty upon finding that Defendant's plea was made knowingly and voluntarily. Following the plea colloquy, the court ordered probation to prepare a presentence investigation report, and the period of time for review and objections to the presentence investigation report passed. Defendant was scheduled to appear before the court for sentencing on September 25, 2018. But the day before his sentencing hearing, Defendant requested a continuance to evaluate the possibility of obtaining relief under\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   . The Court granted the request and ordered deadlines for filing motions and responses. On November 1, 2018, Defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea and for dismissal of his indictment. The government responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Dkt. No. 29-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant argues that the 2011 deportation order is void because the immigration\n   court that issued it lacked \"subject-matter jurisdiction.\" Defendant relies on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , which held that a putative notice to appear is not a \"notice to appear\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) if it does not include the time and place of the removal proceeding (hearing). According to Defendant, because the 2011 notice to appear did not include time-and-place information, it is not a \"notice to appear\" as contemplated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). As a result, Defendant contends that the immigration court was not vested with subject-matter jurisdiction, the 2011 deportation order had no legal effect, and the prior deportation element under \u00a7 1326 is not met. And despite having pleaded guilty to the instant offense, Defendant asserts that he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) and the\n   <em>\n    Carr\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The court finds that the immigration court did not lack jurisdiction to conduct Defendant's deportation hearing or to issue the resulting deportation order. Moreover, the court is not persuaded that Defendant should be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty to the illegal entry charge under \u00a7 1326(d) or the\n   <em>\n    Carr\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Pereira\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\") provides that nonpermanent residents subject to removal (deportation) proceedings may be eligible for cancellation of those proceedings. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b.

Defendant argues that because\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   held that a putative notice lacking the time-and-place information is not a \"notice to appear\" under \u00a7 1229(a), this court must similarly conclude that a notice to appear lacking the time-and-place information is not a \"charging document\" for purposes of vesting the immigration court with \"subject-matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant posits that, absent a valid \"charging document,\" the immigration court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over his removal proceeding, and the 2011 order of deportation is thus a nullity. The crux of Defendant's argument is that this court should read\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   expansively to hold that a notice to appear that is defective for purposes of triggering the stop-time rule is defective for all purposes. Not so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant misapprehends the breadth of the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   decision. The Supreme Court took concrete and measured steps to ensure that its opinion would not be broadly interpreted or perceived as having general application. This court is bound by those admonitions. For example, the Court repeatedly expressed that it was addressing a \"narrow question.\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2110, 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court was careful not to examine the relationship between stop-time rule requirements to other statutory and regulatory requirements that address the purpose of the notice to appear in removal proceedings. In responding to arguments on whether time-and-place information for stop-time rule purposes is more crucial than other types of information required to be included in a notice to appear,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court stated that the \"dispositive question in this case is much narrower, but no less vital: Does a 'notice to appear' that does not specify the 'time and place at which the proceedings will be held,' as required by \u00a7 1229(a)(1)(G)(i), trigger the stop-time rule?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   decision is tied to the stop-time rule like a ship made fast to its mooring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is little space to argue its application to matters other than the stop-time rule. This creates too high a hurdle for the Defendant to clear with his argument that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   supports a finding that the immigration court in this case lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Defendant's 2011 removal proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Specifically, the Supreme Court did not address the jurisdiction of the immigration court in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This point is important because the authority of an administrative\n   agency to act is a threshold question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The question of whether a notice to appear triggers the stop-time rule becomes irrelevant if the immigration court lacked jurisdiction. Whether the immigration court had jurisdiction to act in the first instance was raised by the government in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   when it argued that the notice to appear bore the character of a \"charging document.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2116 n.7. The Supreme Court had the option to address the jurisdictional nature of the charging document but did not do so. If Defendant's argument is correct, the Supreme Court should have vacated the immigration court's decision on the basis that it acted outside its statutory authority by issuing the underlying deportation Order. Instead, the Supreme Court remanded to the immigration court, thereby implicitly recognizing that the immigration courts had continued jurisdiction over the proceeding. This court concludes that the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   decision offers little succor to the Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Defendant argues that subject-matter jurisdiction does not vest in the immigration court if the notice to appear lacks time-and-place information. (Dkt. No. 29 at 7-8) Defendant's argument implies that the jurisdiction of an immigration court over removal proceedings may be vested or withdrawn by the actions of the parties.

The court is not convinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant reads the regulations to mean that the immigration court lacks \"subject-matter jurisdiction\" until it is created by the filing of a charging document. This rests on the erroneous assumption that immigration courts derive subject-matter jurisdiction from DHS regulations. But, to be clear, the source of the immigration court's power to exercise legal authority over removal proceedings lies in the statute, \u00a7 1229a, and not in the regulation, \u00a7 1003.14. The statute and regulations demonstrate that the primary function of filing the notice to appear as a charging document is to commence a deportation proceeding. As a charging document, the notice to appear thus serves to provide information necessary to commence a deportation proceeding. The regulations do not indicate that a notice to appear that lacks time-and-place information cannot function as a charging document. Even if time-and-place information may not necessarily be available at the time of filing, once the time-and-place information becomes available, it is provided by the immigration court to both the government and the alien.

The record in this case shows that Defendant had ample opportunity to contest the immigration court's jurisdiction and was otherwise afforded due process. It is undisputed that Defendant received both the notice to appear and time-and-place information for the removal hearing, that he appeared at the hearing, and that he was represented by counsel.

Upon review, the court determines that none of the factors weigh in favor of the Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   First, Defendant asserts actual innocence, but the facts in this case belie that argument. Nothing in the record suggests that Defendant had any viable defense to the deportation proceedings. And the court also notes that Defendant entered into a stipulation for removal, which constitutes \"a conclusive determination of the alien's removability from the United States.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(d). This factor weighs against Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Second, the court finds that the government would be prejudiced if the motion to withdraw is granted. Significant government resources have already been expended in preparing this case for sentencing, and additional resources would be expended to re-litigate the underlying removal. The government is already under the heavy burden of prosecuting a large number of cases in this district, and requiring it to restart cases involving facts such as here would be prejudicial to the government. This factor weighs against Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Third, for the same reasons stated above for the second factor, the court finds that substantial delay would result by granting the motion to withdraw. This factor weighs against Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Fourth, the withdrawal of the guilty plea would result in substantial inconvenience to the court, particularly if a trial is necessary as judicial resources would need to be allocated to arrange for the trial. Fifth, Defendant concedes that he has been well-represented by counsel throughout his proceedings. Sixth, the facts and record demonstrate that the initial plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily. Seventh, allowing Defendant to withdraw his guilty plea would waste judicial resources as it would have made the plea colloquy inconsequential along with all the work undertaken in preparation for sentencing. Defendant has not offered valid justification for why he did not raise any jurisdictional argument until the day before sentencing. Nor has the court received information or credible argument that would reasonably lead it to believe that redoing this case would result in an outcome other than eventual deportation. All of the\n   <em>\n    Carr\n   </em>\n   factors, when considered under the totality of circumstances in this case, weigh against the Defendant.
