The First Circuit Court of Appeals, however, applies the legal standard pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) (\" Rule 59(e)\") to motions for reconsideration arising in the criminal context.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Burgos and Lozada's arguments in support of their motion for reconsideration are unavailing. Defense counsel fail to demonstrate that the Court's prior order is manifestly contrary to law, or that newly discovered evidence compels a different conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biltcliffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5921934\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/925/#p930\">\n    772 F.3d at 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court possesses \"broad equitable power to deny attorneys' fees (or to require an attorney to disgorge fees already received) when an attorney represents clients with conflicting interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodr\u00edguez v.

Burgos and Lozada's invocation of the Fifth Amendment demonstrates that they believed that disclosing information regarding their fee agreement could potentially subject them to criminal liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defense counsels' personal interests were separate and potentially divergent from Mulero's interests. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the fee agreement between Mulero, Burgs and Lozada created a conflict of interest\n   <em>\n    ab initio.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This Court will not allow Burgos and Lozada to be compensated with fees received during a representation tainted by a conflict of interest.
