Frequent reapplication and saturation are unnecessary. Do not apply more than three times per day.\" Plaintiff claims that these labels are incorrect and misleading because Off!

Registration of Off! Clean Feel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The complaint alleges that Off! Clean Feel is a product that Defendant manufactured and represents to be an \"insect repellent\" that \"repels mosquitoes\" and provides \"effective protection from mosquitoes.\" (Dkt. 1 (\"Complaint\" or \"Compl.\") \u00b6 2.) The product's label instructs consumers to: \"Reapply every 3-4 hours. Frequent reapplication and saturation are unnecessary. Do not apply more than three times per day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) Unlike other personal repellents distributed by Defendant, Off! Clean Feel is a deet-free formulation, and instead contains the active ingredient picaridin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 19 Ex. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Off! Clean Feel is registered with the EPA and bears EPA Reg. No. 4822-536. (Dkt. 19 Ex. A.) The EPA initially approved the registration and label in 2001.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA New Pesticide Fact Sheet, at 1,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/registration/fs_PC-070705_01-May-05.pdf. The label approved by the EPA included the following statements: \"Effective protection from mosquitoes, biting flies and fleas\"; \"Repels insects for up to 3 to 4 hours.\" (Dkt. 9 Ex. B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In Off! Clean Feel's registration, Defendant submitted to the EPA data from field studies of the product regarding its effectiveness at repelling mosquitoes. On April 17, 2000, the EPA entomologist who reviewed the data found it to be acceptable and to support a mosquito repellency claim of 3-4 hours for the label. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. C.) Laboratory studies were also submitted to support and supplement the field studies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Subsequently, Defendant sought an amendment to Off! Clean Feel's label to\n   add a claim of repellency to mosquitoes that may carry the West Nile Virus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. D.) On January 25, 2006, the same EPA entomologist who had reviewed efficacy data in 2000 concluded: \"The existing data and published studies support a WNV [West Nile Virus ] claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 18, 2016, the EPA approved another amendment to the Off! Clean Feel label to add claims of repellency against mosquitoes that may carry the Dengue virus and the Zika virus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. E.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Effectiveness of Off! Clean Feel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Off! Clean Feel is a \"complete sham\" and that contrary to its labeling, does not repel mosquitoes. An independent laboratory testing, commissioned by Plaintiff's counsel in early 2018, revealed that Off! Clean Feel was ineffective in repelling Aedes mosquitoes and Culex mosquitoes-the two most common species of mosquitoes found in the United States. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-6.) Off! Clean Feel failed the independent laboratory testing almost immediately-within half an hour of application, all of the test subjects were bitten by both species of mosquitoes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2016, Consumer Reports also tested Off! Clean Feel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) The subjects were bitten by Aedes and Culex mosquitoes within one hour after application, leading Consumer Reports to conclude that Off! Clean Feel exhibited \"poor performance\" at repelling mosquitoes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff purchased Off! Clean Feel from a Duane Reade store located in New York City in the summer of 2016 for approximately $ 7. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Prior to purchase, Plaintiff carefully read the Off! Clean Feel bottle's labeling, including the representations that it is an \"insect repellent,\" that it \"repels mosquitoes,\" and that it provides \"effective protection from mosquitoes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff believed these statements to mean that Off! Clean Feel would repel mosquitoes and relied on them-he would not have purchased Off! Clean Feel at all, or would have only been willing to pay a substantially reduced price for Off! Clean Feel, had he known that these representations were false and misleading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff used the product as directed, but it did not provide effective production from mosquitoes, as advertised.
