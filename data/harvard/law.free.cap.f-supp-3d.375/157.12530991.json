(Docket No. 195 at pp. 6, 8, 70-71.) Serrano drove Valent\u00edn and Mir\u00f3 to Aqua Marina Street in Ponce, passing in front of Herol Caf\u00e9, also known as \"La Tumba,\" three times within four minutes. (Docket No. 222 at pp. 57-60.) After the third pass, Serrano stopped his BMW approximately 500 feet from La Tumba and \"made as though he was looking for something in the trunk\" while Valent\u00edn and Mir\u00f3 exited the vehicle and walked toward La Tumba. (Docket No. 195 at pp. 70-71.) Valent\u00edn and Mir\u00f3 wore handkerchiefs covering their faces as they approached the establishment. (Gov. Ex. 1G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Outside La Tumba, Valent\u00edn brandished a firearm and Mir\u00f3 brandished a knife, and they announced a robbery. (Gov. Ex. 1G.) They demanded money. (Docket No. 195 at p. 29.) The owner of La Tumba, who was sitting at a table outside the establishment playing dominos with three other men, placed money from La Tumba's sales on the table.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 28-29. An individual sitting at the domino table with the owner removed a chain from around his neck and handed the chain to Mir\u00f3. (Gov. Ex. 1G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Valent\u00edn entered the billiards area of La Tumba and Mir\u00f3 stood watch outside. (Gov. Exs. 1B and 1G.) Valent\u00edn encountered Roberto Medina-Mariani (\"Medina\"), an off-duty police officer, along with Medina's friend. (Docket No. 194 at p. 12.) Valent\u00edn aimed the firearm at Medina and his friend and demanded that they surrender their belongings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 12-13. Medina's friend surrendered Medina's cellular device, and Medina \"put up his hands\" and \"took out the money he had in his pocket,\" placing the money on the billiards table.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 12. Medina attempted to exit La Tumba, but Valent\u00edn \"pulled him by his shirt ... back into the establishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13. Medina then took out his own firearm and shot Valent\u00edn several times, wounding Valent\u00edn. (Gov. Ex. 1B.) Valent\u00edn shot back, mortally wounding Medina.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the first shots, Mir\u00f3 sprinted from La Tumba in the direction of Serrano's BMW. (Docket No. 195 at p. 30.) Valent\u00edn followed, running from La Tumba with hunched posture. (Gov. Ex. 1A.) Valent\u00edn fired shots toward La Tumba as he retreated\n   to the BMW. (Docket No. 195 at pp. 7-8, 36.) The owner of La Tumba took possession of Medina's firearm and returned fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 32. Valent\u00edn and Mir\u00f3 entered the BMW and Serrano sped off toward Jardines del Caribe in Ponce.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 9; Docket No. 222 at pp. 64-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the way to Jardines del Caribe, Serrano \"hit a hole and got a flat tire,\" but ultimately arrived at Jardines del Caribe. (Docket No. 222 at p. 46.) During the drive, Valent\u00edn was \"saying that he was dying.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At Jardines del Caribe, Serrano and Mir\u00f3 left a wounded Valent\u00edn on 19th Street at the side of the road.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 64. Serrano parked the BMW on 21st Street and called his mother, who picked him up at a nearby bridge and drove him back to the Dr. Pila Public Housing Project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 47-48, 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Serrano returned to Jardines del Caribe with his brother and his girlfriend. (Docket No. 195 at p. 74.) Serrano used rags to clean Valent\u00edn's blood from inside his BMW and discarded the bloodied items behind the wall of an abandoned house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 48-50, 66-68. Later, police officers observed Serrano, shirtless, changing the tire of the BMW. (Docket No. 194 at p. 69.) The officers took Serrano, his brother, and his girlfriend into custody.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, on the date of the robbery and the shooting, Puerto Rico Police had set up cones and a perimeter around La Tumba and were working with forensics and homicide specialists at the scene. (Docket No. 193 at pp. 27-31; Docket No. 195 at pp. 67-68; Gov. Exs. 71, 115.) Medina's body remained inside the establishment while the officers investigated the crime. (Gov. Ex. 71.) No sales were made at La Tumba after the robbery and shooting that day or later. (Docket No. 195 at p. 44.) The robbery halted La Tumba's commercial activities on the very day of the robbery and shooting, and the establishment never reopened after the attack. (Docket No. 195 at pp. 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The next morning, FBI agents interviewed Serrano at the Ponce Drug Division. (Docket No. 195 at p. 69.) Serrano admitted that: (1) he left the Dr. Pila Public Housing Project with Valent\u00edn and Mir\u00f3 and drove to La Tumba; (2) he parked down the street from La Tumba; (3) he \"made as though he was looking for something in the trunk\" while Valent\u00edn and Mir\u00f3 approached La Tumba; (4) he heard gunshots, after which Valent\u00edn and Mir\u00f3 returned to the BMW; (5) he abandoned Valent\u00edn, wounded, on the side of 19th Street in Jardines del Caribe; (6) he cleaned Valent\u00edn's blood from the BMW; and (7) Mir\u00f3 took the firearm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 70-75; Docket No. 196 at pp. 4-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 15, 2018, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment that charged Serrano, Valent\u00edn, and Mir\u00f3 with: (1) conspiring to interfere with commerce by robbery in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" section 1951\"); (2) interference with commerce by robbery in violation of section 1951 ; (3) discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence resulting in death, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j) ; and (4) discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A)(iii).

Serrano's closing argument addressed Serrano's lack of intent, innocent\n   motive, innocent action, and lack of knowledge. (Docket No. 223 at pp. 63-69.)
