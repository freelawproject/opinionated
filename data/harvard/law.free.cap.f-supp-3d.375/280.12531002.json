Because of its vast network of foreign service officers, the Department is in a position to report effectively on local country conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Ex. 331 at 2. Thus, DHS will contact the Department of State \"to initiate their own process of putting together a country conditions assessment\n   and generally a recommendation ....\" Prelogar Dep. Tr. at 31:11-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The local U.S. Embassy, under the direction of the local ambassador, provides the Department of State with an analysis of country conditions for the Secretary's consideration. PL Ex. 331 at 2; Trial Tr. at 114:11-115:7 (Posner). As former Ambassador James Nealon testified, \"[A]n ambassador's input carries a tremendous amount of weight in the Department of State.\" Nealon Dep. Tr. at 109:8-10. Thus, the Department of State normally gives great deference to the factual reports prepared by the local Embassy. Pl. Ex. 331 at 2-3; Trial Tr. at 115:20-116:4 (Posner).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Once the local Ambassador and foreign service officers complete the report, they send it to the applicable regional bureau and policy bureaus to prepare a document-the Secretary of State Memorandum-for the Secretary's review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 114:18-115:18 (Posner). The Bureau for Western Hemisphere Affairs (\"WHA\"), is the regional bureau for Haiti.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115:19-21 (Posner). Once the regional and policy bureaus complete the Secretary of State Memorandum, the Embassy and applicable bureaus review it and must approve it before submitting it to the Secretary of State.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126:24-131:17 (Posner);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. Ex. 145 at 6. The Department of State considers the Embassy's clearance and approval particularly important because the Embassy plays a primary role in gathering information on country conditions. Trial Tr. at 126:24-131:17 (Posner). If an embassy, regional bureau, or policy bureau disagree on a recommendation to the Secretary, the parties typically produce a \"split memo\" to present their competing positions to the Secretary. Pl. Ex. 331 at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 144:15-24 (Posner).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Department of Homeland Security\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   DHS engages in well-established practices and considers a number of factors to aid the DHS Secretary in making a well-informed, evidence-based decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    a. General Practices DHS Employs in Making TPS Determinations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Within DHS, the \"process for gathering information to inform decision makers relating to the periodic review for TPS\" begins with reaching out to the Refugee Asylum and International Operations (\"RAIO\") directorate, a subdivision of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"). Prelogar Dep. Tr. at 31:1-8. RAIO contains a country conditions unit staffed by career civil servants specializing in country conditions research.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 232:6-233:23; Trial Tr. at 233:15-23 (Rodriguez). RAIO creates a \"country conditions assessment for the relevant country,\" which informs the Secretary's TPS determination. Prelogar Dep. Tr. at 31:9-10. This Report, also known as the \"RAIO Report,\" is a fact-based assessment used to determine whether TPS should be extended, redesignated, or terminated. Trial Tr. at 233:15-23, 233:9-14 (Rodriguez). The Report \"provide[s] an assessment about the country conditions and whether the statutory conditions continue to be met with respect to a TPS designation.\" Prelogar Dep. Tr. at 34:7-10. Because it contains the \"factual predicate\" for USCIS's recommendation to the DHS Secretary, the Report plays a crucial role in the Secretary's decision to extend or terminate TPS. Trial Tr. at 233:7-14 (Rodriguez).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In addition, the Office of Policy and Strategy (\"OP &amp; S\"), another subdivision within USCIS, drafts a Decision Memorandum, also called a \"Director Memo,\" containing USCIS's recommendation regarding a foreign nation's TPS designation and provides the final report to the Secretary. Kovarik Dep. Tr. at 28:12-16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Prelogar\n   Dep. Tr. at 31:16-22 (describing how the RAIO Report is used to create the Director Memo); Trial Tri at 235:15-21 (Rodriguez) (same). The Director Memo is a \"distill[ed]\" version of the more comprehensive RAIO Report. Trial Tr. at 235:20-21 (Rodriguez). The Office of the Executive Secretary, another office within USCIS, \"would distribute a document for review by various entities within USCIS.... They would provide the administrative function of circulating it to the right people who needed to review it.\" Anderson Dep. Tr. at 133:11-21. Once drafted, OP &amp; S sends the Director Memorandum to the Direction of USCIS to send to the DHS Secretary. Kovarik Dep. Tr. at 28:12-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The purpose of the Director Memorandum is to \"give[ ] the secretary everything that they need\" to make an informed decision on whether to designate, extend or terminate TPS. Trial Tr. at 235:20-21 (Rodriguez). Because the DHS Secretary holds a \"tremendous number of responsibilities,\" she looks \"to the USCIS, to the director, to [its] staff, as the experts on Temporary Protected Status.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 235:6-14 (Rodriguez).

Factors DHS Considers in Making TPS Determinations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Former Director Rodriguez testified extensively to the factors DHS and USCIS have traditionally considered as part of TPS decisionmaking. According to Rodriguez, USCIS historically interpreted the term \"extraordinary and temporary conditions,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(1)(C), to require an analysis of conditions at the \"particular point in time when the adjudication is occurring\" that \"prevent nationals of that country from returning to the country in safety, which means significant threat to life or health.\" Trial Tr. at 248:30-249:12, 250:11-12 (Rodriguez). This includes, conditions \"not necessarily caused by,\" and conditions \"untethered\" to, the initial event that led to an initial TPS designation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 251:13-14, 252:6-14 (Rodriguez).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Under established practice, the USCIS Director and DHS Secretary generally consider many factors to determine whether it is safe for nationals to return to a country and whether the receiving country can absorb the return of TPS recipients, including but not limited to the number of TPS recipients, and issues of \"public safety, national security, healthcare, housing, [and] education\" in the receiving county.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 214:20-25 (Rodriguez). It was established practice that USCIS recommendations on TPS considered \"a broad range of issues, including food security, gender violence, stability of the Government, education, [and] healthcare.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 255:5-9 (Rodriguez). Consequently, the USCIS Director and DHS Secretary have historically considered \"intervening factors\" arising after a country's original TPS designation, such as subsequent natural disasters, issues of governance, housing, health care, poverty, crime, general security, and other humanitarian considerations, even if those factors lacked any connection to the event that formed the basis for the original designation. Pl. Ex. 330 \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Rodriguez testified he did not consider crime rates among TPS recipients during his tenure as USCIS Director. As Director Rodriguez explained, crime rates were not a factor because \"by definition, you do not qualify to receive TPS in the first place if you are a convicted criminal.... And if you are convicted while you were on TPS, your TPS would ordinarily be ... terminated ... based on that conviction. Trial Tr. at 255:25-256:6 (Rodriguez);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(c)(2)(B). \"[I]f somebody is convicted of a crime while they are on\n   TPS, ordinarily Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which is the enforcement agency within the Department of Homeland Security, ... would initiate proceedings ... to terminate their TPS[ ] and then to potentially place that person in deportation proceedings.\" Trial Tr. at 257:24-258:5 (Rodriguez).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     HAITI'S TPS DESIGNATIONS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

They contend \"[a]n injunction against the President is ... appropriate to ensure that the Secretary's new decision on whether to extend or terminate TPS for Haiti is based on a review of the proper statutory criteria and not prejudicial influence motivated by racial animus.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In balancing the weight of the interests to be served by injunctive relief against the intrusion into Executive affairs, the Court concludes, at this time, enjoining the President to ensure executive officials operate in accordance with the law is appropriate in this case and\n   well within the Court's power. The Government's comparison to\n   <em>\n    Mississippi\n   </em>\n   -where states that disagreed with the constitutionality of a law sought to enjoin the President from enforcing it-is inapposite. Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Mississippi\n   </em>\n   , injunctive relief against the President corrects unlawful conduct (rather than promotes it) and ensures the decision to extend or terminate TPS for Haiti is in accordance with the law. Plaintiffs cite numerous statements made by the President himself to support their respective claims in this action, and evidence within the administrative record reflects the influence of several senior White House officials.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Suppl.

Such involvement suggests enjoining the Secretary alone would not afford complete relief sought by Plaintiffs. Moreover, any intrusion into executive function would be minimal; the Court is not directing the President or any executive official to reach a certain policy conclusion but rather to abide by the mandates of the APA, the TPS statute, and the Constitution. The United States is a government of laws, not of men.

Second, the evidence shows Acting Secretary Duke's decision was arbitrary and capricious because she departed from past agency practices without explanation and was improperly influenced by the White House. Third, the evidence shows Acting Secretary Duke's decision was pretextual and, accordingly, made in bad faith-the rationale she provided for her decision was not her real rationale. The Court concludes, however, Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of showing Acting Secretary Duke articulated a new substantive rule for evaluating TPS subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Where the DHS Secretary initially designates a foreign state for TPS under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(1)(C), as in this case, he or she must assess in determining whether the conditions continue to be met whether \"there exist extraordinary and temporary conditions ... that prevent ... nationals of the state from returning to the state in safety.\" Finally, if the Secretary determines a foreign state no longer meets the conditions for designation, the Secretary must terminate the designation by publishing notice in the Federal Register, including the basis for the determination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528852\" index=\"486\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/502/#p605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1254a(b)(3)(B).

Congress's use of the word \"shall\" in the periodic review and termination provisions of the statute evinces its intent to\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   the Secretary to follow the enumerated procedure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528852\" index=\"488\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/502/#p605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1254a(b)(3)(A)-(B) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528852\" index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/502/#p605\">\n    351 F.Supp.3d at 637-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding Section 6(c) of the Census Act \"mandatory where it applies\" based on the language of the statute, including the word \"shall\"). Moreover, Congress's use of \"shall,\" specifically in requiring the Secretary to \"review the conditions in the foreign state,\" evinces its intent that the Secretary undertake a periodic review grounded in fact-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , based on objective conditions in the foreign country and regardless of any government official's political motives-and in good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(3)(A).

But procedurally, the Secretary may not provide sham or pretextual justifications as the basis for the decision under the statute, and the Secretary must review the conditions of the foreign state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   With these principles in mind, the Court turns to the parties' arguments. Plaintiffs claim the Secretary violated the statutorily-mandated procedure for termination of a TPS designation on several grounds. Pl. Br. at 88. First, they argue \"the Secretary did not make the 'determination' required by the statute\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   , but instead carried out a preordained decision to terminate Haiti's TPS designation for reasons unrelated to the statutory criteria and then manufactured support for that outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528852\" index=\"494\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/502/#p605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, Plaintiffs argue Acting Secretary Duke violated the TPS statute because \"the review process was a sham designed to create a pretext for terminating TPS for Haiti.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528852\" index=\"495\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/502/#p605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 100. Second, Plaintiffs contend the Secretary violated the TPS statute's \"directive concerning the procedures for termination\" because she failed \"to consider\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   current conditions to determine whether grounds for designation continued to exist and whether nationals could safely return to Haiti.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99-100. Rather, she considered only conditions related to the 2010 earthquake. Such an interpretation, Plaintiffs argue, is \"legally erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   Defendants, on the other hand, argue Acting Secretary Duke's decision \"was made in good faith, was evidence-based, and reasonably applied the criteria set forth in the TPS statute.\" Def. Br. at 55. They further argue Acting Secretary Duke did not apply a new standard but rather \"considered Haiti's conditions stemming from the originating conditions that triggered Haiti's TPS designation\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Haiti's overall current country conditions.\" Def. Reply at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim Acting Secretary Duke violated the TPS statute by failing to make a \"real merits determination\" and by instead issuing \"a pretextual edict,\" contravening the evidence-based review the TPS statute requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. at 89. Simply put, the justifications articulated in the January 2018 Federal Register Notice were not the agency's actual reasons for terminating Haiti's TPS. Plaintiffs have proffered significant evidence showing Acting Secretary Duke, DHS, USCIS, and the Department of State reverse engineered the TPS review process to achieve a desired political outcome: the termination of Haiti's TPS. Such an outcome-determinative process violates the mandatory periodic review process of the TPS statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   As described below, the evidence shows Acting Secretary Duke, the White House, and other Government agencies and officials undertook the TPS review process with the explicit goal of terminating TPS for Haiti. This includes direct evidence that Acting Secretary Duke sought to terminate TPS for Haiti, evidence of White House involvement, and evidence that Secretary Kelly foreshadowed an end to TPS for Haiti while simultaneously announcing an extension in 2017, laying the foundation for Acting Secretary Duke to terminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , there is significant evidence from the record linking Acting Secretary Duke directly to a desire to terminate TPS for Haiti. Acting Secretary Duke's handwritten notes-many of which are part of the\n   designated administrative record-indicate she sought to terminate TPS for Haiti regardless of her statutory obligation to conduct an interagency, fact-based review of the conditions in Haiti. Secretary Duke wrote she did not have a \"[r]ationale\" for terminating TPS for Haiti but instead \"need[ed] to rationalize conflicting info\" because \"all agree[d] [TPS] must end.\" Suppl. Admin. R. at 318. She stressed, \"Haiti TPS is dramatically different from the other three countries due to the limited duration of TPS. Haiti-7 years; Honduras and Nicaragua-19 years.... Separate out Haiti. They have been given a preview of what is likely to happen. Eight years is not the same as 20 years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 317-18. Acting Secretary Duke wrote she needed a \"plan for a decision\" and to \"foreshadow [TPS] will end.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Secretary Duke sought to terminate TPS for Haiti in part due to President Trump's \"America First\" strategy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 318; Pl. Ex. 179 at 1 (\"The TPS program must end for these countries soon .... This conclusion is the result of an America first view of the TPS decision.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   Moreover, extensive pressure from the White House to terminate TPS impeded Acting Secretary Duke's statutory obligations to conduct an interagency, fact-based review process. Acting Secretary Duke met with Chief of Staff Kelly regarding her decision on TPS \"with specific reference to Haiti\" as early as October 19, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Priv. Prod. at 1033. White House officials formally recommended terminating TPS for Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador at the November 3, 2017 Principals Small Group Meeting called to \"coordinate the conditions and process for terminating temporary protected status,\" regardless of country conditions. Suppl. Admin. R. at 127. The officials pressured Acting Secretary Duke to terminate TPS, not because of Haiti's country conditions, but because of their belief that \"[e]xtending TPS for any or all of the four countries would prolong the distortion between the temporary protections that TPS was designed to provide and current circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129. Acting Secretary Duke's notes reveal at that meeting, Attorney General Sessions strongly advocated termination and pushed her to \"ha[ve] the guts to pull the trigger.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113-15. Pressure from the White House continued on through November 5, 2017, when White House officials Tom Bossert and Zack Fuentes suggested in the event Acting Secretary Duke cast the decision \"into the lap of [the] next secretary,\" she would be another \"gutless fed[eral] bureaucrat.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 283. They would have been \"extremely disappointed\" with such an outcome and did not want the decision to \"get to close to end of 2019 political and midterms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-372\">\n   Emails from Acting Secretary Duke to Chief of Staff Kelly further reveal the White House in fact influenced Acting Secretary Duke's decision making with respect to TPS at large. Acting Secretary Duke viewed her TPS decision as \"send[ing] a clear signal that TPS in general is coming to a close,\" and noted her \"decision is really just a difference in strategy to get to the President's objectives.\" Pl. Ex. 169. After a discussion with Bossert, Acting Secretary Duke wrote she changed the timeframe for termination of TPS for Nicaragua from 18 months to 12 months purely because \"of a strategy [she] was not previously aware of,\" and not because of the country conditions. Pl. Ex. 96. A White House official thanked her for that outcome. Pl. Ex. 165. Significantly, though some contact with executive officials is to be expected, White House influence is probative in claims of bad faith, particularly when such influence is a break from past practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tummino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3475478\" index=\"496\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/603/519/#p544\">\n    603 F.Supp.2d at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding a \"lack of good faith [was] evidenced by, among other\n   things ... pressure emanating from the White House\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the evidence shows Secretary Kelly foreshadowed the end of TPS for Haiti even when he made his decision to extend Haiti's TPS in May 2017, indicating a predetermined outcome for the next decision on TPS for Haiti. In late April 2017, leaked documents revealed to the press and public that Secretary Kelly intended to terminate TPS for Haiti and had been inquiring into criminality and welfare data, resulting in public backlash. In early May 2017, \"USCIS [was] told to redraft the Haiti TPS notice once again,\n   <em>\n    this time\n   </em>\n   to announce a 6-month extension [and] instruct[ed] [ ] not to announce a termination\n   <em>\n    at this point\n   </em>\n   , but to suggest in the notice somehow that it is likely to be terminated in 6 months and that the Haiti beneficiaries should get their affairs in order.\" Priv. Prod at 5206. Some officials expressed skepticism at this approach, noting: \"We are concerned how [the Secretary] could find Haiti to meet TPS conditions now but find in just a few months from now that it no longer does. Do the clients really believe conditions will improve over the current baseline over the next 4-6 months? Could extending now box [the Secretary] in for the next determination?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4623. These internal communications demonstrate the extent to which Defendants refashioned evidence- and fact-based memoranda to arrive at predetermined outcomes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   In accordance with this approach, when Secretary Kelly extended TPS for six months in November 2017, he, DHS, and USCIS warned TPS recipients \"to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States\" prior to the end of the next extension period. Suppl. Admin R. at 194;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   (describing the Haitian Government's ability to \"welcome the safe repatriation of Haitian TPS recipients\n   <em>\n    in the near future\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (requesting Haitian Government officials to \"take steps to prepare for the eventual end of its TPS designation\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 179-80 (\"During this 6-month extension, beneficiaries are encouraged to prepare for their return to Haiti in the event Haiti's designation is not extended again, including requesting updated travel documents from the government of Haiti.\"); Pl. Ex. 51 (encouraging TPS recipients \"to pack up\"). Officials, including then-Deputy Secretary Duke, privately recognized the agency likely would not extend TPS again after these warnings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Ex. 53 (highlighting Duke's statement there was \"[e]very expectation that Haiti may not be renewed again\"); Nealon Dep. Tr. at 27:12-22, 128:9-17, 129:5-130:10 (noting there was a \"general feeling that TPS ... for Haiti was going to be terminated\" by July 2017 based on discussions with Secretary Kelly).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   The manner in which Acting Secretary Duke, DHS, and the Department of State undertook the review process also strongly suggests the decision was pretextual. This includes evidence that: (1) Defendants manipulated the facts in the record to gradually minimize, omit, or deem unrelated to the hurricane \"negative\" information about Haiti; (2) Defendants changed their interpretation of the TPS statute; (3) Defendants intentionally edited the 2017 director memorandum to support the case for termination; (4) high-ranking officials directed staffers to uncover data they believed would weigh toward termination; and (5) the Department of State conducted a \"highly unusual\" process that departed from past practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Defendants' manipulation of the facts in the record are highly suggestive of a pretextual decision. Comparisons between the October 2017 RAIO Report, November 2017 Director Memorandum, and January 2018 Federal Register Notice\n   show the agencies gradually minimized, omitted, or deemed unrelated to the 2010 earthquake negative information about Haiti. Positive information, however tangential or isolated, became the sole focus and the stated basis for decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Admin. R. at 38-44, 51-68; Pl. Ex. 341. Indeed, whereas the October RAIO Report concluded Hurricane Matthew had done over $ 2.8 billion in damage in Haiti, the January 2018 Federal Register Notice did not mention Hurricane Matthew at all.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Admin. R. at 61,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pl. Ex. 341. Similarly, whereas the RAIO Report concluded Haiti's cholera epidemic \"remains ongoing and continues to place strain on Haiti's beleaguered public health system\" and that nearly 10,000 people had died from the disease, the Federal Register Notice noted only that the disease \"is currently at its lowest level since the outbreak began.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Admin. R. at 54-55,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pl. Ex.[341.

Admin. R. at 40,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pl. Ex. 341. The Court does not question the substantive verity of the Secretary's conclusions-but it considers the glaring editorial decisions, including the omission of obviously \"negative\" information, as further evidence Acting Secretary Duke sidestepped the review process required by the TPS statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Defendants departed from their past practice of considering all country conditions at the time of the adjudication, further suggesting the decision was pretextual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tummino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3475478\" index=\"497\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/603/519/#p544\">\n    603 F.Supp.2d at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding \"lack of good faith is evidenced by, among other things ... significant departures from the [Agency's] normal procedures and policies.\"). Prior to Acting Secretary Duke's decision, the DHS Secretary, DHS, and USCIS had a longstanding practice of considering all country conditions when undertaking the mandatory periodic review under the statute, regardless of their relation to the originating condition.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. at 248:30-249:12, 250:11-12, 251:13-14, 252:6-14 (Rodriguez) (describing the longstanding practice of evaluating conditions at the \"particular point in time when the adjudication is occurring\");\n   <em>\n    see also infra\n   </em>\n   (detailing the agency's change in practices in full).

In July 2017, Nielsen sought \"any information on the TPS registrants in terms of current jobs or education\" to push back on some of the Haitian Government's concerns about ending TPS. Pl. Ex. 355. After RAIO circulated its October 2017 country conditions report, officials, including Kathy Kovarik, directed staffers to further research and highlight \"positive steps that have been taken since [Haiti's] designation\" for TPS because, at the time, the draft Director Memorandum \"read[ ] as though we'd recommend an extension.\" Pl.

Robert Law's October 31, 2017 email requesting \"positive data on the current status of Haiti to bolster the recommendation to terminate TPS\" and instructing the staffer tasked to \"[b]e creative\" yields the same inference. Pl. Ex. 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   Secretary Kelly's directives to staff to search for criminality and welfare data provide further evidence the agency was fishing for reasons to terminate TPS for Haiti. Indeed, Secretary Kelly sought data showing extending Haiti's TPS would be contrary to the national interest. These factors are largely irrelevant to the Secretary's review under the statute because individuals with a felony conviction or two misdemeanor convictions are ineligible for TPS, and TPS beneficiaries may be ineligible for public benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254a(c)(2)(B), 1254a(f)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still, the TPS statute requires the Secretary to consider whether \"permitting the aliens to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the national interest of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3475478\" index=\"501\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/603/519/#p544\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1254a(b)(1)(C).

Tr. at 257:8-9; 339:20; Def. Br. at 40. It therefore follows that Secretary Kelly and others at DHS and USCIS sought this information in the hopes of finding that extending TPS would not be in the \"national interest\"-indeed, DHS officials said as much.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Priv.

Ex. 331 at 2-3; Trial Tr. at 115:19-116:4 (Posner). When another bureau within the Department of State disagrees with the Embassy, the bureaus present a split memorandum addressing the positions of all parties to the Secretary of State. Pl.

Here, although the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recommended extension and the regional bureau WHA recommended termination, the WHA failed to present the Embassy's perspective in its split memo to Secretary Tillerson, casting aside the views of the Embassy and thereby contravening longstanding State Department practices. See Trial Tr. at 125:22-126:23, 157:8-160:10 (Posner); Pl. Ex. 246. Inconsistent with past practices, DHS and the Department of State moved in lockstep to coordinate its review of Haiti's TPS in advance of Acting Secretary Duke's decision and after Secretary Tillerson's \"mistake[n]\" extension recommendation.

Consequently, the most recent January 2018 notice terminating TPS for Haiti fails to address any conditions untethered to the originating event, including a number of existing conditions that previously justified an extension of TPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   Plaintiffs presented a wealth of evidence of past practices at DHS to support their claim DHS departed from those practices. In his expert report, former USCIS Director Rodriguez noted the DHS Secretary and USCIS Director historically considered, among other things:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-406\">\n   intervening factors arising after a country's original TPS designation, such as subsequent natural disasters, issues of\n   governance, housing, health care, poverty, crime, general security, and other humanitarian considerations ...

At the injunction hearing, he testified USCIS historically interpreted \"extraordinary and temporary conditions\" to mean the country conditions in existence at the \"particular point in time when the adjudication is occurring\" because those contemporaneous conditions \"prevent nationals of that country from returning to the country in safety, which means significant threat to life or health.\" Trial Tr. at 248:30-249:12, 250:11-12 (Rodriguez). This includes, conditions \"not necessarily caused by,\" and conditions \"untethered\" to, the initial event that led to an initial TPS designation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"548\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C582\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"548\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C582\">\n    at 251:13-14, 252:6-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rodriguez).

Significantly, these documents show the decision to terminate was based solely on Haiti's recovery since the originating condition without consideration of current country conditions that may have been unrelated to the originating event-conditions that DHS and prior Secretaries consistently considered in rendering prior TPS decisions. The November 2017 Director Memorandum recommended termination because \"[a]ny\n   <em>\n    current issues\n   </em>\n   in Haiti are unrelated to the 2010 earthquake.\" Suppl. Admin. R. at 18.

Moreover, White House officials at a meeting with Secretary Duke, sought to \"coordinate the conditions and process for terminating temporary protected status\" because they believed \"[e]xtending TPS for any or all of the four countries would prolong the distortion between the temporary protections that TPS was designed to provide and current circumstances.\" Suppl. Admin. R. at 127, 129. Other members of the Executive Branch, such as Attorney General Sessions, impressed upon Secretary Duke she could not kick the decision down the road to the next Secretary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 113-15 (insisting Secretary Duke should \"ha[ve] the guts to pull the trigger\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 283 (noting officials would be \"extremely disappointed if [the decision was] kick[ed] into [the] lap of [the] next Sec[retary]\" and officials did not want the decision to \"get too close to end of 2019 political and midterms\"). Moreover, Chief of Staff Kelly suggested to Acting Secretary Duke \"work[ing] out a permanent solution with the hill\" factored into his \"thinking on Haiti.\" Pl. Ex. 184. He viewed his role as making \"calls to leaders and staff to help in the decision making process ... and ensuring agenda adherence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   Clearly, political motivations influenced Secretary Duke's decision to terminate TPS for Haiti. Even if these factors, which are not relevant under the statute, were not dispositive, they nevertheless factored into the Acting Secretary's TPS calculus. Although the TPS statute requires the Secretary consult with appropriate federal agencies, any discussions should center on the factors on the ground, as well as the \"national interest\" of the United States. A TPS determination should not be a political decision made to carry out political motives. Ultimately, the potential political ramifications should not have factored into the decision to terminate Haiti's TPS. Nor should the likelihood of working out a permanent legislative solution or the desire for \"agenda adherence.\" Accordingly, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing Secretary Duke's decision was arbitrary and capricious due to improper political influence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-428\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Pretext\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   Plaintiffs are also likely to succeed in their arbitrary and capricious claim because Acting Secretary Duke's decision reflected a pre-ordained outcome. The reasons motivating her decision were not\n   those articulated in the Federal Register Notice. As discussed above, Plaintiffs argue \"the review process was a sham designed to create a pretext for terminating TPS for Haiti.\" Pl.

The evidence summarized above amply supports the conclusion Acting Secretary Duke made her decision with a closed mind and for reasons other than those articulated in the Federal Register. Acting Secretary Duke terminated TPS for Haiti for reasons unrelated to the conditions in Haiti. Acting Secretary Duke met with White House officials, who exerted significant pressure on her to terminate. These officials sought to \"coordinate the conditions and process for terminating temporary protected status (TPS) for aliens from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Haiti.\" Suppl. Admin. R. at 127. They also believed \"[e]xtending TPS for any or all of the four countries would prolong the distortion between the temporary protections that TPS was designed to provide and current circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129. The record of that meeting suggests high-level cabinet officials, including the Attorney General, and other White House advisors, insisted Acting Secretary Duke terminate TPS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 113-15. The pressure continued through November.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 283 (noting, for example, the White House would be \"extremely disappointed if [she] kick[ed] [the termination decision] into [the] lap of [the] next secretary\"). Moreover, Acting Secretary Duke's handwritten notes strongly indicate she had trouble figuring out a \"plan\" or \"rationale\" to terminate TPS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 317-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   The parties involved in the periodic review process decided to terminate well before the start of the TPS review process-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , before USCIS officials issued the RAIO Report. Secretary Kelly foreshadowed the end of TPS for Haiti with his final six-month extension. Indeed, even before the extension, Secretary Kelly's Senior Advisor, Gene Hamilton, wrote in an April 20, 2017 email to David Lapan: \"African countries are toast ... Haiti is up next.\" Priv. Prod. at 4670. Officials within the agency understood DHS would terminate Haiti's TPS in the next decision. As James Nealon testified, based on his discussions with former Secretary Kelly, there was a \"general feeling that TPS ... for Haiti was going to be terminated\" by July 2017. Nealon Dep. Tr. at 27:12-22; 128:9-17, 129:4-130:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Cowpasture River\n   </em>\n   , the agency reverse-engineered facts and objective assessments to justify termination. DHS manipulated, minimized, and omitted many of the facts included in the October 2017 RAIO Report. Notably, it suddenly departed from its longstanding practice of considering all country conditions and instead only considered conditions directly related to the originating condition (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the 2010 earthquake). Indeed, officials were \"looking for\" an outcome of termination rather than coming to the outcome after a fact-based review of country conditions. Pl. Ex. 127. Similarly, the Department of State violated its own internal and longstanding practice of awarding great deference to the recommendations by the U.S. Embassy in Haiti by failing to include the Embassy's viewpoint in the split memorandum presented to Secretary Tillerson. These factors are all highly suggestive of a pretextual decision. Therefore, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim the decision to terminate was arbitrary and capricious because it was pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Important to this Court's calculus, these communications also reveal the intent to formulate a general policy of terminating TPS for predominantly non-white foreign countries in order to decrease the presence of non-white immigrants in the United States. Unlike prior decisions on TPS, the White House was not only involved in but was influential in producing the decision to terminate TPS for Haiti. For example, DHS official Christina McDonald wrote in\n   an email to other DHS officials on November 21, 2017: \"The interagency process for TPS-Haiti\n   <em>\n    was led by the White House\n   </em>\n   .

The decision to terminate Haiti's TPS designation subjects them to removal from their homes, jobs, and communities in the United States. Many of them have little to no ties left in Haiti.

Confronted with these prospects, Haitian TPS holders are understandably suffering from severe emotional distress and anxiety. At trial, Plaintiffs' proffered testimony illustrating the profound hardships impacting Haitian TPS holders and organizations working on behalf of this population. For example, Rachelle Guirand, a 40-year-old TPS beneficiary, has lived in the United States since 2009 and works full time as a home health aide and certified nursing assistant and attends school part-time in pursuit of a career as a dental hygienist. Trial Tr. at 182:8-25, 183:10-22 (Guirand). She has a nine-year old son born in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 184:1-10 (Guirand). Ms. Guirard testified she \"would never imagine going to Haiti and leaving him\" in the United States but does not know where she will live or how she will provide for her son in Haiti, where the need for health aides is scarce or non-existent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 185:15-20, 187:6-11, 189:21-25, and 190:1-2 (Guirand). Other than her father who is \"an old man and struggling himself,\" she has no ties to family or friends in Haiti.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 187:6-11 (Guirand). Her son requires a nebulizer and a mobile pump for his asthma, and she fears her son will suffer the same fate as her relative, who died from an \"asthmatic crisis\" because the hospitals in Haiti lacked the necessary materials to treat him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189:13-16 (Guirand).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-495\">\n   Plaintiffs offered similar testimony from Naischa Vilme, a 22-year-old TPS holder from Haiti.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 167:9-12 (Vilme). Ms. Vilme entered the United States with her family in January 2010 after the earthquake.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 168:8-17 (Vilme). She is a recent college graduate in math and psychology with hopes of obtaining a doctorate in clinical psychology but has held off applying to Ph.D programs in the United\n   States due to the uncertainty regarding Haiti's TPS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 170:9-15 (Vilme). Ms. Vilme testified she and her family intended to remain the United States until it was safe to return to Haiti.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 169:1-2 (Vilme).

With the expiration date of Haiti's TPS looming, Plaintiffs face imminent and irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-497\">\n   The decision to terminate Haiti's TPS will also exacerbate social, emotional, and financial harms to FANM, a nonprofit which serves low-income families, including Haitian TPS holders, in the South Florida community.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 382:6-10, 426:13-15 (Bastien). Since January 2017, FANM has supplemented its traditional array of wrap-around services with TPS-specific services, such as providing up-to-date information on TPS, holding bi-weekly community meetings regarding TPS, and providing psycho-social counseling for TPS holders and their children.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 383:8-21 (Bastien). FANM does not have a dedicated source of funding for its TPS-related activities. To support the increased need to provide TPS-services, FANM draws financial resources from its \"general support\" fund, which is used to pay for its \"[i]nfrastructure, to organize training, [and] to support staff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   385:24-386:7 (Bastien). Terminating Haiti's TPS will put significant pressure on FANM's resources.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. at 266-70 (noting FANM will need to expend more time and personnel to fundraise the amount it needs to serve Haitian TPS holders, will lose essential employees, and stands to lose more than half of its membership dues). For example, Ms. Bastien testified since January 2017, the amount of fiscal resources FANM expended on TPS-related activities have tripled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 384:4-20 (Bastien).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-498\">\n   Although Defendants do not dispute termination of TPS for Haiti may inflict deep psychological pain and impose financial hardships upon the community of Haitian TPS holders, they nevertheless argue any injuries Plaintiffs may suffer in the form of uncertainties, concerns, and stress are based inherently on the temporary nature of the TPS program. Def. Br. at 44-45. These harms, however, are not necessarily a direct result of the temporary nature of the TPS program. Rather, they stem from the government's actions in evaluating TPS status for Haiti. In\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   , the court noted if \"the government were to follow the APA's procedural requirements\" as mandated by law, TPS beneficiaries would have additional time to work, wrap up their affairs in the United States, and prepare for their return to their countries of origin.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527543\" index=\"707\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/336/1075/\">\n    336 F.Supp.3d at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if their status is temporary, as the court reasoned, \"the shortening of their time in the United States and acceleration of their removal if relief is not granted may constitute irreparable harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527543\" index=\"708\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/336/1075/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-499\">\n   The harms Plaintiffs identified are sufficient to demonstrate irreparable harm. Moreover, the Court cannot issue a final adjudication on the merits before Haiti's TPS designation expires, at which point the harms will materialize. On March 1, 2019, DHS announced beneficiaries under the TPS designation for Haiti will retain\n   their TPS while the preliminary injunction order issued in\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   remains in effect. Their TPS-related Employment Authorization Documents and other TPS-related documents will automatically extend through January 2, 2020, provided the affected TPS beneficiaries otherwise remain eligible individually for TPS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"709\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207103\">\n    84 Fed. Reg. 7103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7104 (Mar. 1, 2019). In the event the\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   injunction is reversed, and that reversal becomes final, DHS plans to allow for a transition period the \"later of (a) 120 days from the effective date of such a superseding final order,\" or (b) July 22, 2019, the date of the termination of Haiti's TPS designation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"710\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"710\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207103\">\n    at 7105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such a reversal could occur at any point after the date of this Court's decision, and Haitian TPS beneficiaries would have three months left to wrap up their affairs in the United States. Once TPS beneficiaries are removed, the Government's actions cannot be undone.

Of course, balanced against Plaintiffs' injuries if this Court does not issue a preliminary injunction are the Government's injuries if this Court does. Nothing in the record suggests the continued presence of Haitian TPS beneficiaries in the United States pending review of Haiti's TPS designation would cause any concrete harm to the United States.
