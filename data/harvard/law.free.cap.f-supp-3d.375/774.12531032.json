[\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 59]. All briefing is complete, and both Motions for Summary Judgment are ripe for adjudication. For the reasons set forth herein, Midland's Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied and Thompson's Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In Thompson's First Amended Class Action Complaint filed on June 6, 2017, he asserts that Midland violated \u00a7 1692f(1) of the FDCPA \"by bringing suit and/or sending a dunning communications on a claim that is barred by the applicable statute of limitations\" and that Midland violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(5) based on the nearly identical conduct of \"filing suit on a debt and/or sending a dunning letter on a claim that is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, or threatening to take legal action on a debt that is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\" [Docket No. 59 at \u00b6 45(a)-(b) ]. The First Amended Class Action Complaint also alleges generally that \"Midland Funding, LLC violated multiple sections of the FDCPA by filing suit and sending dunning letters on debt on which it had no documents that supported its claims.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45(c) ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Midland filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on April 2, 2018.

Midland filed a combined Reply in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment and Response to Plaintiff's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment on May 21, 2018. [Docket No. 78]. Thompson filed a Reply in Support of his Cross Motion on May 31, 2018. [Docket No. 83].

[\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 78 at 15 n.4]. Midland correctly points out that the deadline for dispositive motions was extended to April 2, 2018 [Docket No. 68], on which date Midland filed its Motion for Summary Judgment [Docket No. 69]. Thompson did not file his Cross Motion for Summary Judgment until April 25, 2018, in conjunction with Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. [Docket No. 71]. Although Thompson's Motion for Summary Judgment was not filed by the dispositive motions deadline, the Court will nevertheless consider the motion, because there is no evidence Thompson acted in bad faith or that Midland was prejudiced by the delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Great Am.

Ky. Mar. 29, 2017). The arguments raised in Thompson's Cross Motion overlap significantly with the substance of Thompson's Response to Midland's Motion for Summary Judgment. In addition, an Agreed Order granted Midland an extension of time in which to file its consolidated Reply and Response to Plaintiff's Cross Motion. [Docket No. 77].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The relevant facts are undisputed. Prior to 2002, Thompson obtained a credit card from Spiegel Inc., operated through Spiegel's wholly-owned subsidiary, First Consumers National Bank (\"FCNB\"). [Docket No. 59 at 2]. The credit card could only be used at Spiegel's Newport News stores and websites. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The last payment made on the account was made on June 30, 2002. [Docket No. 71 at 5]. A debt was incurred on the account, which FNCB \"charged off\" on or around February 9, 2003. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6]. Defendant Midland then purchased the debt from Spiegel on or around December 4, 2007. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6]. Thereafter, Midland Credit Management (\"MCM\") serviced\n   Plaintiff's account for Midland. [Docket No. 69 at 9].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between January 2008 and December 2011, MCM sent nine letters to Thompson, attempting to collect the debt. [Docket No. 71 at 6]. On or around March 11, 2012, MCM sent the account to the law firm Morgan &amp; Pottinger, P.S.C. for review and consideration of a potential lawsuit. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Docket No. 69 at 11]. Midland filed a collection action in the Lawrence County, Kentucky District Court on August 7, 2012. [Docket No. 71 at 6].\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thompson moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the lawsuit was time-barred under Kentucky's five-year statute of limitations for contracts not in writing pursuant to Kentucky Revised Statute (\"KRS\") \u00a7 413.90(2). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. At some point in the litigation, Midland moved for voluntary dismissal without prejudice. [R. 69 at 106]. The Lawrence District Court granted Thompson's motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the case\n   <em>\n    with prejudice\n   </em>\n   on May 21, 2013. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Docket No. 69 at 112].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the movant shows that there is no dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(1). A court must look to the substantive law to identify which facts are material.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

When evaluating cross motions for summary judgment, courts should \"evaluate each motion on its own merits and view all facts and inferences in the light more favorable to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Bakery &amp; Confectionery Union &amp; Indus. Int'l Health Benefits &amp; Pension Funds v.

Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party demonstrates there is \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). While the initial burden of showing there is no genuine issue of material fact is on the moving party, once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must demonstrate that there is sufficient evidence on which the jury could find for the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    Dominguez v.

Based on the undisputed facts cited above and the fact that Midland does not dispute the state court's finding that its collections action against Thompson was time-barred, the Court finds no material facts in dispute and rules on the motions for summary judgment as a matter of law. [Docket No. 69 at 7;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143638\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/447/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   n.3 ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Because few unsophisticated consumers would be aware that a statute of limitations could be used to defend against lawsuits based on stale debts, such consumers would unwittingly acquiesce to such lawsuits. And, even if the consumer realizes that she can use time as a defense, she will more than likely still give in rather than fight the lawsuit because she must still expend energy and resources and subject herself to the embarrassment of going into court to present the defense; this is particularly true in light of the costs of attorneys today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3939328\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/668/1480/#p1487\">\n    668 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1487 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   , 736 F.3d at 1079.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   When the district court in\n   <em>\n    Stratton\n   </em>\n   assessed the cross motions for summary judgment on remand, the court's analysis with respect to the \u00a7 1692e(5) claim went as follows: defendant's \"liability hinges on whether it had the right to collect prejudgment interest....

Moreover, although Thompson claims the Sixth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Currier\n   </em>\n   opinion is on point [Docket No. 71 at 11-12], the court in\n   <em>\n    Currier\n   </em>\n   did not reach the question of liability under \u00a7 1692f(1), stopping short of doing so after finding a violation under the broader provision cited by the plaintiff, \u00a7 1692f.\n   <em>\n    Currier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179658\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/529/#p535\">\n    762 F.3d at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Currier has plausibly alleged an unfair debt collection practice under the broad meaning of \u00a7 1692f.

[Docket No. 69 at 24]. The FDCPA provides a safe harbor provision for violators of the FDCPA known as the \"bona fide error defense\" which states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A debt collector may not be held liable in any action brought under this subchapter if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c).

Midland asserts that it is entitled to the protection of this provision because it inadvertently filed the time-barred lawsuit due to conflicting state law on the issue. [Docket No. 69 at 35]. Midland cites to a federal district court case commenting on the unsettled state of Kentucky law with respect to the statute of limitations for credit card agreements, asserting that based on Kentucky precedent at the time the collection suit was filed against Thompson, Midland \"reasonably believed\" the fifteen-year statute of limitations for written contracts applied to Thompson's credit card agreement, rather than the five-year statute of limitations for unwritten contracts.
