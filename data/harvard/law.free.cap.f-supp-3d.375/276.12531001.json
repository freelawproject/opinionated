In 2010, the defendant moved back to the United States, where he worked in retail before attending a program to become a certified nurse assistant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 38, 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Stowe is sentenced to time served (one day) and four years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   It is crucial that he continues his studies and improves his employment prospects. It will be challenging for him to find employment with a felony conviction even absent further education.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Christopher Stafford,\n   <em>\n    Finding Work: How to Approach the Intersection of Prisoner Reentry, Employment, and Recidivism\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20Geo.%20J.%20on%20Poverty%20L.%20%26%20Pol%27y%20261\">\n    13 Geo.

Criminology 706, 715 (2010) (finding that employment may lengthen the period of time from one incarceration to the next for those that are reincarcerated because employment prolongs the period of motivation to remain crime-free). Since employment is a rehabilitative necessity, the court must consider the detrimental effects of interrupting, even potentially terminating, the defendant's progress toward securing employment. Stowe's period of supervision, unlike a term of incarceration, will help ensure his rehabilitation is not interrupted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court considered specific deterrence. Until the instant conviction, the defendant had never been in trouble with law enforcement, and he is committed to being a productive citizen going forward. He desires to work in the healthcare field, where he can help others. He has taken on student loan debt and is supported by public assistance to achieve this goal. It is apparent the defendant is deeply apologetic for his actions. He emphasized at the sentencing hearing that he intended to use the money earned from this offense to help his family; he will be in a better position to provide for his family by continuing his education and working toward his employment goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court also considered the challenges the defendant would face in prison. As a seriously ill inmate with a prior history of sexual assault, the defendant could face traumatic conditions that would rewind his progress toward a stable life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   No fines are being imposed because the defendant has insufficient funds. There is a special assessment of $ 100 for each of the two counts. No forfeiture is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    IX.
