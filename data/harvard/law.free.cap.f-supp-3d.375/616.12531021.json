No. 50), Plaintiffs' Opposition thereto (Doc. No. 54), Defendants' Reply in Support thereof (Doc. No. 56), and Plaintiffs' Sur-reply thereto (Doc. No. 57). For the reasons set forth below, we grant Defendants' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises from Plaintiffs' Walgreen Co. and The Kroger Co. (\"Retailer Plaintiffs\") allegations that Defendants Johnson &amp; Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively \"Janssen\") (\"J &amp; J\") violated federal antitrust laws through an anticompetitive scheme to exclude competition, maintain a monopoly over, and artificially inflate prices for Defendants' biologic infliximab drug, Remicade. Pl. Comp. \u00b6 1. These allegations stem from facts set forth in this Court's Memorandums denying J &amp; J's motion to dismiss Pfizer's complaint and denying in part J &amp; J's motion to dismiss Direct and Indirect Purchasers' amended complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pfizer Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527317\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/333/494/\">\n    333 F.Supp.3d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. 2018) ; Doc. No. 58.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Direct and Indirect Purchasers v. Johnson &amp; Johnson\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-04326 and No. 18-cv-00303. In the instant case, Plaintiffs, indirect purchasers, allege that inflated prices for Remicade were passed on to them as overcharges on their purchases of the drug from pharmaceutical wholesalers (\"Wholesalers\"), AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc. Wholesalers purportedly assigned to Plaintiffs their \"rights\" under their distributor agreements with JOM Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., a subsidiary of J &amp; J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the heart of the dispute here is Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing because Wholesalers' purported assignment of \"rights\" under the Agreements was void pursuant to an anti-assignment provision. Plaintiffs maintain that their antitrust claims are not encompassed by the purported assignments, and may proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are undisputed: Defendants manufacture and market Remicade. (Pl. Resp. to Def. Stmt. Facts at \u00b6 2, Doc. No. 54-1). Plaintiffs purchase Remicade from AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (\"Amerisource\") and from Cardinal Health, Inc. (\"Cardinal\"), pharmaceutical wholesalers who purchase Remicade directly from Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. Wholesalers' direct purchases of Remicade are governed by Distribution Agreements (together, \"the Agreements\") with JOM Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (\"JOM\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. The Agreements are governed by New Jersey law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Section 4.4 of the Agreements between Wholesalers and Defendants each includes a non-assignment provision containing the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Except as provided in this section, neither party may assign, directly or indirectly, this agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this agreement, either voluntarily or involuntarily (whether by merger, acquisition, consolidation, dissolution, operation of law, change of control or otherwise), without prior written consent of the other party....Any purported assignment in violation of this section will be void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Def. Br. Exs. A and B, Doc. 50-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 23, 2018, Wholesalers purportedly assigned their claims against Defendants over alleged overcharges for Remicade to Plaintiffs. (Pl. Resp. to Def. Stmt. Facts at \u00b6 10, Doc. No. 54-1 at 3). The purported assignment agreements stated, \"[Amerisource] hereby conveys, assigns and transfers to Walgreens all of its rights, title and interest in and to all Direct Purchaser Claims it may have against Defendants under the antitrust laws of the United States.\" \"[Cardinal] hereby conveys, assigns and transfers to Kroger all of its rights, title and interest in and to all Direct Purchaser Claims it may have against Defendants under the antitrust laws of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. Exs. C and D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 6, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the underlying action against Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Compl., Doc. No. 1. Plaintiffs' complaint asserts federal antitrust claims purportedly assigned to them by Wholesalers, in addition to asserting claims on their own behalf. (Pl. Resp. to Def. Stmt. Facts at \u00b6 12, Doc. No. 54-1). On December 7, 2018, this Court denied Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' direct purchaser antitrust claims (those that do not depend on assignments from Wholesalers).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 48, fn 2. Now, Plaintiffs concede that \"their purchases of Remicade were indirect\" and that any purchases not covered by a purported assignment \"will not be\n   included in [their] damages model.\" Pl. Opp. at 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In our December 7th, 2018 Order we also converted Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' indirect purchaser antitrust claims (Doc. No. 36) into a summary judgment proceeding, pursuant to the Third Circuit's direction that \"[i]f matters outside the bounds of the complaint are considered by the district court, the merits of the claim must be tested by way of motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    JM Mech.

The instant motion for summary judgment is fully briefed and ripe for the Court's adjudication, now that Plaintiffs have been afforded \"a reasonable opportunity to present all material\" pertinent under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

R. Civ. P. 56(a). New Jersey law, which we find applicable to the issue of non-assignment provisions in the distributor Agreements in this case, instructs that \"interpretation or construction of a contract is usually a legal question for the court, 'suitable for a decision on a motion for summary judgment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Driscoll Const.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants, J &amp; J, assert four arguments for summary judgment. First, Defendants argue that they are parties to the Agreements. Second, Defendants argue that the anti-assignment provisions in the Agreements encompass Plaintiffs' statutory antitrust claims. Third, Defendants argue that the anti-assignment provisions are enforceable under New Jersey law. Fourth, Defendants argue that Wholesalers' assignments to Plaintiffs are void because they were made without Defendants' consent, thereby violating the clear and specific anti-assignment provisions. In sum, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs are barred from asserting an antitrust cause of action because these statutory claims would not exist but for the void assignments. Plaintiffs oppose summary judgment on three grounds: first, that Defendants are not parties to the Agreements; second, that Plaintiffs' antitrust claims are outside the scope of the Agreements; and third, that even if the Wholesalers' assignments violated the anti-assignment provisions,\n   federal common law allowing for valid assignment of antitrust claims should preempt state law enforcing anti-assignment provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    A. Whether Defendants are Parties to the Agreements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants seek to enforce the anti-assignment provisions of the Agreements, arguing that they are parties to the Agreements. Defendants argue that the Agreement discloses that they are the parent company (Johnson &amp; Johnson) and affiliate (Janssen) of the signatory, JOM, to whom they delegated authority to enter Agreements governing distribution of Defendants' drug, Remicade. Furthermore, Defendants argue, the Agreements explicitly apply to claims involving JOM's parent company, subsidiaries, or affiliates. Exs. A and B \u00a7\u00a7 4.21(a). Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that JOM signed the Agreements not as Defendants' agent, but as the only party to the contract. Therefore, Plaintiffs' argument goes, Defendants cannot oppose the purported assignments because they are not parties to the Agreements. Pl. Opp. at 9.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170284\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/654/#p655\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We find there is no dispute that Defendants are parties to the Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Agency is the fiduciary relationship that arises when one person (a 'principal') manifests assent to another person (an 'agent') that the agent shall act on the principal's behalf and subject to the principal's control, and the agent manifests assent or otherwise consents so to act.\" Restat 3d of Agency, \u00a7 1.01 (3rd 2006).

A at 25, Ex. B at 23) names Janssen Biotech, Inc. as an \"affiliate\" (also referred to as a \"Manufacturer,\" Exs. A and B at 1) of JOM for purposes of the Agreements. The language of the Agreements expressly provides that JOM's affiliates have delegated authority to JOM to enter distribution agreements on their behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. A and B at 1, \"[JOM] is an Authorized Distributor of Record for the\n   Products with authority delegated by the Manufacturers to designate additional Authorized Distributors of Record (each an \"ADR\") on their behalf for distribution of Products....

Defendants contend that the Agreements' prohibition on assignment of \"rights\" without consent necessarily includes a prohibition on assignment of statutory causes of action, such as the right to recover overcharge damages. Accordingly, where the anti-assignment provisions have been violated, under New Jersey law the purported assignments are void, and, as a result, Plaintiffs' have no basis on which to assert their statutory claims. By contrast, Plaintiffs argue that the anti-assignment provisions narrowly prohibit performance of the contract, while the right to bring a statutory antitrust claim is \"in some way independent of, or pre-existing to, the 'rights or obligations' \" that the provisions prohibit from being assigned. Def. Br. at 12. If Plaintiffs' statutory claims exist independent of the Agreements, Plaintiffs argue, then federal common law, not New Jersey law, will resolve the issue at summary judgment. We find there is no reasonable dispute that the anti-assignment provisions prohibited assignment of rights under the Agreements, including statutory causes of action; therefore, we grant summary judgment for Defendants, where Plaintiffs' antitrust claims exist by virtue of void assignments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It is established that \"under controlling federal law,...antitrust claims are assignable.\"\n   <em>\n    Gulfstream III Assocs., Inc. v.

Without the assignment of Wholesalers' rights under the Agreements, Plaintiffs would have no basis from which to assert the Wholesalers' claim for overcharges on purchases of Remicade. Thus, Plaintiffs' antitrust claims flow from the purported assignment of Wholesalers' rights.

In\n   <em>\n    Owen\n   </em>\n   , the New Jersey Supreme Court considered a broad anti-assignment provision stating, \"...the aforesaid deferred lump sum payments shall not be subject to assignment....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1204366\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/167/450/\">\n    771 A.2d at 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Court viewed the provision's broad language as \"merely...a covenant not to assign. [Because] [i]t contains no specific prohibition on the power to make an assignment, and it does not specifically state that the assignments are 'void.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1204366\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/167/450/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bel-Ray\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11659362\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/181/435/#p442\">\n    181 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   442 ). In this case, by contrast, the assignment provisions clearly state, \"neither party may assign...this agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this agreement...without the prior written consent of the other party....\n   <em>\n    Any purported assignment in violation of this section will be void\n   </em>\n   .\" Exs. A and B \u00a7\u00a7 4.4 (emphasis added). Thus, under New Jersey law interpreting anti-assignment provisions, we find it is beyond genuine dispute that the anti-assignment provisions here manifested a clear intent to prohibit assigning rights under the Agreements without the parties' consent and expressly indicated such assignments would be void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs angle for yet another view, arguing that statutory antitrust claims are not contemplated by language in the assignment provision barring assignment of \"rights.\" Yet New Jersey courts have not treated statutory antitrust claims as exempted from a clear and specific non-assignment provision. In this case, the Wholesalers' rights to recover antitrust damages against Defendants, although statutory in nature, exist \" 'by virtue of the relationship,' established by the Agreements-indeed, 'there is no context other than [those] preexisting contractual relationship[s] in which [those rights] could have arisen.' \" Def. Br. at 11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Am. Fin. Capital Corp. v. Princeton Elecs. Prods.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20131145\">\n    1996 WL 131145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%203412\">\n    1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *27-28 ). Thus, we find there is no reasonable dispute that the anti-assignment provisions here encompass Plaintiffs' antitrust claims because their claims exist by virtue of the Agreements and that the assignments of \"rights\" under the Agreements, without consent of Defendants, are void. Therefore, there is no genuine dispute that Plaintiffs' antitrust claims, which they assert by virtue of void assignments, are barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    D. Plaintiffs' Unassigned Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs \"do not dispute that their purchases of Remicade were indirect.\" Pl. Opp. at 9. Accordingly, any claim for overcharges on purchases of Remicade by Plaintiffs arose through the unauthorized assignment by Wholesalers of rights under their distributor Agreements. These assignment-based antitrust claims, grounded in invalid assignments, cannot proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. An appropriate Order will follow.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
