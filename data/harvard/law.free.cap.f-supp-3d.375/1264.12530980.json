He visited the City of Ocala's website,\n   <em>\n    www.ocalafl.org\n   </em>\n   , but could not access all of it because portions were incompatible with his screen reader. Price is suing the City under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012131\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et. seq.

The overwhelming majority of case law addressing ADA website violations involve claims under Title III, which this Court concludes is inapposite to Title II cases. So relying on basic standing principles and this Circuit's case law on ADA standing generally, the Court will explain what factors it finds relevant to determining standing in Title II ADA website cases. After considering those factors, the Court concludes Price lacks standing because there is no threat of immediate future injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In December 2018, Price visited the City's website, www.ocalafl.org, to \"educat[e] himself about the quality of life and governmental functioning in City of Ocala\" and \"to find out more about programs, services and activities available to visitors and residents of City of Ocala.\" (Doc. 1, \u00b6 33). Some items on the City's website were incompatible with Price's screen reader software, although Price does not specify precisely what documents were inaccessible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The inability to access some documents on the City's website \"resulted in Plaintiff suffering from feelings of segregation, rejection, and isolation as Plaintiff was left excluded from participating in the community services, programs and activities offered by City of Ocala in a manner equal to that afforded to others who are not similarly disabled.\" (Doc. 1, \u00b6 34). Price alleges he again visited the City's website on January 20, 2019, but still could not access portions of the website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Price does not allege where he lives in Florida or that he is a citizen of the City. Nor does he allege that he has any concrete plan to visit or move to the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The City argues Price lacks standing to bring his claims alleging its website violates Title II of the ADA. While a seemingly straightforward proposition, the issue is more complicated than it appears. So\n   the Court will discuss standing generally, then address the differences between Title II and Title III ADA cases, then explore the peculiarities of claims involving websites, and finally undertake an analysis of Price's standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Courts have struggled to apply traditional principles of standing to these website cases and have disagreed about what features a website must have to comply with the ADA. The latter is largely due to a complete lack of rules and regulations being promulgated by the Department of Justice despite being aware of this issue for years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That\n   said, as far back as 2011, the DOJ explained its position on the ADA's relation to the Internet:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Although the language of the ADA does not explicitly mention the Internet, the Department has taken the position that title II covers Internet Web site access.

Pleading Title III website cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Most of the ADA website case law involves violations of Title III. These cases have been primarily concerned with two issues that both go to whether a plaintiff has stated a claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, the cases consider whether a website is a \"place of public accommodation\" such that it is governed by the ADA.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Access Now, Inc. v.

When considering whether there is a nexus, courts distinguish between \"an inability to use a website to gain information about a physical location and an inability to use a website that impedes access to\n   enjoy a physical location,\" with only the latter being sufficient to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    Everglades College,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203428156\">\n    2018 WL 3428156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (explaining that a contrary view \"would require all websites with\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   nexus to a physical public accommodation to be formatted in such a way that they are accessible to screen reader software.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   But those cases, which make up the majority of the case law, do not address standing. In the few cases that have addressed standing in Title III website cases, district courts have applied the\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   factors\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to determine whether a plaintiff has pleaded a future injury.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Price v. Orlando Health, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:17-CV-1999-ORL-40DCI,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206434519\">\n    2018 WL 6434519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 7, 2018) (finding plaintiff had not alleged a future injury related to a hospital website because of the distance between his house and the \"place of public accommodation,\" his failure to travel to the area frequently, and his lack of definite plan to return); and\n   <em>\n    Honeywell v.

Dec. 3, 2018) (concluding a plaintiff pleaded a future injury related to a hotel's website by alleging she intended to travel from Fort Lauderdale to Fort Myers within six months).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As a review of the above cases shows, courts cannot agree on how to apply traditional Title III case law to website cases. There is disagreement about when a website impedes access to a physical location, or whether a plaintiff must actually visit a \"place of public accommodation\" to state a claim after having visited a website. And that is to say nothing of the uneven application of the\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   factors in Title III website cases. Guidance is sorely needed in this arena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Title II website cases and the problem with reliance on Title III case law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While district courts are, at the very least, beginning to flesh out these issues in Title III website cases, there has been little discussion of what it takes to satisfy standing or to state a claim in Title II website cases. The only case in this Circuit of which this Court is aware of that has directly addressed these issues is\n   <em>\n    Gil v. Broward Cty., Fla.\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-60282-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204941108\">\n    2018 WL 4941108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla. May 7, 2018) (Dimitrouleas, J.). But that Court, without explanation, applied Title III case law to a Title II claim-essentially lumping together all ADA cases involving alleged website violations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204941108\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at *2 (\"The Court has set forth the standard applicable to Title III website cases, and the Court finds that analysis instructive in this Title II case.\"). The problem with this one-size-fits-all approach is best illustrated via some examples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, let us consider standing in Title II website cases. The\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   factors district courts have struggled to apply in Title III website cases are largely inapplicable to proving a future injury in Title II website cases because there is no requirement that a violation be tied to a physical location.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   What is the proximity of a plaintiff's residence to a governmental website, and what does it mean to frequently travel near a website? For that matter, what does it mean to patronize a website, or to have a\n   plan to return to the website? And does it matter that a Title II plaintiff has no connection with the governmental entity that's website is the subject of the lawsuit? The lack of clear answers to these questions-or perhaps the obvious answers-demonstrate the problems of applying general Title III standing principles in Title II website cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Likewise, reliance on Title III website case law on how to state a claim is misguided because requiring a nexus between a governmental website and an impediment to accessing a physical, brick-and-mortar location makes no sense under Title II. Again, Title II has no statutory requirement that a violation be connected to a physical location. So the requirement that a website impede access to a physical location to be actionable cannot be applicable. For this and various other reasons, this Court concludes Title III case law on standing and what is needed to state a claim is largely inapplicable to Title II website cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    3. A workable solution for Title II website cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Having identified the problems with applying Title III case law in Title II website cases, the question arises: what factors are relevant for courts to consider in when ruling on a motion to dismiss a Title II website claim based on lack of standing? Rather than tackle this unenviable task by reinventing the wheel, the Court concludes general standing principles should act as the touchstone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is undisputed that a Title II plaintiff must have Article III standing to state a justiciable claim.\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519653\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/1330/#p1336\">\n    912 F.3d at 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]t is settled that Congress cannot erase Article III's standing requirements by statutorily granting the right to sue to a plaintiff who would not otherwise have standing,\" quoting\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1547-48 ). That means a plaintiff must have a concrete and particularized injury-in-fact, and a real and immediate threat of future harm to have standing to bring a Title II claim based on a governmental entity's website.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Shotz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11089804\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/256/1077/#p1081\">\n    256 F.3d at 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Supreme Court recognized, though, that \" '[t]he actual or threatened injury required by Art.

So this Court can conclude that the Eleventh Circuit would hold that a tester has standing to bring a claim under Title II of the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   But although a Title II tester (likely) has satisfied the injury-in-fact requirement by discovering an ADA violation, the tester still must articulate a real and immediate threat of future injury to have standing.

Those cases, though, provide no guidance in website cases where there is no facility to which to return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This Court, then, must determine what considerations are relevant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As with Title III cases and other areas of law, the Court concludes that the totality of the relevant facts should be considered when determining whether there is an immediate threat of future injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714027\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/1323/#p1328\">\n    733 F.3d at 1337, n.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And while considering the totality of relevant facts, the Court concludes the following non-exclusive, non-dispositive factors will likely be worth consideration in most Title II website cases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714027\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/1323/#p1328\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The first factor the Court considers relevant is what ties or connections a plaintiff has to the defendant governmental entity. It is this Court's experience that most governmental websites provide services to that governmental entity's constituents, not to the world at large. Without a link between the plaintiff and the governmental entity-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff is a citizen or lives nearby, the plaintiff has concrete plans to relocate to within that government's bounds or visit it, the plaintiff has family or friends who are citizens whom depend on the plaintiff, etc.-this factor would weigh against an immediate threat of future injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This factor appears to be consistent with the DOJ's acknowledgement the governmental websites primarily serve to communicate with the governmental entity's constituents. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 Pt. 35, App. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Another factor to consider is what information about a government entity's \"services, programs, or activities\" on the website is allegedly inaccessible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is a difference between inaccessible information about current governmental services, programs, or activities, and merely archival information. For instance, if a county's public events calendar from 2015 is inaccessible on its website, that poses a lesser (or no) risk of future harm compared to a situation in which the current public events calendar is inaccessible. Here's another example: failure to properly code a photograph from a meeting that renders the photograph incompatible with a screen reader poses a lesser (or no) risk of future harm as compared to having a future\n   meeting agenda being inaccessible. In other words, the type of information that is inaccessible is relevant to determining whether there is an immediate risk of future harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Last, how the inaccessibility injures a plaintiff is relevant to determining whether there is a risk of immediate future harm. Many ADA website cases involve testers ferreting out inaccessible portions of a website, and then claiming they have been harmed solely by being unable to access that portion of the website. This differs from a claim that a portion of a website is inaccessible, which then prevents a plaintiff from participating in or benefiting from some governmental service or activity. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Hindel v. Husted\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:15-CV-3061,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20432839\">\n    2017 WL 432839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D. Ohio Feb. 1, 2017), Ohio's voter services website was allegedly inaccessible via screen readers, which hindered the abilities of citizens with vision impairments from registering to vote or using other services on the website. And in\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Metro. Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11427928\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/225/1362/#p1366\">\n    225 F.Supp.2d 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1366 (N.D. Ga. 2002), Atlanta's public bus system's routes and schedules on its website were inaccessible to the vision impaired, which prevented those persons from using the bus system in an equal manner to those without vision impairments. This factor would also encapsulate services on government websites that allow citizens to do things like apply for and renew licenses, or pay fees or fines. In these cases, the future harm was not the inaccessibility of the information itself; rather, it was the effect that the inaccessibility had on the plaintiff's ability to use the information for its intended purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In sum, here are three factors this Court has identified, which should be considered along with the totality of the relevant facts: (1) plaintiff's connection with the defendant governmental entity; (2) the type of information that is inaccessible; and (3) the relation between the inaccessibility and a plaintiff's alleged future harm. This Court considers none of these factors to be dispositive, nor are they exclusive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

None of the three factors the Court identified above-(1) plaintiff's connection with the defendant governmental entity; (2) the type of information that is inaccessible; and (3) the relation between the inaccessible information and a plaintiff's alleged future harm-support Price's standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the first factor, Price alleged no meaningful connection to the City. First, he does not allege that he is a constituent of the City. Second, he alleges that he is interested in learning information to determine if the City is worth visiting or moving to, but he alleges no concrete plans to do either. These are the sort of \"some day\" allegations that are insufficient to allege a future injury.\n   <em>\n    Lujan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    504 U.S. at 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Last, Price alleges no other ties to the City, such as dependent friends or family who live there. So the Court concludes this factor weighs against Price having an immediate threat of future injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The second factor also weighs against Price. Price failed to allege what specific information was inaccessible to him on the City's website. As noted, the Court cannot speculate or piece this information together for Price, so this factor weighs against Price having an immediate threat of future injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, the third factor weighs against Price. His only allegation of harm is that he in unable to access the information, which \"impaired, obstructed, hindered, and impeded Plaintiff's ability to become an involved citizen in City of Ocala government and learn about the programs, services and activities available to residents to (and visitors of) City of Ocala.\" (Doc. 1, \u00b6 42). Price fails to allege any specific way that the inaccessible information hindered his ability to be involved with the City's government, making this generic allegation too conclusory to merit much weight. Instead, it is akin to an allegation that he was harmed by the inaccessibility of the information itself. So the Court concludes this factor weighs against Price having an immediate threat of future harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Based on the above, the Court agrees with the City that Price lacks standing to pursue his claims. But because the Court has articulated new considerations of which Price was unaware when he filed the Complaint, the Court deems it appropriate to allow Price an opportunity to amend his Complaint to reallege standing (and to state a claim under Title II) if he can do so. So the Court will dismiss the Complaint without prejudice to Price filing an amended complaint within fourteen days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Accordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   1.
