Roundpipe is a Utah limited liability company with its principal place of business in Salt Lake City, Utah, whose sole member is Roberts. Complaint at 2. Roberts is a resident of Utah, as well as the programmer who helped design the website at issue in this case, www.SWMonkey.com.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (docket entry 24) at 1. Yurevich is a resident of Washington as well as the person who thought of the idea for www.SWMonkey.com. Complaint at 2; Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 1. None of the defendants in this case has any rights or ownership interest in Southwest's trademarks, nor are they authorized to use them. Complaint at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This dispute revolves around the website www.SWMonkey.com, created by Yurevich and Roberts and launched through Roundpipe in early November 2017. Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 1. As noted above, the idea for the website was originally conceived by Yurevich, who knew that Southwest had a policy allowing customers to change their tickets without paying a fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Yurevich recognized that Southwest's no-fee policy essentially meant that if a customer's ticket was reduced in price after the customer's purchase, the customer could use this policy and exchange his original ticket for the lower-priced ticket, thereby saving the difference in fare.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Yurevich also recognized, however, that to take advantage of this policy consumers would have to constantly monitor Southwest's website to determine if their ticket price had dropped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To get around this problem Yurevich conceived the idea of providing a price monitoring service in the form of a website which would provide consumers an alert when their ticket price dropped so that they would know when to exchange their tickets to reap savings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Yurevich reached out to Roberts, a programmer who had experience building programs designed to pull data from websites, and the two developed www.SWMonkey.com and launched it in early November, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit S (explaining that to make the website, Yurevich contacted Roberts, \"who had experience building scrapers, or programs that pull data from websites.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The original version of the SWMonkey website operated by scraping information about ticket fares off Southwest's website and using that information to alert customers who signed up through www.SWMonkey.com that their ticket prices had dropped. Complaint at 11; Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit Q (travel blog post explaining that the defendants' website would monitor ticket prices on Southwest's website for customers; the owner of the travel blog informed the defendants that their scraping activities\n   would undoubtedly be met with legal action from Southwest); Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit S. The original www.SWMonkey.com website also required consumers pay a three-dollar charge to utilize the automatic price-checking service, provided the customer saved ten dollars or more through using the defendants' website.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit R (\"There is a $ 3 dollar charge for this service to check your flight price daily and text you if your [f]light decreases in price. You only pay, however, IF they are able to save you $ 10 or more.\"); Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 1 (\"Roundpipe stood to make three dollars if it saved this customer at least ten dollars.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Upon its launch, www.SWMonkey.com was met with initial success. On November 6, 2017, www.SWMonkey.com got its first customer. Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 1. On the same date, a travel blog posted about the defendants' website and promoted the services it offered. Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit Q. Ultimately, about 40 people signed up to use www.SWMonkey.com during its launch. Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit S (blog post explaining that \"[a]bout 40 people signed up for the service, which convinced [Yurevich and Roberts] the business was viable.\"). The momentum generated by the initial success of the defendants' website was slowed, however, as Southwest began to send cease-and-desist letters to the defendants regarding the www.SWMonkey.com website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, on November 8, 2017, Southwest sent the defendants a cease-and-desist letter explaining that Southwest had become aware that the defendants' website was using Southwest's proprietary and trademarked names and logos in connection with the defendants' business. Complaint at 7; Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 1; Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit N. In particular, this letter explained that it constituted a demand for the defendants to stop using, in any way, Southwest's intellectual property without Southwest's consent. Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit N. Moreover, the letter warned that \"should you fail to immediately [c]ease and [d]esist, Southwest will vigorously pursue all remedies and actions available, ... and Southwest will seek recoupment of all expenses associated with such actions, including attorneys' fees and costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Two days later, on November 10, 2017, Southwest sent the defendants a second cease-and-desist letter. Complaint at 13; Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 1; Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit T. Unlike the first letter, Southwest's second letter stated that Southwest had become aware that www.SWMonkey.com was violating the terms of Southwest's use agreement by offering third party services not approved by Southwest and by extracting or scraping Southwest's flight and fare information from its servers and websites. Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit T. Accordingly, Southwest's second letter demanded that the defendants stop scraping Southwest's flight and fare information and cease publishing this information on www.SWMonkey.com or elsewhere.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This letter also warned that \"Southwest may pursue formal legal action to recover damages for and to stop the unauthorized use of its website.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Despite receiving these two letters, the defendants did not shut down their website. Complaint at 14. Southwest thus sent the defendants an additional cease-and-desist email on November 15, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 2; Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit U. In pertinent part, the November 15 email expressed that Southwest was \"surprised and disappointed\" that the defendants continued to maintain their website. Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit U. Much like the previous letters, Southwest also stated in the November 15 letter that it would pursue litigation against the defendants if they failed to comply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The next day, on November 16, the defendants blogged about receiving Southwest's cease-and-desist letters and linked this blog post on www.SWMonkey.com. Complaint at 14; Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 2; Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit V. In this post, the defendants catalogued their excitement over creating www.SWMonkey.com as well as their subsequent disappointment caused by receiving multiple cease-and-desist letters from Southwest. Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit V. Additionally, the defendants asserted in this blog post that they did not believe they were using any of Southwest's intellectual property, since the only Southwest image on their website was a public domain image of a Southwest plane.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, the defendants used this post to attack Southwest's claims that the defendants' automatic scraping of Southwest's website was illegal, arguing that the problem with Southwest's argument is \"that they are making this information public. To restrict someone from accessing public information is a violation of our basic rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendants then concluded their post with a reaffirmation that the defendants would continue their website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Over the next few weeks, the defendants communicated with more travel blogs, prompting several articles to appear online discussing the dispute between Southwest and the defendants. Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 2; Declaration of Pavel Yurevich (docket entry 24-1) \u00b6 6. During this time, counsel for the defendants and counsel for Southwest communicated with each other. Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 2. Specifically, on November 18, 2017 Southwest's counsel emailed counsel for the defendants, explaining his availability to discuss these issues and demanding that the issues be resolved before November 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Appendix in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (docket entry 24-1) at 8. Counsel for the defendants responded quickly, and the lawyers for both parties had a telephone conference on the morning of November 20, 2017. Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 2. Later that day, Southwest's counsel sent another email stating that Southwest took this issue very seriously and that Southwest would not make a goodwill payment to the defendants to shut down their website. Appendix in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 16. In the same email, Southwest's counsel warned counsel for the defendants that \"[y]our clients either need to shut down the website or prepare to answer our federal lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In response to this email, the defendants disabled their website's functionality on November 21, 2017, and sent an email to Southwest to confirm that they had done so. Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 3; Appendix in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 19. Despite receiving this email, Southwest maintains that the defendants did not stop using their automatic scraping tool on Southwest's website until November 28, 2017. Complaint at 14; Additional Attachments to Complaint, Exhibit W. In any event, because of Southwest's cease-and-desist\n   letters. the defendants removed all scraping functionality from their website, effectively ending the defendants' ability to track and monitor Southwest's ticket and fare prices for customers. Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Even though the defendants removed the scraping functionality from their website, however, the defendants kept www.SWMonkey.com online as a modified website, which the court will refer to as the disabled site. Complaint at 15; Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 3. On the disabled site, the defendants included a new \"thank you\" section, explaining why the website was no longer in operation. Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 3. Furthermore, the disabled site also included a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" section, which customers could use to find a link posted by the defendants to another website that contained an open source tool for checking Southwest's flight and fare information individually.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After discovering that the defendants' website was not fully taken down, on November 21, 2017, Southwest sent the defendants an email demanding that the defendants take down their entire website, \"including the recently revised FAQ.\" Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 3-4; Appendix in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 32. The next day, on November 22, Southwest sent its final cease-and-desist letter. Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 3-4; Response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (docket entry 25) at 5; Appendix in Support of Response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (docket entry 26) at 111-113. By way of this final letter, Southwest not only reminded the defendants of their original violations, but also alleged the disabled site raised additional issues. Appendix in Support of Response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 111-113. Moreover, Southwest stated that it would pursue formal legal action unless the defendants confirmed in writing each of the following: \"(1) [t]heir written agreement to comply with Southwest's Terms [and] Conditions; (2) [t]heir agreement to cease operation of the [w]ebsite and removal of all related information from the internet; (3) [t]heir agreement to notify travel-related websites ... that the [w]ebsite will be removed from the internet for violations of Southwest's Terms and Conditions; (4) [t]heir agreement to cease using Southwest Airlines' trademarks in connection with the [w]ebsite or any related commercial ventures; and (5) [t]heir confirmation that any existing materials containing any of Southwest Airlines' trademarks have been deleted or destroyed[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113. As a final demand, Southwest required the defendants to provide written confirmation related to all conditions on or before November 27, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Counsel for the defendants responded to Southwest's final cease-and-desist letter on November 28, a day after the deadline imposed by Southwest. Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 4; Response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 5; Appendix in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 53-55. In this reply, counsel for the defendants explained that: (1) the defendants website had not, and does not, infringe upon Southwest's trademarks; (2) it is unclear how the disabled site can give rise to any causes of action; and (3) the defendants had considered this matter resolved.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the response submitted by counsel for the defendants also rejected each of the demands Southwest made in its final letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-55. After receiving this response, Southwest sent back an email once again expressing its disappointment\n   and explaining that it planned to pursue litigation. Appendix in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 57. The next day, on November 28, 2017, without any further communication with Southwest, the defendants filed a declaratory judgment action in the federal district court for the district of Utah. Response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 1 n. 1, 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After issuing multiple warnings that it would file suit, Southwest filed its complaint in this case on January 5, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint. Months later, on March 6, 2018, the defendants filed their motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss. Southwest filed its response to the defendants' Motion to Dismiss on March 27, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. The defendants filed their reply on April 10, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (\"Reply\") (docket entry 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Two months later, on June 12, 2018, Southwest filed its request to dismiss the portions of the defendants' motion to dismiss brought under the TCPA as well as its request for attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Request to Dismiss. The defendants filed their response to this motion on July 3, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Response to Southwest's Request to Dismiss Defendants' TCPA Ground and Request for Attorneys Fees (\"Response to Request to Dismiss\") (docket entry 30). Southwest did not file a reply in support of its request to dismiss. Additionally, the defendants have not yet filed an answer to Southwest's complaint. Regardless, at this juncture both the defendants' motion to dismiss and Southwest's request to dismiss the defendants' TCPA grounds and request for attorneys' fees are ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In their motion to dismiss, the defendants urge two separate grounds of dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. First, the defendants seek to dismiss claims one and six of Southwest's complaint pursuant to the TCPA, Texas's anti-SLAPP\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-13. Second, the defendants seek to dismiss the entirety of Southwest's complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-24. Finding these grounds of dismissal to be vastly different, the court will analyze each ground separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    TCPA Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The TCPA \"protects citizens who petition or speak on matters of public concern from retaliatory lawsuits that seek to intimidate or silence them.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lipsky,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p584\">\n    460 S.W.3d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 584 (Tex. 2015) (citing Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code \u00a7\u00a7 27.001 -.011). \"The purpose of the statute is 'to encourage and safeguard the constitutional rights of persons to petition, speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise participate in government to the maximum extent permitted by law, and at the same time, protect the rights of a person to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury.' \"\n   <em>\n    Misko v.

There, the First Circuit evaluated Maine's anti-SLAPP statute and concluded that it was substantive because neither Rule 12 nor Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were broad enough to cover the same ground as Maine's anti-SLAPP statute.\n   <em>\n    Godin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079359\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/79/\">\n    629 F.3d at 87-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In particular, the\n   <em>\n    Godin\n   </em>\n   court concluded that Rule 12(b)(6) did not cover the same ground as Maine's anti-SLAPP statute since\n   Rule 12(b)(6) only served to test the sufficiency of a complaint, whereas Maine's anti-SLAPP statute provided an entirely different mechanism for dismissal based on the defendant's petitioning conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079359\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/79/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079359\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/79/\">\n    at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As for Rule 56, the First Circuit determined that Maine's anti-SLAPP statute covered separate grounds than the summary judgment rule because the anti-SLAPP statute served \"the entirely distinct function of protecting those specific defendants that have been targeted with litigation on the basis of their protected speech.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079359\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/79/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addition, the First Circuit determined that the burden-shifting regime and legal defenses contained within Maine's anti-SLAPP statute provided further evidence that Maine's anti-SLAPP statute and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure did not occupy the same field.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079359\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/79/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079359\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/79/\">\n    at 89-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the First Circuit concluded that applying Maine's anti-SLAPP statute in federal court would best serve the twin aims of\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   , because declining to apply it would create incentives for plaintiffs to forum shop and bring state-law claims in federal court solely to avoid Maine's anti-SLAPP statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079359\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/79/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079359\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/79/\">\n    at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Here, however, the court is not concerned with Maine's anti-SLAPP statute, nor does the court find that the TCPA is identical to the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Godin\n   </em>\n   . While the two anti-SLAPP statutes share similar features, the court concludes that Texas's anti-SLAPP statute contains certain elements that place it in direct conflict with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 56. For instance, the TCPA provides that to survive a TCPA motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must provide \"clear and specific\" evidence of a prima facie case. Texas Civil Practices &amp; Remedies Code \u00a7 27.005. \"This mandate requires evidence that is 'unambiguous, sure, or free from doubt,' 'explicit or relating to a particular named thing,' and that 'support[s] a rational interference that the allegation of fact is true.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cuba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144189\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/701/#p711\">\n    814 F.3d at 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Graves, dissenting) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p584\">\n    460 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   590 ) (changes in original).

In the court's view, both the anti-SLAPP statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Godin\n   </em>\n   and the TCPA cover the same ground as Rules 12(b)(6) and 56, because Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 answer the same questions as the anti-SLAPP statutes about the circumstances in which a court must dismiss a case before trial.\n   <em>\n    Abbas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055498,4149534\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/783/1328/\">\n    783 F.3d at 1333-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, the court concludes that the TCPA is not applicable in federal court.

Response to Request to Dismiss at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Southwest raises two arguments against the defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Cuba\n   </em>\n   , both of which the court finds persuasive. Request to Dismiss at 5-6. First, Southwest explains that the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cuba\n   </em>\n   is unrelated to both the instant action and the San Antonio Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   . The court agrees with Southwest. In\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   , the issue was not whether the movant's failure to set a hearing within the time-period resulted in the motion being denied by operation of law.\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656203\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/544/421/#p423\">\n    544 S.W.3d at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the court in\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   was concerned with whether the movant's failure to obtain a timely hearing warranted the trial court's denial of the movant's motion because the hearing was untimely.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656203\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/544/421/#p423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656203\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/544/421/#p423\">\n    at 422-426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fifth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Cuba\n   </em>\n   decision, on the other hand, was concerned with determining when a TCPA motion to dismiss was overruled by operation of law based on the court's failure to render a decision on the TCPA motion within a certain time period, even though no hearing was held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Second, Southwest argues that because the Fifth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Cuba\n   </em>\n   decision predates the San Antonio Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   , that Fifth Circuit precedent regarding\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   guesses would require the court to apply\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   and deny the defendants' TCPA motion as untimely. Request to Dismiss at 5-6. This court agrees. As pointed out by Southwest, in the absence of an opinion from the state's highest court, the Fifth Circuit has held that federal courts must make an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   guess, in which the courts defer to\n   intermediate state appellate court decisions, unless convinced that the state's highest court would decide otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chaney v.

Unlike the situation when the Fifth Circuit decided\n   <em>\n    Cuba\n   </em>\n   , this court has the benefit of\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   , an intermediate state court decision that held that a TCPA motion to dismiss may be denied where the movant fails to obtain a hearing within ninety days after the motion was served.\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656203\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/544/421/#p423\">\n    544 S.W.3d at 425-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finding no reasons that the Texas Supreme Court would decide otherwise, in making an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   guess on this issue, the court is bound to follow\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   and deny the defendants' TCPA motion as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Next, the defendants contend that\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable because it dealt with \"state-court rules governing the scheduling of hearings, and state procedural rules have no application in federal court.\" Response to Request to Dismiss at 2. Instead, the defendants insist that Local Rule 7.1(g) controls whether a hearing is required.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656203\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/544/421/#p423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court disagrees. The defendants do not offer any explanation to the court as to how certain TCPA provisions are substantive, yet the TCPA's accelerated hearing requirements are purely procedural and should not be applied. Put simply, the court declines to allow the defendants to have their cake and eat it, too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Lastly, the defendants contend that they were not required to schedule a hearing, because the TCPA does not specify that the movant must schedule the hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656203\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/544/421/#p423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While the defendants are correct that the statute only states that a hearing \"must be set,\" Texas state court opinions have clarified that it is the movants burden to timely obtain a hearing.\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656203\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/544/421/#p423\">\n    544 S.W.3d at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that the movant had the burden to timely obtain a hearing in his efforts to invoke the TCPA's protections).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Ultimately, for the reasons stated above, the court finds that the TCPA provides no basis for dismissing Southwest's state law claims. Accordingly, the defendants' motion to dismiss Southwest's first and sixth claims under the TCPA is denied. Furthermore, by denying the defendants' motion to dismiss under the TCPA, the court has mooted Southwest's request to dismiss the defendants' TCPA grounds. Therefore, the court denies as moot Southwest's request to dismiss and motion for attorneys' fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Application of Rule 12(b)(6)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Now that the court has dealt with the defendants' TCPA arguments, the court must consider the merits of the remaining sections of the defendants' motion to dismiss. In these sections, the defendants contend that Southwest's entire complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and thus should be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 13-24. Interestingly, the defendants neither discuss nor provide any analysis as to why Southwest's complaint fails to satisfy the pleading standards set forth in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656203\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/544/421/#p423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, the defendants attempt to \"hide the ball,\" so to speak, by bifurcating the discussion of their 12(b)(6) motion into two separate sections-the first arguing that Southwest's claims relating to the original www.SWMonkey.com fail due to Southwest's \"promise\" not to sue, and the second arguing that Southwest's claims against the disabled website fail because the defendants have ceased all offending conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656203\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/544/421/#p423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The defendants' attempt to\n   hide the ball fails, however. Southwest did not file two separate complaints against the defendants, one alleging claims based on the original SWMonkey website and the other alleging claims based on the disabled site. Nor are the claims raised by Southwest specific to certain versions of the defendants' website. Rather, Southwest's complaint states that all of the defendants' actions--from starting SWMonkey.com to disabling its functionality but keeping the website online--form the factual basis for Southwest's claims.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   , Complaint. As such, the court will not follow the defendants' lead and analyze Southwest's claims with respect to both versions of the defendants' website. Rather, the court will simply examine whether Southwest's complaint is sufficiently well-plead to state claims upon which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As previously noted, the defendants' main argument as to why Southwest's complaint fails under Rule 12(b)(6) has little to do with any alleged deficiencies in Southwest's complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-20. Rather, this argument is in all actuality the defendants' attempt to raise the affirmative defense of contractual estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Reply at 5-9 (acknowledging that contractual estoppel is raised by the defendants as an affirmative defense). The crux of the defendants' contractual estoppel argument is that the defendants' compliance with Southwest's cease-and-desist letters created a unilateral contract that bound Southwest not to sue the defendants. Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 13-19. Specifically, the defendants allege that Southwest's repeated cease-and-desist letters constituted offers for the defendants to enter into a unilateral contract with Southwest, since these letters promised the defendants a benefit if they performed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-17 (citing\n   <em>\n    Westinde v.

Accordingly, the defendants ask the court to dismiss Southwest's complaint as barred by contractual estoppel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Southwest, in its response brief, points out multiple problems with the defendants' 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 8-14. To start, Southwest explains that\n   its complaint readily satisfies the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   standard, as well as the pleading standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10. Next, Southwest correctly urges that the defendants failed to challenge the sufficiency of Southwest's pleadings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Additionally, Southwest raises three arguments as to why the defendants' contractual estoppel argument fails to support a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-14. First, Southwest maintains that an affirmative defense is an improper ground upon which to base a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Southwest contends that precedent makes clear that a Rule 12(b)(6) motion requires the court to only look at the pleadings, not affirmative defenses or allegations outside the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (citing\n   <em>\n    Spivey v. Robertson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633575\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/197/772/#p774\">\n    197 F.3d 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774 (5th Cir. 1999) ). Second, Southwest argues that its cease-and-desist letters were in no way offers to contract, since these letters made no promises and only informed the defendants that if their improper conduct did not cease, Southwest would sue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. Third, Southwest contends that even if the court were to decide the defendants' contractual estoppel argument on summary judgment, there are multiple issues of material fact that preclude a grant of summary judgment on this ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. In particular, Southwest contends that fact issues exist because: (1) Southwest's demands required the defendants to shut down their website, which the defendants did not do; and (2) the defendants' request for \"nominal\" payment in response to Southwest's cease-and-desist letters constituted a counter-offer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Consequently, Southwest asks the court to deny the defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In their reply brief, the defendants admit that their contractual estoppel argument is an affirmative defense that relies on matters outside the pleadings. Reply at 6. The defendants argue, however, that the court should apply Rule 12(d) and consider the matters outside the pleadings, thereby converting the defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; see also Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(d) (\"If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\"). The defendants respond to a number of Southwest's arguments in their reply, too. Reply to Motion to Dismiss at 7-9. First, the defendants respond to Southwest's argument that no contract was created because the defendants did not shut down their website by arguing that the literal reading of Southwest's letters, which demanded the entire website be shutdown, is not the reasonable interpretation of these letters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Rather, the defendants maintain that \"[t]he only reasonable interpretation of Southwest's demand letters was that Southwest was looking for Roundpipe to do two things: not infringe its trademarks and not scrape data from its website.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, the defendants respond to Southwest's contention that its cease-and-desist letters were not offers by arguing that \"the only reasonable interpretation of the many-emails from Southwest's lawyer was that the only way to avoid being sued was to comply with his demands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Finally, in response to Southwest's argument that the defendants request for a nominal payment was a counter-offer, the defendants maintain that their request for payment is not a counter-offer, and that even if it was, Southwest rejected it and re-tendered its original offer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   After reviewing the parties' arguments, or lack thereof, the court concludes that the defendants' motion to dismiss Southwest's complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   When Southwest's factual allegations are taken as true and viewed in the light most favorable to Southwest-as the court is required to do-it is clear that Southwest's complaint states plausible claims for breach of contract, for violations of both the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\") and section 33.02 of the Texas Penal Code (\"THACA\"), and for unfair competition, trademark infringement, and dilution under the Lanham Act. Specifically, the court concludes that Southwest's complaint states a plausible claim for breach of contract because Southwest's complaint not only identifies the existence of a valid contract (Southwest's use agreement) but it also explains how the defendants' use of automated scraping tools breached the contract and caused damage to Southwest. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v. Bank of America, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:14-CV-3186,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206977093\">\n    2014 WL 6977093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-*4 (N.D.

Additionally, the court concludes that Southwest's complaint states plausible claims for violations of the CFAA and THACA because Southwest's complaint contains factual allegations that the defendants accessed Southwest's website without authorization in violation of Southwest's use agreement, thereby causing damage to Southwest. See e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Southwest Airlines Co. v.

Tex. 2004) (concluding that the plaintiff had stated a plausible CFAA claim, where the plaintiff's complaint made similar allegations that the defendant improperly accessed Southwest's data through an automated scraping device). Furthermore, the court concludes that Southwest's complaint states plausible claims for unfair competition, trademark infringement, and dilution because Southwest's complaint alleges Southwest's ownership and registration of various marks and explains how the defendants' unauthorized use of Southwest's famous marks on www.SWMonkey.com tarnished Southwest's trademarks and likely caused consumer confusion. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Springboards to Education, Inc. v. Kipp Foundation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526773\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/325/704/#p716\">\n    325 F.Supp.3d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 716-718 (N.D. Tex. 2018) (Fish, Senior J.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Moreover, the defendants have failed to provide the court with any arguments as to how Southwest's pleading are deficient.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss; Reply. Without any argument as to how Southwest's complaint is flawed or how it fails to state any plausible claim upon which relief can be granted, the court is convinced, for the reasons articulated above, that Southwest's complaint succeeds in stating multiple plausible claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Most importantly, however, the court declines the defendants' invitation to consider their contractual estoppel affirmative defense and non-pleading materials. The defendants are correct that if the court, in evaluating the defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion, were to consider matters outside of the pleadings, such as the defendants' contractual estoppel argument, Rule 12(d) would require the court to treat their motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(d).

Although the court has not and is not deciding these issues, the court is skeptical of the defendants' arguments. For one, the court is troubled by the defendants' claim that Southwest's cease-and-desist letters constituted offers to contract, as the defendants have cited no binding authority, or authority at all for that matter, finding that a cease-and-desist letter similar to those sent by Southwest constituted an offer. In fact, the\n    <em>\n     Accurso\n    </em>\n    case relied upon by the defendants does not, in fact, establish that a cease-and-desist letter may constitute an offer to contract. Rather,\n    <em>\n     Accurso\n    </em>\n    merely establishes that a letter proposing a settlement may constitute an offer.\n    <em>\n     Accurso\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201273878\">\n     2016 WL 1273878\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4.\n    <em>\n     In re H.E. Butt GroceryCo.\n    </em>\n    similarly fails to establish that a cease-and-desist letter may constitute an offer, as the section of the opinion cited by the defendants only addresses more broadly the issue of unilateral contract formation under Texas law.\n    <em>\n     In re H.E.Butt Grocery Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11512181\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/17/360/#p370\">\n     17 S.W.3d at 370\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Even assuming that Southwest's letters constituted offers, the court has qualms about the defendants' claim that they created a unilateral contract by removing the functionality from their website and ceasing to access the fare data on Southwest's website. The letters cited by the defendants include demands such as \"Your clients ... need to shut down the website\" and \"The site needs to come down completely.\" Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 17; Reply at 7. Here, it is clear that the defendants did not shut down their website. While the defendants aver that the literal reading of Southwest's demand letters requesting the shutdown of the defendants' website is not the\n    <em>\n     reasonable\n    </em>\n    reading of these letters, the defendants provide no explanation as to\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    this is the case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply at 7-9. The lack of such an explanation raises concerns to the court. Finally, the court is dubious about the defendants' claim that its email to Southwest suggesting that Southwest make a nominal payment to the defendants did not constitute a counter-offer. In sum, because the court has these doubts, the court does not believe that evaluating the defendants' contractual estoppel argument on summary judgment would dispose of this action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
