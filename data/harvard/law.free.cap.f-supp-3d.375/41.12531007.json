Although Plaintiffs frame their challenge under various anti-discrimination statutes, the substance of their complaints concerns the District's administration of the program. As a result, they were required to litigate their claims through local administrative processes before filing suit in federal court, which they did not do. The Court therefore must dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Beginning with the most obvious claims, Counts 4 through 6 challenge DDS-RSA's alleged failure to provide specific \"auxiliary aids\"-such as \"human readers[,] automated reading machines,\" SAC \u00b6 42, and \"modern electronic magnifiers,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189548\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/464/#p477\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43-to Plaintiffs and other blind vendors.

That is clearly a challenge concerning the administration of the Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Next, Counts 7 through 18 turn on Plaintiffs' broad assertion that the District used \"secret mathematical formulas\" to \"charge[ ] class members, including plaintiffs, with vending machine deductions, set asides, and other such levies and expenses that the District of Columbia had no right or authority to charge against the account of plaintiffs and other class members.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), (b);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20395.11\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20395.11\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 58-118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court nonetheless concludes that the substance of those counts turns on the operation of the \"regime\" itself-the qualifications of the RSVFP \"monitors,\" the forms and inspection reports those monitors use, and the kind of supervision and counseling those monitors provide to blind vendors.

In the Second Amended Complaint, they allege that they were denied the benefits and services that come from counseling by trained and licensed DOH inspectors, leading to the aforementioned \"segregated regime\" where sighted vendors received quality DOH inspections while blind vendors receive unauthorized, low-quality DDA-RSA inspections. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 19-21. But the District pointed out in its motion to dismiss that it is \"a matter of indisputable public record [that] the RSVFP vending facilities plaintiffs operate\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   licensed and inspected by DOH.\" MTD at 22. In support, the District attaches to its motion copies of the most recent publicly available DOH inspection reports of Plaintiffs' facilities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204174417\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204174417\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Ex. 3, ECF No. 19-3 (available at https://dc.healthinspections.us/?a=Inspections).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs then shifted their theory for these counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 28-31. In their opposition, they argue that they \"labored under segregated DDS-RSA\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   inspections by inadequately trained DDS-RSA employees who used bogus inspection report forms, and this happened while the plaintiffs faced\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   inspections from DOH\" while \"sighted proprietors faced inspections\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   from DOH, which used credentialed inspectors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 (emphases added). In other words, Plaintiffs now complain that while sighted vendors only received inspections by DOH inspectors, blind vendors received two-fold inspections by both DOH inspectors\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   DDS-RSA monitors. But Plaintiffs did not receive the additional inspections by DDS-RSA monitors by reason of their blindness; they received additional inspections because of their participation in the District's RSVFP. For instance, the RSA implementing regulations require SLAs to \"carry out full responsibility for the supervision and management of each vending facility in its program in accordance with its established rules and regulations, this part, and the terms and conditions governing the permit\" and also \"take adequate steps to assure that each vendor understands the provisions of the permit and any agreement under which he operates, as evidenced by his signed statements.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20395.3\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(11)(i) &amp; (vi). The challenged inspections are obviously designed to fulfill these regulatory responsibilities. Because the challenged conduct-the inspections by both DOH and DDS-RSA-was not plausibly undertaken by reason of Plaintiffs' blindness, Counts I through III fail to state claims of discrimination under the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, or DCHRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ultimately though, Plaintiffs' allusions to segregation and discriminatory intent do not change the fact that their claims turn on the administration of the RSA and fall within the broad remedial scheme established for vendors' disputes regarding \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   action arising from the operation or administration of the vending facility program.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d-1(a) (emphasis added). A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, and an RSA claim brought under any other name is still subject to the Act's mandatory exhaustion requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This result is consistent with other cases in which courts have rejected \"the simple 'pleading trick' of adding a section 504 [of the Rehabilitation Act] claim to a complaint alleging violations of the [Randolph-Sheppard] Act\" that would allow plaintiffs \"to evade the exhaustion requirements specified in the Act.\"\n   <em>\n    New York v.

Despite KDB's \"styling\" the complaint \"as a challenge entirely within the Tucker Act's jurisdiction\" regarding procurement issues, the court concluded that the challenged \"issue arose out of an alleged failure\" to comply with RSA's priority scheme and thus was subject to the Act's mandatory administrative grievance procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 461-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    2.

They argue that the District of Columbia \"waived its right to demand that the plaintiffs exhaust remedies with an administrative\n   action before the OAH\" when it passed the D.C. Human Rights Act.

Pls.' First \"Praecipe,\" ECF No. 28, at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is wrong.
