Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is an Iowa insurance corporation, with its principal place of business in Clive, Iowa. (Pl. 's Compl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 1 ). From 2001 to 2018, Plaintiff issued a series of professional liability insurance policies to Defendant Ryan D. Smith (\"Defendant Smith\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). Defendant Smith is a resident of Delaware County, Ohio, with a chiropractic practice located in Franklin County, Ohio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). Defendant Smith formed Synergy Clinic, a for-profit limited liability company registered in Ohio, for the purpose of running his chiropractic business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). At the time the relevant facts arose, Defendant Smith was covered by Plaintiff's Professional Liability Insurance Policy (\"the Policy\"), number MP00923418, for a policy period from October 3, 2016 to October 3, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The present case arises from two underlying actions. Defendant Doe, a named plaintiff and representative party in\n   <em>\n    Jam Doe, et al. v. Smith, et al.\n   </em>\n   , 18-CV-003487 (\"Doe Lawsuit\") is an Ohio resident and a former patient of Defendant Smith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). On April 25, 2018, Defendant Doe, on behalf of herself and others, filed suit against Defendant Smith alleging assault, battery, and sexual misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14; Exhibit B). On May 7, 2018, Defendant Doe filed an Amended Class Action Complaint in the Doe Lawsuit to add Synergy Clinic as a named defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15; Exhibit C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In her Amended Complaint, Defendant Doe alleged that Defendant Smith \"engaged in a pattern of deplorable and illegal behavior towards [Jane Doe] and over 40 other female patients\" and \"sexually assaulted patients.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16) (citing Exhibit C). Specifically, Defendant Doe claimed that at treatment sessions between May 2017 and June 2017, Defendant Smith touched her breasts and \"positioned [her] hand behind her back at waist level ... and holding [her] arm firmly in place, pressed his genitals into [her] hands.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18) (citing Exhibit C). Defendant further claimed that Defendant Smith once required her to wear a medical gown so that he could \"manipulate the gown to expose both of her breasts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing Exhibit C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Doe asserted that \"[a]s a result of 47 women coming forward as of April 12, 2018, Smith has (as of that same date) been criminally charged with 66 counts of gross sexual imposition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20) (citing Exhibit C). The putative class members brought the following allegations against Defendant Smith: (1) assault, (2) battery, (3) medical negligence/chiropractic malpractice, (4) failure to obtain informed consent, (5) negligent invasion of privacy, (6) false imprisonment, and (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Exhibit C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Susanne Horner (\"Defendant Horner\"), a named plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Susanne Horner v. Ryan D. Smith, D.C., et al.\n   </em>\n   , 18-CV-003645 (\"Horner Lawsuit\"), is also an\n   Ohio citizen and a former patient of Defendant Smith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). On May 1, 2018, Defendant Horner filed suit against Defendant Smith and Synergy Clinic. (Pl.'s Compl. \u00b6 25) (citing Exhibit D). Defendant Horner alleged that in May 2017, Smith touched the \"pectoralis muscle of [her] left breast in a way that made [her] feel uncomfortable\" and \"guided [her] hand behind her back and placed his penis in her hand.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26) (citing Exhibit D). Defendant Horner asserted the following counts in her complaint: (1) assault, (2) battery, (3) negligence, (4) failure to obtain informed consent, and (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Exhibit D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff filed the instant action on May 31, 2018, seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend, indemnify, or otherwise offer liability coverage to Defendant Smith or Synergy Clinic in connection with any claims asserted in the Doe and Horner Lawsuits. (Pl.'s Compl. \u00b6 A-H). On My 31, 2018, Defendant Doe filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint, or alternatively, a Motion to Stay Proceedings pending the conclusion of the underlying state court litigation. (ECF No. 8 ). On August 20, 2018, Plaintiff filed its Response in Opposition. (ECF No. 9 ). On September 17, 2018, Defendant Doe filed her Reply brief. (ECF No. 13 ). Three days later, on September 20, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to File Sur-Reply. (ECF No. 14 ). On October 11, 2018, Defendant Doe responded with a Motion to Strike, or alternatively, a Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Sur-Reply. (ECF No. 17 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   That same day, the Court ordered Plaintiff to show cause within fourteen days why it should not dismiss this action against Synergy Chiropractic without prejudice for failure to effect service. (ECF No. 16 ). Plaintiff moved for default judgment against Defendant Smith on October 18, 2018. (ECF No. 19 ). On October 22, 2018, the Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that: (1) Plaintiff's Motion for Default Judgment be denied without prejudice, and (2) Plaintiff's claims against Synergy Chiropractic be dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Rule 4(m). (ECF No. 20 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 13, 2018, Defendant Doe filed a Supplemental Affidavit of Alexander J. Durst in support of her Motion to Dismiss or Stay Proceedings. (ECF No. 31 ). Plaintiff filed a Motion to Strike the Supplemental Affidavit on November 27, 2018. (ECF No. 33 ). One day later, the Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendations (ECF No. 20 ), denying Plaintiffs Motion for Default Judgement without prejudice and dismissing Plaintiff's claims against Synergy Chiropractic without prejudice. (ECF No. 34 ). On December 27, 2018, Defendant Doe filed a Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Strike. (ECF No. 37 ). Plaintiff filed a Reply brief in support of its Motion to Strike on January 2, 2019. (ECF No. 39 ). All motions are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Analysis of Plaintiffs Motion for Leave to File Sur-reply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Guyton\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff argues that a sur-reply is warranted because Defendant Doe \"misrepresents the current status of the state court litigation between her, Defendant [Smith], and [Plaintiff].\" (Pl.'s Mot. for Sur-reply at 2, ECF No. 14 ). Specifically, Plaintiff suggests that although the \"Franklin County Court of Common Pleas granted [Defendant] Doe's motion to amend her complaint (in a seemingly perfunctory manner), [Plaintiff] has not yet had any opportunity to move to dismiss [Defendant] Doe's newly-added claims against it.\" (Pl.'s Amended Mot. for Sur-reply at 2-3, ECF No. 15-1 ). Thus, Plaintiff argues it is not yet a participant in the litigation. Defendant Doe moves to strike Plaintiffs Sur-reply, arguing that Plaintiff \"not only fails to establish good cause for the allowance of a sur-reply brief, but strongly misconstrues [Defendant] Doe's reply brief.\" (Def.'s Mot. to Strike Sur-reply at 1, ECF No. 17 ). In Defendant Doe's view, she \"never stated or in any way implied that NCMIC had been served or participated in the state case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court declines to conclude whether Defendant Doe's characterization of the state court litigation contained misstatements. Instead, the Court notes that \"in this circuit, there is 'a strong preference that claims be adjudicated on the merits.' \"\n   <em>\n    National City Bank v.

Appx. 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157 (6th Cir. 2003) ).

Although Defendant contends that permitting additional briefing will raise attorneys' fees and cause undue delay, Plaintiff has already filed its proposed Sur-reply. (ECF No. 15-1 ). No additional delay is necessary. As the tendered Sur-reply addresses the merits of this Court's jurisdiction, the Court will consider it. Consequently, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Amended Motion for Leave to File Sur-reply. (ECF No. 15-1 ). Defendant Doe's Motion to Strike Plaintiffs Sur-reply is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   (ECF No. 17 ), and Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Sur-reply is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   (ECF No. 14 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Analysis of Defendant's 12(b)(1) Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The central issue at this time is whether the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's declaratory judgment claim. Defendant Doe argues the Court should dismiss the case because there are no \"claims or issues of federal law in either this declaratory judgment action or the underlying state law litigation.\" (Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 2, ECF No. 8 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Defendant Doe points out, Defendant Doe and Defendant Horner's negligence, malpractice, and intentional tort claims are governed exclusively by Ohio law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). Defendant Doe further claims the \"insurance coverage question is already being litigated in one of the state cases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Moreover, in Defendant Doe's view, the present suit is a waste of judicial resources because this Court would need \"extensive understanding of the facts in the underlying cases ... in order to resolve the question of [whether] or not coverage is due.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Accordingly, Defendant Doe asserts that this Court should decline subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act.

First, Plaintiff claims that Defendant Doe's characterization of ongoing state litigation is misleading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). Specifically, Plaintiff points out that it has not been served or formally named a defendant in any of the state court actions against Defendant Smith.

(Pl.'s Opp'n at 8). Moreover, Plaintiff contends that, like in\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   , the insurance coverage question cannot be considered in state court. Specifically, Plaintiff maintains that its party or non-party status in state court bears little relevance in the present controversy because O.R.C. \u00a7 2721.02(B) bars a declaratory judgment in state court. (Pl.'s Sur-reply at 2, ECF No. 15-1 ). O.R.C. \u00a7 2721.02(B) provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [A] plaintiff who is not an insured under a particular policy of liability insurance may not commence against the insurer that issued the policy an action ... that seeks declaratory judgment or decree as to whether the policy's coverage provisions\n   extended to an injury, ... until a court of record enters in a distinct civil action for damages between the plaintiff and that insured as a tortfeasor a final judgment awarding the plaintiff damages for the injury, death, or loss to person or property involved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   O.R.C. \u00a7 2721.02(B). Thus, Plaintiff asserts that, \"under the\n   <em>\n    plain language\n   </em>\n   of the statute,\" Defendant Doe cannot attain a declaratory judgment in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas until or unless a final judgment is entered against Defendant Smith. (Pl.'s Sur-reply at 2) (emphasis in original). As a result, Plaintiff claims it \"intends to promptly move to dismiss [Defendant] Doe's claims against it\" in state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff distinguishes the present case from\n   <em>\n    Bituminous Cas. Corp. v.

Because the plaintiff in the underlying state court action was not a party to the declaratory judgment action, \"any judgment in federal court would not be binding as to him and could not be res judicata in a tort action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9234417\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/807/#p814\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Sixth Circuit held that a declaratory judgment would not resolve the insurance coverage controversy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9234417\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/807/#p814\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Plaintiff points out that the plaintiffs in the underlying state court action (i.e., Defendants Doe and Horner) are parties in the instant litigation. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9234417\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/807/#p814\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, any declaratory judgment in federal court would be binding on them. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9234417\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/807/#p814\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Accordingly, Plaintiff argues this Court can fully settle the insurance coverage controversy without undermining any ongoing state court litigation.

As indicated by the Sixth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   , a \"declaratory relief action can settle the insurance coverage controversy\n   <em>\n    not being addressed in state court\n   </em>\n   , even though it will not help resolve the underlying state court action.\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/\">\n    513 F.3d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (\n   <em>\n    see also,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Northland Insurance Co. v.

In Count Nine of her Second Amended Class Action Complaint (i.e., Doe Lawsuit), Defendant Doe seeks a declaratory judgment that Plaintiff must indemnify Defendant Smith pursuant to Ohio's Declaratory Judgments Act. (Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, Exhibit A \u00b6 78-84). However, the insurance coverage question is not presently being addressed in state court. Plaintiff correctly notes that O.R.C. \u00a7 2721.02(B) bars the state court from issuing a declaratory judgment until or unless liability is found against Defendant Smith, (Pl.'s Sur-reply at 2). In addition, Plaintiff accurately states that O.R.C. \u00a7 2721.02(B) contains no provision which waive a party's \"right to object\" to a declaratory judgment in state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, the first\n   <em>\n    Grand Trunk\n   </em>\n   factor favors Plaintiff's position. Plaintiff is a party to the state court action, yet O.R.C, \u00a7 2721.02(B) precludes the state court from addressing the insurance coverage controversy. Defendants Doe and Horner must obtain a state court judgment against Defendant Smith for the underlying tort claims before seeking a state court declaratory judgment regarding his insurance policy. Consequently, a federal judgment would settle the controversy,\n   and the first factor supports federal subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

For instance, Defendant Doe points out that \"it is not yet clear whether the Franklin County court will certify the [underlying state court] matter as a class action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). Moreover, Defendant Doe states that additional Jane Does will likely be identified in the future, making it difficult to clarify legal relations at this stage in the litigation.

In\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   , a patient brought a tort action against her chiropractor, alleging malpractice, intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress, spoliation of evidence, tortious alteration of records, and negligent hiring or retention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The suit arose from a consensual sexual relationship between the patient and the chiropractor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although the patient did not allege sexual abuse because the relationship was consensual, the court noted that a medical malpractice type theory will not support a \"claim based on an intentional act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 n.1. In other words, a patient may not frame sexual abuse from a medical practitioner as medical malpractice. The\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   court went on to state that \"[sexual abuse] as an intentional act, ... generally would not be covered by professional malpractice insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Zuidema v. Pedicano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439875\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/373/135/\">\n    373 N.J.

Thus, Ohio law on this issue (while limited), is not nonexistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Second, the Court affords this consideration slightly less weight. Unlike the\n   <em>\n    Northland\n   </em>\n   plaintiff, Plaintiff is a party in the state court action. However, a state court may not address the insurance coverage question without running afoul of O.R.C. \u00a7 2721.02(B). The Court finds the situation described\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D'Atri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2034655\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/375/761/#p763\">\n    375 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   763 to be relatively analogous:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   There are, however, important differences in the matters presented in the district court and the [state court] proceedings. Whether the insurance company is contractually obligated to defend and protect [its insured] involves considerations\n   that are not relevant to whether *1066 or not [the insured], as a matter of tort law, is liable for the damages incurred by [the tort plaintiff]. Since the [insurer] is not, and could not be, under Ohio law ... a party to the state court action, it is powerless under the district court's disposition of the case, presently to ascertain the scope of its liability. It must, consequently, defend a party to whom it does not believe it owes a duty, or assume the risk that that party will go defenseless-or be defended by someone whose interests are adverse to those of the company. In either event, should a judgment be rendered against [its insured], it must expose itself to future suits for collection, or bring another declaratory judgment action, and then assert the same theory it now seeks to have vindicated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10550172\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/825/1061/\">\n    825 F.2d at 1065-1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Ohio law bars the consideration of insurance coverage until tort liability is found. Consequently, as in\n   <em>\n    D'Atri\n   </em>\n   , a denial of federal jurisdiction would force Plaintiff to defend \"a party to whom it does not believe it owes a duty\" or run the risk of a subsequent bad faith claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2034655\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/375/761/#p763\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, Ohio courts-while better versed in Ohio law-are not in a better position to evaluate the insurance coverage question. Accordingly, the exercise of federal jurisdiction would not \"offend principles of comity.\"\n   <em>\n    Northland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9137078\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/448/#p454\">\n    327 F.3d at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The second subfactor supports jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Finally, with respect to the third subfactor, the Court finds that the scope of Defendant Smith's medical malpractice insurance is tied to Ohio public policy. As noted by the Sixth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Bituminous\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9234417\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/807/#p814\">\n    373 F.3d at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"[s]tates regulate insurance companies for the protection of their residents, and state courts are best situated to identify and enforce public policies that form the foundation of such regulation.\" Moreover, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that Ohio \"public policy is contrary to insurance against intentional torts.\"\n   <em>\n    Wedge Products, Inc. v. Hartford Equity Sales Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1827159\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/31/65/#p67\">\n    31 Ohio St. 3d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=509%20N.E.2d%2074\">\n    509 N.E.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987).

Ohio 1962) (holding same). Accordingly, the \"close nexus\" between the factual issues and Ohio public policy favors a decision by the state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Because two of the three subfactors favor jurisdiction, the Court finds that a decision by the district court is unlikely to encroach on state jurisdiction. The fourth\n   <em>\n    Grand Trunk\n   </em>\n   factor weighs against dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Is There an Alternative Remedy?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, the Court considers whether an alternative remedy is available. Defendant Doe argues that an alternative remedy exists in the form of Ohio's Declaratory Judgment Act, O.R.C. \u00a7 2721.02(B). (Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 12) (citing\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562780\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/266/#p271\">\n    495 F.3d at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that Kentucky's Declaratory Judgment Act provided an alternative remedy to federal jurisdiction) ). Plaintiff counters that Defendant Doe's proposed alternative remedy would violate Ohio law. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 14). As noted by Plaintiff, seeking declaratory judgment under O.R.C. \u00a7 2721.02(B) is \"statutorily prohibited unless and until [Defendant] Doe has a final judgment against the alleged\n   tortfeasor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Furthermore, Plaintiff argues that, even assuming judgment is eventually entered against Defendant Smith, utilizing Ohio's Declaratory Judgment Act will not provide an adequate alternative remedy. In Plaintiff's view, it \"does not even have a duty to defend [Defendant] Smith.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Therefore, waiting to bring a declaratory judgment claim in state court will \"have prejudiced [Plaintiff] from asserting it has no duty of defense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, Plaintiff argues that barring federal jurisdiction raises the risk of inconsistent state rulings because of the \"multiplicity of these suits all grounded in the same types of allegedly sexually abusive acts by [Defendant] Smith.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   A district court should \"deny declaratory relief if an alternative remedy is better or more effective.\"\n   <em>\n    Grand Trunk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648811\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/746/323/#p326\">\n    746 F.2d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"One of the alternative remedies available to the federal declaratory plaintiff is to seek a declaratory judgment in state court.\"\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/\">\n    513 F.3d at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, a plaintiff could file an indemnity action after the conclusion of the state court case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   court noted \"it is not clear whether such alternative remedies are better or more effective than a federal declaratory action ... our precedent is split regarding whether the possibility of seeking a declaratory judgment or an indemnity action in state court counsels against the district court exercising jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Comparing\n   <em>\n    Northland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9137078\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/448/#p454\">\n    327 F.3d at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"intervening in the state court action would not have necessarily provided a better or more effective alternative remedy\") with\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562780\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/266/#p271\">\n    495 F.3d at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the alternative remedies of a state declaratory judgment or indemnity action \"weighed against federal discretionary jurisdiction\"). Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   court concluded the inquiry is fact specific, \"involving consideration of the whole package of options available to the federal declaratory plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/\">\n    513 F.3d at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Here, Plaintiff may not assert a declaratory judgment action in state court until and unless judgment is entered against Defendant Smith. Consequently, this option provides Plaintiff with no ability to argue it has no duty to defend Defendant Smith. Rather, Plaintiff would be obligated to represent Defendant Smith in state court or risk the consequences of allowing Defendant Smith to proceed without counsel. The Court concludes a declaratory judgment action in state court is not a viable alternative remedy-much less a better or more effective one. Similarly, the Court finds an indemnity action would not be a superior alternative for Plaintiff. Plaintiff would have to wait until the liability issues were resolved before determining its contractual obligations to Defendant Smith. Thus, the fifth\n   <em>\n    Grand Trunk\n   </em>\n   factor favors federal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Balancing the\n    <em>\n     Grand Trunk\n    </em>\n    Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   On balance, the\n   <em>\n    Grand Trunk\n   </em>\n   factors weigh against dismissal. The first three factors point towards exercising jurisdiction. The fourth factor, while not entirely in favor of a federal forum, is \"at worst neutral about the exercise of jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/\">\n    at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the fifth factor supports Plaintiff's position that state court remedies are not superior or more effective to a federal declaratory judgment. Accordingly, the Court finds that exercising federal subject matter jurisdiction is appropriate.

Therefore, Plaintiffs Motion to Strike the Supplemental Affidavit is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED AS MOOT.\n   </strong>\n   (ECF No. 33 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Amended Motion for Leave to File Sur-reply (ECF No. 15 );\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendant Doe's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Sur-reply (ECF No. 17 ); and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss or Stay Proceedings (ECF No. 8 ).
