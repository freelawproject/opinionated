For the reasons stated below, the Court grants Reyes Nunez's motion and dismisses the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Reyes Nunez was born in El Puerto de la Libertad, on the southern coast of El Salvador on June 10, 1988. (Def's. Mot. to Dismiss (\"Def's. Mot.\"), Dkt. 16, at 2.) At that time, El Salvador was in the midst of a civil war, and Reyes Nunez's parents decided to move the family to Honduras shortly after his birth, settling in a small farming village in the state of Yoro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Reyes Nunez's father worked as a farmer and his mother sold food to local laborers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Reyes Nunez's father left the family in 1994 and the family was homeless periodically over the next few years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 1998, following Hurricane Mitch, which battered the state of Yoro, Reyes Nunez's mother left for the United States to find work, and Reyes Nunez went to live with his uncle, and later, a local landowner named Don Jose Truchero in the municipality of El Progreso. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Around this time, the transnational gang MS-13 began to recruit Reyes Nunez and encourage him to commit criminal acts. His paternal uncle, Efrain Reyes, was murdered by the gang in 1998. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Reyes Nunez resisted the gang and was violently attacked on numerous occasions as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The attacks prompted him to move back to El Puerto de la Libertad in El Salvador, but MS-13 had an active presence there too, and the harassment continued. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) His father, living in the United States, was contacted by a gang member who threatened to \"come after\" Reyes Nunez if his father did not pay extortion money. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Reyes Nunez moved back to Honduras and attended a trade school, but was again targeted by the gang upon his return. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April of 2006, at the age of 17, Reyes Nunez swam across the Rio Grande River to enter the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) He was apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Agents (\"CBP\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He admitted to the agents that he was \"a native and citizen of El Salvador by birth,\" that he entered the United States illegally, and that he \"had no documents to remain in the United States legally.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Reyes Nunez was detained in a holding cell with \"at least 20 other undocumented people\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   and was given a Notice of Custody Determination, which stated that Reyes Nunez would be detained by Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") \"pending a final determination by the immigration judge in [his] case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) Reyes Nunez signed that document, along with a Notice to Respondent, which stated that he would \"be advised by the immigration judge before whom [he] appear[s], of any relief from removal for which [he] may appear eligible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) His signature appears under the statement, \"To expedite a determination in my case, I request an immediate hearing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Reyes Nunez also signed a Request For Disposition of Salvadorans, checking next to two paragraphs, one in English and one in Spanish, that stated, in relevant part: \"I wish to request a hearing before an immigration judge to determine whether I may remain in, or be removed from the United States. I understand that if I wish to request political asylum I must request a hearing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) The form also stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Right to Apply for Political Asylum\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   If you fear persecution because of your race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, you may request political asylum. If you wish to apply for political asylum you should advise the officer who gave you this notice. An immigration judge will decide if you will be given or denied political asylum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Right to Request Voluntary Departure\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   If you want to return to El Salvador, you may ask to be allowed to depart on the first available transportation. By agreeing to depart voluntarily, you give up your right to a deportation hearing and your right to apply for political asylum. If you request to depart voluntarily and then change your mind at any time before you actually go home, you may still request a hearing before a judge. You may also make a request to the judge at the hearing to depart voluntarily.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (Notice of Rights to Salvadorans 4/26/06, Dkt. 17-10, at 9-10.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Reyes Nunez was criminally prosecuted pursuant to an initiative called Operation Streamline, an enhanced prosecution initiative in Del Rio, Texas, in which \"Border Patrol refer[red] aliens entering the United States illegally for the first time or attempting re-entry to DOJ for criminal prosecution.\" (Def's. Mot., at 11.) A few days after his arrest, Reyes Nunez appeared in front of a U.S. Magistrate Judge in Del Rio, for a hearing on his alleged misdemeanor of unlawful entry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) Reyes Nunez received counsel from a Criminal Justice Act (\"CJA\") attorney, Robert Garza, who was appointed to represent multiple defendants on the docket on the same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) The Magistrate Judge addressed a \"crowd of defendants as a group\", with the translation being provided through headphones to the defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) The group \"pled guilty en masse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) On May 3, 2006, Reyes Nunez was sentenced to 90 days' imprisonment. (Government's Opposition (\"Gov. Opp'n\"), Dkt. 19, at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 15, 2006, Reyes Nunez signed a second Request for Disposition of Salvadorans, checking a paragraph in Spanish where he admitted to being in the country illegally, waiving his right to a hearing before an immigration judge (\"IJ\"), and asking to return to his home country. (Notice of Rights to Salvadorans 6/15/06, Dkt. 17-13, at 12.) He also signed a Stipulated Request For Order/Waiver of Hearing (\"Stipulated Removal\"), which stated that he understood the consequences of signing the Stipulated Removal, including the fact that he would be removed from the country\n   and that he was waiving his right to appeal the written order of removal. (Def's. Mot., at 13.) The Stipulated Removal stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I do not wish to apply for relief from removal pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (hereinafter the Act). I am NOT seeking the relief of voluntary departure, political asylum, withholding of removal, adjustment of status, registry, review of a termination of conditional resident status, review of a denial or revocation of temporary protected status, family unity benefits, legalization benefits, cancellation of removal, naturalization, or any other possible relief or other benefits under the Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (Stipulated Removal, Dkt. 17-13, at 5.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Reyes Nunez stated that he signed these documents because an immigration officer told him it \"would speed up my deportation if [he] signed it.\" (Def's. Mot., at 13.) An immigration officer certified that he had read the form to Reyes Nunez in Spanish and that Reyes Nunez indicated that he \"had no fear of return to his ... native country.\" (Gov. Opp'n., at 7.) Reyes Nunez did not have an immigration attorney at any point in his 2006 removal proceedings or any time thereafter. (Def's. Mot., at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The order removing Reyes Nunez was entered on July 7, 2006 (\"2006 Removal Order\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The removal order from the IJ states that, \"[u]pon the basis of respondent's admissions, I have determined that the respondent is subject to removal on the charge(s) contained in the Notice to Appear.... Respondent has made no application for relief from removal.\" (Order of the Immigration Judge, Dkt 17-13, at 3.) This was the only statement that the IJ made in the removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Reyes Nunez re-entered the United States three times thereafter and was deported two of those times. Each time, the removal order was a reinstatement of the 2006 Removal Order. (Gov. Opp'n., at 7-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Reyes Nunez's first post-2006 removal occurred after he was arrested in October 2008 in New York County for robbery in the Second Degree. He pled guilty to the offense in August 2009 and was sentenced to time served. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) On August 17, 2009, he was transferred to Department of Homeland Security custody and deported on November 13, 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   His second post-2006 removal occurred after he was apprehended by CBP on April 29, 2010, having just swum across the Rio Grande River. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) In a sworn statement in Spanish, Reyes Nunez stated that he did not have \"any fear of persecution or torture\" if he were to be removed from the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On June 23, 2010, he pled guilty to illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b)(1), and was sentenced to 37 months' imprisonment soon thereafter. He finished his sentence and was removed to El Salvador on February 8, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Reyes Nunez re-entered the United States again some time before April 30, 2017, when he was arrested for driving without a license in Middleton, Pennsylvania. On August 3, 2017, Reyes Nunez was apprehended by immigration officers in Queens, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) When asked by an immigration officer in Spanish why he had come to the United States, he responded that he was \"afraid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, he also responded \"no\" when the officer asked whether he had \"any fear of persecution or torture should [he] be removed from the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Reyes Nunez also told the officer, \"If you're going to deported [sic] me, do it as soon as possible. I need to see what I am going to do with my life.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 24, 2017, Reyes Nunez was charged with illegal reentry. He was indicted on one count of illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) on September 6, 2017. Reyes Nunez now moves to dismiss the indictment. (Def's. Mot., Dkt. 16.) The government filed an opposition on May 16, 2018. (Gov. Opp'n, Dkt. 19.) The Court held oral argument on June 12, 2018. Thereafter, the Court requested, and the parties submitted, supplemental briefing on the issue of whether the 2006 Removal Order was deficient under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.25\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) because the IJ had not determined whether Reyes Nunez's waiver of rights was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.

(Def's. Mot., at 1, 28.) Reyes Nunez claims that he requested a hearing with an immigration judge, but then was sent weeks later to see a criminal judge for a guilty plea \"en masse\" without any opportunity to ask or answer individualized questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) Reyes Nunez asserts that the IJ ultimately failed to comply with \u00a7 1003.25(b) by not ascertaining whether Reyes Nunez's written waiver was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. (Def's. Supp., at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The government responds that Reyes Nunez's removal proceedings were fundamentally fair because he was repeatedly presented with documents explaining his rights, including the right to seek \"asylum\" and \"voluntary departure.\" (Gov. Opp'n, at 16.) The government emphasizes that the record includes affirmations from CBP officials that Reyes Nunez had been read, and understood, the contents of the documents he was presented to sign and that he had no fear of return to his home country.

Reyes Nunez was not represented by counsel when he signed the Stipulated Removal form, waiving his right to appeal the deportation order. Reyes Nunez signed a certification acknowledging that he had read the form, and that the form was also read to him in a language he understood. Reyes Nunez initialed each paragraph. The immigration officer also signed the form, certifying that he had explained the contents and meaning of the document to Reyes Nunez in a language which he understood. The IJ then entered the removal order, stating: \"[u]pon the basis of respondent's admissions, I have determined that the respondent is subject to removal on the charge(s) contained in the Notice to Appear.... Respondent has made no application for relief from removal.\" (Order of the Immigration Judge, at 3.) The IJ made no other statements on the removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   It is undisputed that Reyes Nunez was not represented by an attorney at the time he signed the waiver and that the IJ did not make an express finding that Reyes Nunez's waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov. Supp., at 1.) The IJ also neglected to include any language indicating that Reyes Nunez's waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent beyond the single statement that the IJ had \"determined that the respondent is subject to removal on the charge(s) contained in the Notice to Appear.\" (Order of the Immigration Judge, at 3.) The Court disagrees with the government's argument that the record supports an \"implicit finding\" that Reyes Nunez's waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. (Gov. Supp., at 1.) Reyes Nunez, an uncounseled alien, whose native and only language is Spanish, faced a distinct disadvantage trying to navigate the bureaucratic tangle of immigration law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Drax v.

Reyes Nunez's choice to sign a multitude of forms waiving his rights, including the Stipulated Removal and Request for Disposition of Salvadorans, did\n   not absolve the IJ of his responsibility to ensure that an uncounseled alien's waiver was valid. The IJ's failure to determine the validity of Reyes Nunez's waiver violated \u00a7 1003.25(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Having found that the IJ committed a procedural error by not complying with \u00a7 1003.25(b), the Court now turns to whether this error implicated Reyes Nunez's fundamental rights. The parties recognize that the Second Circuit has not expressly ruled on this question. Yet the parties disagree on how to interpret Second Circuit precedent concerning fundamental rights in the immigration context. Reyes Nunez relies on the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Reyes Nunez argues that the IJ's error deprived him of \"the right to apply for voluntary departure in lieu of deportation, either at the outset of his\n   removal proceeding (to the exclusion of any other applications for relief) or at the end of the evidentiary hearing on his asylum\" because the IJ did not advise him of this right.
