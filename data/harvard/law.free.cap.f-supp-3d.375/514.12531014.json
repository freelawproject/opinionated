ECF 16-1 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April, 2015, Karen Cegalis (\"Cegalis\") filed a lawsuit against the Knutsens, claiming that the Knutsens \"conspired to create a campaign to cause severe estrangement of Leif Cegalis from his mother Karen Cegalis.\" ECF 16-3 at 1-2, ECF 16-1 at 2. Leif Cegalis is the child of Raymond Knutsen and Karen Cegalis. ECF 16-3 at 1. Cegalis' Complaint alleges that, inter alia, the Knutsens prevented contact between her and her son, violated Court Orders to not engage in discussing their Family Court case with Leif Cegalis, brainwashed Leif Cegalis against Karen Cegalis, recklessly or knowingly made defamatory statements about Karen Cegalis to Leif Cegalis, tortuously interfered with Karen Cegalis' custodial rights, and \"engaged in a crusade to prosecute Karen Cegalis for unsubstantiated allegations of abuse towards Leif Cegalis.\" ECF 16-3 at 2. The Complaint alleged four separate claims: Negligence, Breach of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Intentional Torts. ECF 16-3. In terms of damages, Karen Cegalis sought \"damages in an amount sufficient to compensate her for her damages including but not limited to past, present and future damages for physical pain, suffering [sic] emotional damages, economic damages for the cost of litigating false accusations, counseling costs and other equivalent out of pocket expenses.\" ECF 16-3 at 5. Damages are for \"compensation of medical bills past, present and future\" and \"for pain and suffering past, present and future.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 23, 2015, the Knutsens contacted State Farm and requested that State Farm provide insurance coverage for the claims asserted against them in the Cegalis Complaint. ECF 16-1 at 2. State Farm replied on October 28, 2015, denying insurance coverage for the claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   State Farm determined that the claims in the Cegalis Complaint are not covered by the Policy. ECF 16-4 at 1. The Policy provides personal liability coverage to the Knutsens as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   If a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this coverage applies, caused by an occurrence, we will:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. Pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the insured is legally liable; and\n   2. Provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice. We may make any investigation and settle any claim or suit that we decide is appropriate. Our obligation to defend any claim or suit ends when the amount we pay for damages, to effect settlement or satisfy a judgment resulting from the occurrence, equals our limit of liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ECF 16-2 at 24. The Policy defines \"bodily injury\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. \"Bodily injury\" means physical injury, sickness, or disease to a person. This includes required care, loss of services and death resulting therefrom.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Bodily injury does not include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   a. Any of the following which are communicable: disease, bacteria, parasite, virus, or other organism, any of which are transmitted by any insured to any other person;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   b. The exposure to any such disease, bacteria, parasite, virus, or other organism by any insured to any other person; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   c.

Additionally, the Policy contains the following coverage exclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Coverage L [Personal Liability] and Coverage M [Medical Payments to Others] do not apply to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   a. bodily injury or property damages:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) which is either expected or intended by the insured; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) which is the result of willful or malicious acts of the insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Trial for the Cegalis lawsuit began on June 5, 2017. ECF 16-1 at 2. At trial, Cegalis described how the alleged acts by the Knutsens were affecting her: \"I couldn't concentrate ... I was starting to have physical symptoms, tingling and numbness in my fingers and just this brain fog.\" ECF 16-5 at 3. Cegalis added that she also had \"trouble sleeping.\" ECF 16-5 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 5, 2017, the trial judge announced the close of evidence and gave the jury closing instructions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The instructions attached to the Knutsen Complaint in Rutland Superior Court are not signed by the trial judge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The instructions for the Negligence claim instruct jurors that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   To prove that the Knutsens were negligent Ms. Cegalis must prove all the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) That the Knutsens had a duty to Ms. Cegalis; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (2) They failed to use reasonable care in discharging that duty; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (3) The Knutsen's [sic] failure to use reasonable care caused physical injury to Ms. Cegalis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   ECF 16-6 at 3. The instructions further provide that \"[i]f you find that the Knutsens breached a duty toward Ms. Cegalis, then you must decide whether Ms. Cegalis has proved that the breach caused physical harm to her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The jury returned a verdict for Cegalis and eventually awarded her $ 500 in damages: $ 499 for negligence and $ 1 for intentional infliction of emotional distress. ECF16-1 at 3. On October 7, 2017, the court ordered that the Cegalis lawsuit be re-tried.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On November 1, 2017, the Knutsens' attorney wrote to State Farm, renewing their claim for insurance coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On January 19, 2018, State Farm wrote back to the Knutsens, reiterating State Farm's position that there is no coverage for the Cegalis claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On April 2, 2018, Cegalis filed an Amended Complaint. ECF 16-1 at 4. The Amended Complaint is identical to the original Complaint except that Count IV is now labeled 'Defamation' instead of 'Intentional Torts.'\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That same month, the Knutsens renewed their request for insurance coverage, and State Farm again replied that there was no insurance coverage for the disputed claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   State Farm now moves for summary judgment arguing that it has no duty to defend the Cegalis lawsuit because the Cegalis Complaint does not allege that Cegalis sustained \"bodily injury\" as that term is defined in the Policy. ECF 16 at 6. State Farm also argues that it has no duty to defend the Cegalis lawsuit because the Cegalis Complaint alleges that the harm to Cegalis was \"expected or intended\" or was \"willful and malicious.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

When contractual parties have not specified the state law to be applied in a given case, Vermont uses the test laid out in Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 188 (the \"Restatement\") to determine which state has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1135284\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/980/747/#p750\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKinnon v.

The Restatement considers five factors in determining the law applicable including: (1) the place of contracting, (2) the place of negotiation of the contract, (3) the place of performance, (4) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and (5) the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business to the parties. Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 188.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, the balance of factors weighs heavily in Vermont's favor. The Knutsens are residents of Castleton, Vermont and State Farm has its principal place of business in Illinois. ECF 1 at 1. The contract at issue is a Homeowners Insurance Policy\n   purchased by the Knutsens from State Farm. The Knutsens are alleging that State Farm has a duty, under this contract, to defend them in a lawsuit in Vermont state court. The alleged acts which gave rise to the state court lawsuit occurred in Vermont. Vermont has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties, and thus Vermont state law applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3. State Farm Has No Duty to Defend or Indemnify the Knutsens in the Cegalis Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   An insurer has a duty to defend \"whenever it is clear that the claim against the insured might be of the type covered by the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Garneau v.

This duty does not extend, however, to circumstances where, as a matter of law, there is no duty to indemnify.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4839533\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/363/#p366\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the issue in this case is whether the Cegalis Complaint contains claims which are potentially or arguably within the Policy, requiring a duty to defend from State Farm. More specifically, the question is whether Cegalis' claims of emotional distress fall within the Policy's definition of \"bodily injury,\" which she argues is the basis for State Farm's duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   When looking at unsettled areas of state law, a federal court must \"carefully ... predict how the state's highest court would resolve the uncertainty or ambiguity.\"\n   <em>\n    Maska U.S., Inc. v.

These slight, physical manifestations may offer insight into the severity or extent of Cegalis' emotional harm, but they are thin facts upon which to rest a duty to defend.
