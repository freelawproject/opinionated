Both the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   and Defendant's comments in support of the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   rely on language from\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   discussing why export price, cost of production, and constructed value \"should be increased together, or not at all\" in order to achieve a \"duty-neutral\" comparison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 8, 11 n.36; Def.'s Resp. 7-8. This reference to\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   is taken out of context.

Generally, Commerce makes a duty drawback adjustment to a respondent's U.S. price to account for duties rebated and exempted by reason of exportation of the finished product to the United States. Commerce makes a separate adjustment to a respondent's cost of production and constructed value to reflect import duties incurred when the finished product is sold in the home market.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Habas Sinai ve Tibbi Gazlar Istihsal End\u00fcstrisi A.S. v.

Commerce again departs from the legislative purpose of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(B). As stated in the court's previous Opinion and Order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The purpose of a duty drawback adjustment is to ensure a fair comparison between normal value and export price. Under a duty drawback program, a producer may receive an exemption or rebate from their home government for duties on imported inputs used to produce merchandise that is subsequently exported to the U.S. As a result, producers are still required to pay import duties for domestically-sold goods, which leads to an increase in normal value. A duty drawback adjustment corrects this imbalance, which could otherwise lead to an inaccurately high dumping margin, by increasing [export price] to the level it likely would be absent the duty drawback.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Tos\u00e7elik I\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526271\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/1270/\">\n    321 F.Supp.3d at 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted). The upward adjustment to export price contemplated by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(B) aids Commerce's statutory duty to make a fair comparison between normal value and export price in antidumping duty investigations. Commerce's action on remand here negates the statutory duty drawback adjustment that Tos\u00e7elik earned by exporting its finished product to the United States and impinges on the agency's ability to make a fair comparison. The court concludes that the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   are not in accordance with the law and remands this case for a second redetermination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Tos\u00e7elik also contends that the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   are not supported by substantial evidence. Defendant argues that because Tos\u00e7elik failed to raise this issue in administrative proceedings before Commerce, it cannot assert it before the court under the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Because the court remands the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   to Commerce for a second redetermination, the court need not reach this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Zekelman argued that Commerce's decision was unsupported by substantial evidence because Commerce failed to address contrary evidence on the record allegedly showing that Tos\u00e7elik overstated its warehousing expenses in its questionnaire responses. The court agreed with\n   Zekelman and remanded the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   for Commerce to \"adequately address contrary evidence on the record and provide clear and discernable reasons for its decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Tos\u00e7elik I\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526271\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/1270/\">\n    321 F.Supp.3d at 1281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On remand, Commerce continued to grant Tos\u00e7elik a circumstances of sale adjustment for warehousing expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 16-17. Relying on Tos\u00e7elik's September 28, 2015 Section B Questionnaire Response and March 28, 2016 Supplemental Questionnaire Response, Commerce found that Tos\u00e7elik did not overstate its warehousing expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.

The accounting records showed the total quantity of goods shipped at the warehouse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Tos\u00e7elik removed scrap generation expenses that related exclusively to cut-to-length services, which do not qualify as warehousing expenses, from its requested adjustment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Commerce reasonably relied on Tos\u00e7elik's questionnaire responses, and therefore the court concludes that Commerce's grant of circumstances of sale adjustment is supported by substantial evidence.
