However, the briefing on the omnibus motions to dismiss, Plaintiff's oppositions, and Defendants' replies is identical in all 4 cases. Thus, for ease of reference and unless otherwise specified, the Court refers to documents filed in the Twitter litigation, Case No. 18-CV-04523-LHK.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before the Court is Defendants' consolidated motions to dismiss, which contend that the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit fail to recite patent-eligible subject matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A method of routing communications in a packet switched network in which a first participant identifier is associated with a first participant and a second participant identifier is associated with a second participant in a communication, the method comprising:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   after the first participant has accessed the packet switched network to initiate the communication, using the first participant identifier to locate a first participant profile comprising a plurality of attributes associated with the first participant;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   when at least one of the first participant attributes and at least a portion of the second participant identifier meet a first network classification criterion, producing a first network routing message identifying an address in a first portion of the packet switched network, the address being associated with the second participant, the first portion being controlled by an entity; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   when at least one of the first participant attributes and at least a portion of the second participant identifier meet a second network classification criterion, producing\n   a second network routing message for receipt by the controller, the second network routing message identifying an address in a second portion of the packet switched network, the second portion not controlled by the entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   '005 Patent at 43:41-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As aforementioned, the parties have divided the asserted claims into two categories: the multi-network claims, and the single network claims. The difference between the two types of claims lies within the claims' preambles. For instance, claim 1 of the '815 Patent, which is representative of the multi-network claims, discloses a \"call routing controller to facilitate communication between callers and callees in a system comprising\n   <em>\n    a plurality of nodes.\n   </em>\n   \" '815 Patent at 36:14-16 (emphasis added). Thus, claim 1 requires a call routed through a plurality of nodes, which is why it is a\n   <em>\n    multi-network\n   </em>\n   claim; each node comprises a different network. On the other hand, claim 74 of the '005 Patent, which is representative of the single-network claims, discloses \"routing communications in\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   packet switched network.\" '005 Patent at 43:41-42 (emphasis added). Thus, claim 74 of the '008 Patent refers to routing communications through a single packet switched network, as opposed to multiple nodes (i.e. networks) like in claim 1 of the '815 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Indeed, the specification concedes that the invention did not invent the \"caller identifier\" or the \"callee identifier.\" Specifically, the specification discloses that \"[t]he caller identifier field may include a [publicly switched telephone network] number or a system subscriber username.\" '815 Patent at 17:13-15. Moreover, as examples of callee identifiers, the specification identifies \"a callee telephone/videophone number.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:49-50.

As discussed above, the callee identifier is essentially \"a callee telephone/videophone number,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:49-50, which the '815 Patent did not invent. The specification makes clear that this matching process is not unique to the Patent either, especially as the '815 Patent did not invent the callee identifier or any of the information associated with the matching process, such as an area code.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:8-10 (\"Using the call classification criteria may involve comparing calling attributes associated with the caller dialing profile with aspects of the callee identifier.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:17-19 (\"Comparing may involve determining whether the callee identifier includes a portion that matches an area code associated with the caller dialing profile.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:20-22 (\"Comparing may involve determining whether the callee identifier has a length within a range specified in the caller dialing profile.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Finally, the call is either classified as a \"public network call\" or a \"private network call\" based on undefined \"classification criteria,\" and the appropriate public network or private network routing message is sent to the call controller.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:26-38. In essence, this step in claim 1 discloses classifying a call based on these \"classification criteria,\" then sending a message based on that analysis. According to the specification, this process is as generically-implemented\n   on a computer as the previously-described steps: \"The process involves, in response to initiation of a call by a calling subscriber, receiving a callee identifier from the calling subscriber, using call classification criteria associated with the calling subscriber to classify the call as a public network call or a private network call and producing a routing message....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:25-30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:45-47 (\"The process may involve classifying the call as a private network call when the re-formatted callee identifier identifies a subscriber to the private network.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:48-50 (\"The process may involve determining whether the callee identifier complies with a pre-defined username format and if so, classifying the call as a private network call.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:51-57 (\"The process may involve causing a database of records to be searched to locate a direct in dial (DID) bank table record associating a public telephone number with the reformatted callee identifier ... and if a DID bank table record is not found, classifying the call as a public network call.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Claim 1 is similar to other claims that courts have found to be abstract. In\n   <em>\n    West View Research, LLC v. Audi AG\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit held that claims that \"do not go beyond receiving or collecting data queries, analyzing the data query, retrieving and processing the information constituting a response to the initial data query, and generating a visual or audio response to the initial data query\" were directed to the abstract idea of collecting and analyzing information.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12403990\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/685/923/#p926\">\n    685 F.

Essentially, the caller and callee identifiers consist of either a telephone number or a username, neither of which is unique to the '815 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In addition, \"locating a caller dialing profile\" does not provide an inventive concept either. The specification makes clear that the '815 Patent did not invent the caller dialing profile, but rather, the caller dialing profile is comprised of various identificatory attributes of subscribers that are left undefined in the claim and specification.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:1-4 (\"Effectively the dialing profile is a record identifying calling attributes of the caller identified by the caller identifier.

The callee identifier is essentially \"a callee telephone/videophone number.\" '815 Patent at 14:49-50. The specification makes clear that this matching process is not unique to the Patent either, especially as the '815 Patent did not invent the callee identifier or the process of matching the caller dialing profile with the callee identifier.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:8-10 (\"Using the call classification criteria may involve comparing calling attributes associated with the caller dialing profile with aspects of the callee identifier.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:17-19 (\"Comparing may involve determining whether the callee identifier includes a portion that matches an area code associated with the caller dialing profile.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:20-22 (\"Comparing may involve determining whether the callee identifier has a length within a range specified in the caller dialing profile.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Moreover, case law has held that the process of matching information does not provide an inventive concept.

The Court agrees with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Step one of the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   framework directs the Court to assess \"whether the claims at issue are directed to [an abstract idea].\"\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, the Court conducts its step one inquiry by first identifying what the \"character as a whole\" of claim 1 of the '815 Patent is \"directed to,\" and then discussing whether this is an abstract idea. In distilling the character of a claim, the Court is careful not to express the claim's focus at an unduly \"high level of abstraction ... untethered from the language of claims,\" but rather at a level consonant with the level of generality or abstraction expressed in the claims themselves.\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1334\">\n    822 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1337 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thales Visionix\n   </em>\n   , 850 F.3d at 1347 (\"We must therefore ensure at step one that we articulate what the claims are directed to with enough specificity to ensure the step one inquiry is meaningful.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Like for claim 1 of the '815 Patent, the Court finds that claim 74 of the '005 Patent is directed to the abstract idea of routing a call based on characteristics of the caller and callee. Put in plain language, claim 74 discloses: (1) using a \"participant identifier\" to locate a \"first participant profile\" comprising of \"attributes associated with the first participant,\" who starts a communication with a second participant; (2) sending a \"first network routing message\" that identifies an address in a first portion of the network for receipt by a controller when some information about the first participant and a portion of a \"second participant identifier\" meet a criterion; and (3) sending a \"second network routing message\" that identifies an address in a second portion of the network for receipt by a controller when some information about the first participant and a portion of the \"second participant identifier\" meet a second criterion. '005 Patent at 43:41-65. In essence, claim 74 of the '005 Patent is essentially the same as claim 1 of the '815 Patent, but with two routing messages being sent as opposed to just the one routing message being sent in claim 1 of the '815 Patent. For this reason, claim 74 of the '005 Patent suffers from the same defects as claim 1 of the '815 Patent. Claim 74 is abstract because first, it only discloses generalized steps to carry out generic functions, and second, because there are long-standing practices analogous to the claimed steps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Claim 74 Discloses Generalized Steps to Carry Out Generic Functions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   For instance, as discussed above, the\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   court found that because the\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   patent failed to provide technical details for components, but instead described the system and methods \"in purely functional terms,\" functions that were generic to a computer, the\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   patent claim failed step one of\n   <em>\n    Alice.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p611\">\n    823 F.3d at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, claim 74 of the '005 Patent describes the methods in purely functional terms with functions generic to a computer. Thus, claim 74 is directed to an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The idea of using a \"participant identifier\" to locate a \"first participant profile\" comprising of \"attributes associated with the first participant,\" who starts a communication with a second participant is purely functional language that is generic to a computer. The phrase \"participant identifier\" is not found in the '005 Patent specification. However, \"participant identifier\" is akin to the aforementioned caller identifier and callee identifier in claim 1 of the '815 Patent because the participant identifier functions in the same way as the caller and callee identifiers. For instance, in claim 1 of the '815 Patent, a portion of the callee identifier is used to match various attributes associated with a caller, and a routing message is sent out based on the match. '815 Patent at 36:23-25. Likewise, in claim 74 of the '005 Patent, a portion of the second participant identifier is used in conjunction with various attributes associated with a first participant, and a routing message is sent out based on whether a portion of the second participant identifier and the attributes associated with a first participant meet a classification criterion. '005 Patent at 43:51-58. Moreover, both claims refer to the use of \"identifiers,\" which is defined in the specification as caller and callee identifiers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Thus, \"participant identifier\" is defined in the specification as \"a [publicly switched telephone network] number or a system subscriber username.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:23-24. The specification additionally identifies an identifier as \"telephone/videophone number.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:48-49. Essentially, an identifier consists of either a telephone number or a username. A telephone number or a username can hardly be considered unique to the '005 Patent, as the specification admits and as common sense dictates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Likewise, the \"first participant profile\" of claim 74 is equally as generic. The specification never uses the phrase \"participant profile,\" but the Court finds participant profile equivalent to the dialing profile discussed above in relation to the '815 Patent because the participant profile functions in the same way as the dialing profile. The participant profile comprises \"a plurality of attributes associated with the ... participant,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43:48-50, much like how a caller dialing profile comprises \"a plurality of calling attributes associated with the caller,\" '815 Patent at 36:20-22. The specification makes clear that the '005 Patent did not invent the participant profile, but rather, the participant profile is comprised of various identificatory attributes of subscribers that are left undefined in the claim and specification.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '005 Patent at 18:10-13 (\"Effectively the dialing profile is a record identifying calling attributes of the caller identified by the caller identifier. More generally, dialing profiles represent\n   <em>\n    calling attributes of respective subscribers\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added).).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Then, claim 74 proceeds to claim, without further detail, starting a communication between a first participant and a second participant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43:46-47. The process of initiating a communication is described in the specification as using a generic computer with a routing controller to connect two parties. The specification discloses that the super node, which includes the routing controller that routes communications, \"may be implemented as separate modules on a common computer system or by separate computers, for example.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In the next step of claim 74, claim 74 claims sending a \"first network routing message\" that identifies an address in a first portion of the network for receipt by a controller when some information about the first participant and a portion of a \"second participant identifier\" meet a criterion. As discussed above, a routing message\n   is sent by the routing controller, a component of the super node, which is comprised of generic computers. Therefore, the process of sending a network routing message is generic. For instance, a claim that recited steps \"by which data was obtained ... and\n   <em>\n    transmitted by a telephone\n   </em>\n   ... and sent over a channel to different destinations\" was held to represent \"nothing more than a disembodied concept of data sorting and storage.\"\n   <em>\n    Morales v. Square, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232319\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/716/#p725\">\n    75 F.

Del. 2012) ). Moreover, the claim does not define what \"criterion\" must be met for the first network routing message to be sent. Claim 74 thereby repeats the same mistake as claim 1 of the '815 Patent in that claim 74 recites steps in very vague terms. As the Federal Circuit has held, \"[g]eneralized steps to be performed on a computer using conventional computer activity are abstract.\"\n   <em>\n    RecogniCorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277199\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/1322/#p1326\">\n    855 F.3d at 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The final step of claim 74 claims sending a \"second network routing message\" that identifies an address in a second portion of the network for receipt by a controller when some information about the first participant and a portion of the \"second participant identifier\" meet a second criterion. This final step is near-identical to the above-described step, the differences being that a \"second network routing message\" is sent when another criterion is met by information about the first participant and a portion of a \"second participant identifier.\" As the Court has discussed at length, the process of sending a network routing message is not unique to the Patent, and is implemented using generic computers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

At\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step two, there is no inventive concept sufficient to save the claim. Thus, the Court concludes that the single-network claims-claims 74, 75, 77, 78, 83, 84, 94, 96, and 99 of the '005 Patent -of which claim 74 of the '005 Patent is representative, are patent-ineligible under \u00a7 101. Defendants' motion to dismiss the single-network claims is therefore GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Whether there Exist Factual Questions that Preclude Resolution of the Instant Motion under Rule 12\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Plaintiff's opposition cites disclosures in the complaints that Plaintiffs argue preclude resolution of the instant motion under Rule 12. Opp. at 7. In particular, Plaintiff's opposition mentions two specific features-user-specific calling and transparent routing-disclosed by the complaints that purportedly demonstrate that the asserted claims are not directed to abstract ideas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   First, Plaintiff argues that claim 1 discloses \"user-specific calling,\" which precludes a finding of abstractness because in user-specific calling, \"[d]ifferent callers with differently configured attributes could dial the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   string of digits to reach\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   destinations because the meaning of the callee identifier is different based on each caller's attributes.\" Opp. at 7-8 (emphasis in original). Plaintiff cites the '815 Patent specification to show that user-specific calling exists because the Patent describes \"calling attributes associated with the caller\" to evaluate a \"callee identifier\" to identify the callee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7 (citing '815 Patent at 36:15-23). Moreover, Plaintiff states that \"[u]ser-specific call placement provides benefits such as the ability to support local [public switched telephone network] styles (or even unconventional styles) of calling no matter where in the world a caller is located.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   However, the '815 Patent's\n   <em>\n    claim language\n   </em>\n   contains no mention of these alleged benefits of user-specific calling, such as supporting local public switched telephone network telephone number styles or unconventional styles of calling regardless of where a caller is located. After all,\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   's step one inquiry must focus on the\n   <em>\n    claim language\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Accenture\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697798\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/1336/#p1345\">\n    728 F.3d at 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he important inquiry for a \u00a7 101 analysis is to look to the claim.\");\n   <em>\n    CMG Fin.

App'x 420 (Fed. Cir. 2015). Also, the patent specification fails to disclose user-specific calling. Regardless, even if the specification disclosed user-specific calling, as the Federal Circuit has held, \"details from the specification cannot save a claim directed to an abstract idea that recites generic computer parts.\"\n   <em>\n    Synopsys, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 839 F.3d at 1149.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Second, Plaintiff also argues that the asserted claims disclose \"transparent routing,\" rendering the claims non-abstract. Opp. at 8. Plaintiff asserts that the \"improved call routing controller, system and method of the claim invention also enables using a caller's attributes to evaluate a callee identifier against network routing criteria to cause a call to\n   <em>\n    automatically\n   </em>\n   be routed over system network ... or another network interconnected to the system network via a gateway ...\n   <em>\n    transparently to the user\n   </em>\n   -without the user manually specifying the network to use for routing\n   by the user's manner of placing the call (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , by dialing a prefix of \"9\" to make a [public switched telephone network] call).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   However, as aforementioned,\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   's step one inquiry must focus on the claim language.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Accenture\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697798\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/1336/#p1345\">\n    728 F.3d at 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he important inquiry for a \u00a7 101 analysis is to look to the claim.\"). Like with user-specific calling, the concepts embodied by transparent routing appear nowhere in the claims. As Defendants correctly point out, the \"claims do not recite any limitation regarding what the caller specifies, or does not specify, to place a call, nor do the claims refer to a caller making a [public switched telephone network] call without dialing the prefix '9.' \" Reply at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   At bottom, under Federal Circuit law, \"[w]hether a claim recites patent eligible subject matter is a question of law which ... has in many cases been resolved on motions to dismiss or summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer v.
