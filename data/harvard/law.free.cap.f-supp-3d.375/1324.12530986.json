Pl.'s Resp. Br. at 13. This line of argument sidesteps the fact that Perry is attempting to bring an action based on entries for which it suffered no \"injury in fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That the statute does not expressly contemplate applying a revoked ADD order to a single importer does not mean that Perry must seek reliquidation of all subject entries-even those for which it suffered no injury-to state a claim. Such an approach would implicitly negate the standing requirement imposed by Article III of the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Perry asserts that it does not seek refunds of cash deposits potentially made by other importers during AR2. Pl.'s Resp. Br. at 14-16. Perry argues that although its desired remedy-reliquidation of all subject entries during the relevant periods, not just Perry's-may affect other parties, this fact does not affect the validity of Perry's cause of action and requested relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Paragraph one of Perry's complaint states that Perry seeks\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   a writ of mandamus from the Court compelling [Commerce] to issue corrected liquidation instructions to [CBP] directing that entries of [PVA] from Taiwan produced and exported by [Chang Chun] during the periods March 1, 2012 to February 28, 2013 and March 1, 2013 to December 29, 2013 be reliquidated without regard to antidumping duties, in accordance with Commerce's amended final determination and revocation of the [ADD] order covering PVA from Taiwan, and all cash deposits made by Perry be returned, with interest, as provided by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Compl. at \u00b6 1 (internal citation omitted). Although the above paragraph limits Perry's request for refunds to entries for which it paid cash deposits, it nonetheless requests reliquidation of all of Chang Chun's entries-regardless of importer-during\n   the relevant periods. Moreover, the complaint's request for relief seeks\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   a writ of mandamus directing Commerce to issue instructions to [CBP] within to [sic] (10) days to reliquidate without regard to antidumping duties all entries of subject PVA produced and exported by Chang Chun during the periods of March 1, 2012 to February 28, 2013 and March 1, 2013 to December 29, 2013, and to refund excess antidumping duty deposits, with interest, as provided by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Compl. at 10 (Request for Relief). The request for relief again makes clear that Perry seeks reliquidation of all entries, irrespective of whether Perry paid cash deposits on those entries. Perry alleges no particularized injury relating to entries for which it paid no cash deposits. Accordingly, to the extent that there are entries from Chang Chun during the relevant periods for which Perry did not pay the cash deposits, Perry lacks standing with respect to such entries and this Court accordingly lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
