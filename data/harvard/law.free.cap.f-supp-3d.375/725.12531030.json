[Doc. 37]. Plaintiff Trevor Pinder (\"Pinder\") filed his opposition. [Doc. 41]. Pinder also filed a motion to strike an expert report attached to Defendants' motion [Doc. 40], to which no response was filed. Having considered the Parties' briefs, summary judgment evidence, and the relevant law, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion to Strike and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the night of November 29, 2014, Skero pulled over Pinder in a traffic stop that escalated into a physical conflict. Despite the inclusion of dash cam video evidence, this case involves highly disputed facts. How the escalation occurred and whether Skero's use of force was justified are both disputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At approximately 12:40 a.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on November 29, 2014, the video shows that Pinder was driving on Texas Farm to Market Road 1314 when Skero made a U-turn [Doc. 37-1 at 0:26] and pulled behind Pinder in his official patrol vehicle.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:30].\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The video shows Pinder made a right turn onto Texas State Highway 242 without using his turn signal, and Skero followed.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:34]. The video shows that Pinder rapidly accelerated, almost out of sight of Skero's dash cam, after which Skero struggled to catch up. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:41-2:14]. Pinder's vehicle drifted over the right lane stripe. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:13]. Pinder's car comes more clearly into view when he slowed down behind an eighteen-wheeler. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:15-25]. His car appeared to be tailgating the eighteen-wheeler, although Pinder alleges he was driving behind it at a safe distance. [Doc. 14 \u00b6 18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pinder then made a left turn into a residential neighborhood as Skero engaged his vehicle's lights but not the sirens. [Doc. 37-1 at 2:25, 2:31]. Pinder stopped his vehicle on the side of the road. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:35-40]. Skero pulled over behind Pinder's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As Skero walked to Pinder's car, the audio indicates that Pinder initiated a call\n   in his car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:10]. Skero walked to the left side of the car and stopped at the driver's side, where he asked for Pinder's driver's license and insurance.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:17]. For approximately thirty seconds, Skero asked Pinder to hang up the phone four times. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:28-52]. Pinder did not do so. During one of these commands, Skero referred to Pinder by name. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:40]. Pinder alleges that Skero identified him without seeing his license or registration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. 14 \u00b6 29]. Pinder finally hung up the phone when Skero told him to step out of the vehicle. [Doc. 37-1 at 3:59]. At that point, while still seated in the car, Pinder asks Skero what he did wrong. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:04, 4:06]. Skero responded, \"For one thing you were doing 89 in a 60 and you were unable to stay in your lane.\"\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:23]. Despite being asked to step out of the car, Pinder did not comply. Skero then asked Pinder to get out of the car two more times before he complied.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:07, 4:36]. As Pinder exited his vehicle, he continued to ask what he did wrong, to which Skero responded \"I told you already\" and that \"when you come [sic] off 1314 and turned onto 242 and gunned it, then you caught up, got in behind that eighteen-wheeler, you were doing 89 miles an hour.\"\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:43, 4:51].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Skero testified in his deposition that he also suspected Pinder of driving while intoxicated at this time and intended to conduct a field sobriety test: \"[H]e's not listening to me, not listening to anything I'm asking him, other than give [sic] me his license. He did ask me why I stopped him. I told him. It's like he wasn't comprehending it. I could smell the alcohol. I could just look at him, he had red bloodshot eyes .... I had him walk to the back of his vehicle in front of my patrol car to do DWI field sobriety.\" [Skero Depo. Doc. 41-1 at 187:13-25]. Skero acknowledged that he did not tell Pinder he was planning to do a field sobriety test. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 188:1-3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pinder, upon exiting his car, walked behind the car. [Doc. 37-1 at 5:18-5:24]. Skero told him to keep his hands out of his pockets. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:24]. Skero then asked him to stand in a specific spot behind the vehicle and pointed to demonstrate where.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:27]. Pinder moved closer to the spot but not to the location indicated by Skero.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:31]. Skero pointed to the spot on the ground again and asked Pinder to stand there two more times.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:36, 5:42]. Pinder did not move from where he was standing, and instead took something out of his left jacket pocket and asked again what he had done wrong. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:42-45]. It is not apparent from the video what Pinder was taking out of his pocket, but their dialogue indicates it might have been a piece of candy.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   P: What I do wrong, sir?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   S: Don't be eating on that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   P: Question. Simple question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   S: Tired of having to tell you to stop eating on candy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:45-51]. Pinder attempted to put the substance in his mouth, and Skero grabbed Pinder's hand and pulled it away from his mouth, saying \"stop.\"\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:52]. Pinder alleges he was simply trying to eat candy. [Doc. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 53-55]. (Obviously,\n   candy could be used to mask the smell of alcohol.) Skero later testified that he viewed this gesture as a potential threat, as he did not know whether it was actually candy or another substance, such as a narcotic or drug that could make Pinder more difficult to handle. [Doc. 41-1 at 196:17-197:25]. He did not voice any of these concerns during their interaction. After Skero initially grabbed Pinder's hand containing the substance, the video shows they began to struggle as Skero tried to gain control of both of Pinder's hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The two men can be seen struggling, and at one point Skero managed to grab both of Pinder's hands. [Doc. 37-1 at 5:52-53]. During the struggle, Skero told him \"stop\" and \"don't do this\" but Pinder continued to scuffle.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:52, 5:55]. At this point, Pinder managed to free his arm and pulled his right hand backwards.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:52]. The Parties dispute the significance of this arm movement. Pinder alleges, with no supporting evidence, that he pulled his hand away in a \"reflexive action.\" [Doc. 14 \u00b6 57]. Skero testified that he was trying to grab the object that Pinder was holding when he started to put it in his mouth, and \"then he grab[bed] me and raise[d] his arm like he was going to punch me....\" [Skero Depo. Doc. 41-1 at 188:21-24]. Skero avers that Pinder grabbed him and \"brought his hand back up in a swinging motion,\" so Skero placed him in a chokehold. At this point they were still standing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189:20-23, 190:15-16]. Skero testifies that Pinder then grabbed the wire on his earpiece to his radio and elbowed Skero in the face, which is what led him to bring Pinder to the ground. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189:20, 191:18-20, 192:5-8]. During this exchange, the events occurred rapidly and the definition in the video is not such that the viewer can pinpoint each exact movement but Skero's version of the facts is not controverted. Because the events leading up to the takedown occurred quickly and the video is inconclusive, the Court notes that it has to rely on Skero's sworn description as this is the only available and admissible summary judgment evidence regarding the takedown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Soon after Pinder's arm movement, Skero grabbed Pinder, and the two of them went down and ended up rolling on the grass off the side of the road. The roadside appeared to have a slope, and the duo rolled off camera. While they were offscreen, Skero radioed for backup: \"433 give me a unit.\" [Doc. 37-1 at 5:58]. When their heads once again became visible onscreen seconds later, the two were still clearly struggling on the ground. Skero was located behind and on top of Pinder and held Pinder in a headlock with his right arm.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:05]. Skero punched Pinder in the face or upper body area twice while they were on the ground and yelled \"stay on the ground.\"\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:06-07]. Pinder refused to follow this command and kept trying to get up. Skero kept Pinder in a headlock and reached for his radio.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:13]. At one point, Pinder was on his knees with Skero behind him, and then Skero forced him to the ground. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:24]. Skero repeated the instruction to stay on the ground. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:31]. Pinder appeared to struggle to get back on his knees, and Skero once again forced him back to the ground.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:35].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During this struggle, Pinder made several comments over the course of about one and one-half minutes, including that he could not breathe\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:39, 6:58, 7:06], was not resisting\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:45-50], was not doing anything wrong [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:32], and needed help [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:52], mixed among several profanities directed at Skero [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:48, 7:51, 7:54]. Pinder's words suggest a situation worse than what the video reveals, as it is apparent that Pinder was resisting Skero's attempts to handcuff him and that he could breathe because he kept\n   talking without apparent difficulty. During this part of the struggle on the ground, Skero called into dispatch two more times and told Pinder to stay there and not move and he would not get hurt. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:01, 7:31, 7:56-58].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After about two minutes of remaining somewhat still (as Skero waited for backup), Pinder again began to struggle against Skero and attempted to grab Skero's radio.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:49]. Skero struggled to stay on top of him. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:58]. Notably, Skero had his right arm around Pinder's neck for about three minutes total at this point, including when Pinder took hold of the radio and yelled into it \"please help me.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:59]. Skero then punched Pinder at least twice in the back of the head and strengthened his headlock on him. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:01]. Pinder continued to yell into the radio and would not release it. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:02]. At that point, Skero released the chokehold to grab his taser and warned him \"you're going to get tased. You better let go of that radio.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:10-12]. Although muffled, Pinder appeared to respond, \"you wouldn't tase me.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:18]. He did not release the radio. Skero tased Pinder in the back of the neck and yelled again to let go of the radio. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:19-21]. It is unclear from the video if Skero deployed the taser more than once. Although Pinder showed little or no reaction to being tased, he released the radio and tossed it a short distance away from him. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A voice over the radio asked Skero to check in, and Skero asked for backup units. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:25-28]. The dispatch responded \"yes sir, you're on priority.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:30]. Over the next few minutes before backup units arrived, Pinder and Skero remained on the ground with Skero straddling Pinder's back to hold him down. Pinder continued to talk, calling Skero a series of expletives (\"m-------r\") and insults (\"little boy\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:33, 9:37]. Pinder also continued to contend that he did not do anything wrong and was not fighting him. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:27, 10:48]. Pinder said, \"Brother, I ain't doing nothing wrong. I am doing nothing wrong. I promise you, I ain't fighting you. I ain't trying to do nothing wrong. You are f-----d up, bro. And are you going to get into any trouble? No. Because you're an officer. I know the f------g game. I am not doing anything wrong.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:48-11:17]. All that Skero said during this exchange was demanding that Pinder give him his hands, which Pinder did not do, and instructing him to stay on the ground after Pinder began to move his legs again. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:34, 11:28]. Skero remained on top of Pinder without further struggle for approximately four minutes and fifteen seconds after deploying the taser before a second police officer finally arrived on screen.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:19-13:35].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When another officer reached the spot where Skero and Pinder were located, that officer told Pinder to put his hands behind his head and to give them his arms. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:44-46]. Pinder kept his arms tucked under his chest and still did not comply. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:47]. The officer again instructed him to give them his arms or he would be tased. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:51]. Skero got off Pinder's back, and he and the second officer attempted to grab Pinder's arms to handcuff him. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:00]. Pinder continued to resist, and the video shows that the two officers struggled to handcuff him for about forty seconds before they finally succeeded in restraining his arms (during which Pinder repeated that he was \"not fighting nobody\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:00-47]. Skero walked away to sit by the police car breathing heavily and sat down while the second officer placed the cuffs on Pinder. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:54-15:05]. The remainder of the video shows several other officers arriving on scene and records some of their dialogue\n   but shows no further interactions between Pinder and Skero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Subsequent blood tests and state judicial proceedings occurred, some of the results of which were discussed at the motion to dismiss stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that Pinder later pleaded guilty to a charge of Driving While Intoxicated related to that night. [Doc. 7, Exs. 1, 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pinder filed this lawsuit under Section 1983 against Skero and Montgomery County, Skero's employer. Pinder's description of his injuries in his Amended Complaint is limited to these statements: \"As a direct and proximate result of the conduct of the Defendants ... Plaintiff has suffered losses and damages.\" [Doc. 14 \u00b6 105]. \"Specifically, Plaintiff felt frightened, humiliated, embarrassed and suffered severe mental anguish from the arrest, from being detained in prison ... Plaintiff continues to suffer mental anguish that interferes with his ability to carry out the day-to-day responsibilities of life and to enjoy life ... In addition, Plaintiff suffered damage to his reputation as a result of this incident. Plaintiff also suffered extreme physical discomfort as a result of this incident.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106-107, 110]. He also claims that he lost his job as a result of the arrest. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 109, 111]. Pinder submitted no evidence for consideration as summary judgment evidence or further briefing regarding his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Defendants moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and on qualified immunity grounds [Doc. 17], and the Court denied the motion. [Doc. 24]. Defendants filed their joint motion for summary judgment [Doc. 37], and Pinder filed his opposition. [Doc. 41]. Pinder also filed a motion to strike an expert exhibit attached by the Defendants to their motion for summary judgment. [Doc. 40]. Both motions are now ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion to Strike (Doc. 40)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Before turning to the motion for summary judgment, the Court must dispense with the motion to strike, as it concerns what evidence can be considered at this stage. Defendants submitted an affidavit and report from Robert Hauck (\"Hauck\"), who is presented as an expert \"in the field of law enforcement, security, police procedures, police policies, crime analysis, crime prevention, crime scene investigations, internal investigations, and public safety.\" [Doc. 37-2]. Defendants, however, did not establish why Hauck is an expert regarding the facts at issue in this case (such as being an expert in traffic stops or an expert in particular uses of force or dealing with a recalcitrant subject). Furthermore, most of the purported evidence provided in Hauck's report is stated in conclusory form. Finally, and most importantly, Defendants did not respond to the Motion to Strike, which, under the local rules of this Court, is an admission of \"no opposition.\" LR 7.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court, therefore,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's motion to strike [Doc. 40] Hauck's affidavit and report as they pertain to the pending summary judgment motion. This holding, however, should not be construed\n   to prohibit Hauck's expert testimony, if in a later proceeding he is properly qualified and the evidence is properly introduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Legal Standard for Summary Judgment and Qualified Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate only \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A dispute is genuine if \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Evidentiary Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In support of his argument against summary judgment, Pinder's proffered \"evidence,\" to the extent it constitutes valid summary judgment evidence, largely focuses on the question of municipal liability. The Court will address some of the overarching evidentiary concerns before turning to the merits of the arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In reference to the excessive force claim against Skero, Pinder's entire presentation is limited to his allegations in his briefing, Skero's deposition testimony, the video recording of the stop, and references to this Court's order on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 24]. Pinder has included no sworn affidavit or deposition to provide his view as to what occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The second evidentiary issue arises out of Pinder's failure to cite to\n   specific evidence in his summary judgment response regarding his Section 1983 excessive force claim. Pinder references the video recording generally but does not provide any particular citations to it or to any other exhibits. A district court is not prohibited from considering evidence not specifically cited to in the briefing, however, the Fifth Circuit has made clear that \" Rule 56 does not impose upon the district court a duty to sift through the record in search of evidence to support a party's opposition to summary judgment, especially where, as here, the nonmoving party is well aware of the existence of such evidence. Rule 56 allocates that duty to the opponent of the motion, who is required to point out the evidence, albeit evidence that is already in the record, that creates an issue of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Skotak v.

As is obvious from the above factual recitation, this Court has reviewed all admissible evidence and the video of the encounter in minute detail, but emphasizes that Plaintiff's allegations and contentions are not evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The third overarching issue requiring discussion is Plaintiff's apparent reliance on this Court's order [Doc. 24] denying Defendants' motion to dismiss. Throughout Pinder's response to the motion for summary judgment, he cites to the Court's order as conclusive support for his allegations that the force Skero used was excessive. This reliance is misplaced. That order is not a finding of fact nor is it summary judgment evidence. It was issued using a totally different standard than that used at the summary judgment phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In that order, the Court clearly indicated that it was utilizing the standards applicable to a 12(b) motion, where all allegations made by a plaintiff must be taken as true in order to determine whether he or she has sufficiently pleaded a claim upon which relief could be granted. The determination of whether a complaint was sufficiently pled to withstand a motion to dismiss exerts a lower standard on the plaintiff. The language used in that order reinforces this notion: The Court indicated that its description of the facts in the case was based\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on the allegations in Pinder's First Amended Complaint, Doc. 14, and the video recording attached to it, Doc. 14-1. [Doc. 24 at 1]. The Court also noted that \"statements made by Defendants regarding facts of the night in question will not be considered to the extent that they are inconsistent with Pinder's allegations or the video evidence.\" [Doc. 24 at 7]. In comparison to the standard applied to a Rule 12(b) motion, at the summary judgment phase the Court can only consider all properly submitted evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The next issue involves the admissibility of Pinder's \"evidence\" regarding the County's alleged liability under the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   doctrine.

Pinder has supplied several\n   exhibits consisting of miscellaneous police reports and records. The overwhelming majority of this purported evidence is inadmissible, at least as submitted, and cannot be used to defeat summary judgment because the documents are unauthenticated, do not contain affidavits attesting to their admissibility or accuracy or their contents, or do not indicate that they were \"made on personal knowledge\" as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(4). The only exhibits attached to Pinder's opposition brief that were properly authenticated are the depositions of Skero and Sergeant Arturo Looza, the County's designated Rule 30(b)(6) representative for Precinct 4, the governmental unit for which Skero worked at the time. That being the case, they are all this Court can consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Pinder has asserted a Section 1983 claim against Skero for excessive force under the Fourth Amendment and a Section 1983 claim against the County for having (1) a \"policy, procedure, custom, practice, or protocol of inadequately training, supervising, and/or disciplining its officers which was the moving force behind Plaintiff's injuries,\" (2) shielding its officers from the consequences of engaging in improper or illegal conduct, and (3) permitting its officers to engage in improper or illegal actions.

In addition to the obvious traffic violations, Skero testified that he suspected Pinder of driving while intoxicated and that once their interaction outside of the car began, Pinder resisted arrest [Doc. 37 at 13] and\n   \"cocked\" his arm back as though to strike him. [Skero Depo. Doc. 41-1 at 189:19-23]. It is also apparent from the video that Pinder had not complied with Skero's instructions up to this point, or at least had ignored the instructions several times, as he refused to hang up the phone multiple times, initially refused to exit his vehicle until the fourth time asked, did not stand where instructed several times, and tried to put an object in his mouth despite being told not to multiple times. Pinder alleges in his Complaint that he was compliant with police instructions, an allegation that is clearly not true, or at most passively resisting, an allegation unsupported by any evidence from Pinder himself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 41, 48, 50, 67]. Pinder contends in his response to the Motion for Summary Judgment that because Skero only listed traffic violations as the cause for the stop in their conversation, that use of force was not warranted and should have been proportionate to the traffic violations. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 41 at 3-4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Although Pinder's actions leading up to putting the object in his mouth were not severe offenses, the combination of apparent intoxication, repeated noncompliance, pulling his hands away from Skero's grasp, and jerking his right arm back into a striking stance could raise a concern for a reasonable officer that violence or more aggressive resistance was imminent-facts which transform a mere traffic stop into a more severe situation. The Court finds that a reasonable officer confronted with these circumstances could anticipate the need to restrain Pinder. Although the takedown occurred quickly, the Court finds that Pinder's resistance and the perceived risk to Skero's safety, which is discussed in more detail below, weigh in favor of Skero's use of a takedown maneuver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3510248\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/691/624/#p627\">\n    691 F.3d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Once the two men were engaged in a physical struggle on the ground, the severity of Pinder's conduct increased. The video shows that he forcibly resisted Skero's efforts to bring him to the ground and was strong enough to get up despite Skero having his arm locked around his neck and placing his full weight on Pinder's back. The Fifth Circuit has clearly stated that officers are \"entitled only to 'measured and ascending responses' to the action of a suspect, 'calibrated to the physical and verbal resistance' shown by the suspect.\"\n   <em>\n    Chacon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202201\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/577/355/#p362\">\n    577 F. App'x at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A reasonable officer on the scene could have perceived Pinder, at this point on the ground, to be actively resisting arrest, especially considering Pinder's continued ability to talk and struggle throughout the entirety of the \"chokehold.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265604\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/722/#p732\">\n    880 F.3d at 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e have found that a police officer uses excessive force when the officer strikes, punches, or violently slams a suspect who is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   resisting arrest.\") (emphasis added). Again, this weighs in favor of Skero's use of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Similar considerations apply to Skero's deployment of his taser. While they were struggling on the ground, Pinder-who had refused to yield his arms to be cuffed and who had previously been able to match Skero's weight and size-grabbed Skero's radio, despite being held in a chokehold, and began yelling into it. In addition to resisting arrest, Pinder's ability to grab Skero's equipment could lead a reasonable officer to fear increasing levels of violence. When instructed to release the radio, Pinder refused and continued to not comply despite the warning that he would be tased. The severity of engaging in a physical\n   altercation, taking and using police equipment, and resisting arrest weighs in favor of Skero's perceived need to deploy a taser in response to an escalating situation. This is especially true considering that Skero specifically warned Pinder that he would be tased if he did not relinquish the radio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   Factor Two: Threat Posed by the Suspect\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court next considers whether the second factor, whether Pinder posed an immediate threat, weighs in favor or against Skero's takedown maneuver, alleged chokehold, and taser deployment. Skero testified to several factors that made him believe that Pinder was a threat, both to him and to public safety. First, he stated in his deposition that Pinder smelled of alcohol and had bloodshot eyes, and as such would be a danger to the public by driving while intoxicated.\n   <em>\n    [See\n   </em>\n   Skero Depo. Doc. 41-1 at 187:13-18]. Second, Skero explained that he did not know the contents of the wrapper that Pinder was trying to put in his mouth, and that he thought it could have been drugs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 196:2-21, 197:1-3]. Skero mentioned he even worried it could be a drug that Pinder would throw on him. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 197:12-25]. Third, Skero testified that Pinder cocked his arm back as if to hit him [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 190:15-17], and later grabbed at the wire on his radio, deactivating his earpiece, and elbowed him in the face. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 191:13-25, 192:1-8]. Here, again, Pinder asserts, but provides no evidence, that he was moving his arm in a \"reflexive action\" and that he did nothing that could be construed as a threat or aggressive. [Doc. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 56-59]. As previously discussed, the video is inconclusive so the Court relies on the only available summary judgment evidence regarding the events leading up to takedown, Skero's testimony, as Pinder preferred no evidence on the topic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Once the two men were physically engaged on the ground, Skero appeared to use escalating levels of force to maintain control of the situation. Skero described the struggle as \"fighting for his life.\" [Skero Depo. Doc. 41-1 at 193:9]. He avers that because he had weapons on his person, once started, the struggle had potentially lethal implications. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 193:10-25]. It appears from the video that Skero struggled to maintain control of Pinder, as Pinder was able to get back onto his knees and grab the radio despite being in the alleged chokehold. Skero testified that using the taser (stun gun maneuver) was necessary to maintain control while he waited for backup units to arrive because he was still having trouble maintaining control of the situation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 202:3-25, 203:1-23]. Pinder alleges in his Amended Complaint that the force used was unreasonable and caused him to fear for his life and react responsively. [Doc. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 66, 69, 76]. Again, he provided no evidence or sworn statements to this effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   After considering the summary judgment evidence including the video, it is apparent that a reasonable officer could have viewed Pinder as an immediate threat. The Court again notes that Pinder has provided no sworn testimony, affidavits, or exhibits to support his assertions, leaving the Court with only the video to compare with Skero's deposition. With regard to the initial takedown, Pinder was clearly intoxicated and purposefully being uncooperative. When he raised his arm, a reasonable officer could have feared that Pinder was trying to initiate violence. Regarding the headlock or chokehold, the available testimony and video demonstrate that Pinder was never in danger, was able to talk without apparent difficulty, and continued to physically struggle against Skero, all while Skero had his right arm around his neck for several consecutive\n   minutes. It is apparent that this technique was used to maintain control of the situation, in which Skero was struggling to keep Pinder under control on the ground rather than to inflict harm. Faced with a physical altercation with a clearly intoxicated suspect who had already engaged in resistance and physical struggles against the officer, the Court finds that a reasonable officer could have feared that Pinder was capable of increasing measures of resistance. Finally, regarding the use of the taser, the summary judgment evidence shows that Pinder continued to try to get up, resisted Skero's attempts to maintain control, and grabbed and used Skero's radio. Even in the face of being warned to relinquish the radio or be tased, Pinder refused to let it go. Under the circumstances, a reasonable officer could view this suspect as posing an increasing threat. A reasonable officer could fear that Pinder might reach next for his gun or escape his grasp or both. The potential threats to officer safety weigh in favor of Skero's use of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   Factor Three: Resisting Arrest or Flight Risk\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Next, under the third\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor, the Court considers whether Pinder resisted arrest or attempted to flee. The Parties strongly disagree whether Pinder actively or passively resisted arrest leading up to the takedown maneuver. Although the video suggests that Pinder was not an active flight risk, it does demonstrate that he was noncompliant throughout the course of their interaction. Pinder refused to yield his hands, began to struggle against Skero while they were still standing, and forcibly resisted all of Skero's attempts to gain control of the situation. Pinder clearly resisted all instructions and physical restraints both before and after the two were engaged in the physical altercation. In fact, even when help arrived and Pinder was outnumbered, he still continued to resist. From the time when Pinder refused to yield his hands to Skero when instructed, a reasonable officer could have perceived Pinder to be resisting arrest, as previously discussed. This factor also weighs in Skero's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   iii. Conclusion Regarding Skero\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Under the circumstances, the Court concludes that it must grant summary judgment on Skero's qualified immunity claim and again stresses the importance of the lack of evidence submitted by Pinder. Without an affidavit attesting to his view of the situation, to find for Pinder would require this Court to find that the video raised an issue of material fact as to what a reasonable officer would do in the situation.

Pinder provided no personal testimony as to any aspect of the encounter and no lay or expert testimony as to the events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Skero is entitled to qualified immunity for the following reasons: (1) Pinder bears the burden of proof to show that a fact issue exists as to whether the defense of qualified immunity should not apply but provided no evidence on the topic or regarding what a reasonable officer should have done in such a situation; (2) the dash cam video does not raise any issues of material fact; and (3) the Fifth Circuit has granted qualified immunity in situations with police conduct much more \"egregious\" or questionable than that alleged in the instant case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054969\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/174/#p181\">\n    822 F.3d at 177-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming grant of qualified immunity where police tased and used a four-point restraint on a suspect who walked away from the officers and refused to stop);\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174180\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/308/#p312\">\n    841 F.3d at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Brewer's actions [taking down and punching a \"drunken, erratic\n   suspect\"] may not have been as restrained as we would like to expect from model police conduct, but qualified immunity 'protect[s] officers from the sometimes hazy border between excessive and acceptable force.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Saucier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313023\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/194/#p206\">\n    533 U.S. at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313023\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/194/#p206\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) );\n   <em>\n    Cadena v.

He alleges that the County had widespread practices of \"1) failing to train, supervise, and/or discipline officers for a) how to respond to requests for reasons for officer actions, b) how to deploy de-escalation techniques, c)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   what constitutes a resisting arrest charge, d) reasonable use of force, and e) how to prepare, draft, and submit truthful use of force reports; 2) shielding its officers from consequences of wrongful conduct; 3) permitting its officer to perform illegal and improper conduct; and 4) ratification.\" [Doc. 41 at 7]. In support of his claims, Pinder has provided his briefing and unauthenticated use of force incident reports, which are not proper summary judgment evidence, and the depositions of Officers Skero and Looza (the County's Rule 30(b)(6) designee). The Court has already addressed the evidentiary problems concerning the submission of these exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Initially it is important to note that Plaintiff has not provided any evidence of any written policy or procedure of the County that in any way impacts this case. For purposes of its analysis, the Court separates Pinder's claims into theories of failing to train or supervise, having a custom or practice of using or allowing excessive force, and ratifying Skero's actions. The Court takes each of these theories in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Pinder first argues that the County is liable because of its alleged deliberate indifference to the need for training in several areas. In support, Pinder points to Skero's deposition testimony where he could not recall what kind of trainings he had, when he attended those trainings, and, at times, the contents of those trainings, as evidence of a lack of training in the County for its law enforcement officers. Pinder also contends that Sergeant Looza, who was designated as the County's representative in response to a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notice, only approved training class requests for officers and did not oversee what trainings are offered or otherwise handle curriculum. [Doc. 41 at 18]. As a result, because Looza did not have comprehensive knowledge of the County's training programs but is the 30(b)(6) designee, Pinder suggests that his lack of knowledge should indicate a lack of training in the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   This argument is unavailing. Demonstrating that two officers within the County do not remember what trainings are offered, or even forgot the contents of those classes, does not demonstrate that no trainings or insufficient trainings were offered. At most, it demonstrates that these officers did not pay attention to the trainings they received. While the Court acknowledges that the best interests of the public are served when officers are informed and up-to-date on their trainings, it cannot impose liability on a County for an individual officer's memory deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Moreover, Pinder has not submitted any authenticated evidence that can demonstrate that the County was deliberately indifferent to the obvious need for training within the areas he lists. To hold a municipality liable for failure to train an officer, \"it must have been obvious that 'the highly predictable consequence of not training' its officers was that they 'would apply force in such a way that the Fourth Amendment rights of [citizens] were at risk.' \"\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495782\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/838/#p847\">\n    588 F.3d at 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Although Pinder submitted unauthenticated use of force incident reports purportedly involving Skero on other occasions, he has presented no evidence that this Court considered. Even if the incident reports were considered, however, they presented several situations that included even more risk to officer safety than in the instant case, and as such they fail to present an issue of material fact demonstrating that it should have been\n   <em>\n    obvious\n   </em>\n   to the County that it was failing to train its officers adequately as to the proper use of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Similarly, Pinder has not presented any proper summary judgment evidence that the County was deliberately indifferent to the need to supervise its officers adequately. As with failure to train claims, for the County to be liable for failure to supervise, \"it at least must have been obvious that 'the highly predictable consequence' of not supervising its officers was that they 'would apply force in such a way that the Fourth Amendment rights of [citizens] were at risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495782\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/838/#p847\">\n    588 F.3d at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11194213\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/219/450/#p461\">\n    219 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   461 ). Again, no authenticated evidence supports this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court turns next to whether Pinder has presented any evidence to raise a fact issue for municipal liability on the basis that the County maintained a policy that was permissive of excessive force. To meet this burden, Pinder must show some evidence supporting the claim that an official policy or custom was the moving force behind the excessive force that allegedly violated his Fourth Amendment rights, as discussed previously. Pinder argues that Skero has a pattern of excessive force demonstrated by the number of use of force reports involving Skero. He claims, without any admissible evidence for support, that the number of Skero's use of force reports is above average and that the County's findings that those uses of force were justified are sufficient to establish a pattern of excessive force that could be said to represent the County's official policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Fifth Circuit has stated that a pattern can demonstrate an official policy where it is \"so common and well-settled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Piotrowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162285\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/567/#p578\">\n    237 F.3d at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Where prior incidents are used to prove a pattern, they 'must have occurred for so long or so frequently that the course of conduct warrants the attribution to the governing body of knowledge that the objectionable conduct is the expected, accepted practice of city employees.' \"\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"580899\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/735/838/#p841\">\n    735 F.2d at 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The incidents alleged in the unauthenticated use of force reports, even if properly proven, do not refer to similar types of force or incidents but instead include an accidental car collision, alleged unlawful entry for a search, and shooting a firearm at a fleeing subject. While the other alleged incidents involve the deployment of a taser and a takedown maneuver, they do not clearly contain such egregious facts as to indicate a pattern of repeated unwarranted use of force without ascending and measured responses to escalating force from the suspects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Additionally, Pinder provides no evidence regarding the use of force by other officers in the County with respect to takedown maneuvers, taser deployment, or chokeholds. Further, he does not provide evidence regarding the size of the police\n   force in the County in comparison to the number of arrests or use of force reports filed over the years involving these types of force. Without additional information, to hold the County liable here on the theory of a pattern establishing official policy would be effectively to hold the County liable for Skero on the theory of respondeat superior, which is expressly prohibited by\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p694\">\n    436 U.S. at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p694\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If this Court was to reach any conclusion based upon these unproven case reports, it would be that Skero has acted appropriately on all occasions. Pinder provides no evidence regarding what happened between Skero and the County after the incident with Pinder, although he mentions related state court proceedings where Pinder was found not guilty of assault on an officer (Skero), in which he alleges that the County represented or otherwise supported Skero. Again, no evidence, authenticated or otherwise, was provided on this subject.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Supreme Court precedent makes clear that \"[i]f the authorized policymakers approve a subordinate's decision and the basis for it, their ratification would be chargeable to the municipality because their decision is final.\"\n   <em>\n    City of St. Louis v.

As stated earlier, when tased, Pinder showed little or no reaction to it, nor has he offered any admissible evidence of any resulting injury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Obviously to the extent the video provides evidence that supports Pinder, the Court can consider the video.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
