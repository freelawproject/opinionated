The gravamen of his complaint is that a group of Pakistan-born doctors who \"ran\" St. Vincent's schemed to deprive him of patient referrals because he is white and not of Pakistani origin. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 36-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In a prior order, I granted the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to all of Dr. Holland's claims except his state and federal claims of national-origin discrimination and a retaliation claim under Title VII and Ohio law - claims which the motion did not attack.\n   <em>\n    Holland v.

Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants' principal argument is that Dr. Holland may not file an amended complaint unless he satisfies, not merely the standard set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), but also \"the requirements for reopening a case established by Civ. Rules 59 or 60.\" (Doc. 41, PageID 538). This is so, the defendants insist, because my prior order was \"an adverse judgment and Dr. Holland's motion for leave has been filed in a post-judgment context.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants' argument has no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Most simply put, my prior decision was an interlocutory order that disposed of fewer than all of Holland's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dyer v.

Rules 59 and 60 do not apply to such an interlocutory order.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hewitt v. McCrary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201365135\">\n    2019 WL 1365135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *8 (E.D.

Ohio 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Furthermore, none of the cases on which the defendants rely requires me to apply - or even suggests that it is appropriate to apply - a more stringent standard to Dr. Holland's motion for leave to amend than Rule 15's liberal standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Warstler v.

Ohio 2017), for example, I dismissed a complaint and entered a Rule 58 judgment. Thereafter, the plaintiff moved for reconsideration under Rule 59 and, for the first time in the litigation, sought leave to amend his complaint. Relying on binding Sixth Circuit precedent, I held that the plaintiff needed to meet, not the more permissive Rule 15 standard, but a \"heavier burden ... to warrant post-judgment leave to amend.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203088037\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leisure Caviar, LLC v.

The district court denied the motion, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Contrary to the Mercy defendants' arguments here, however, the Circuit did not base its decision on Glazer's inability to meet some \"heightened\" standard or show a \"compelling reason\" for allowing the amendment. It held instead that Glazer flunked the Rule 15 test: \"Glazer simply waited too long to seek leave to amend, and the delay unduly prejudiced Chase.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654038\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/453/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654038\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/453/\">\n    at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Whether Dr. Holland waited \"too long\" to seek leave to amend his complaint, and whether any such delay \"unduly prejudiced\" the defendants, may be reasons to deny Holland's motion under Rule 15(a)(2). But they are not reasons to adopt the defendants' false - and, quite candidly, rather fanciful - premise that my earlier decision was somehow a final judgment as to some of the claims in Dr. Holland's complaint, such that Holland may not amend his complaint unless he satisfies Rule 59 or 60 or provides a \"compelling reason,\" as in\n   <em>\n    Leisure Caviar, supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768153\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/612/#p617\">\n    616 F.3d at 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   If this were not plain enough from the posture of the case, it is quite plain from my order itself, which expressly invited Dr. Holland to file a motion for leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    Holland,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206041359\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206041359\">\n    2018 WL 6041359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Doc. 42, PageID 614-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The motion relies largely on \"the Sixth Circuit's liberality standard with respect to allowing amendments[.]\" (Doc. 40, PageID 483 at \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Dr. Holland also argues that the proposed amendments \"cured many deficiencies identified in his original complaint,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   such that the amendment are \"not futile.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 482 at \u00b6 12). He emphasizes that, as previously noted, the amended complaint \"removed several causes of action altogether.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, Dr. Holland argues that the amendment would not prejudice the defendants because I recently extended the discovery schedule. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 482 at \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Apart from their misguided arguments\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the defendants contend that I should deny Holland's motion under Rule 15 because of Holland's \"undue delay, bad faith, and resulting prejudice\" to them. (Doc. 41, PageID 551).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The defendants urge me to find that Dr. Holland is using my prior order as an advisory opinion on the viability of his complaint and attempting to correct the deficiencies identified there with information long known to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 545, 549).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Having considered these arguments, I will grant the motion for leave to amend over the defendants' objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, as my colleague District Judge Benita Y. Pearson, has aptly noted, \"the Sixth Circuit has held that it is not appropriate to dismiss even improperly pled claims with prejudice without giving the party an opportunity to correct the pleading deficiency.\"\n   <em>\n    Empire Title Servs., Inc. v. Fifth Third Mortg. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321153\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/298/528/#p530\">\n    298 F.R.D. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 530 (N.D. Ohio 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Indeed, \" 'where a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim, a plaintiff must be given at least one chance to amend the complaint before the district court dismisses the action with prejudice.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321153\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/298/528/#p530\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel. Bledsoe v. Cmty. Health Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9100503\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/342/634/#p644\">\n    342 F.3d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644 (6th Cir. 2003) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, given the vigor with which the defendants' Rule 12(c) motion successfully challenged the plausibility of Dr. Holland's complaint, I had expected the defendants to raise similar challenges in their opposition to the motion for leave. Yet the defendants' brief does not address the plausibility of any of Dr. Holland's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate to deny Dr. Holland's motion and forever preclude him from proceeding on the claims at issue, as not even the defendants have argued that those claims remain implausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Third, and given the foregoing considerations, I do not find much merit it, and thus give little weight to, the defendants' undue-delay and prejudice arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants note that, by virtue of their May, 2018 motion for judgment on the pleadings, Holland has long been on notice of the \"fatal flaws\" in his original complaint. (Doc. 41, PageID 539-40). But rather than file a motion for leave to amend after being so advised, defendants continue, Dr. Holland opposed the Rule 12(c) motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 540). Only now, the defendants' argument concludes, more than seven months after they filed their motion, Holland has tried to amend the complaint based on information that his long been available to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 549 -50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   I disagree that these circumstances should preclude Dr. Holland from obtaining leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Most importantly, these considerations do not, and should not, in my view override Dr. Holland's ability to submit a \"more carefully drafted complaint\" setting forth his claims.\n   <em>\n    Empire Title Servs., supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321153\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/298/528/#p530\">\n    298 F.R.D. at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is especially true where the defendants have not challenged the plausibility of the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In any event, the defendants' claims of prejudice flowing from the delay are entirely\n   conclusory. There is no contention that my granting the motion for leave will affect the discovery schedule, require more or more onerous forms of discovery, or the like. Nor is there an explanation of how the defendants have been or will be prejudiced, other than the bare fact that more claims will remain in the case than the defendants believe should remain in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Fourth, defendants' claim that Dr. Holland's motion is in bad faith is hard to square with his having abandoned several of the claims that I identified as implausible in\n   <em>\n    Holland,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206041359\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Rather than seek amendment of the complaint\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Holland has properly winnowed out the most implausible of his claims, such as his claims for hostile work environment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holland,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206041359\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206041359\">\n    2018 WL 6041359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5-7, violations of the Ohio whistleblower statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *12, and intentional infliction of emotional distress,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At the end of the day, Rule 15 instructs that \"[l]eave to amend should be 'freely' granted 'when justice so requires.\"\n   <em>\n    Pittman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518353\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/619/#p640\">\n    901 F.3d at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Fed.
