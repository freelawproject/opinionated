K.B. and P.B. formally adopted M.B. and her brother on February 1, 2017, and K.B. and P.B. have been the legal parents and guardians of both children since that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Shortly thereafter, KidsPeace employee Cori Ruszkowski contacted K.B. and P.B. about potentially placing an 11-year-old boy, J.W., in K.B. and P.B.'s care. At that time, J.W. was in the custody of Schuylkill County Children &amp; Youth Services (\"SCCYS\"), which is an agency of Schuylkill County. Although K.B. and P.B. \"were not looking to foster a child of [J.W.'s] age,\" Ms. Ruszkowski assured K.B. and P.B. that \"J.W. acted younger than his biological age and that he posed no risk, sexual or otherwise, to [K.B. and P.B.'s] minor children,\" including M.B.

Ms. Ruszkowski reaffirmed that J.W. did not have a history of sexual abuse, molestation, or past behavioral issues that might cause problems at K.B. and P.B.'s home. K.B. and P.B. were only told that J.W. had one \"minor incident\" in his prior home, in which he \"turned over a table.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On or around May 22, 2017, K.B. and P.B. met with J.W. for the first time, at Lehigh Valley Hospital. The meeting and a medical exam did not raise any red flags with K.B. and P.B., and so they agreed to foster J.W. After that meeting, Ms. Ruszkowski text messaged K.B. that J.W. had \"been through the ringer,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36, but did not explain what she meant by that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A few days later, on or around May 25, 2017, Ms. Ruszkowski and Marcia Hoke-a case worker at SCCYS-\"transported [J.W.] for placement\" in K.B. and P.B.'s home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.

(1) adequately pleads an individual liability state-created danger\n   claim against Marcia Hoke, and (2) adequately pleads an organizational liability\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against Schuylkill County. As to the CSS Defendants' and KidsPeace Defendants' arguments, the Court agrees that neither was acting under color of state law and therefore M.B. does not adequately allege \u00a7 1983 claims against the CSS Defendants or the KidsPeace Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, the Court analyzes the negligence and vicarious liability claims against the CSS Defendants. The Court determines that although the CSS Defendants owed a general duty of care to M.B., the Amended Complaint does not contain any allegations of misfeasance by the CSS Defendants, and so the negligence and vicarious liability claims cannot proceed against the CSS Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Fourth, the Court analyzes the KidsPeace Defendants' argument that the Amended Complaint does not state a claim for negligent misrepresentation. The Court acknowledges that M.B. does not make any allegation of reliance by M.B., but nonetheless holds that, as set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, the reliance of one party-here M.B.'s parents-can be imputed to a third party-here M.B.-to satisfy the reliance element of negligent misrepresentation. Consequently, the Court will not dismiss the negligent misrepresentation claim against the KidsPeace Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Fifth and finally, the Court analyzes the KidsPeace Defendants' request to dismiss the negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   claims. The Court will not dismiss these claims, because the purpose of the relevant administrative laws was, at least in part, to protect foster families-and not just foster children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Ms. Hoke was present when J.W. was physically placed with K.B. and P.B., and Ms. Hoke also knew that K.B. and P.B. had children.

First, Ms. Hoke had ample notice that her specific actions could endanger the children in K.B.'s and P.B.'s home, as the foster parents explicitly asked Ms. Hoke whether J.W. would pose a risk to their other children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35, 37.

As the Court of Appeals vividly observed, \"if the state puts a person in a position of danger from private persons and then fails to protect him, it will not be heard to say that its role was merely passive; it is as much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown him into a snake pit.\"\n   <em>\n    L.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353472\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/235/#p245\">\n    836 F.3d at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and quotation omitted).

The KidsPeace Defendants make three arguments that M.B.'s claim for negligent misrepresentation fails, none of which are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   First, the KidsPeace Defendants argue that there are no \"plausible\" allegations that they had \"knowledge of a danger[.]\" Doc. No. 48-1 at p. 20. This appears to be an attempt by the KidsPeace Defendants to argue that they did not misrepresent J.W.'s history and the safety of placing J.W. in M.B.'s home. But this argument overlooks that the KidsPeace Defendants allegedly knew (or had in their possession) the following information when KidsPeace employee Cori Ruszkowski spoke with K.B. and P.B.: (1) at a prior foster home, J.W. asked another child to have sex with him, Amended Compl. \u00b6 44, (2) J.W. was not allowed to be in the same foster home as his biological siblings because he told them to \"do bad things,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45, and (3) J.W. alleged that he had previously been abused,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. This information all contradicts Ms. Ruszkowski's alleged statement to K.B. and P.B. that J.W. had no \"sexual assault, molestation or troubling behavioral history.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Second, the KidsPeace Defendants argue that they are not liable for any misrepresentation because K.B. and P.B. found out about J.W.'s history prior to his alleged assault of M.B.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 48-1 at 20-21. The KidsPeace Defendants do not state, however, what legal significance this fact has, if any. To the extent that this is a half-hearted attempt by the KidsPeace Defendants to challenge causation, M.B. has adequately alleged both factual and proximate causation. The Amended Complaint states in several points that K.B. and P.B. would not have fostered J.W. absent the representations from the KidsPeace Defendants that J.W. posed no risk to K.B. and P.B.'s children,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Amended Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, establishing factual causation. And the KidsPeace Defendants' alleged misrepresentations were similarly a proximate cause of, or \"substantial factor in bringing about,\" the harm to M.B.\n   <em>\n    Flickinger's Estate v. Ritsky\n   </em>\n   , 74,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"575042\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/452/69/\">\n    452 Pa. 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%2040\">\n    305 A.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43 (1973) (adopting \"substantial factor\" test for proximate causation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Third, the KidsPeace Defendants argue that M.B. did not detrimentally rely on any alleged misrepresentation. As M.B. acknowledges, the Amended Complaint does not allege that M.B. relied on any misrepresentation made by the KidsPeace Defendants. Instead, M.B.'s theory is that \"M.B.'s\n   <em>\n    parents\n   </em>\n   relied on the inaccurate information provided by the Kids[P]eace Defendants[.]\" Doc. No. 52-1 at p. 29 (emphasis added). It does not matter, M.B. argues, that her parents relied on the KidsPeace Defendants' representations. In support, she cites\n   <em>\n    Frantz v. Nationwide Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-0509,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204207742\">\n    2018 WL 4207742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Pa.

Although the court in\n   <em>\n    Frantz\n   </em>\n   refused to dismiss a negligent misrepresentation claim, the court conducted no analysis of the reliance element.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Nonetheless, the Court is persuaded that because Pennsylvania has embraced \u00a7 311 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, M.B. is correct that her parents' reliance can support M.B.'s cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. Section 311 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   (1) One who negligently gives false information to another is subject to\n   liability for physical harm caused by action taken by the other in reasonable reliance upon such information, where such harm results\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   (a) to the other, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    to such third persons as the actor should expect to be put in peril by the action taken.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    English v.

This does not change the foregoing analysis for two reasons. First, it does not diminish the fact that\n    <em>\n     historically\n    </em>\n    foster placement in Pennsylvania was not an exclusively public function. And second, the Court today notes that the relevant Pennsylvania administrative provisions suggest that foster placement continues to involve private\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    public actors, rather than exclusively public agencies. For example, the State Administrative Code chapter on Foster Family Care Agencies applies to any \"agency operated by a person, organization, corporation or society,\n    <em>\n     public or private\n    </em>\n    , for profit or not-for-profit, which approves or supervises foster families or provides foster family care.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203700.1\">\n     55 Pa.
