Hinkle, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case presents a First Amendment challenge to a Florida statute requiring\n   convicted sex offenders to notify the Florida Department of Law Enforcement of their internet identifiers. This order upholds the statute in substantial part but protects the right to anonymous speech by prohibiting FDLE from publicly disclosing information of a kind that FDLE has compiled but never publicly disclosed and that no member of the public has ever requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Florida maintains a sex offender registry. An individual who has been convicted of a qualifying sex offense must register with FDLE and must provide specified information. The information includes, among other things, the registrant's name, physical address, email addresses, and, subject to exceptions, the registrant's internet identifiers-names the registrant uses to communicate directly with other internet users. Failure to comply with these requirements is a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FDLE maintains a publicly available website with each registrant's name and physical address. A user of the website thus may determine whether an individual is a registered sex offender and, if so, the registrant's physical address. The publicly available website lists email addresses and internet identifiers that have been disclosed by registrants, but the website does not match them up-the website does not indicate which registrant is associated with which email address or internet identifier. FDLE makes that information-the identity of the registrant associated with any given email address or internet identifier-available to law enforcement officers for use in investigating crimes. FDLE policy allows disclosure of that information to members of the public only on written request, not over the internet. No member of the public has ever made a written request for that information, so FDLE has never publicly disclosed it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 77, at 6 ; Coffee decl., ECF No. 77-1, at \u00b6 36 ; Rough Tr. of Summ. J. Hr'g at 50, 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiffs are registered sex offenders. They filed this action against the Commissioner of FDLE in his official capacity. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs assert the requirement to notify FDLE of their internet identifiers violates the First Amendment because the requirement burdens their protected speech, deters them from engaging in protected speech, and deprives them of the right to anonymous speech. The plaintiffs also assert the statute's description of which internet identifiers must be registered is unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   FDLE asserts the plaintiffs lack standing and are wrong on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The motions have been fully briefed and orally argued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. The Statute\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Florida sex-offender registry statute imposes requirements on individuals with qualifying sex-offense convictions who reside in Florida or visit for as little as three days in a calendar year.

The statute requires registration of a sex offender's email addresses and any username a sex offender uses in connection with a communication over the internet directly with another user, with the following exceptions. A username need not be registered based only on a communication whose primary purpose is to facilitate a commercial transaction involving goods or services, or a communication over a website whose primary purpose is the dissemination of news, or a communication with a governmental entity. And a username need not be registered based only on its use on a website or application that does not allow users to create web pages or profiles as described in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For the most part, the summary set out in the preceding paragraph derives from the plain language of the statute. But the limitation to communications directly with another user is less clear. That limitation is mandated by three considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, while not explicit, the statutory language strongly supports the limitation. The statute defines an internet identifier as a \"designation, moniker, screen name, username, or other name\n   <em>\n    used for self-identification to send or receive social Internet communication.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20943.0435\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 775.21(2)(j) (emphasis added). The italicized phrase is most naturally understood as a reference to communications between users; that is what makes a communication \"social\" and provides an occasion for \"self-identification.\" Further, the registration requirement is triggered only by communications through a commercial social networking website or application software that \"offers a mechanism for communication with other users, such as a forum, chat room, electronic mail, or instant messenger.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20943.0435\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 943.0437(1). Requiring that a website or app provides a platform for direct user-to-user communications is not the same as requiring the platform to be used, but the provision does make clear the statute's focus on direct user-to-user communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is those communications, after all, that pose the risk of sex offenses that the statute aims to reduce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, any doubt on this score should be resolved by the rule of lenity, under which ambiguities in a criminal statute-this is one-that require a court to guess at the statute's meaning must be resolved in a defendant's favor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muscarello v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181745\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/125/#p138\">\n    524 U.S. 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 138,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181745\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/125/#p138\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181745\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/125/#p138\">\n    141 L.Ed.2d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Summ. J., ECF No. 77, at 12 (\"The context of the registration provisions makes clear that they relate solely to actual online communications by a registered sexual offender with another person.\"); Rough Tr. of Summ. J. Hr'g at 48 (agreeing, after specific questioning, that the requirement to register an internet identifier \"only applies when there is a communication with another user\"). The state's solemn representation that the statute is so limited confirms that this reading of the statute is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. Standing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

Second, \"there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of-the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks, ellipses, and brackets omitted). Third, \"it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   That the plaintiffs meet these requirements is clear. The plaintiffs have been convicted of qualifying sex offenses. They are on the Florida sex-offender registry. The statutory requirement to register email addresses and usernames applies to the plaintiffs themselves. If, as the plaintiffs assert, the requirement is unconstitutional, the requirement to register is imposing on them an injury in fact-an injury that is concrete and particularized, actual and not just imminent but ongoing. The causal connection between the statute and the injury is certain; the challenged statute is the sole cause of the injury. And it is not only likely but certain, or nearly so, that a favorable decision will redress the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In asserting the contrary, the Commissioner says no member of the public has ever made a written request to FDLE for a sex offender's email address or username, so the information has never been made public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 77, at 6 ; Coffee decl., ECF No. 77-1, at \u00b6 36 ; Rough Tr. of Summ. J. Hr'g at 50, 52. This does not mean, though, that the requirement to provide the information to FDLE inflicts no injury in fact. First, the steps required to provide the information take time; this imposes a burden that constitutes an injury in fact, even if no member of the public ever asks for the information. Second, and more importantly, the plaintiffs have provided unrebutted\n   testimony that the requirement to provide the information to FDLE has deterred them from using the internet as extensively as they otherwise would have; this, too, is an injury in fact, even if no member of the public ever asks for the information. Third, individuals have an interest in keeping information confidential not just from the public but also from FDLE; this loss of confidentiality, too, imposes an injury in fact, even if no member of the public ever asks for the information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   That no member of the public has ever asked for the information does not defeat standing, but this does make clear that the state's interest in making the information publicly available is zero or close to zero. This goes to the merits, as addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV.

If the person on the other end of the user-to-user communication knows the registrant's true identity, the challenged requirement will make no difference at all. Thus, for example, if a plaintiff communicates with a person who knows the plaintiff's identity, the requirement to register email addresses and internet identifiers won't matter; that the plaintiff is a sex offender is already publicly available through the registry. If, on the other hand, the person on the other end of the user-to-user communication does not know the plaintiff's identity, the challenged requirement will allow the person to learn that he or she is communicating with a sex offender-information that, for most other communications in most other settings, is already available through the registry itself. On the rare occasion when a party to an anonymous user-to-user communication over the internet checks to see whether the person on the other end is a sex offender, the party probably will have a reason to check-suggesting that checking may well serve an important purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The plaintiffs insist, though, that the risk that a convicted sex offender will use the internet to reoffend is exaggerated and that the challenged statute is overbroad, requiring disclosures by individuals and in circumstances that pose no real risk. The plaintiffs say sex offenders as a group are no more likely-indeed less likely-than most other felons to reoffend. The plaintiffs say sex offenders who did not use the internet to commit their sex offenses are not likely to use the internet to commit new sex offenses. And the plaintiffs say properly trained professionals can use reliable tests to sort out offenders who pose a risk to reoffend from those who do not, making it unnecessary to impose disclosure requirements on offenders who pose no risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Sex-offender registries sweep broadly, requiring registration for a wide array of offenses committed in a wide array of circumstances. Some registrants pose a substantial risk. Some do not. A state legislature could reasonably decide to narrow the list of offenses mandating registration. But the plaintiffs' assertion that methods are available to reliably identify offenders with qualifying offenses who pose no risk runs counter to common experience and to the considered judgment not just of the State of Florida but of every other state. The Supreme Court has held that a state may require registration of all individuals convicted\n   of qualifying offenses; a state need not make an individualized assessment of risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conn. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030296\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/1/#p6\">\n    538 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6-7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030296\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/1/#p6\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030296\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/1/#p6\">\n    155 L.Ed.2d 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Responses to the plaintiffs' other assertions also are readily available. Recidivism correlates with criminal history. Convicted sex offenders as a whole may have lower overall criminal histories than other offenders. If so, one would expect sex offenders to have lower overall recidivism rates. But regardless of the\n   <em>\n    overall\n   </em>\n   recidivism rate, it is likely that convicted sex offenders commit more new\n   <em>\n    sex offenses\n   </em>\n   than other offenders. The plaintiffs' proffered studies do not suggest the contrary. There is nothing improper about a state's effort to reduce repeat sex offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   That a sex offender did not use the internet for a prior crime-perhaps a crime committed when the internet did not exist or social media were not as widespread-does not indicate the offender will not use the internet in a future crime. It is a person's prior commission of a sexual offense, not the precise manner in which it was committed, that shows at least a past proclivity or willingness to commit a sexual offense and poses a risk that it will happen again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In any event, the plaintiffs' assertion that the risk is exaggerated does not mean the state's interest in reducing sex offenses is not substantial, indeed compelling. One sex offense is one too many. One opportunity to groom a child victim is one too many. The Supreme Court settled long ago the issue of whether sex-offender registries are constitutionally permissible; they are.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

A convicted sex offender may constitutionally be required to register and to publicly disclose name, physical address, and additional information. Requiring the registrant to disclose email addresses and internet identifiers to FDLE is also permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     VI. Content Discrimination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Application of intermediate scrutiny to this statute is not inconsistent with the principle that strict scrutiny applies to statutes that are not viewpoint-and content-neutral. This statute is viewpoint neutral-whether a sex offender must register an email address or internet identifier does not depend on the viewpoint expressed. And with one exception, the statute is content neutral-the statute's applicability does not depend on the content of a communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The exception is this. The requirement to register internet identifiers has an exception for communications whose primary purpose is the facilitation of commercial transactions involving goods or services. There is no exception for other communications, including, for example, political communications. So a communication between the same individuals over the same platform in the same circumstances at the same time-that is, a communication in the same time, place, and manner-is covered or not depending on the content of the communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This is the very paradigm of content discrimination. A law is content discriminatory if it \"applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.\"\n   <em>\n    Reed v. Town of Gilbert\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2231\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2227,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2231\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Here a communication is covered or not based on \"the topic discussed\"-whether a commercial transaction or something else. Put more intuitively, if one must read a message to decide whether a statute applies,\n   the statute probably discriminates based on content.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCullen v. Coakley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20464\">\n    573 U.S. 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581709\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2518/#p2531\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2531,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581709\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2518/#p2531\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The question, then, is whether this exception-an exception intended to narrow the statute's applicability and thus to reduce the burden on speech-has the perverse effect of subjecting a less-burdensome statute to more-stringent scrutiny. For two reasons, the answer is no. First, this is an exception at the margin, having little relationship to the real dispute. Second, the legislature's goal was to prevent overbreadth-to reduce the sweep of the registration requirement-not to favor or disfavor speech on any topic. The Supreme Court's recent statement in rejecting a First Amendment challenge to a different Florida statute could as easily have been written for this case: \"We will not punish Florida for leaving open more, rather than fewer, avenues of expression, especially when there is no indication that the selective restriction of speech reflects a pretextual motive.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee v.

The plaintiffs say that by requiring disclosure of their internet identifiers, the challenged statute prevents them from engaging in anonymous speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At least two federal courts have relied on the right to anonymous speech in striking down statutes requiring sex offenders to disclose internet identifiers to law enforcement officials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4315216\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/563/#p576\">\n    772 F.3d 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    White v.

Ga. 2010). In both cases, law enforcement officials had authority to disclose the internet identifiers\n   <em>\n    to the public\n   </em>\n   for law enforcement purposes or to protect public safety. The courts held this gave law enforcement officials too much discretion to disclose a speaker's identity, thus violating the First Amendment right to anonymous speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Here, FDLE makes available to the public a list of email addresses and internet identifiers associated with registered sex offenders, but FDLE does not publicly disclose which sex offender is associated with which email address or internet identifier. Quite the contrary. FDLE has a policy allowing disclosure of a sex offender's email address or internet identifier to a member of the public only on written request. There has never been a written request, so the information has never been made publicly available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   That there has never been a request makes clear what would be apparent anyway: the public disclosure of which registrant is associated with any given email address or internet identifier is not necessary to serve a substantial state interest. The Commissioner conceded this, or nearly so, at oral argument, labeling \"true\" the assertion that the state could exempt this information from public disclosure \"and not lose one thing in terms of sex offenses.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rough Tr. of Summ. J. Hr'g at 52. The Commissioner explained the statute's failure to exempt this information from public disclosure only on the ground that in Florida, a legislative exemption from the public-records statute must be passed by a super-majority vote. At least in these circumstances, this is not a state\n   interest sufficient to override the right to anonymous speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A person receiving an email or a communication over the internet who wishes to determine whether it is from a registered sex offender can readily do so, and, if the answer is yes, the person can take appropriate action, breaking off the communication and, if warranted, reporting the communication to law enforcement. Learning the registrant's actual identity, if not already known, would serve no additional substantial purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This order thus enjoins the Commissioner from publicly disclosing the identity of the offender associated with a registered email address or internet identifier. This does not, however, preclude FDLE from disclosing the information to law enforcement officials. The record shows that law enforcement officers have used this information to investigate and solve crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hoffman Decl., ECF No. 77-2, at \u00b6 19.

This is perhaps the statute's least clear provision. Even so, the application of this provision is clear in most instances; the ambiguity exists only at the margins. Perhaps more importantly, it is far from clear that the ambiguity will ever make a real difference in a registrant's real decision whether to register a username. Pressed at oral argument for real-world examples of what actual difference the registration requirement would make, the plaintiffs struggled to cite any concrete example for which the perceived ambiguity of the web-page and profile provisions would matter.

Making that information available to law enforcement officers for official use is not unconstitutional. Public disclosure of email addresses and internet identifiers associated with registered sex offenders-without disclosing the identity of the sex offender associated with a given email address or internet identifier-is not unconstitutional.

The Constitution does not prohibit FDLE from making the disclosed information available to law enforcement agencies and officers for official use.
