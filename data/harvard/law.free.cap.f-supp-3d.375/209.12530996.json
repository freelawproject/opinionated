(\"Plaintiff\") brought this action seeking injunctive relief and damages for violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERLA\") against Defendants Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, the State of New York, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (\"NYSDEC\"), Basil Seggos in his official capacity as Commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Martin Brand in his official capacity as Deputy Commissioner of the N.Y. State Department of Environmental Conservation, and Carrie Meek Gallagher, in her official capacity as Regional Director for Region 1 of the N.Y. State Department of Environmental Conservation (all together the \"State Defendants\"), and the United States of America and the United States Department of the Navy (\"Navy,\" together with the United States of America, \"Federal Defendants,\" and together with the State Defendants, \"Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court are the State Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P (\"Rule\") 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, as well as the Federal Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant Rule 12(b)(1). For the reasons explained below, both the State Defendants' and the Federal Defendants' motions are granted and the matter is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following relevant facts are taken from the Amended Complaint (\"Am. Compl.\") and are assumed true for purposes of this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This action concerns activities that commenced in the early 1940's on approximately 605 acres in Bethpage, New York (the \"Bethpage Facilities\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6 35.) The Navy operated the Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant (\"NWIRP\") on 105 of the 605 acres. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) The NWIRP was government-owned and occupied, but contractor-operated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The remaining 500 acres were owned by Northup Grumman, formerly Grumman Aerospace Corporation and Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation (\"Grumman\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Operations at the Bethpage Facilities included, \"among other things, research, prototyping, testing, design engineering, fabrication, and primary assembly of military aircraft.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During many decades of operations at the Bethpage Facilities, Grumman and Defendant Navy \"used, spilled, and/or otherwise discarded hazardous materials into the surrounding soils.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) Apparently, these hazardous materials eventually reached the groundwater, which spread the pollutants over a wide area creating a \"Plume.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Defendants do not dispute the existence of the Plume, or that it contains perchloroethene (tetrachloroethylene),\n   trichloroethene, dichloroethenes, vinyl chloride, 1,1,1 trichloroethane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) \"Several public drinking water supply wells are known to be threatened by the Plume.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 1983, the NYSDEC listed the Bethpage Facilities as a New York State Inactive Hazardous Waste Site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) In 1993, the NYSDEC divided the Bethpage Facilities into the Grumman site and the 105-acre Navy NWIRP site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) The Bethpage Facilities are currently listed as Class 2 Inactive Hazardous Waste Sites, meaning \"the disposal of hazardous waste has been confirmed and the presence of such hazardous waste or its components or breakdown products represents a significant threat to public health or the environment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Radium is a radioactive metal that exists in thirty four isotopes and is a hazardous waste when disposed. The maximum contaminant level (\"MCL\"), which is the legal threshold limit, for Radium-226 and Radium-228 is five picocuries per liter (\"pCi/L\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-65.) Quantities exceeding this MCL in the drinking water supply are hazardous to human health and the environment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Radium has not been found to exceed the MCL naturally on Long Island. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) Apparently, Defendants have never released sampling results for Radium-226 or Radium-228 from the Plume. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Bethpage local water district's public drinking water supply well 4-1 is located southeast of the Bethpage Facilities and in the direction of the groundwater flow. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) On August 4, 2012, the local water district detected Radium in well 4-1 at 4.72 pCi/L, just below the MCL of 5 pCi/L. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) In or around May 2013, the local water district shut down well 4-1 from service due to the detection of elevated Radium that was continuing to rise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) On December 7, 2015, Radium was detected at well 4-1 at 5.92 pCi/L and 5.21 pCi/L. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In June 2017, the Bethpage School District released sampling results from three groundwater monitoring wells at Bethpage High School showing Radium detected at levels ranging from 10.46 pCi/L to 24.74 pCi/L. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) In August 2017, the Bethpage School District released sampling results from three groundwater monitoring wells at the High School showing Radium detected at levels ranging from 9.63 pCi/L to 23.95 pCi/L. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) Also in August, the Bethpage School District released sampling results from three groundwater monitoring wells at Central Boulevard Elementary School showing Radium detected at levels ranging from 12.19 pCi/L to 32.18 pCi/L. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) Plaintiff alleges that there are at least twelve additional samples taken in the Bethpage area from 2013 to 2016 detecting Radium levels ranging from 5.23 pCi/L to 8.59 pCi/L. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to contaminating groundwater, Radium-226 decays to the radioactive gas Radon-222, which is a known carcinogen that \"can move upwardly through soil and may impact indoor air quality[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90, 91.) Radon generally occurs on Long Island at levels below 2.0 pCi/L. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.) The recommended indoor air action level for Radon is 4.0 pCi/L. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100.) The Bethpage School District conducted isolated Radon sampling at the Bethpage High School and the Central Boulevard Elementary School, which revealed Radon levels of 3.8 pCi/L and 3.9 pCi/L, just below the threshold of 4.0 pCi/L. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.) Plaintiff does not make any comment on the risks of Radon at level of 3.9 pCi/L, if any, but anything at or above 4.0 pCi/L would be a danger to human health and the environment. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Defendants have failed to formally investigate Radon contamination in the Bethpage area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112.) Plaintiff also contends that the State Defendants\n   contributed to the endangerment of the public and the environment by failing to take action required by law. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 250-253.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff brought the instant action on February 1, 2018, and filed the Amended Complaint on April 12, 2018. The Amended Complaint sets forth three causes of action. The first claim is brought against all Defendants for violations of RCRA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 420-428.) The second claim is brought against the Federal Defendants for violations of CERCLA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 429-439.) The third claim is brought against all Defendants for injunctive relief \"preventing Defendants from continuing the current violations\" and seeking for Plaintiff's counsel to be appointed to oversee the cleanup efforts and to receive a commission equal to five percent (5%) of the total funds allocated for the Bethpage Facilities.

(Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 a-k.) Putting aside the Court's concerns that this type of remedy appointing private counsel to oversee a government remediation pursuant to CERCLA and RCRA seems to be unprecedented, and may be barred by the very statutes this action seeks to enforce, the majority of the relief sought compels\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff\n   </em>\n   to act and requires everything to be paid for out of the public treasury. Of the eight demands, all but three-Demands 3, 4, and 6-relate to Plaintiff's actions. Demand 6 explicitly asks for Defendants to pay for the other demands, in effect asking the Court to compel Defendants to pay for Plaintiff's actions. Thus, the cost to the state is not the \"ancillary\" result of a prospective injunction compelling state officials to carry out their duties. Rather, the cost is an integral component\n   of the relief explicitly sought by Plaintiff and is in large part the actual relief sought by Plaintiff. This is especially true given that Plaintiff asks the Court to order Defendants to\n   <em>\n    pay\n   </em>\n   for Plaintiff to conduct the studies and oversee the remedial activities, rather than asking the Court to order Defendants to carry out these actions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Dairy Mart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8951458,8964402\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/411/367/\">\n    411 F.3d at 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that when the action is in essence for recovery of funds it is barred by the Eleventh Amendment, but an injunction requiring state officials to carry out their duties that results in the expenditure of funds as an ancillary effect of such prospective relief falls within the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception). The only demands that could be construed as possibly comporting with\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   are Demands 4 and 5. However, both seek \"substantial participation of Plaintiff\" and are therefore interwoven with Plaintiff's request for compensation and for the Court to order Plaintiff to act. Thus, there are no claims for prospective injunctive relief for which cost is an ancillary effect. Accordingly, this action as it is brought against the individual state defendants is truly against the State as the real, substantial party Therefore, this matter does not fall within the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that where\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   applies, the state is automatically\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the true party.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Federal Defendants counter that the response action at the Bethpage Facilities has been undertaken pursuant to the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (\"DERP\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202700\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2711, which functions together with \u00a7 104 and is thus barred from judicial review by \u00a7 113(h).

As explained above, Plaintiff challenges whether the geographic range of the Plume that is outside the NWIRP falls within the scope of E.O. 12580 and \u00a7 104. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mem. in Opp. at 18.) The term \"facility\" is not defined in E.O. 12580, nor does the Executive Order cross-reference any other legislation for definitions. Even if the Court reads the CERCLA definition for a facility into E.O. 12580 (\"any site or area where a hazardous substance has ... otherwise come to be located\"), its applicability is still constrained by the requirement that the site be under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of the Department of Defense (\"DOD\"). This provision in E.O. 12580 is difficult to reconcile with the language in \u00a7 2701(c)(1) stating that DERP applies to \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   response actions with respect to\n   <em>\n    releases\n   </em>\n   of hazardous substances from\" a DOD-controlled facility. As a \"release\" is defined to include leaching, and leaching has been interpreted to include passive migration, the DERP should logically apply to the clean-up of passive migration from a federally-owned or operated facility, whether or not those releases have stayed on a federal facility. This interpretation is reinforced by the DOD's own guidance in the DERP Management Manual, which provides that \"DERP includes all environmental restoration activities undertaken by a DOD Component\" including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   At a facility or site that is not on real property that is or was owned by, leased to, or otherwise possessed by the United States and under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense, provided that contamination attributable to the DOD has migrated from (e.g. by groundwater flow) ... a site [owned by, leased to, possessed or under the jurisdiction of the DOD].

In the interim, the site was rented by Boeing's predecessor, North American Aviation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4015672\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/709/888/#p921\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The hazardous substances at the site included two industrial solvents, and the related plume extended \"12,000 feet long, up to 4,000 feet wide at points, and up to 300 feet deep at points.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4015672\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/709/888/#p921\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4015672\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/709/888/#p921\">\n    at 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Eastern District of California does not specify in its decision which of the parties contributed to the contamination, but based on the cost-sharing \"Cooperative Agreement\" discussed therein it seems that both the Army and North American\n   Aviation discharged hazardous substances.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4015672\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/709/888/#p921\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    City of Fresno\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff argued that the clean-up was proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 120, while the defendant United States countered that the clean-up was proceeding pursuant to E.O. 12580 and the DERP statute. The Eastern District of California held that the cleanup was proceeding under E.O. 12580 and the DERP statute, not \u00a7 120, because the property was not federally owned at the time of the cleanup. The Eastern District of California does not provide any further discussion on the scope or application of E.O. 12580.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The facts in\n   <em>\n    City of Fresno\n   </em>\n   are similar to the facts at bar insomuch as both cases involve hazardous substances that were released by the DOD at DOD properties, plumes that have spread far beyond the original property, and co-mingled contaminants. The Court notes that this is a close call with convincing evidence on both sides. In light of the Eastern District of California's holding in\n   <em>\n    City of Fresno\n   </em>\n   , the language of \u00a7 2701(c) read together with the definitions in CERCLA, the guidance in the DERP Manual, and the lack of any other instructive precedent on this issue, the Court finds that the scales tip in the Federal Defendants' favor. Accordingly, the Court holds that the Federal Defendants' cleanup activities related to the Bethpage Facilities Plume fall within the scope of E.O. 12580 and DERP even where the Plume has extended beyond the NWIRP site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Courts in other districts have found that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)\"functions together with CERCLA \u00a7 104\" such that \"[a] ]ll the evidence points to the applicability of [\u00a7 104], which falls under the jurisdictional bar of [\u00a7 113(h) ].\n   <em>\n    City of Salina v.

It seems that the Second Circuit has not addressed this question, and neither Plaintiff nor Defendants indicate otherwise. Nevertheless, the Court is persuaded by the case law in other Circuits and agrees that the DERP statute implicates \u00a7 104. Therefore, the instant cleanup efforts are protected from judicial review \u00a7 113(h). Section 113(h) extends to challenges brought under both CERCLA and RCRA, so this action is dismissed in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Camillus Clean Air Coalition v.

The Court has found that the cleanup efforts at issue in this action fall under \u00a7 104. Section 104(b) provides that \"whenever the President has reason to believe that a release has occurred\n   or is about to occur ... he may undertake such investigations, monitoring, surveys, testing, and other information gathering as he may deem necessary or appropriate to identify the existence and extent of the release or threat thereof[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). The Southern District of New York has previously held that \"testing and other investigative measures\" qualify as a removal action under \u00a7 104.\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Potter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9410870\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/208/415/#p420\">\n    208 F.Supp.2d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). Again, this appears to be a question of law that is underdeveloped in this Circuit and others. Here, the Court finds that the language of \u00a7 104(b) and the rationale in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   demonstrate that the Federal Defendants' investigations into radium constitute a removal action under \u00a7 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court is unpersuaded by Plaintiff's assertion that the Federal Defendants must first determine that the radium is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   naturally-occurring under \u00a7 104(a)(3) before the investigation comes within the ambit of \u00a7 104(b). This logic is a legal paradox because Plaintiff is essentially stating that the Federal Defendants cannot undertake an investigation under \u00a7 104(b) until they are already certain of the result of such investigation. Section 104(b) establishes that the President only needs \"reason to believe\" that a release has occurred in order to begin an investigation thereunder. Therefore, the Court finds that the Federal Defendants' investigations have been carried out pursuant to \u00a7 104(b). Likewise, the Court declines to consider Plaintiff's arguments citing unrelated provisions of CERCLA and nonbinding precedent from other Circuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Accordingly, the Federal Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted in its entirety. Plaintiff is not given leave to re-plead its claims or to add a \u00a7 120(h) claim because all of the Defendants are protected by either sovereign immunity or CERCLA's bar on judicial review, and amending the Complaint will not give this Court subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the State Defendants' Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) is granted based on sovereign immunity. Furthermore, the Federal Defendants' Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) is granted based on the bar on judicial review in CERCLA \u00a7 113(h). Accordingly, the matter is dismissed and the Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment and close the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
