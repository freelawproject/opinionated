ROMAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Stephen P. Walsh (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Walsh\") commenced this action against his former employer, the Scarsdale\n   Union Free School District (\"Scarsdale\" or \"SUFD\") and Michael McDermott (\"McDermott\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") on May 12, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, (\" Compl.\"), ECF No. 1.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants discriminated against him because of his age and that the discrimination against him culminated in his constructive discharge. The action arises under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and New York State Human Rights Law (\"NYSHRL\") \u00a7 290\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages and other relief, permitted under Federal and New York State anti-discrimination laws, arising from Defendants' illegal, discriminatory, and disparate treatment of Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court is the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's age-based discrimination and constructive discharge claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Motion, ECF No. 30.) For the following reasons, Defendants' Motion is DENIED in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff, Stephen P. Walsh, is a retired middle school mathematics teacher who was born in 1951 and who was first employed by Scarsdale Middle School on September 1, 1995. When he was hired, he was forty-four years old. He was awarded tenure in 1998, when he was forty-seven years old. He worked for 19 years at Scarsdale Middle School. Plaintiff intended to retire from his position at the end of the 2015-2016 school year, after his twentieth year of teaching. Instead, Plaintiff resigned from his position as a mathematics teacher by a letter dated January 13, 2015, less than a year before his planned retirement. He was 67-years old at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Michael McDermott was the middle school principal during the time relevant to this lawsuit. He was part of the committee that hired Plaintiff, and he had recommended that Plaintiff be hired and awarded tenure. Further, McDermott was born in 1950 and was sixty-three to sixty-five years old in 2014-2015. McDermott is approximately one year older than Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiff's Employment History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For the first 15 years that he taught at Scarsdale, Plaintiff claims that he was never advised of any concerns or complaints by any student or parent, related to his teaching or classroom conduct. Then, towards the end of the 2010 school year, he claims that he was subject to disproportionate punishments for two minor incidents that occurred in May of 2010 and 2014, respectively. (Plaintiff's Opposition to Summary Judgment, (\"Pl. Opp.\") at 2, ECF No. 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. First Incident (May 11, 2010)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The first incident, which occurred in May 2011, involved another teacher, Alex Campbell, who had previously granted Plaintiff permission to come into her classroom and discuss the issue of students being tardy to her class and blaming it on Mr. Walsh keeping them late. (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 39, ECF No. 42.) On May 11, 2010, Plaintiff went down to Ms. Campbell's class and addressed the students about the issues of their being late and lying. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When Plaintiff finished addressing Ms. Campbell's class, he claims that she suggested\n   that he go next door to the classroom of another teacher, Cara Forray, and do the same thing. So, he did. According to Defendants, on these occasions, Plaintiff spoke to the students in more than just a disciplinary tone-he was \"belligerent and caustic\" and frightened students and the teachers with a \"complete and total tirade.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Plaintiff disagrees. He admits that his tone was disciplinary, but is adamant that it was never \"belligerent,\" \"caustic,\" nor a \"tirade.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties dispute the extent to which Ms. Campbell and Ms. Forray were distressed by the encounter. The two of them did write a memorandum about the incident, and subsequently, on May 17, 2010, Plaintiff and McDermott had a meeting about it. McDermott then made a referral for Plaintiff to the District's Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP.\") This referral required that Plaintiff attend a meeting with the EAP Coordinator, Dr. Irma Van Dam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Plaintiff, when he met with Dr. Van Dam, she advised him that there was nothing \"wrong\" with him, that he did not need counseling, and that he should continue to do what he had done for 15 years. (Pl. Opp. at 3.) But, according to Plaintiff, she also suggested - numerous times - that he should \"consider\" retirement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition, McDermott placed Plaintiff on \"full review\" status. As part of being on \"full review,\" McDermott told Plaintiff that he would be formally and informally observed over the course of the next year, with an administrator observing at least one of his classes daily. This was the first time that Plaintiff was placed on \"full review\" status. McDermott then memorialized the meeting, from his perspective, in a letter/memorandum, dated May 20, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 20, 2010 Letter, Exhibit E, ECF No. 31.) Plaintiff vehemently disputes the truth of the statements in the letter, including McDermott's characterizations of Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Plaintiff, the formal and informal observations proceeded sporadically for about one month and then ended abruptly without Plaintiff receiving any feedback, counseling, or advice regarding deficiencies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But at the end of the school year, in May 2010, Plaintiff received, for the first time in his teaching career, an \"unsatisfactory\" performance review. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Professional Performance Review, Ex. 15, ECF No. 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Second Incident (May 1, 2014)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The second incident occurred on May 1, 2014. That day, Plaintiff was proctoring a New York State Math Assessment. While proctoring the test, about half-an-hour before it was supposed to end, Plaintiff claims that he began to hear loud noises coming from outside his classroom. Plaintiff claims that, after calling the chairperson of the mathematics department and receiving no reply or help, he left his classroom to investigate the noise's source, which he learned was from the classroom next door. There, Plaintiff saw chaos in a room where an exam was supposedly being proctored by Steven Goodman. Plaintiff describes witnessing a scene where \"the source of the noisy disturbance [was] students up out of their seats, talking loudly, playing chess and handling the scantrons for the exams, which ... [was] disturb[ing] his students and violated the testing protocol.\" (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 52.) Plaintiff claims that, in response to witnessing this unexpected conduct, he raised his voice to ask the students to sit down and be quiet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants disagree about exactly how the classroom encounter went. They contend that Plaintiff was disproportionately angry and used a loud voice, yelling in the classroom and hallway, and shouting obscenities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.) Plaintiff states that no one saw him entering or exiting the classroom, and that he does not recall whether he used an obscenity after he left, but knows that no one else was present and close enough to him to have accurate personal knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently met with McDermott about this issue on May 5, 2014. During this meeting, McDermott mentioned the mathematics exam incident and also discussed other performance issues, such as Plaintiff's purported lateness and certain alleged parental complaints. McDermott also raised an incident in which Plaintiff had \"interjected himself into Jeanne-Marie Castiello's class when an outside instructor from Lincoln Center was present.\" Plaintiff does not dispute that McDermott raised this incident, but disputes the characterization of it, noting that Ms. Castiello found nothing disruptive about his going into her class and told this to McDermott. Plaintiff adds that Ms. Castiello refused McDermott's request to document this alleged incident. Plaintiff and Defendants similarly dispute the relevance and egregiousness of several other purported \"incidents\" that McDermott raised during this meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   McDermott characterized Plaintiff's attitude as \"dismissive\" and wrote that Plaintiff attempted to \"explain away, minimize or blame others\" for his behavior. McDermott also stated that Plaintiff's conduct \"represents a pattern of behavior\" that had been previously reported and discussed. Plaintiff disagreed and felt that his behavior was being purposefully manipulated and overblown. Plaintiff raised these concerns with his Union, (Walsh Dep. at 71-73, Ex. 2, ECF No. 35 ), and with Dr. Weber, (Weber Dep. at 125, Ex. 3, ECF No. 35 ), but to no avail. McDermott then, again, referred Plaintiff to Dr. Van Dam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition to meeting with Dr. Van Dam at the EAP, Plaintiff was told he would be required to sign in on a daily basis and either McDermott or Assistant Principal Rochelle Hauge would be required to preview any written communications about students before any meetings. In addition, McDermott changed Plaintiff's house assignment and again placed Plaintiff on \"full review\" for the 2014/2015 school year. Plaintiff was told about the decision to place him on \"full review\" during a meeting on May 5, 2014, attended by: McDermott, the Assistant Principal Rochelle Hauge, Mathematics Department Chair Cindy Parrott, and Scarsdale Teachers Association Union Representative Laurie Ciccone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff was then given a letter/counseling memorandum summarizing the meeting and indicating that he would be put on full review for the following year on May 14, 2014. The letter advised Plaintiff that the full review would consist of one of his supervisors observing one of Plaintiff's classes each day to ensure that his interactions with staff were professional and appropriate. (May 14, 2014, Counseling Memorandum, Ex. G, ECF No. 31.) According to Plaintiff, between September 1, 2014 and January 1, 2015, he had 31 classroom observations, a nearly unprecedented number for any faculty member. The observations were of one forty-five class period each day. According to Plaintiff, this number of informal observations, in conjunction with the length of those observations and the lack of feedback he received, was also unprecedented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties dispute the purpose of the copious classroom observations. According to Defendants, it was to ensure that Plaintiff's interactions with students and staff were professional and appropriate. According to Plaintiff, there was no good reason for the multitude of observations. Rather,\n   Plaintiff believes that the real purpose was to undermine his authority, humiliate him, and force him to leave. Neither party disputes that the supervisors who conducted the classroom observations did not say anything to Plaintiff during or after the observations. Similarly, neither party disputes that Plaintiff continued to receive his full pay and benefits whilst he was being observed. The parties do dispute whether and to what extent Plaintiff suffered repercussions, emotionally and financially, from being observed. They also dispute whether and to what extent Plaintiff was subjected to derogatory comments during this period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff never filed a grievance, pursuant to the procedure set out in his Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\"). The CBA had been executed between the Scarsdale Teacher's Association and SUFD and was effective July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit Y, CBA, ECF No. 31.) It contained a grievance procedure and a procedure for professional performance reviews, pursuant to Article 35, Section F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It also contained a provision on the full review process:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Informal Classroom Visits and Conferences\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   - Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit conference with the teacher or informal classroom visits which may be made apart from formal observations. Any material to be placed in a teacher's file as a result of such conferences or informal visits shall be placed there in accordance with Article 26 of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further, CBA Article 36, entitled \"Professional Standards,\" permits a supervisor to \"review the performance of a teacher at any time.\" The CBA also provides that teachers are to be paid based on a step system related to a teacher's seniority and academic background. It also provides for an early notification of retirement stipend payment. This incentive provides a $ 10,000 stipend payment to any teacher who submits notice to the District Assistant Superintendent for Personnel of their Retirement by January 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of any year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to Plaintiff, the reason that he did not file a grievance was because when he went to the Union President, David Wixted, Wixted told him that they would not support his grievance and that \"he should just put his head down and bear whatever was going to come his way.\" (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 81.) Plaintiff was also allegedly told that they had never filed a grievance related to the Middle School before. Plaintiff notes that, at the time, Wixted's wife was being considered by McDermott for a house counselor job, which she could not get without McDermott's support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Plaintiff's Voluntary Resignation and Retirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff and Defendants dispute whether to characterize Plaintiff's retirement as a decision he made because the interaction with administration had become insufferable or whether Plaintiff was constructively discharged by the creation of overly hostile, unprofessional, and objectively unbearable work conditions. Plaintiff testified that he complained to Dr. Weber about the excessive observations with no feedback and told him that he was looking to curtail the repetition of visits so that it was more manageable and less stressful. Butt Defendants contend that Plaintiff hardly described a hostile and intolerable work atmosphere in his deposition. The parties do agree that, in general, Plaintiff's interactions with other teachers did stop whilst he was on full review. Further, while no teacher stated that they stopped interacting with Plaintiff due to his full review status, Plaintiff felt that teachers were afraid to interact with him due to fear or retaliation. In addition, similar to when he\n   was first placed on full review, Plaintiff claims that Dr. Van Dam, the EAP Consultant, repeatedly told him that, because of his age and stress, he should retire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff claims that the demeanor of his peers, the dismissiveness of the four administrators, the lack of feedback, and the generally hostile environment made it too difficult for him to continue performing his job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Other Teacher Comparators\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that other teachers within the age-protected class were also unnecessarily put on full review by McDermott. In his Complaint, Plaintiff specifically alleged that \"[a] number of 'older' teachers,\" including Irving Sloan and Mike Katz, \"were subjected to 'heightened' scrutiny for the sole purpose of attempting to manage them out of the District.\" (Compl. \u00b6 13 n.1.) There are additional individuals whom Plaintiff argues are also proper comparators, but whom Defendants dispute as \"teachers.\" In sum, the individuals the parties agree are potentially appropriate comparators are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Caran Pullen\n   </strong>\n   : She was placed on full review as well as a Teacher Improvement Plan on or about November 1, 2013. She was born in 1962 and was hired by the district in 2002, when she was forty years old. Pullen alleged that McDermott asked her when she was going to retire and told her that if she agreed to retire in a year or two, he would \"lessen the pressure.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Harvey Flisser\n   </strong>\n   : He was put on full review after incidents with students in which he allegedly demonstrated poor professional judgment. Scarsdale had also received repeated student/parent complaints about his inconsistent teaching practices; for example, having material on tests that had not been covered in class and not connecting with his students and/or saying inappropriate obscenities to students.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Dorothy Golden\n   </strong>\n   : The parties dispute whether Golden was ever formally put on full review, though Plaintiff claims that she told him she under full review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Marjorie Najac\n   </strong>\n   : The parties agree that Najac was at least a House Counselor at Scarsdale but dispute whether she was also a teacher. Najac was placed on full review because of her performance issues as a House Counselor, including attention issues, lateness, failure to appear for meetings without prior notification, and issues or poor communication with teachers on the house team.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Steven Goodman\n   </strong>\n   : Goodman was born in 1970 and was over forty when two incidents happened for which he was not put on full review. Plaintiff describes one in which, during a fire drill, he got in another teacher's face and allegedly yelled at her in front of students and teachers. In another, he allegedly got so belligerent with one professor that he went across the table to him. The parties dispute whether Goodman was ever disciplined for these behaviors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. SUFD Demographics\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   During the 2014/2015 school year, 66% of the District's teaching staff were over the age of forty and 63% of the middle school teachers were over the age of forty. Between 2009/2010 and 2014/2015, at least 62% of the District's teaching staff each year were over the age of forty. Between 2009/2010 and 2014/2015, at least 57% of the Scarsdale Middle School teaching staff\n   each year were over the age of forty. There were no budgetary incentives related to teacher salary that would be impacted by replacing more senior teachers with younger teachers. There was no effect upon McDermott's compensation or his budget management if he could lower the cost of the teaching population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. SUFD's Equal Employment Opportunity Policy and Regulation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The District has a policy entitled Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\"). The EEO provides that the \"Board of Education, its officers, and employees shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of race, color, national origin, creed or religion, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, age, or disability. Furthermore, District Policy 9520 governs all staff complaints and grievances. The Policy provides that staff complaints and grievance procedures are defined in CBAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff filed a Charge of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and New York State Division of Human Rights on March 31, 2015. Plaintiff filed a notice of claim with the District on May 21, 2015. Plaintiff appeared for a 50-h Examination on July 16, 2015 and answered questions under oath. The EEOC issued a \"right-to-sue\" letter on February 17, 2016. Plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit on May 12, 2016. Defendants filed their Motion for Summary Judgment on August 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Before discussing these merits arguments, Defendants also raise several threshold issues, arguing that: 1) Plaintiff's ADEA claims are barred by the statute of limitations, 2) the notice of claim do not include allegations of disparate impact and hostile work environment, and 3) the ADEA claims are not actionable because of lack of provable damages.

(Defendants Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment, (\"Def. Mem.\") at 3, ECF No. 32.) Based on this 300-day limitations period for age discrimination claims, Defendants argue that any claims of incidents that occurred prior to June 4, 2014 cannot serve as the basis for any of plaintiff's ADEA claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, allegations in the Complaint that occurred prior to June 4, 2014 are time-barred, including allegations involving the first period of full review, which was in 2010, and the May 5, 2014 decision to place Plaintiff on full review.

Rather, Plaintiff argues that being placed on full review was the\n   <em>\n    beginning\n   </em>\n   , not the end, of a period of discriminatory treatment. Plaintiff pleads that he was placed on full review twice, during which he was constantly observed and never provided with feedback, during which time other professors were not disciplined for similar infractions to his, and after which Plaintiff received an unnecessary negative performance reviews. He alleges that these acts, combined with the unbearable atmosphere and evidence that younger teachers were treated preferentially, revealed age discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 46). Defendants arguments that the discreet acts of discrimination are either: 1) giving Plaintiff a memorandum relaying that he would be placed on full review, or 2) issuing the unsatisfactory job performance are misguided. The date of Plaintiff's resignation, which he claims was a constructive discharge, is the time stamp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that all claims have been timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

He then had his lawyer send SUFD's legal counsel, in fact, the same counsel representing SUFD in this litigation, a detailed letter explaining his grievances and the basis for his intended lawsuit on February 4, 2015. (Ex. 5, ECF No. 35.) Plaintiff then filed a detailed complaint with the EEOC on May 13, 2015. (Ex. C, ECF No. 31 ). He filed his New York State notice of claim on May 21, 2015. (Ex D, ECF No. 31 ). He then submitted a three-page position statement to supplement his EEOC charge on May 30, 2015, which relayed in detail Plaintiff's grounds for age discrimination and constructive discharge, including the facts that color his hostile work environment and disparate impact theories. Defendants replied to Plaintiff's EEOC charge on July 15, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 30.) Therefore, Defendants had ample notice of Plaintiff's constructive discharge and age discrimination claims, including under the hostile work environment and disparate impact theories.

ADEA Claims Actionable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendants next argue that Plaintiff's ADEA claims are not actionable because the ADEA claims for a hostile work environment and disparate treatment lack provable damages. Specifically, Defendants argue that because the ADEA protects employees over forty against age-based discrimination relating to \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\" ADEA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), the only make-whole remedies are back pay, front pay, and reinstatement.

They add that none of Plaintiff's allegations, supporting his disparate treatment or hostile work environment claims, demonstrate that Plaintiff suffered any pecuniary or economic damages because, at all times that Plaintiff was employed by SUFD, he continued to receive his full pay and benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Lastly, Defendants argue that because of the limited remedies available under ADEA, Plaintiff cannot recover compensatory damages for pain and suffering or emotional distress.

(Pl. Opp. at 28.) He notes that in paragraph 52, he alleges financial damages \"due to a full year of lost salary and a reduction pension benefits for which [he] is entitled to an award of monetary damages and other relief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Compl. \u00b6 52.)

(Pl. Opp. at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiff in part and with Defendants in part. As to Plaintiff's request for compensatory and/or punitive damages in relation to his suffering emotional distress, Defendants are correct that it is well-settled that the ADEA does not allow plaintiffs to recover for emotional distress, pain and suffering, or any other non-economic damage.\n   <em>\n    Meyers v.

Hostile Work Environment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Before analyzing the sufficiency of Plaintiff's claim for age discrimination under a hostile work environment theory, the Court underscores its previous finding that Plaintiff need not actually allege a separate hostile work environment nor disparate impact claim in either document in order to properly plead such claims. Under,\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , \"[c]laims not raised in an EEOC complaint ... may be brought in federal court if they are 'reasonably related' to the claim filed with the agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3385401\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/67/#p70\">\n    458 F.3d at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, there is no question that the hostile work environment and disparate impact claims all relate to Plaintiff's claim for age discrimination. They are cuts of the same wood. But because the Court believes Plaintiff has adequately pleaded these claims as well, it will briefly discuss the allegations supporting them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   To properly plead a hostile work environment claim, a plaintiff must allege that: 1) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment, and 2) that there is a specific basis for imputing the conduct creating the hostile work environment to the employer.\n   <em>\n    Feingold v.

In both the Complaint and EEOC Charge, Plaintiff complains about the unprecedented number of informal reviews that were conducted within his classroom, in response to which he was never counseled, but which ultimately resulted in his receiving unsatisfactory performance reviews. In his Complaint, Plaintiff discusses how this number of reviews completely undermined him, gave him an aggravated ulcer, and \"made it impossible for him to perform at the stellar level at which he had performed for nearly two (2) decades.\" (Compl. \u00b6 42.) Both documents reflect that the full reviews were ordered by McDermott (EEOC Charge at 1,3.) At the pleading stage, such allegations are sufficient to make a hostile work environment claim plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Disparate Impact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Turning to the disparate impact claim, in order plead a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of disparate impact under the ADEA, a plaintiff must show \"(1) the occurrence of certain outwardly neutral practices, and (2) a significantly adverse or disproportionate impact on persons of a particular type produced by the defendant's facially neutral acts or practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Attard v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206511\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/451/21/#p24\">\n    451 F. App'x at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By a thread, Plaintiff makes sufficient allegations for this claim in his Complaint. He states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    A number of \"older\" teachers were subjected to \"heightened\" scrutiny for the sole purpose of attempting to manage them out of the district.\n   </em>\n   This technique was used on Irving Sloan, Mike Katz, Harvey Flisser, and Caren Pullen.\n   <em>\n    By way of example only\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Pullen, a teacher who was on staff at the time of Mr. Walsh's ouster, was told by Mr. McDermott that he would \"back off' from her frequent observations if she would announce her retirement. Ms. Pullen immediately reported this inappropriate behavior to Dr. Weber, the Assistant Superintendent for Personnel. Unfortunately, Dr. Weber did nothing to curb or stop the utilization of this management technique to coerce Mr. Walsh's early, forced resignation. On information and belief, the SUFSD and Mr. McDermott stopped their harassment of Ms. Pullen solely due to the fact\n   that Mr. Walsh filed a charge with the EEOC as a result of their unjustified campaign of harassment against him due to his age.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   (Compl. P 13. n.1.) Hence, Plaintiff makes a plausible allegation that a disproportionate number of teachers in his age category were subject to \"heightened scrutiny\" and put on full review for the similar purpose of being \"managed out\" of the district. Accordingly, Plaintiff's disparate impact claim, too, survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Having addressed all the pleading issues that Defendants raise, the Court, alas, turns to the crux of the dispute-whether Plaintiff has produced sufficient evidence to allow his claims to survive past summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to adduce evidence to sustain his constructive discharge and hostile work environment claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court disagrees. It begins it analysis with the hostile work environment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Hostile Work Environment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to establish a hostile work environment claim because he failed to show that the workplace was \"permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult\" that was \"sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the [P]laintiff's employment\" and that it \"created an abusive working environment\" (Def. Mem. at 9) (citing\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Forklift Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232972\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/17/#p21\">\n    510 U.S. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232972\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/17/#p21\">\n    114 S.Ct. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) They add that the hostility of the work environment is assessed on the totality of circumstances, including: (1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee's work performance.

Further, they note that the analysis is both subjective and objective. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Plaintiff does not dispute the legal standard but posits that the treatment he endured was \"intolerable for many reasons.\" (Pl. Opp. at 19.) For example, Plaintiff mentions that he was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   \u2022 \"Subjected to an unprecedented number of observations, but given no feedback or administrative support\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   \u2022 \"His authority was undermined and his statements led to believe he had done something terribly wrong\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   \u2022 \"His colleagues shunned him for fear of reprisals, and he no longer enjoyed the respect of his fellow teachers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   \u2022 \"The stress of the constant observations affected his teaching\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   \u2022 \"He developed an ulcer and felt terrible stress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   \u2022 \"He had been transferred out of the house where he had been on a team for his entire career and [ ] moved to a different one where no one had his back and he had nowhere to turn.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   \u2022 \"His Union president did not support him\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   \u2022 \"The Assistant Superintendent failed to address his complaint with any action at all.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   All these statements are supported by the evidentiary record. For example, Plaintiff claims that he had around 50-60 informal classroom reviews between the two periods of full review-around 10-12 the first time around and around 30-50 the second time around. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Walsh Aff. Ex. 1, P 35, ECF No. 35.) In addition, evidence reflects that no one provided feedback, let alone negative feedback, to him throughout the review process, nor counseled him on how to improve his performance. In fact, he testified that, during the first review, Dr. Van Dam told him that he was doing fine and did not need to change anything with his teaching. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EEOC Charge at 2.) Even Dr. Weber, the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources testified that she knew about Plaintiff's complaints and discomfort and did not do anything to investigate his concerns beyond speaking with McDermott. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weber Dep. at 125-26)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Plaintiff also testified that he no longer had regular interactions, such as the lunches he had for many years, with his team members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   133:2.) And he mentioned that his general interaction with other teachers stopped. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   133:19-22, 133:12-13) (\"There were many times just informally where people who I would normally had communication with as colleagues, it stopped.... there was much less interaction with people.\") Although Plaintiff had no way of knowing his teachers intentions in distancing themselves from him, he testified that he believed it was because of his being on full review. (Walsh Dep. at 132:23-133:6) (\"It's not uncommon that when other teachers have gone on full review that the faculty is well aware of what is happening and people shared with me informally that they wanted to be supportive of me but they felt they had to keep their distance. There was a sense with people that they didn't want a spotlight on themselves by being overly supportive.\") He also testified that he had minimal interactions with his administrators, and those he had were all \"critical\" in nature. (Walsh Dep. 130:16-20.) And it is undisputed that, along with his full review, Plaintiff was indeed assigned to work in a new wing of the school than the one he had been assigned to for most of his teaching career.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Court has no doubt that Plaintiff's environment underwent a strong change as soon as McDermott placed Plaintiff on full review status. If the goal of such a change of atmosphere was to deter behavioral infractions, perhaps such an environment could achieve that result. But, bafflingly, the attempt to achieve a goal is nowhere to be found in the record. And as such, the constraining environment has a cloud of arbitrariness hovering above it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Further, while courts have often found that petty slights or legitimate disciplinary measures, including isolation, do not amount to a hostile work environment, they have also found that, in the right circumstances, they do. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Flowers v. N. Middlesex YMCA\n   </em>\n   , the Court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment on a retaliation claim, explaining that it could not be that \"employer-orchestrated isolation at work\" would never constitute a materially adverse action or dissuade an employee from complaining about harassing conduct. No. 3:15-CV-705,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201048751\">\n    2016 WL 1048751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (D. Conn. Mar. 11, 2016). It further explained that \"[t]he social environment in a workplace can prove to be a powerful motivator; fear of employer-sponsored isolation 'might well' influence an employee's decision whether to 'mak[e] or support[ ] a charge of discrimination.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201048751\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And it noted that\n   no controlling precedent has ever precluded such a work environment from being severe enough to constitute an adverse employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Because forcing an employee to work in hostile work environment is an adverse employment action,\n   <em>\n    Shapiro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027601\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/561/413/#p424\">\n    561 F.Supp.2d at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the principle above applies. Frequent petty occurrences and social isolation can constitute a hostile work environment. While no single factor that Plaintiff lists may be severe enough to deem his work environment hostile, the Second Circuit has held that \"\n   <em>\n    the effect of a number of adverse conditions in the workplace is cumulative.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Chertkova v.

Rather, in\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   'a work environment may be actionable if the conduct there is\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   so severe\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   so pervasive as to alter the working conditions of a reasonable employee. To the extent the district court suggested that conduct must always be severe\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   pervasive to be actionable under a hostile work environment theory, it was therefore mistaken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11093918\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/251/345/#p359\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 149 ) (emphasis in original) (internal citation omitted). Hence, in\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit found that where Plaintiff was reassigned to a different office and suffered from regular, but non-severe, comments about his age, a jury could conclude that he was subjected to a hostile workplace environment because he was \"not complaining merely about sporadic and isolated events, but rather about his daily working conditions.\" Consequently, it vacated the district court's grant of summary judgment against the plaintiff's ADEA claim. In so doing, the Court also relayed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   While the standard for establishing a hostile work environment is high, we have repeatedly cautioned against setting the bar too high, noting that while a mild, isolated incident does not make a work environment hostile,\n   <em>\n    the test is whether the harassment is of such quantity or quality that a reasonable employee would find the conditions of her employment altered for the worst.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 148 (internal marks omitted) (emphasis added) (citing\n   <em>\n    Whidbee v.

It suffices as being of such quality or quantity that a reasonable employee would find the conditions of her employment altered for the worse. Therefore, after assessing the totality of circumstances, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that it a trier-of-fact could conclude that the aggregated conditions transformed Mr. Walsh's work environment into a hostile work environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Constructive Discharge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Defendants claim that the evidence adduced through discovery falls woefully short of establishing a constructive discharge. They argue that: 1) the existence of a grievance procedure defeats the claim for constructive discharge and 2) the alleged working conditions were not\n   objectively intolerable. (Def. Mem. at 14.) The Court addresses each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Viability of Grievance Procedure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Beginning with the relevance of the union grievance procedure as it relates to Plaintiff's constructive discharge claim. The Court finds that just because some courts have found that the presence of alternatives to resignation - such as complaint procedures -\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   preclude a finding of constructive discharge, does not mean they\n   <em>\n    must.\n   </em>\n   Certainly, courts have found that when there were alternative dispute resolution channels that the plaintiffs did not avail\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   , it did not make sense to find that employees were \"forced\" to resign.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silverman v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11428956\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/216/108/#p115\">\n    216 F.Supp.2d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115-16 (E.D.N.Y. 2002),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"756245\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/64/799/\">\n    64 F. App'x 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2003) (collecting cases). But all those cases were premised on the notion that a plaintiff cannot argue that their resignation was \"compelled\" when they simply neglected to use viable forms of self-help.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simmons-Grant v. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4300433\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/915/498/\">\n    915 F.Supp.2d 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (holding that an employee who \"\n   <em>\n    fails to explore alternative avenues\n   </em>\n   offered by [his] employer\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   concluding that resignation is the only option cannot make out a claim of constructive discharge.\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   It belies logic to hold that the mere existence of\n   <em>\n    unviable\n   </em>\n   forms of dispute resolution preclude the possibility of constructive discharge. Here, the record does not reflect that Plaintiff ignored the grievance procedure, but rather that he attempted to speak with his Union Representative and did not receive any support. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weber Dep. at 103) (\"Steve was complaining that he was being unduly supervised. And that he went to his union and they did not support him. And he was coming to talk to me about the situation.\"); (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 120) (reflecting that Ms. Weber's notes stated: \"Union will not support him\" and \"David [the Union President] dismissed him.\") It also reflects that Scarsdale's then Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources, Dr. Weber, failed to investigate Plaintiff's complaints or assist him in any meaningful way. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weber Dep. at 125-26) (discussing how despite that fact that \"a tenured faculty member is expressing these concerns, that he thinks there's a hostile work environment, [and that with regards to the full review] there's been no feedback\" she did nothing to investigate the claims other than at best having an undocumented conversation with McDermott).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The record does not even reflect that the grievance procedure was truly tenable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Walsh Dep. at 69-73) (reflecting that when Plaintiff discussed the viability of filing a grievance with his union, the union told him that he should \"put [his] head down and bear whatever was going to come [his] way,\" which led him to believe that he \"probably would not get the audience with the school board that is necessary for a grievance.\"). There is even some evidence indicating that the union never used it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pullen Dep. Ex. 7 at 55:12-23, ECF No. 35 ) (\"I met with the union representative several times. She was also brought in to have a meeting with Mike McDermott and I during the full review or before the full review. I don't remember at this point. We were basic-I was basically told that Scarsdale has never had a grievance.\") SUFD has certainly not shown any evidence that it has ever been used in the past in similar contexts. Hence, Plaintiff's constructive discharge claim cannot be dismissed on the questionably useful procedure laid out in his CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Objectively Intolerable Work Conditions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Turning to the objective conditions. First, the Court reiterates that \"constructive\n   discharge of an employee occurs when an employer, rather than directly discharging an individual, intentionally creates an\n   <em>\n    intolerable\n   </em>\n   work atmosphere that\n   <em>\n    forces\n   </em>\n   an employee to quit involuntarily.\"\n   <em>\n    Silverman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11428956\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/216/108/#p115\">\n    216 F.Supp.2d at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Flaherty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11166872\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/235/133/\">\n    235 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   138 ). The Second Circuit has repeatedly explained that \"working conditions are intolerable when, viewed as a whole, they are 'so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's shoes would have felt compelled to resign.' \"\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537717\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/128/#p148\">\n    336 F.3d at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chertkova v.

Moreover, it has explained that \"[b]ecause a reasonable person encounters life's circumstances cumulatively and not individually,\" the various conditions are to be treated in an \"additive\" manner, rather than \"individually.\"\n   <em>\n    Chertkova,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7624093\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/81/#p91\">\n    92 F.3d at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In sum, the court's goal is to ascertain whether, viewed as a whole, the facts in the case at hand could permit a fact-finder o conclude that the employee was forced to resign.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7624093\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/81/#p91\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The court finds that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that a reasonable person in Plaintiff's position would have felt compelled to terminate his employment. First, as discussed previously, Plaintiff made a sufficient showing for a reasonable trier-of-fact to find that Plaintiff was experiencing a hostile work environment, which involved pervasive harassment by his supervisors in the form of repeated, seemingly arbitrary performance reviews and day-to-day isolation. Second, Plaintiff testified that Dr. Van Dam - during both full review periods - had meetings with Plaintiff in which she encouraged him to consider retirement. This was corroborated by Caran Pullen, Plaintiff's peer who was also in his age bracket and underwent a similar full review, and who also testified that she was urged to retire by McDermott himself, who stated that he would lessen the pressure in the environment if she gave him her written notice. Third, Plaintiff's sudden reassignment to a new house after teaching for 19 years in a different house also supports his claim, just as reassignment of office was considered a relevant factor for the plaintiff's claim in\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   . Fourth, Plaintiff's feelings of social isolation, embarrassment, and mockery are relevant to his assessment of the hostile environment, as it was important to the Court assessing the cumulative affect of minor slights in\n   <em>\n    Flowers v. N. Middlesex YMCA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201048751\">\n    2016 WL 1048751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Fifth, a fact-finder could find that Plaintiff's lack of support from his union, coupled with that of his own administration, left him with no avenues to traverse other than to continue suffering the indignities bestowed on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Again, the Second Circuit takes a realistic and wholistic view of the change in the environment to assess whether a reasonable trier-of-fact could deduce that the environment was hostile enough to compel a reasonable person to feel forced to resign.\n   <em>\n    Chertkova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7624093\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/81/#p91\">\n    92 F.3d 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in so doing, courts may focus on whether the hostility in the atmosphere was\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   so severe\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   so pervasive as to alter the working conditions of a reasonable employee.\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537717\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/128/#p148\">\n    336 F.3d at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Here, Plaintiff has met the test. Though the individual factors may not have been egregious or severe, they had an aroma of hostility and their unprecedented frequency and seeming arbitrariness could certainly allow a reasonable fact-finder to deduce that Plaintiff had no alternatives left but to resign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Inference of Discrimination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In addition to an objectively intolerable environment, to state a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of constructive discharge, Plaintiff must establish\n   that the constructive discharge \"occurred in circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination on the basis of [his] membership in [a protected] class.\"\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537717\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/128/#p148\">\n    336 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   152 (citing\n   <em>\n    Chertkova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7624093\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/81/#p91\">\n    92 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   89 ). Proof a such a causal connection can be established directly, though evidence of retaliatory animus directed against a plaintiff, or indirectly, by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory treatment through other evidence such a disparate treatment of fellow employees who engaged in similar conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7624093\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/81/#p91\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Because a constructive discharge claim is a flavor of the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   age discrimination claim, the additional requirement for constructive discharge is the same that Plaintiff would need if he were pleading a run of the mill\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case-that the employer had discriminatory intent. This element is Plaintiff's remaining element for Plaintiff to demonstrate both his\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   discrimination and constructive discharge claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The Court finds that plaintiff has adduced enough evidence to allow a fact finder to conclude that the constructive discharge occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination on the basis of his age. The same evidence would also allow a fact-finder to conclude that Defendants proffered legitimate reasons for terminating Plaintiff were pretext for an age-related animus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   First, there is a dispute of fact regarding McDermott's characterization of the math testing incident that resulted in Plaintiff's negative performance review. McDermott wrote a report summarizing what he believed happened in this incident based on sources that Plaintiff claims did not have firsthand knowledge. Indeed, everything McDermott memorialized about the incident and Plaintiff's alleged tone is based on hearsay - specifically statements he was told by Ms. Campbell and Ms. Foray. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McDermott Dep. 54:5-14.) At least three individuals who could be deemed eyewitnesses, including Plaintiff, still have conflicting accounts about the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Walsh Dep. 93-95, Ex. 3, ECF No. 35\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pincus Dep., Ex. M at 17-38, ECF No. 31 and Overbay Dep. at 17-34, Ex. N, ECF No. 31.) Some of these reflect that Plaintiff was very angry, and others that he was not even in earshot of students. Mr. Goodman, the proctor of the exam and Mr. Pincus, who passed Plaintiff in the hallway when he allegedly used the profanity, refused to give McDermott written accounts of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Second, Plaintiff evinces that he was repeatedly pressured to retire during his full review processes, something that he showed his colleague was experiencing as well. For example, during his first review, he stated that when he met Dr. Van Dam, she told him that he was doing fine and did not need to change anything with his teaching, but that he should consider retiring. A similar occurrence occurred during his second review. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Walsh Dep., Ex. 3, 134:7-19) (\"In my sessions with Dr. Van Dam, because I had a follow-up session with her into the new year. And in that meeting she visited the idea that the stress and your age, et. cetera, that I should strongly consider retiring. And that it might be in the best interest of myself and my family. She counseled me that I should keep an open mind to that possibility ... I was a little surprised because she revisited that topic during that session two or three times, emphasizing that it was something I should keep out in front of me.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Third, there is evidence that other older teachers were subjected to a similar review process in order to urge them to retire, which they then did. For example, Pullen testified that she, too, felt that she\n   was unnecessarily put on full review status and subjected to heightened supervision and incessant criticism that was unjustified. (Pullen Dep. 146:15-2.) She also described feeling socially isolated whilst she was on full review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64.) She similarly described how the teacher's union and Joan Weber, the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, were useless in helping her find a solution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.) She also described how McDermott urged her to retire during the full review process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117) (\"I've been talking about this with Joan. If you put it in writing and agree to retire in a year or two, I will lessen the pressure.\") And she, too, described how everyone who went through full review then retired. (\"Q: So with the people who you observed, obviously with the exception of Mr. Flisser, who were teaching and you observed go through the same thing that you went through, they all retired, correct? A: Absolutely.\") (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   146:3-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Fourth, there is evidence that other younger teachers who exhibited similar belligerence were not similarly disciplined. For example, multiple parties testified about another professor, Mr. Goodman, who was much younger than Plaintiff, and who on two separate occasions, in front of other faculty members lost his temper and yelled at another faculty member. Ms. Ciccone testified that she witnessed Mr. Goodman yelled at a professor named Mr. Fisher at least once during a faculty meeting. (Ciccone Dep, Ex. 6, 15:8-11, ECF No. 35 ) (\"Mr. Goodman got increasingly agitated to the point that he sat on the edge of his seat and raised his voice, pointed his finger directly in Mr. Fisher's face.\") And another was when he got angry at Ms. Ciccone in front of numerous faculty and students during a fire drill and humiliated her and berated her. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7624093\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/81/#p91\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   17:9-25-181-24) (describing how Goodman lost his temper, continuously yelled at Ms. Ciccone, telling her things like \"You don't need to talk to them\" \"I've got it under control\" \"I'm going to tell you this. Nobody yells at me except my father and you're not my father.\") McDermott even testified that he learnt about these incidents, yet never met with Goodman, nor disciplined him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McDermott Dep. at 129.) In sum, Plaintiff has adduced ample evidence to allow a fact-finder to draw an inference of age-related discriminatory intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   As to pretext, Plaintiff has shown that there is an unresolved question about the purpose of the copious reviews. McDermott himself testified that the purpose of the reviews was \"to improve whatever deficits, issues et. cetera have resulted in a need for full review,\" and he added that it was not \"punitive,\" but employed to make improvements on the issues that necessitated full review. (McDermott Dep. 38:8-25.) And yet there's a problem. When rubber met the road, both in Plaintiff's case and for other older teachers, SUFD provided absolutely no feedback, nor any methods for improvement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pullen Dep. 142:4-7) (\"Q: Earlier when you had your thirty-two reviews, did you get regular feedback and oversight with respect to those reviews? A: No.\") This diminishes the reliability of McDermott's \"legitimate\" action and bolsters Plaintiff's argument that the entire review process was a pretext to build a sham disciplinary record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Accordingly, Defendants Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's constructive discharge/\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   discrimination claim is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   For the reasons discussed, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED in its entirety. The Clerk of the Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 30. The parties are instructed to appear before me on April\n   11, 2019 at 11:00 am for a pre-trial conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    The facts are drawn from the Defendants' Rule 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Def. 56.1\") (ECF No. 33 ) and Plaintiff's Rule 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Pl. 56.1.\") (ECF No. 42 ) and the exhibits attached to each. They are undisputed except where indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    Plaintiff's retirement letter reads:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n    Further, be advised that I submit this letter without prejudice to my claims for age discrimination. I am awaiting a response by the School District to my settlement demand, but did not want to be time barred from receiving this retirement incentive. I had planned to teach another year, but my circumstance has become intolerable as the School District intensified its efforts to \"manage me out\" by making my work place hostile, unprofessional and objectively unbearable.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    Defendants throw in the kitchen sink with their arguments in this motion, providing the Court with no explanation for why all the issues related to justiciability and pleading sufficiency were not raised at earlier junctures. The Court will allow it this once. It is not appropriate for Defendants to hoard all their claims and arguments for the very end of litigation in a waste of judicial and client resources. Similar conduct, if employed during trial, will not be permitted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    Because Defendants comingled a motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment into one motion, their briefs only address whether Plaintiff sustained a claim for age discrimination based on disparate impact in its pleadings. This Court already ruled that Plaintiff has met the minimum burden to sustain his claim. Defendants have not moved for summary judgment on the disparate impact claim or provided any reasons why it is unsustainable. As such, Plaintiff's claim for disparate impact survives this juncture.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
