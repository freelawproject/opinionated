Leinenweber, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case concerns the Client Solutions Manager (\"CSM\") position at Facebook, Inc., and whether that role constitutes an \"overtime-exempt\" position under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") and Illinois Minimum Wage Law (\"IMWL\"). For the reasons stated herein, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 48) is denied. Plaintiff's Motion for Conditional Certification of an FLSA collective action (Dkt. No. 45) is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Facebook, Inc. (\"Facebook\") is a social media company. It generates revenue primarily from selling advertisements that are displayed on its various electronic platforms. (Def.'s Statement of Facts (\"SOF\") \u00b6 5, Dkt. No. 57.) Facebook offers its clients an array of customization and monitoring options so that each client can precisely target particular demographics in its advertisements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Facebook employs an array of advertising, marketing, and engineering professionals to shepherd clients through the process of implementing a Facebook advertising campaign. (SOF \u00b6 6.) Facebook's sales structure is organized around industries (known at Facebook as \"verticals\") and sales teams (known as \"pods\"). (SOF \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Facebook utilizes a compensation system in which employees are hired at certain designations that indicate their role and compensation level. For example, a manager in human resources might be designated \"M-2\": \"M\" for manager and \"2\" for second level. (Hickman Dep. 40:8-17, Ex. A to Pl.'s Statement of Additional Facts (\"SOAF\"), Dkt. No. 58-1.) This case concerns the \"Individual Contributor\" (\"IC\") (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , non-managerial) designation. (SOF \u00b6 10.) An IC-1 is an Individual Contributor level 1, an IC-2 is an Individual Contributor level 2, and so on. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case concerns a particular position at Facebook - the Client Solutions Manager (\"CSM\") - whose origin lies in two prior roles that Facebook has since eliminated. Prior to 2014, a sales \"pod\" included, among other positions, an Account Manager and a Media Solutions Manager (\"MeSo\"). (SOF \u00b6 7.) Account Managers had a \"sales role\" in which they were responsible for \"upselling\" Facebook products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Hickman Dep. 43:3-22.) \"Upselling\" is a sales technique in which a seller encourages the customer to purchase additional items or upgrades to make a more profitable sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Parties disagree over how exactly to characterize the MeSo role, and the extent to which MeSos were overtime exempt. Facebook contends that MeSos had a sales role as well as \"more analytical\" duties that included planning, implementing, and optimizing the performance of advertising campaigns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:20-43:22.) In contrast, Plaintiff claims that MeSos performed operational duties, including data entry, troubleshooting bugs in ads, and following up with clients on unpaid invoices. (Bigger Dep. 141:16-149:21.) Plaintiff claims that Facebook classified all MeSos as overtime exempt (Bigger Dep. 131:16-132:3); Facebook contends that only MeSos at certain IC levels were exempt. (Hickman Dep. 36:21-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Facebook hired Plaintiff Susie Bigger (\"Bigger\") in April 2013 to work in its Chicago office as an Account Manager in the Financial Services \"vertical\" (industry team). (SOF \u00b6 14; Bigger Dep. 74:1-5.) Bigger received an IC-4 designation, which rendered her exempt from overtime compensation. (SOF \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In late 2013, the Account Manager and MeSo positions were merged into a new role called Client Solutions Manager (\"CSM\"). (SOF \u00b6 8.) Bigger was one of many who assumed that position. (SOF \u00b6 16.) Some CSMs were classified as exempt and some as nonexempt. (SOF \u00b6 10.) CSMs at IC-1 and IC-2 are non-exempt, overtime eligible positions, and CSMs at IC-3 and above are overtime exempt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Facebook employees at higher IC levels are expected to act with increasingly higher levels of independence, discretion, and autonomy. (SOF \u00b6 10.) However, the \"core job responsibilities\" of a CSM are \"the same\" across all IC levels. (Hickman Dep. 61:22-25.) Regardless of office location, all CSMs are employed full-time and have the same compensation structure, which is approximately 75% base salary plus 25% commission based on sales quotas. (Hickman Dep. 51:20-25, 87:19-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bigger retained her IC-4 designation when she became a CSM. (SOF \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff claims she worked an average of 60 hours per week as a CSM. (Bigger Dep. 336:5-7.) Due to her IC-4 designation, Facebook classified her as exempt and did not pay her overtime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff filed suit against Facebook on October 27, 2017, on behalf of herself and other similarly situated CSMs. Plaintiff claims that Facebook wrongly classified her, and all other IC-3 and IC-4 CSMs, as overtime exempt. She brings two counts: (1) a putative\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) collective action for violating the FLSA's overtime provisions, and (2) a putative Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 class action for violating the IMWL's overtime provisions. Plaintiff defines her putative FLSA collective as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   All individuals who were employed by Facebook as Client Solutions Managers at level IC-3 or IC-4 at any location in the United States during the period from three years prior to the entry of the conditional certification order, and as extended by stipulation of the parties, to the present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Bigger now moves for conditional certification of her proposed FLSA collective. Facebook moves for summary judgment, contending that it cannot be held liable under the FLSA and IMWL as a matter of law. The Court will begin with its analysis of Facebook's summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Incomplete Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff contends that Facebook's summary judgment\n   motion is premature. The parties originally planned to conduct discovery in two phases, with one phase to precede and another to follow Plaintiff's Motion for Conditional Certification, as is customary in FLSA collective actions. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 9, Dkt. No. 56; Decl. of Teresa Becvar, Ex. A to Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. No. 56-1.) To that end, Plaintiff deposed two current Facebook employees-Nicolle Hickman and Ginger Melrose-in October 2018. Facebook deposed Bigger immediately thereafter. As far as the Court can tell, those three are the only depositions that have taken place to date. More importantly, they are the only depositions that are presently on the record before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff filed her Motion for Conditional Certification on November 8, 2018. On November 15, 2018, Facebook filed its Motion for Summary Judgment, apparently to Plaintiff's great consternation, as Facebook had not informed her that it was planning to file such a motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Becvar Decl.) Of course, Facebook was under no obligation to keep Plaintiff abreast of its case strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Facebook's summary judgment motion is premature because discovery is not complete in this case. But procedurally, the motion is timely. The federal rules do not require that discovery always be complete (or even underway) before summary judgment can be granted.\n   <em>\n    Larsen v. Elk Grove Vill., Ill.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3915804\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/433/470/#p472\">\n    433 F. App'x 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 472 (7th Cir. 2011). FED. R. CIV. P. 56(b) allows a party to file a motion for summary judgment \"at any time\" until 30 days after the close of discovery, unless the court orders otherwise. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(b). Because discovery has not closed, and the Court has not issued any restrictions on when parties may file for summary judgment, Facebook's Motion is properly before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In Plaintiff's response to Facebook's Motion for Summary Judgment, she invokes Rule 56(d), arguing that the Court must deny or continue Facebook's summary judgment motion in order for Plaintiff to conduct further discovery before responding. Under Rule 56(d), if a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, she cannot present facts essential to justify her opposition, a court may: (1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(d). Plaintiff attached a declaration by her counsel to her summary judgment response. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Becvar Decl.) The declaration sets forth the various documents that Facebook has yet to produce, which Plaintiff's counsel believes will raise a genuine issue of material fact as to Facebook's exemption defenses. (Becvar Decl. \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff's counsel also names individuals that Plaintiff has yet to depose who she believes could also raise a genuine issue of material fact. (Becvar Decl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Facebook argues that Plaintiff's Rule 56(d) argument is unavailing because she has, to this day, not made any motion under that rule. The Seventh Circuit has made clear that Rule 56(d) requires a motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deere &amp; Co. v. Ohio Gear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3463399\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/701/#p706\">\n    462 F.3d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706 (7th Cir. 2006) (\"When a party thinks it needs additional discovery in order to oppose a motion for summary judgment ... Rule 56(f) [now Rule 56(d) ] provides a simple procedure for requesting relief: move for a continuance and submit an affidavit explaining why the additional discovery is necessary.\");\n   <em>\n    Farmer v. Brennan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7654325\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/1444/#p1449\">\n    81 F.3d 1444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1449 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"When a party is unable to gather the materials required by Rule 56(e), the proper course is to move for a continuance under Rule 56(f) [now Rule 56(d) ].\"). A\n   Rule 56(d) motion \"must state the reasons why the party cannot adequately respond to the summary judgment motion without further discovery and must support those reasons by affidavit.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio Gear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3463399\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/701/#p706\">\n    462 F.3d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The preceding opinions refer to an earlier version of Rule 56, in which the current 56(d) provision was located in 56(f). Because no substantive change to this provision occurred when the rest of Rule 56 was rewritten, cases applying Rule 56(f) remain controlling authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10B Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Civ. \u00a7 2741 (4th ed.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff has not made any motion under Rule 56(d), which constitutes procedural error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spierer v. Rossman\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:13-CV-00991,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204908023\">\n    2014 WL 4908023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (S.D. Ind. Sept. 30, 2014) (finding that plaintiffs committed procedural error by filing a Rule 56(d) affidavit contemporaneously with their response to summary judgment, rather than requesting 56(d) relief\n   <em>\n    instead\n   </em>\n   of responding to the summary judgment motion),\n   <em>\n    aff'd,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333526\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/502/\">\n    798 F.3d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2015). Thus, Plaintiff's Rule 56(d) arguments and declaration are not properly before the Court and will be disregarded.

Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where there is \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). A dispute is \"genuine\" if the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to find for the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

If the moving party satisfies its burden, the non-movant must present facts to show a genuine dispute exists to avoid summary judgment, which requires that she \"do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Sarver v.

Facebook's business model is similar to the free magazine at issue in\n   <em>\n    Reiseck\n   </em>\n   . Facebook provides its social media platforms to users on a complimentary basis, and advertising sales constitute the majority of its revenue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reiseck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507795\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/101/\">\n    591 F.3d at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Facebook admits that its business is the sale of advertising. (SOAF \u00b6 1.) Nicolle Hickman (\"Hickman\"), Facebook's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) designated deponent, is an \"HR programs lead\" for Facebook's sales and marketing division. (Hickman Dep. 14:7-21.) Hickman testified that Facebook is an \"advertising business\" and \"the product [it] sell[s] is advertising.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:1-9.) Hickman further testified that, prior to the reorganization of its sales team structure in 2013, Facebook used to have two separate sales divisions: \"direct sales\" and \"mid market sales.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:19-25; 45:9-23.) Bigger worked in a client-facing sales division. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:23-18:13.) Hickman testified that CSMs have \"sales quotas,\" and cannot determine the pricing for Facebook products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:12-20; 55:7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Facebook's summary judgment briefing is replete with corporate jargon that attempts to obscure the issue of whether Bigger made sales. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 4, Dkt. No. 49 (stating that the purpose of Bigger's job was \"promoting\n   the sale of Facebook's panoply of digital marketing product offerings to advertisers\").) But ultimately, Facebook admits that Bigger's responsibilities included making sales. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOAF \u00a7 3; Hickman Dep. at 88:11-20.) Hickman testified further that CSMs are \"responsible for sales with existing clients ... [CSMs and Client Partners are] actually both sales which is why they're on commission plans.\" (Hickman Dep. 88:6-10.) Ultimately, the\n   <em>\n    Schaefer\n   </em>\n   opinion was specific to \"the particular jobs at issue here in this particular industry,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3876439\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/560/#p571\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 575 n.23, and the undisputed facts are insufficient to show that Bigger's work at Facebook is similar enough to that of the pharmaceutical sales reps in\n   <em>\n    Schaefer\n   </em>\n   . Thus, a triable issue of fact remains regarding Defendant's \"promoting sales\" theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Administrative Duties: Marketing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Facebook also argues that Bigger regularly performed marketing and consulting work, which generally constitute exempt administrative duties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.201\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Bigger disputes this characterization. (SOAF \u00b6 2.) Bigger claims that, rather than performing marketing and consulting tasks, she performed more rote \"operational tasks\" like data entry (SOAF \u00b6 7); billing clients (SOAF \u00b6 6); coordinating client meetings, parties, and meals (SOAF \u00b6 15); and ordering and delivering \"swag\" (Facebook branded merchandise) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, the Court finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Bigger did marketing work. Neither the FLSA regulations nor the parties define \"marketing.\" Facebook only identifies one specific marketing duty that Bigger had: she \"develop[ed] marketing plans\" for Facebook's clients by engaging \"cross functional partners\" within Facebook and doing some of her own \"internal digging and sleuthing to find material.\" (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 5 (citing SOF \u00b6\u00b6 38-39) ). Bigger counters that she did not \"develop marketing plans,\" but merely pulled advertising templates from Facebook's internal repositories to show to clients. (SOF \u00b6 39.) Additionally, Hickman testified that the sales group Bigger worked in was distinct from Facebook's separate Business Marketing Group. (Hickman Dep. 18:14-19:15.) And in its Motion for Summary Judgment, Facebook characterized one of Bigger's duties as \"liais[ing]\" between clients and Facebook's \"marketing sciences team.\" (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 9.) Thus, Facebook's own submissions suggest that Facebook's marketing work took place in a different department, of which Bigger was not a part. As such, a factual dispute exists about whether Bigger did marketing work. Facebook's argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Administrative Duties: Consulting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Facebook next argues that Bigger had a \"multi-faceted advisory/consultative role\" at Facebook. (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 13.) FLSA regulations provide that acting as an adviser or consultant to an employer's clients may constitute administrative duties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.201\">\n    9 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Facebook adopts Miriam-Webster's definition of consultant-providing professional or expert advice - and asserts that Bigger was a consultant because \"she gave clients advice and recommendations about their advertising spend on Facebook.\" (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 13.) Facebook also cites to\n   <em>\n    Verkuilen v. MediaBank, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3414474\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/979/\">\n    646 F.3d 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2011), which concerned an account manager at a software company. In that case, the plaintiff did not make individual sales; she was responsible for working with the company's software engineers to determine how software could be adapted to customer's specific needs.\n   <em>\n    Verkuilen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3414474\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/979/\">\n    646 F.3d at 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found the plaintiff was a \"specialist\" and had a \"consulting role,\" and was exempt from\n   overtime under the administrative exception.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3414474\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/979/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3414474\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/979/\">\n    at 982-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Verkuilen\n   </em>\n   is instructive in considering whether an FLSA plaintiff does \"consultant\" work, but as explained below, the relevant facts for this determination are in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Facebook's \"consultant\" argument is largely duplicative of its \"promoting sales\" claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 13 (stating that Bigger's primary duty was to \"promote the sale of Facebook's suite of advertising products through consultation with its clients.\").) The facts that Facebook points to in support of its consultant argument all describe the same essential pattern: to the extent Bigger was \"advising\" or \"consulting\" clients, such activities were in furtherance of her role selling, or upselling, Facebook \"products\" (ads). (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28, 31, 43, 50-52, 61.) The facts do not suggest that Bigger was consulting on advertising campaigns-Facebook's clients had their own advertising agencies. (SOF \u00a7 41.) And the \"expertise\" Facebook claims Bigger had was knowing the scope of Facebook's advertising offerings and matching those products to the clients' needs. (SOF \u00b6 27.). This argument is unavailing. If being familiar with the employer's clients' needs and the employer's product list makes one a consultant, every employee who made sales would be a consultant. As the Court has already explained, whether Bigger was making sales or merely promoting them is in dispute. Because Facebook argues that Bigger's \"consulting\" work was intertwined with promoting sales, its claim is premised on disputed material facts, and fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Administrative Duties: Exercising Discretion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Facebook next contends that Bigger regularly performed work in the second category of administrative duties: \"exercis[ing] discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.200\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, this prong does not require that the employee's decisions \"have a finality that goes with unlimited authority and a complete absence of review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725868\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/753/#p756\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blanchar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725868\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/753/#p756\">\n    736 F.3d at 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Facebook argues that Bigger performed many tasks that satisfy this standard, which can be distilled to: (1) making recommendations to clients about how best to allocate their advertising dollars, (2) deciding what information to relay between clients and other internal Facebook employees, and (3) creating finished products that were presented to clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Bigger disputes Facebook's characterization of her work and argues that to the extent she made recommendations to clients, she merely presented materials that she pulled from Facebook's repositories of examples of advertising products. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bigger Dep. 123:9-20 (\"I was not coming up with the solutions. I was not creating the solutions. It was all things that had been provided to us by vertical managers, product managers, industry experts, engineers, measurement teams.\"); 126:11-19 (\"many of the tasks ... were already written down, and we had manuals and we had scripts and we had templates to follow\").) Further, Bigger emphasizes that she did not have authority to make independent choices, as all strategic decisions were made \"at the team level,\" and Bigger's supervisor required her to get his approval at all phases of a task. (SOAF \u00a7\u00a7 25, 26.) Facebook admits that Bigger did not have the ability to change or create advertising products or solve complex business issues. (SOAF \u00a7 19.) However, at one point in her deposition, Bigger stated that she produced\n   client-ready reports \"to some degree.\" (Bigger Dep. 321:8-10.) Thus, it appears that Bigger's work involved some amount of discretion; however, it is unclear whether she exercised that discretion \"customarily and regularly\" (defined by FLSA regulations as work normally and recurrently performed every workweek, not isolated or one-time tasks,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.701\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) and about matters of significance.

Accordingly, the Court proceeds to Plaintiff's Proposed Notice to the FLSA putative collective members. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Notice, Ex. A to Pl.'s Mot. for Cond. Cert., Dkt. No. 45-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Form of Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Facebook argues that several of Plaintiff's requests regarding notice to the proposed collective are inappropriate. First, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's Proposed Notice should inform potential opt-in plaintiffs if there are circumstances in which they may have to bear costs or pay fees to Plaintiff's counsel. However, Plaintiff's counsel has assured the Court that there are \"no circumstances\" in which opt-in plaintiffs would need to bear costs or pay fees to Plaintiff's counsel. (Pl.'s Reply to Mot. for Cond. Cert., Dkt. No. 55.) The Court denies this requested revision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Second, Defendant claims that sending the Proposed Notice via email, per Bigger's request, would be intrusive and unwarranted. However, this Court agrees with the many other courts that have concluded that because communication by email is \"the norm,\" notice by email is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grosscup v. KPW Mgmt., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267444\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/867/#p880\">\n    261 F.Supp.3d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 880 (N.D.

Ohio Feb. 26, 2015) (noting that notice via both U.S. mail and e-mail to all potential opt-in plaintiffs in an FLSA action \"appears to be in line with the current nationwide trend\"). Particularly in this case, where the opt-in plaintiffs all work or have worked for a digital media company, using email enhances the chance that they receive notice. Plaintiff is authorized to send the Proposed Notice via email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Third, Plaintiff requests to send a reminder notice 20 days before the end of the opt-in period to any opt-in plaintiffs who have not returned their opt-in consent forms. Defendant believes this request should be denied, arguing that a reminder notice is both unnecessary and unfair to Facebook, as it may be interpreted as the Court encouraging putative collective members to join this action. The Court agrees. A reminder is unnecessary given the adequacy of both U.S. mail and email notice and may be misinterpreted as judicial encouragement to join the lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Witteman v. Wisconsin Bell, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-CV-440,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20446033\">\n    2010 WL 446033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (W.D. Wis. Feb. 2, 2010) (\"The purpose of notice is simply to inform potential class members of their rights. Once they receive that information, it is their responsibility to act as they see fit.\"). The Court denies Plaintiff's request for a reminder notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Fourth, Defendant asks the Court to deny Plaintiff's request to post the Proposed Notice in all Facebook offices where members of the FLSA Collective are likely to view it. Defendant argues that mailed notice is adequate and posting notice in its place of business is too intrusive. Workplace postings can be overly intrusive, especially when a workplace posting is meant to supplement a mailed notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howard v. Securitas Sec.
