PARKER, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is one of many cases emerging from what is now infamously known as the Flint Water Crisis. The crisis arose when the City of Flint, Michigan (\"City\" or \"Flint\"), changed the source of its water supply from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (\"DWSD\") to the Flint River. The raw water drawn from the Flint River, processed through Flint's outdated and previously mothballed water treatment plant, was highly corrosive and not properly treated by the City's public works department. As a result, water with excessive lead and copper levels flowed through the City and into residents' homes, causing them physical injury and damage to water mains and service lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Sixth Circuit recently described \"[t]he harmful effects\" from the switch in water sources as \"swift\" and \"severe.\"\n   <em>\n    Guertin v.

The United States (hereafter also \"Government\") has filed motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' lawsuits for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The United States contends that it has not waived its immunity from Plaintiffs' claims because Michigan law would not impose liability on private individuals in similar circumstances-the extent to which the FTCA only waives Government immunity-and because the alleged misconduct by the EPA is excepted from liability under the FTCA's discretionary function exception. The motions have been fully briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The impact on the health of the nearly 100,000 residents of the City of Flint remains untold. It is anticipated, however, that the injury caused by the lead-contaminated public water supply system will affect the residents for years and likely generations to come. While this Court will not decide today the issue of ultimate liability, it can today state with certainty that the acts leading to the creation of the Flint Water Crisis, alleged to be rooted in lies, recklessness and profound disrespect have and will continue to produce a heinous impact for the people of Flint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The issue presented to the Court by the Government's pending motions to dismiss is not whether EPA officials and employees were negligent or even abused their discretion in responding to the Flint Water Crisis. Instead, the issue is whether the Government is subject to tort liability under the FTCA for that conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Flint owns and operates a public water system that provides drinking water to its nearly 100,000 citizens. Before April 2014, Flint purchased finished drinking water from the DWSD. DWSD drew its water from Lake Huron and treated the water to control potential contaminants, including copper and lead levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In approximately late April 2014, Flint switched its water source from DWSD to the Flint River. The use of the Flint River as a water source was intended to be temporary, as Flint planned to connect to the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline in 2016, which also draws its water from Lake Huron. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Ex. 43 at 1, ECF No. 40-3 at Pg ID 1349.) MDEQ and Flint did not, and were not required to, notify the EPA of the changing water sources for Flint. (Def.'s Mot. Ex. C at 37, ECF No. 37-3 at Pg ID 862.) The EPA does not approve such a switch in a primacy State. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35, Pg ID 862; Ex. 15 at 2.) MDEQ approved Flint's water source change, but did not require Flint to begin corrosion control prior to the switch. (Ex. 2 at 1, ECF No. 38-1 ; Ex. 3 at 2, ECF No. 38-2 at Pg ID 1142.) MDEQ interpreted the Lead and Copper Rule (\"LCR\") as allowing Flint to complete two consecutive six-month rounds of sampling prior to determining what, if any corrosion control\n   treatment was needed for the Flint River water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 20, ECF No. 39-3 at Pg ID 1206-07; Ex. 22 at 1-3, ECF No. 39-5 at Pg ID 1209-1211.) Its wrongful and damaging interpretation was later admitted by MDEQ Director Dan Wyant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Flint River provided inconsistent water quality because of elevated levels of organic matter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 35 at 1, ECF No. 39-18 at Pg ID 1313.) By August 2014, elevated levels of fecal coliform and E. coli bacteria were detected in the water and the MDEQ issued a \"boil water advisory\" instructing Flint residents to not drink the water. (Def.'s Mot. Ex. E at 66, ECF No. 37-5 at Pg ID 975; Pls.' Resp. Ex. 70 at 7, ECF No. 53-27 at Pg ID 2114.) A second E. coli exceedance occurred on September 5, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The City's use of chlorine to address bacteria exceedances led to another problem-high levels of total trihalomethane (\"TTHM\"), which poses health risks to consumers. (Pls.' Resp. Ex. 3, ECF No. 53-4 at Pg ID 1931; Ex. 70 at 7, ECF No. 53-27 at Pg ID 2114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Flint's residents immediately noticed the change in the quality of the water when the City switched its water source to the Flint River. Jennifer Crooks, Region 5's Michigan Program Manager for the Drinking Water Program, who was responsible for reviewing and responding to complaints from Michigan citizens on the agency's behalf, testified in this matter that she had never received as many citizen complaints since she began working for the EPA in 1987 than she did after the Flint water switch. (Def.'s Mot. Ex. E at 29, 30-32, ECF No. 37-5 at Pg ID 965-66.) When Region 5 received citizen complaints from Michigan residents, employees would discuss the issues with technical contacts, check for violations in the various databases, and contact the State person responsible for the water system and discuss the complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. E at 24, 49, ECF No. 37-5 at Pg ID 964, 970; Ex. F at 33-34, ECF No. 37-6 at Pg ID 1018-19.) After Region 5's employees conducted background research and communicated with the State, they responded to citizens through emails, phone calls, and written letters.

The EPA informed Flint's residents that \"[t]he most recent laboratory analyses obtained from MDEQ of the City of Flint's drinking water indicate that almost all regulated contaminants meet State and Federal health standards, as required under the Federal and Michigan Safe Drinking Water Acts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) TTHMs pose a health risk for some sub-populations, such as the immune-compromised and pregnant women.

In a February 26, 2015 email to MDEQ officials, Ms. Crooks stated that (1) Flint must have Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment (\"OCCT\"), (2) the test results for the Walters' home must \"be included in with compliance calculation of the 90th percentile\", and (3) the City cannot flush the system in advance of taking compliance samples. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4, Pg ID 1921-22.) Mr. Del Toral, who had been copied on Ms. Crooks' email, sent a follow-up email to MDEQ on February 27, 2015, explaining his concerns about the lead situation and Flint's testing protocols. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, Pg ID 1920-21.) Mr. Del Toral conveyed that pre-flushing the tap before collecting testing samples \"biases the results low by eliminating the highest lead values\" and \"provides false assurance to residents about the true lead levels in the water.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Del Toral suggested that MDEQ contact Region 5's \"resident expert\", Mike Schock, for help with compliance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Crooks forwarded Mr. Schock's contact information to MDEQ the same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On February 27, 2015, Stephen Busch from the MDEQ responded to Ms. Crooks' and Mr. Del Toral's emails, thanking them for their information and indicating: \"[W]e will take it under consideration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, Pg ID 1919.) Mr. Busch represented in the same email, among other things, that Flint \"[h]as an Optimized Corrosion Control Program\", \"[c]onducts quarterly Water Quality Parameter monitoring at 25 sites and has not had any unusual results[,]\" and \"[h]as never had a 90th percentile lead AL exceedance[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Region 5 visited the Walters' home on April 27 and May 6, 2015, to inspect the plumbing and conduct additional testing. (Def.'s Mot. Ex. 3 at 3, ECF No. 38-2 at Pg ID 1143.) Finding that the interior plumbing was primarily plastic, the EPA concluded that it was not the source of the high lead levels found in the water at the residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Shockingly, as Mr. Del Toral noted in an email to colleagues within Region 5, local officials were telling Flint residents that the source of the high lead was the home's internal plumbing. (Pls.' Resp. Ex. 2 at 5, ECF No. 53-3 at Pg ID 1929.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   During EPA's May 6 trip to the Walters' home, the service line to the residence was replaced and the EPA sent three portions of the extracted line for testing, which confirmed that a portion of the line was made of galvanized iron pipe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The EPA's inspection of the remaining portion confirmed that the service line from the water main to the external shut-off valve was lead. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Region 5 collected water samples from other Flint residents' homes, which also showed noncompliant lead levels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, Pg ID 1144.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Meanwhile, on April 23, 2015, Mr. Del Toral sent an email to MDEQ asking: \"What's Flint doing now (post Detroit) for corrosion control treatment?\" (Pls.' Resp. Ex. 2 at 4, ECF No. 53-3 at Pg ID 1928.) MDEQ responded the following day, indicating that Flint is not practicing CCT and that the results of testing for two six-month periods indicated that no treatment was needed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, Pg ID 1927.) Mr. Del Toral emailed MDEQ on April 25, 2015,\n   expressing his concern regarding the lack of CCT following the water source switch considering the known corrosivity of the Flint River and the City's extensive lead service lines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, Pg ID 1925.) Mr. Del Toral further reemphasized that the City's pre-flushing ahead of compliance sampling may be distorting test results. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Del Toral expressed that \"[g]iven the very high lead levels found at one home and the pre-flushing happening at Flint...the whole town may have much higher lead levels than the compliance results indicated ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In May and June 2015, EPA Region 5 staff continued to express concern to MDEQ and the City about increasing concentrations of lead in Flint's drinking water and the City's lack of corrosion control treatment and offered the EPA's expertise to move forward and rectify the water quality problems. (Def.'s Mot. Ex. 32 at 3, ECF No. 39-15 at Pg ID 1294; Ex. 3 at 4, ECF No. 38-2 at Pg ID 1144; Pls.' Resp. Ex. 6 at 1, ECF No. 53-7 at Pg ID 1945.) During this period, Mr. Del Toral prepared the EPA's interim report on high lead levels in Flint's water system, which was circulated to his colleagues. In the report, Mr. Del Toral indicated that Flint was not including tests from homes showing high lead levels in its compliance sampling pool. (Pls.' Resp. Ex. 3 at 5, ECF No. 53-4 at Pg ID 1935.) He also expressed concern that this omission, as well as Flint's sampling procedures, conceal a more wide-spread problem with high lead levels throughout the City's water supply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, Pg ID 1932.) As Mr. Del Toral further explained in an email to his colleagues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The widespread high lead is my judgment based on a couple of decades of working with lead issues and I stand by it despite the limited data set from Flint. A simple application of scientific principles to the circumstances in Flint along with the limited data are enough to know that there is a problem there. They have no corrosion control treatment in place for over a year now and they have lead service lines. It's just basic chemistry on lead solubility. You will have high lead leaching into the water where you are doing nothing to mitigate that. We don't need to drop a bowling ball off every building in every town to know that it will fall to the ground in all of these places. The fact that their sampling is designed not to capture lead (everything is fine) does not negate our scientific understanding of what is going on. The only reason we don't have more data is because the City of Flint is flushing away the evidence before measuring it....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 5 at 3, ECF No. 53-6 at Pg ID 1942.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Tinka Hyde, the Director of the Water Division for Region 5, convened a formal conference call with MDEQ management on July 21, 2015, to discuss the status of Flint's lead sampling results (including MDEQ's position on pre-flushing) and MDEQ's interpretation of the LCR, which conflicted with Region 5's interpretation. (Def.'s Mot. Ex. 20, ECF No. 39-3 at Pg ID 1206-07.) The EPA interpreted the rule as requiring a public water system to use optimal corrosion control treatment upon switching water sources. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20142.10\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex C at 41-42, ECF No. 37-3 at Pg ID 863-64; Ex. 11 at 1-2, ECF No. 38-10 at Pg ID 1169-70.) MDEQ decided to treat Flint's change in water sources as a \"new source\" which would require OCCT only after monitoring reflects the need for treatment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20142.10\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 20 at 1, ECF No. 39-3 at Pg ID 1206.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In preparation for the July 21, 2015 conference call between EPA and MDEQ, EPA drafted a \"Briefing Paper\" which reflects what EPA already knew about\n   Flint's water crisis and state and local officials' response (or lack thereof) to that crisis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. Exs. 11, 22, ECF Nos. 53-8, 53-16.) This included the fact that Michigan was not requiring corrosion control in Flint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It further reflects EPA's knowledge that Flint was not including in its testing the citizen-requested samples where high-lead levels were detected-despite EPA's direction that they needed to be included-and EPA's knowledge that Flint was \"pre-flushing\" lines before sampling-again, despite EPA's explanation of why this distorts testing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These documents also reflects EPA s expectation that proper sampling would show high lead levels in the water supplied to Flint residents and a need for corrosion control. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   During the July 21, 2015 conference call, MDEQ requested an opinion from EPA headquarters to resolve the discrepancy in the LCR interpretation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. C at 42, ECF No. 37-3 at Pg ID 864.) MDEQ nevertheless communicated a willingness \"to initiate discussion with Flint sooner rather than later on corrosion control.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 20 at 1, ECF No. 39-3 at Pg ID 1206.) But MDEQ was unwilling to budge on its pre-flushing requirement until new regulations were issued, maintaining that the State's lead compliance sampling procedures comply with federal SDWA requirements and that pre-flushing instructions are not requirements but suggestions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, Pg ID 1207.) Region 5 again offered the EPA's technical assistance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 20 at 1-2, ECF No. 39-3 at Pg ID 1206-07.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On August 17, 2015, MDEQ instructed Flint to implement corrosion control as soon as possible, but no later than January 1, 2016, and to fully optimize its treatment within six months. (Def.'s Mot. Ex. C at 52, ECF No. 37-3 at Pg ID 866; Ex. 32 at 3, ECF No. 39-15 at Pg ID 1294; Pls.' Resp. Ex. 70 at 15, ECF No. 53-27 at Pg ID 2122.) During an August 31, 2015 conference call between MDEQ and Region 5, the results of the second six-month (January-July 2015) monitoring test results for Flint were discussed, which reflected that corrosion control was needed. (Pls.' Resp. Ex. 70 at 15, ECF No. 53-27 at Pg ID 2122.) During this call, Region 5 discussed the need for outreach to Flint's citizens to reduce their exposure to high lead levels in the drinking water and reiterated the offer of technical assistance in implementing corrosion control treatment. (Def.'s Mot. Ex. 32 at 3, ECF No. 39-15 at Pg ID 1294.) But Region 5 viewed MDEQ as having the responsibility to alert the public as the primacy agency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. C at 109, ECF No. 37-3 at Pg ID 880).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Instead, as EPA's agents were well aware, City officials continued to assure Flint residents that there was no corrosivity issue and that MDEQ and the EPA found the City in compliance with safe water standards. (Pls.' Resp. Ex. 47 at 3, ECF No. 53-22 at Pg ID 2059.) At the same time, the EPA learned that pediatricians at Hurley Medical Center in Flint had conducted a study which showed a rise in the blood lead levels of Flint's children after the switch to the Flint River as the City's water source. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, Pg ID\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2058-59.) For example, in the two zip codes where the highest level of lead was found in the water, the EBL (elevated blood lead) levels for infants less than fifteen months old rose from 1.5% to 4.4%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The rest of Flint had an increase from .6 to 1.1% for the same age group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There was no change, in comparison, for non-Flint infants less than fifteen months old. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For children less than five-years old, EBL levels rose from 2.1% to 4.0% throughout Flint and from 2.5% to 6.3% in the two most-affected zip codes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On September 3, 2015, Flint's Mayor announced that the City would implement corrosion control treatment and invited EPA corrosion control experts to join the Flint Technical Advisory Committee (\"TAC\"). (Def.'s Mot. Ex. 32 at 4, ECF No. 39-15 at Pg ID 1295.) On October 7, 2015, the TAC recommended that MDEQ direct Flint to resume purchasing treated water from the DSWD, now called the Great Lakes Water Authority. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. G at 73, 75-76; ECF No. 37-3 at Pg ID 1078; Ex. 32 at 4, ECF No. 39-15 at Pg ID 1295.) On October 16, 2015, the EPA established the Flint Safe Drinking Water Task Force (\"EPA Flint Task Force\") to provide technical expertise to MDEQ and the City. (Ex. 32 at 4, ECF No. 39-15 at 1295.) On the same date, Flint switched back to purchasing finished water from Detroit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Despite the switch, corrosion control treatment remained necessary because the corrosive Flint River water had eroded away the protective coatings in the system. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20142.10\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex.

On November 25, 2015, and on subsequent dates, the EPA Flint Task Force requested information which was not being shared to assess the City's progress with corrosion control. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 32 at 4-5, ECF No. 39-15 at Pg ID 1295.) Without the information, the EPA could not evaluate whether the contamination in the City's water system had been eradicated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While the City began additional corrosion control treatment in early December 2015, the EPA was not assured that high levels of lead and other contaminants had been removed from the water system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On December 14, 2015, the City declared an emergency. On January 14, 2016, Michigan's Governor requested emergency disaster assistance. Two days later, President Obama declared a federal emergency in the City. On January 21, 2016, the EPA issued an emergency order pursuant to Section 1431 of the SDWA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 32, ECF No. 39-15 at Pg ID 1292-1309.) The EPA identified several reasons for issuing the order at that time, including continued \"delays in responding to critical EPA recommendations and in implementing the actions necessary to reduce and minimize the presence of lead and other contaminants in the water supply\" presently and moving forward. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 at Pg ID 1299.) Further, the EPA noted MDEQ's and the City's failure and continued failure to provide necessary information for the EPA, the EPA Flint Task Force and Flint citizens \"to fully understand and respond promptly and adequately to the current deficiencies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, the City viewed its switch back to Detroit water as temporary and planned to eventually move to untreated water from KWA. The EPA viewed the transition as posing \"complex technical and managerial challenges ...that have serious implications for drinking water safety and public health.\" (Pls.' Resp. Ex. 63 at 2, ECF No. 41-4 at Pg ID 1723.) The EPA was concerned that the City lacked the professional expertise and resources to manage the transition and carry out the recommended actions to safely manage the City's water system.

Here, in the complaints filed in both cases, Plaintiffs allege that the United States is liable because the EPA failed to more quickly intervene in response to the Flint Water Crisis pursuant to the authority granted it under Sections 1414 and 1432 of the SDWA. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim the EPA failed to timely investigate, provide technical assistance, obtain compliance or commence a civil action. Plaintiffs also claim that EPA was negligent in failing to warn them of the health risks posed by the Flint water. In response to Defendants' motion, Plaintiffs further contend that EPA was negligent when responding to the complaints it received from Flint residents, misleading them regarding the safety of the water and the extent to which MDEQ and the City were handling the crisis to ensure the water met health standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Claims Based on the EPA's Failure to Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Sections 1414 and 1431 of the SDWA mandated EPA action in response to Flint's contaminated water system. Sixth Circuit precedent leads this Court to conclude instead that these statutory provisions grant the EPA discretion to act. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit held that the conduct of mine inspectors involved discretion because their instructions followed an \" 'if/then' logical structure\" that required the inspectors \"to determine that some predicate condition exists\" before acting.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830358\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/890/#p896\">\n    17 F.3d at 895-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Assessing what State and local authorities have done, whether those actions will protect public health, and whether those actions are sufficient certainly involve an element of choice and judgment. This provision grants the EPA further discretion by stating that, prior to issuing an order or commencing a civil action, it may determine whether it would \"be practicable in light of such imminent endangerment[ ]\" to \"consult with State and local authorities \"to confirm the correctness of the information on which action is proposed to be taken...is based and to ascertain the action which such authorities are or will be taking.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519137,12519138\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/908/152/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that EPA's 1991 memorandum, which it issued to provide final guidance regarding Section 1431, \"elucidate[s] the mandatory nature of the EPA's responsibility.

Again, at the second step, this Court must determine whether the judgment exercised by the EPA in failing to act is of the kind the exception was designed to shield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court begins its analysis with the presumption that the EPA's lack of action was grounded in considerations of public policy.\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    499 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    A.O.

Plaintiffs counter the presumption, arguing that the EPA's decision whether to intervene in the face of the \"blatant safety hazard[ ]\" posed by the Flint Water Crisis was a matter of objective scientific and professional standards rather than public policy. Plaintiffs equate the present matter to\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , where the Sixth Circuit determined that an MSHA safety inspector does not \"permissibly exercise policy choice\" when making a safety compliance determination.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830358\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/890/#p896\">\n    17 F.3d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Feb. 26, 2016) (unpublished) (finding that the United States failed to explain how considerations of access, conservation, and resources played into National Park Services' decision to delay notification to visitors of park of possible risk of exposure to a disease during their visit). The present matter is analogous to these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In passing the SDWA, Congress intended to leave the primary responsibility for overseeing public water systems with the States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. 93-1185, 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6454, 6461. However, Congress sought to set national standards for compliance \"to assure that water supply systems serving the public meet minimum national standards for protection of public health\" and to empower the federal government to intervene if States fail in their primary responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6454-56. Federalism and the efficient use of federal and state resources were policy considerations that factored into devising the regulatory scheme and establishing conditions for the federal government's intervention. Nevertheless, Congress expressly directed the EPA to intervene under specified conditions. In other words, having weighed varying policy interests, Congress decided when federal intervention is necessary. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Lockett\n   </em>\n   , the statutory scheme here mandates a specific EPA response when certain conditions exist. The assessment of whether those conditions have been satisfied are informed by objective scientific standards, scientific knowledge, and the professional judgment of experts in the field. For example, determining whether Flint's water system complied with EPA regulations and, when it did not, whether the State's response was sufficient to rectify the violations involved only the performance of professional and scientific analysis and reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Moreover, the EPA's failure to warn Flint residents of the severe health risks the City's water supply posed to them cannot be justified by any permissible exercise of policy judgment. Within weeks of the switch to the Flint River, the people of Flint suffered rashes and hair loss. The EPA was well aware that the Flint River was highly corrosive and posed a significant danger of lead leaching out of the City's lead-based service lines at alarming rates into residents' homes. The EPA was well aware of the health risks posed by lead exposure, particularly to children and pregnant women. Mr. Del Toral certainly\n   made the risks clear to his Region 5 colleagues within the first half of 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Further, the EPA knew that MDEQ and Flint officials were not warning Flint's residents that they were being supplied lead-laced water. Quite to the contrary, the EPA learned that State and local officials were misleading residents to believe that there was nothing wrong with the water supply and that the lead levels in some homes resulted from the interior plumbing (as MDEQ tried to do with the EPA when alerted to the high lead levels in the Walters' home-a myth the EPA quickly debunked). These lies went on for months while the people of Flint continued to be poisoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As the Third Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    Abunabba\n   </em>\n   , federal officials \"could be aware of a safety hazard so blatant that its failure to warn the public could not reasonably be said to involve policy considerations.\" 676 F.3d at 340 n.6. In that case, the court was speaking about safety hazards posed to the visitors of a remote national park. At issue here is an obvious danger imperiling a city's nearly 100,000 residents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. Ex. 11 at 1, ECF No. 53-8 at Pg ID 1946.)
