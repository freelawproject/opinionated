For reasons set forth below, the Court DENIES Plaintiff's Motion (ECF No. 11 ) and GRANTS Defendant's Motion. ECF No. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Carneiro seeks a determination that he is entitled to uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage under a commercial auto policy when he was struck by another vehicle while crossing a street as a pedestrian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The Policy\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Sentinel issued Special Multi-Flex Policy No. 02 UEC HE2975 for the Policy period of July 8, 2013 to July 8, 2014 (\"the Policy\") to Mario J. Carneiro, CPA Ltd (\"the Company\"). The Policy provides Commercial Automobile Coverage to the Company, including an endorsement providing uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage (\"UM/UIM Coverage\"). The Named Insured is set forth in the Declarations as the Company and the scheduled vehicle is an Audi convertible (\"Company vehicle\"), owned by the Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The UM/UIM Coverage states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

After the initial impact, Mr. Carneiro was again struck by a vehicle that never stopped and was never identified. As a result of being struck, Mr. Carneiro suffered lower leg and ankle pain and suffered a myocardial infarction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Summary judgment is warranted when \"the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed, R. Civ. P. 56(c).

Mr. Carneiro Was Not Occupying a Covered Vehicle.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While to the lay reader the term \"occupying\" would not encompass a person across the street from their car, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has decided that the term is to be interpreted broadly to encompass many situations. They do this because contracts for uninsured-motorist coverage must \"afford protection to the insured against 'economic loss resulting from injuries sustained by reason of the negligent operation of uninsured-motorist vehicles and hit-and-run motor vehicles.' \"\n   <em>\n    McVicker v.

Accident Ins. Co. v.

The\n   <em>\n    Olivier\n   </em>\n   court held that a four-factor analysis should be applied in determining whether a person is \"occupying\" a vehicle:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (1) there is a causal relation or connection between the injury and the use of the insured vehicle;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (2) the person asserting coverage must be in a reasonably close geographic proximity to the insured vehicle, although the person need not be actually touching it;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (3) the person must be vehicle oriented rather than highway or sidewalk oriented at the time; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (4) the person must also be engaged in a transaction essential to the use of the vehicle at the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7389903\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/574/1240/\">\n    574 A.2d at 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Rhode Island Supreme Court has expanded on the\n   <em>\n    Olivier\n   </em>\n   factors and held that the proper analysis is fact-driven, and the\n   <em>\n    Olivier\n   </em>\n   factors should be applied as guideposts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudson v. GEICO Ins. Agency, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12326254\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/1150/#p1157\">\n    161 A.3d 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1157 (R.I. 2017) (noting that a plaintiff may fail to satisfy a portion of\n   <em>\n    Olivier\n   </em>\n   and still be determined as \"occupying\" an insured vehicle for coverage purposes and finding that the passenger of an insured vehicle who heard crash of an accident nearby and left her vehicle to help was occupying the covered car when injured at the accident site).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Policy language at issue relates to inclusion of persons within the Policy. The Court thus analyzes this case with a liberal view of the Policy and with the\n   <em>\n    Olivier\n   </em>\n   factors in mind as a guidepost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. causal relation or connection\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   There is no evidence of a causal relation or connection between Mr. Carneiro's injury and the use of the insured vehicle. Mr. Carneiro does not claim that he had been using his car at or around the time that he was injured but had simply left his office keys in his vehicle and walked over to retrieve them. The covered vehicle acted as a vessel holding the office keys, and the accident had no relation with the operation and use of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. reasonably close geographic proximity\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Mr. Carneiro argues that courts have found plaintiffs who were further away from the covered vehicle than he was here were \"occupying\" the vehicle for coverage purposes. ECF No, 11-11 at 18 (arguing that the\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   court found the plaintiff was \"occupying\" her vehicle at 97 feet away while Mr. Carneiro was injured at around 40 feet away). The Court finds that Mr. Carneiro has established that he was in \"reasonably close proximity\" to his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. vehicle oriented\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Olivier\n   </em>\n   distinguishes between those who are \"vehicle oriented\" and those who are \"sidewalk oriented.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7389903\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/574/1240/\">\n    574 A.2d at 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Carneiro concedes that he had left the vehicle, crossed the street, and was headed toward his office. He had severed his connection with the vehicle and was \"sidewalk oriented.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12326254\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/1150/#p1157\">\n    161 A.3d at 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing cases where individuals were no longer \"vehicle oriented\" when they have severed connection with their vehicles or are on their own without reference to the vehicle).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. transaction essential to the use of the vehicle\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Lastly, Mr. Carneiro does not present evidence that he was engaged in a transaction essential to the use of the vehicle at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olivier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7389903\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/574/1240/\">\n    574 A.2d at 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While Mr. Carneiro argues that the covered car essential to use of his business and the vehicle was \"business orientated,\" he fails to show how his retrieval of office keys to access his office building was essential to the use of his motor vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At best, Mr. Carneiro establishes one of the four\n   <em>\n    Olivier\n   </em>\n   factors. With a liberal view of the Policy and using the\n   <em>\n    Olivier\n   </em>\n   factors as a guidepost, and considering all the facts as a whole, the Court finds that\n   Mr. Carneiro was not \"occupying\" the covered vehicle at the time of the accident and is therefore not insured under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether Mr. Carneiro is the \"Alter Ego\" of the Named Insured Company is Irrelevant.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mr. Carneiro's argument that he is the \"alter ego\" of the Named Insured Company also fails. The \"Who Is an Insured\" section of the Policy is clear and unambiguous: The Policy states that the coverage is for a corporate entity, \"Mario J. Carneiro, CPA, Ltd.\" Next, the Policy provides that \"[i]f the Named Insured is designated in the Declarations as: ... A partnership, limited liability company, corporation or any other form of organization,\" then only certain individuals are afforded coverage, including those \"occupying\" a covered vehicle. Whether Mr. Carneiro is the \"alter ego\" of the Company has no bearing here as the Company remains the Named Insured and the Policy defining the insured apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court thus DENIES Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 11 ) and GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 12 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Court takes the facts from Mr. Carneiro's Complaint and Motion for Summary Judgment. ECF Nos. 1-1, 11.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Myrna Griffith drove the car. Mr. Carneiro sued Ms. Griffith in Providence Superior Court.
