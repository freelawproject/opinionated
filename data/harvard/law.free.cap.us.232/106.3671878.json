The principal questions of fact were whether the agreement was made substantially as alleged, and, if so, then whether the Bank\u2019s attorneys were specially authorized to make it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>or whether the Bank afterwards ratified their action with knowledge of the facts. There was a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount claimed, and, on appeal, the resulting judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Territory (13 Arizona, 418); whereupon the present writ of error was sued out.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">It is insisted that the evidence fails to show that the attorneys who acted for the Bank were authorized by it to enter into the alleged agreement to purchase the Haverty claim. But we think there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict of the jury in favor of plaintiff upon this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">It is also insisted that the parties never in fact came to an agreement, because an item of about $100 for certain freight charges was left open for further consideration. But the jury was . warranted by the evidence in finding that an agreement had in fact been reached before the question respecting freight was raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The principal contention here, as in the court below, is that the agreement alleged and proved was not performed, in that the Haverty Company did not prosecute its claim to judgment; the claim having been for $14,306, with a prior lien upon the building and lots, but subject to a deduction of $4,992.10, provided the boilers and tools could be removed without injury to the building; while the judgment recovered was for $12,429.22, with a lien subordinate to the Bank\u2019s mortgage. We agree with the court below that neither the averments of the complaint nor the evidence at the trial imported a guaranty on the part of the Haverty Company as to, the exact amount of the judgment or the precise status of the lien. The evidence tended to show that the agreement was made as a compromise between the Bank and the Haverty Company, in view of doubts that had arisen whether in law the lien of the Haverty Company was entitled to priority over the Bank\u2019s mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Error is assigned respecting certain remarks made by counsel for plaintiff in addressing the jury; but if there was any impropriety it was cured by the instructions of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The only other point deserving notice is the contention that the motion o.f plaintiff in error (defendant below) for a direction of a verdict in its favor ought to have been granted because of \u00a7 4, c. 99, p. 230, Session Laws 1907 of Arizona, which is in effect that a contract for sale of any chose in action of the value of $500 or upwards shall not be enforceable unless some note or memorandum in writing be signed by the party to be charged, or his agent. Assuming \u2014 what is not clear \u2014 that the point was brought to the attention of the trial court, it is sufficient for present purposes to say that there is nothing in the record to show that the question was raised upon the appeal to the territorial Supreme Court. <em>Gila Valley &amp;c.
