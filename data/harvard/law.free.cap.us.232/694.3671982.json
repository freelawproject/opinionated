The plaintiff got a verdict and judgment which the Supreme Court of the Territory affirmed. 16 New Mex. 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">The only argument addressed to us is an attack upon the jurisdiction of the court that tried the case. That court was' the District Court sitting for the trial of causes arising under the .Constitution and laws of the United States in the First Judicial District in the Territory of New Mexico. The Organic Act of September 9, 1850, c. 49, 9 Stat. 446, provided in \u00a7 10 for three judicial districts, and for a District Court to be held in each by a Jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tice of the Supreme Court as should be prescribed by law. It further enacted that the jurisdiction of the several courts therein provided for \u201cshall be as limited by law\u201d; that \u201ceach of the said District Courts shall have and ex-' ercise the same jurisdiction in all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States as is vested in the Circuit and District Courts of the United States;\u201d and that the first six days of every term or so much of them as necessary \u201cshall be appropriated to the trial of causes arising under the said Constitution and laws.\u201d See also Rev. Stat., \u00a7 1910. The court where the trial was held was one of these District Courts provided for by the Organic Act and the case was one arising under the laws of thfe United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">But it is said that the jurisdiction of these courts was to be \u2018as limited by law/ that that means by territorial legislation, and that a territorial statute provided for the holding of District Courts in the counties, and enacted that the District Courts in the counties should have \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction in all civil cases which shall not be cognizable before probate judges and justices of the peace.\u201d ' Compiled \u2022 Laws, 1897, \u00a7 900. By a later territorial act the District Courts in the various counties were given \u2018jurisdiction in all civil causes in said counties which according to law belong to the District Courts/ <em>id., </em>\u00a7 901. And this was in pursuance not only of the Organic Act but of another act of Congress of June 14,1858, c. 166, 11 Stat. 366, afterwards Rev. Stat., \u00a7 1874, by which the judges of the Supreme Court were \u201cauthorized to hold court \u25a0within their respective districts, in the counties wherein, by the laws of the Territory, courts have been or may be established, for the purpose of hearing and determining all matters and causes, except those in which the United States is a party.\u201d Thus, it is argued, exclusive jurisdiction of cases like the present was transferred to the County District Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>But it has been held for many years that the purpose and effect of these statutes was to give the judges of the Supreme Court sitting in the County District Courts authority to hear cases arising under territorial laws, and to make the jurisdiction over such cases exclusive in those courts. <em>Lincoln-Lucky &amp; Lee Mining Co. </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>7 New Mex. 486, 499-501. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, 25 </em>N. W. Rep. 806. The statutes, we believe, have not been understood to attempt to withdraw from the courts of the larger ' districts the authority expressly conferred upon them by the Revised Statutes and the Organic Act, a thing that of course territorial statutes' could not do. See <em>The City of Panama, </em>101 U. S. 453. We should not decide against the local understanding of a matter of purely local concern unless we thought it clearly wrong, instead of thinking it, as we do, plainly right. <em>Ph\u0153nix Ry.
