The ordinances are contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Chapter 7 of the Code of Ordinances adopted in the year 1906 as amended (Cosby\u2019s Edition, 1911), and the material sections together with portions of the context are set forth in the margin;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The chapter relates to specified businesses in which no one is permitted to engage except under an annual license granted by the Mayor and revocable by him. Among theseSis the business of \u201cexpressmen \u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 305,306). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>It is provided that no person is to be licensed \u201cexcept' a citizen of the United States or one who has regularly-declared intention to become a citizen\u201d (\u00a7307). The license fee is \u201cfor each express wagon,\u201d five dollars, and, \u201cfor each driver' of any licensed vehicle,\u201d fifty cents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>with provision for renewal at one-half these rates (\u00a7 308). Every person driving a licensed \u201cexpress\u201d is to be \u201clicensed as such driver, and every application for such license shall be indorsed, in writing, by two reputable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>residents of The City of New York testifying to the competence of the applicant\u201d (\u00a7 315).

It is to bear a designation accordingly with its official number (\u00a7 331). Its owner is to give a bond to-the State for \u201cevery v\u00e9hic\u00ede licensed in a penal sum of $100, with sufficient surety, approved by the Mayor or Chief of the Bureau of Licenses, conditioned for the safe and prompt delivery\u201d of all articles (\u00a7 332). Provision is also made for the regular inspection of \u201call licensed vehicles and places of business\u201d (\u00a7 374), the report of any change of residence to the Bureau of Licenses <em>(id.), </em>the .exhibition of licenses upon demand (\u00a7 375), and the display of the prescribed letters'and numbers (\u00a7376). Penalties are provided for the' violation of these requirements, and any person carrying on any business regulated by the ordinance, without license, is guilty of a misdemeanor (\u00a7\u00a7 307, 315, 379).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The Adams -Express Company; an .unincorporated association organized under the laws of New York, has been engaged in interstate commerce, as a common carrier of packages, since the year 1854'. It transacts its business in many States; and.in.the City of New York it handles daily about 50,000 interstate shipments, employing 341 wagons and 68 automobiles. About one-half of these wagons ar\u00e9 stabled in Jersey City. Its shipments from New York City to the south and west are hauled to Jersey City and there loaded on express cars of the Pennsylvania Railroad; those destin\u00e9d to points east are taken to the terminal in New York City of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad; and there is also, traffic for points oil the New York, Ontario -and Western Railroad, and tributary thereto,' which is carried to the terminal of that road .at Weehawken, New Jersey. ' Shipments received, from out of .the State for delivery in New. York City are taken by the Company\u2019s.vehicles to. the consignees either: directly from these railroad terminals or through intermediate distributing offices. The Company also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>does a local business in the City of New York and, in .addition, receives packages for \u2022 transportation between that city and such points within the State of New York as are on the line of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The interstate business, however, in the number of packages, comprises ninety-eight per cent, of the total business transacted in New York City, . and, it being impracticable, to effect a separation, the local and the other intrastate shipments are handled in the same vehicles, and by the same men, that are employed in connection with the interstate transportation. It was not until recently that the City sought to compel the Company, in the transaction of this business, to comply with its license ordinances, although there have been ordinances requiring licenses for both express wagons and their drivers for over fifty years (Kent\u2019s ed. (1856); Valentine\u2019s ed. (1859), pp. 374, 375; Shepard &amp; Shafer\u2019s ed. (1881), \u00a7\u00a7 380-386; Laird\u2019s ed. (1894), \u00a7\u00a7 380-386; Percy &amp; Collins\u2019 ed., \u00a7\u00a7 497-504). The provisions here involved (except \u00a7 315) received their present form in 1899. (Ord. app. May 22, 1899, <em>ante, </em>p, 25, <em>note.) </em>It is conceded that the Company has never been compelled to obtain a license for the conduct of its interstate express business, and that its wagons and drivers employed therein have never .been licensed, except \u201cthat for several years last past about 40 licenses for wagons and drivers have been taken out.\u201d The evidence shows that in 1908 an arrangement was made, by way of compromise, that the forty licenses should be issued (twenty having been taken out the year before). The Company agreed to this number, without prejudice, asserting that it was larger in proportion to the total number of wagons than the local business warranted and also that the latter was merely incidental to the interstate business and hence not subject to the license requirements. In the fall of 1910, however, at a time when the business of the Company was interrupted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>by a strike of its drivers, and it was endeavoring to replace those who had stopped work, the City through its officers undertook to enforce the ordinances with respect to all the wagons and drivers of the Company, threatening to arrest unlicensed drivers of unlicensed wagons notwithstanding they might be engaged in interstate transportation and to remove, if necessary, unlicensed wagons from the streets. This was the occasion of the present suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The Circuit Court held that \u00a7\u00a7 305 and 306 were inoperative so far as they purported to require the complainant to obtain a local license for transacting its interstate business, and further that the requirement of licenses as to express automobiles, and chauffeurs, had been superseded by a state statute (Laws of 1910, c. 374). To this extent the City, and its officers who were codefendants, were enjoined. But with respect to the payment. of license fees for express wagons and drivers, and the other regulations which we have briefly described, the court held that the enactments were valid and an injunction was refused. 189 Fed. Rep. 268. Both parties appeal, the Company insisting that it was entitled to the entire relief sought, and the City, that.no relief whatever should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In restraining the enforcement of \u00a7\u00a7 305 and 306, as stated, we think that the court was right. In the absence of a controlling state decision construing the group of ordinances in question and the statute authorizing the City to license businesses (Greater New York Charter, \u00a7 51), we-are not satisfied that they were designed, despite the broad definition, contained in \u00a7 330, to apply to interstate business. The practical construction which they received before the present controversy arose is very persuasive to the contrary <em>(City of New York </em>v. <em>New York City Ry. Co., </em>193 N. Y. 543, 549; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hermanos, </em>209 U. S. 337, 339). But, if the above-mentioned sections are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>to be deemed to require that a license must be obtained as a condition precedent to conducting the interstate business of an express company, we are of the opinion that so construed they would be clearly unconstitutional. It is insisted that, under the authority of the State, the ordinances were adopted in the exercise of the police power. But that does not justify the imposition of a direct burden upon interstate commerce. Undoubtedly, the exertion of the power essential to assure needed protection to the community may extend incidentally to the operations of a carrier in its interstate business, provided it does not subject that business to unreasonable demands and is not opposed to Federal legislation. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>124 U. S. 465; <em>Hennington </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>163 U. S. 299; <em>N. Y., N. H. &amp; H. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>165 U. S. 628; <em>Lake Shore &amp; M. S. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>173 U. S. 285. It must, however, be confined to matters which are appropriately of local concern. It must proceed upon the recognition of the right secured by the Federal Constitution. Local police regulations cannot go so far as to deny the right to engage in interstate commerce, or to treat it as a local privilege and prohibit its exercise in the absence of a local license. <em>Crutcher </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>141 U. S. 47, 58; <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Shelby County Taxing District, </em>120 U. S. 489, 496; <em>Leloup </em>v. <em>Mobile, </em>127 U. S. 640, 645; <em>Stoutenburgh </em>v. <em>Hennick, </em>129 U.

S. 389; <em>Minnesota Rate Cases, </em>230 U. S. 352, 401. As was said by this court in <em>Crutcher </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>141 U. S. p. 58, <em>\u201c&amp; </em>state law is unconstitutional and void which requires a party to take out a license for carrying on interstate commerce, no matter how specious the pretext may be for 'imposing it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 305 and 306, with the schedule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>of fees in \u00a7 308, cannot be regarded as imposing a fee, or tax, for tbe use of the streets; if they were such, the question would at once arise as to the validity of the discrimination involved in such an exaction. Nor can they be considered as a regulation in the interest of safety in street traffic. Other ordinances provide for the \u201crules of the road\u201d to which wagons of express companies, as well as those of other persons, are subject (Code of Ordinances, chap. 12). The sections now under consideration constitute a regulation of the express \u201cbusiness.\u201d Article I is entitled \u201cBusiness Requiring a License\u201d; \u00a7305, containing the enumeration, provides that \u201cthe following businesses must be duly licensed\u201d and \u00a7'306, that \u201cno person shall engage in or carry on any such business without a license therefor\u201d under a stated penalty <em>{ante, </em>p. 24, <em>note). </em>The right of public control, in requiring such a license, is asserted by virtue of the-character of the employment, but while such a requirement may be proper in the. case of local or intrastate business, it cannot be justified as a prerequisite to the cotiduct of the business that is'interstate. Not only is the latter protected from the action of the State, either directly or through its municipalities, in laying direct burdens upon it, but, in the present instance, Congress has exercised its authority and has provided its own scheme of regulation in order to secure the discharge of the public obligations that the business involves. Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584; <em>Adams Express Co. </em>v. <em>Croninger, </em>226 U. S. 491, 505; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Adams Express Co., </em>229 U. S. 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">It would seem to follow, necessarily, that the annual license fees prescribed by \u00a7 308. <em>(ante, </em>p. 25, <em>note) </em>cannot be exacted, so far as the interstate business is concerned. They cannot be regarded as coming within the category of inspection fees, which are sustained when fairly commensurate with the cost of local supervision of such matters as are under local control <em>(Western Union Tel. Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>New Hope, </em>187 U. S. 419, 425; <em>Atlantic &amp;c. Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em>190 U. S. 160, 164). The provisions of \u00a7 308 are inseparably connected with those of \u00a7\u00a7 305- and 306. The sums fixed \u201cfor each express wagon\u201d and \u201cfor each driver\u201d measure the amount to be exacted for the granting of the license required for- the carrying on. of business. And it is difficult to see how; the payment can be enforced, as to the interstate business if. the taking out of the license therefor cannot be compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u2022 Similar considerations are -controlling with respect to the provision of \u00a7 332 for the giving of license bonds. This in terms is related to the requirement of \u00a7 305. It is' provided that a bond shall-be given \u201cfor each and every vehicle licensed\u201d and it is to be conditioned \u201cfor the safe and prompt delivery of all baggage, packages,\u201d etc., entrusted to the owner or driver \u201cof any such licensed express.\u201d As applied to the Company\u2019s business of interstate transportation, it. most fall with the provision regarding the license, and,, further, it must be regarded as repugnant to the exclusive control asserted by Congress in occupying the field ,of regulation with regard to. the. obligations, to be assumed, by. interstate, express carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\"><em>(Adams Express Co. </em>v., <em>Croninger,, supra; Southern. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>222 U. S. 424; <em>Same </em>v. <em>Reid &amp; Beam, id., </em>444, 447.) ,</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Section- 315 provides for .separate .licenses for . drivers..' We may assume the propriety of suitable provision to. ensure careful driving over the . city streets and the existence. of ample power to meet this local necessity. It is also clear that regulations' for this purpose, when, the^ movement of interstate traffic is involved,, should, be entirely reasonable and should not arbitrarily restrict the facilities upon which it must depend. - If the, provision of \u00a7 315. could be regarded as severable from the requirement of a license-for the conduct, of business, we should still have great difficulty in sustaining it as a reasonable regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>lation with regard to drivers employed in the interstate transportation which has been described. Reading \u00a7 315 in connection with \u00a7 307, as we understand the City contends it should be read, no driver can be licensed except a citizen of the United States or one who has regularly declared intention to become a citizen, and the assurance of his qualifications does not depend simply upon the applicant\u2019s ability to meet appropriate tests so as to satisfy the official judgment but the application must be accompanied by the indorsement in writing of two reputable residents of the city testifying to his competence. When the importance to the entire country of promptness and facility in the conduct of the business of the express companies in New York City, and the obvious convenience of their being able to secure drivers in Jersey City as well as in New York, are considered, the provision would seem to be unnecessarily burdensome. We are not called upon, however, to decid\u00e9 this point. Section 315 relates exclusively to drivers of a \u201clicensed hack or express.\u201d There is no such provision as to drivers of wagons generally. While the driv\u00e9r\u2019s license is separate, the ordinance refers only to such drivers as are employed in the business for the carrying on of which a license may be required. Whatever might otherwise be the City\u2019s power as to the regulation of drivers, this provision cannot be divorced from the- license scheme of which it is a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Other requirements, such as the marking of the vehicles with their official numbers, the exhibition of licenses upon demand, and the inspection of \u2018 \u2018 licensed vehicles and places of business\u201d have obvious reference to the same license plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">We conclude that the complainant was entitled to an injunction restraining the enforcement of the ordinances in question against the Company with respect to the conduct of its interstate business and its wagons and drivers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>employed in interstate commerce. In this view it is unnecessary to consider whether the ordinances have been superseded, as to automobiles, by the state st\u00e1tute.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with direction to enter a decree in favor of the complainant in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-5\"> CHAPTER 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">TITLE I. \u2014 BUREAU OP LICENSES.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">(\u00a7\u00a7300-304)</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">TITLE II. \u2014 THE GRANTING AND REGULATION OP LICENSES.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\"><em>Article I. </em>\u2014 Business <em>Requiring a License.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">\u00a7 305.
