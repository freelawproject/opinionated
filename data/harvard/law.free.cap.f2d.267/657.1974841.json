United States, 1945, 325 U.S. 196, 202, 203, 65 S.Ct. 1120, 89 L.Ed. 1554, and</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Whereas it appears, from the District Court\u2019s memorandum opinion in support of the order, that the District Court relied upon the decision of this court in Atchison, Topeka &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Aircoach Transport Ass\u2019n, 1958, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 355, 253 F.2d 877, and did not consider in its opinion the effect of Federal Maritime Board v. Isbrandtsen Co., 356 U.S. 481, 499, 78 S.Ct. 851, 2 L.Ed.2d 926, and</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Whereas it is the view of this court that the Isbrandtsen opinion modifies the holding of the Aircoach case by requiring that the issue of the intent and effect of an agreement approved by the Commission must, in a case where such issue is the sole or dominant issue in the case, first be referred to the Commission prior to a court determination of whether such agreement violates the anti-trust laws, and</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Whereas it is the view of this court that the Isbrandtsen decision does not necessarily require referral to the Commission of issues such as those sought to be referred to the Commission by petitioners\u2019 motion where the agreement is only one of a considerable number of overt acts alleged and where the policy favoring referral is <em>clearly outweighed by </em>other factors such as the probability of undue delay and the overriding importance of early consideration of the other overt acts alleged, and</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Whereas the District Court, having considered this case in all of its aspects, is in a better position to determine whether, on balance, suspension of proceedings is warranted,</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">It is hereby, <em>ordered </em>that petitioners\u2019 motion for leave to file a petition for writ of certiorari and petitioners\u2019 petition for writ of certiorari are <em>granted, </em>and the case is <em>remanded </em>to the District Court with directions to vacate its order of May 26, 1958, and to reconsider petitioners\u2019 motion to suspend proceedings in light of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Order on Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Clarification of Order of Aug. 8, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">This case came on for consideration on petitioners\u2019 motion for clarification of an order of this court in this cause dated August 8, 1958, respondent\u2019s reply thereto, the motion of Aircoach Transport Association, Inc., et al. for leave to file a memorandum of law as amicus curiae and to participate in oral argument, the lodged memorandum of Air-coach Transport Association, Inc., et al., and respondent\u2019s reply to the motion of Aircoach Transport Association, Inc., et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">It appears therefrom that the order of August 8, 1958, did not fully set forth the view of this court concerning the effect of Federal Maritime Board v. Isbrandtsen Co., 1958, 356 U.S. 481, 499, 78 S.Ct. 851, 2 L.Ed.2d 926, upon the decision of this court in Atchison, Topeka &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Aircoach Transport Ass\u2019n, 1958, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 355, 253 F.2d 877. The intent, however, of the order of August 8 was to assert our view that the Isbrandtsen opinion modifies the holding of the Aircoach case by requiring that the issue of the intent and effect of a rate reduction claimed to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>taken pursuant to procedures set forth in agreements approved by the Commission under Sec. 5a of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5b, must, in a case where such issue is the sole or dominant issue, first be referred to the Commission prior to a court determination of whether such rate reduction violates the anti-trust laws. The \u201cissue\u201d referred to in the order was not intended to mean the issue of the applicability of sec. 5a agreements to the rate reductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">It is therefore Ordered that petitioners\u2019 motion for clarification of the order of August 8, 1958, is granted, to the extent indicated in the foregoing paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">It is Further Ordered that the motion of Aircoach Transport Association, Inc., et al. for leave to file a memorandum of law as amicus curiae is granted, but its motion for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
