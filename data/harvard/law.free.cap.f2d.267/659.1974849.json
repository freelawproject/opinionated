In its opinion of January 16, 1959, supporting its order of January 26, 1959, the District Court concluded, inter alia, that the issue in question \u201cis in no sense the dominant, much less the sole, issue of this litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-17\"> Our extraordinary jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (1952) to review by common-law writs the interlocutory orders of the District Court should be exercised only in very limited and unusual circumstances. We have examined carefully the contentions made by petitioners and have concluded that, in the circumstances of this case, it would not be in the best interests of sound judicial administration to review at this stage of the litigation the District Court\u2019s decision either by writ of certiorari or by the alternatively requested amendment or clarification of our orders of August 8, 1958, and December 16, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-18\">Therefore, it is Ordered by the court that the petition for writ of certiorari, or in the alternative, the motion for clarification of our orders of August 8, 1958, and December 16, 1958, is hereby denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
