The Commissioner then held that \u201cthe resemblance between the marks is such that it is believed that a substantial segment of the purchasers of the products is likely to attribute common origin to them\u201d and accordingly sustained the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">Appellant claims that the products identified by the marks in issue are specifically different from one another, are sold to a class of discriminating purchasers, and therefore would not be likely to be confused as to source or origin by such prospective customers. Appellant further contends that \u201cPlex,\u201d the asserted dominant feature of opposer\u2019s mark, was appropriated by it prior to the use thereof in \u201cPlextone.\u201d Appellant refers to its prior registration of the mark \u201cPlexite,\u201d which registration was pleaded in the answer to the present opposition. It therefore concludes that it \u201c * * * should feel free to adopt a mark with the prefix \u2018Plex\u2019 therein, such as the instant mark \u2018Plextrum\u2019 for other products in its line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">Irrespective of the specific differences in composition of applicant\u2019s and opposer\u2019s goods, we agree with the Assistant Commissioner that they come within the general category of paint products. Also, it is our opinion that both materials are intended to be used as protective and decorative coatings on similar and, in many instances, on identical surfaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-14\">In so far as the class of purchasers is concerned, there is no indication in appellant\u2019s application that it is restricted to any specific channels of trade and, since no other evidence is offered, we must assume that all conventional modes of distribution of its products are contemplated. On the other hand, appellee has introduced testimony which establishes that it not only markets its product through its Industrial Division, which sells \u201cPlextone\u201d directly to manufacturers, for industrial product finishes, and through its Architectural Division, which sells it to authorized distributors who, in turn, sell the material to building and painting contractors, but that appellee has also carried on an extensive educational program by means of \u201cconsumer leaflets\u201d and advertisements in magazines, in order to teach the general public to distinguish its goods by the trademark \u201cPlextone.\u201d Under these circumstances we can only conclude that the channels of trade through which applicant\u2019s and opposer\u2019s products move are, or are likely to be the same, and at least overlapping in some categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>We do not agree with appellant\u2019s contention that there is no likelihood of confusion of prospective purchasers as to origin of the goods of the respective parties because of the allegation that purchasers of paint are discriminating. In some instances in the paint field this theory might be significant but not so here. First, the evidence adduced by appellee discloses a great variety of purchasers having no special technical skill. A painting contractor may be a well established firm or an individual who does odd jobs on days off from his regular occupation. Furthermore, if appellee\u2019s general consumer educational program is successful and the ultimate consumer determines that \u201cPlextone\u201d is to be used in his home or business establishment, he would not be classed in the category of a discriminating purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Appellant\u2019s suggestion that his prior registered mark \u201cPlexite\u201d so resembles opposer\u2019s \u201cPlextrum\u201d as to weaken or delimit its scope is without merit. The existence of <em>one </em>registration having a feature common to that found in op-poser\u2019s mark, while admissible in evidence, is insufficient to prove that that feature is suggestive of the goods with which the mark is associated. Cf. Shoe Corporation of America v. Juvenile Shoe Corporation of America, 266 F.2d 793, 46 CCPA -. Furthermore, as pointed out in the tribunals below, the fact that a prefix may be common to other marks in the paint composition field is of no significance if the use of the two marks, when they are viewed in their entireties, as they must be, is likely to cause confusion of source. The marks may not be judicially dissected. May Department Stores Co. v. Kenya Corp., 234 F.2d 870, 43 CCPA 940, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">The ultimate question before us is whether prospective purchasers may mistakenly believe that the two paint products, marketed under the marks \u201cPlextone\u201d and \u201cPlextrum,\u201d have the same <em>source or origin. </em>We conclude that \u201cPlextrum,\u201d when applied to the goods of applicant, so resembles the mark \u201cPlextone,\u201d as applied to opposer\u2019s prod-ucts, as to stimulate identical psychological reactions and as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">For the above reasons we <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">WORLEY, C.
