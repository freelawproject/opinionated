In this hearing, as stated in his opinion, the district judge \u201cin effect, retried the petitioners for the offense of which they have been convicted\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-21\">Upon full consideration of the appeal in the light of the briefs and arguments and of the opinion of the district judge, we are convinced, as the district judge was, that the full and detailed hearing did not disclose any facts at all supporting plaintiffs\u2019 claims that in their trial and conviction they were denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-22\">\u25a0 For these reasons, therefore, apparent upon the record and correctly summarized and stated in the opinion of the district judge, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-23\">.
