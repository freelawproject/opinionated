The trustees of Seafarers Welfare Plan brought an action of interpleader to have the court determine which of the three claimants named as defendants was-entitled to the death benefit of $3,400 payable to the designated beneficiary of Joseph A. Ryan or, lacking a designated beneficiary, to his estate. The court awarded the fund to defendant Helen-Mae Blakeny. Vivian A. Ryan, individually and as administratrix of the estate of Joseph A. Ryan, has appealed. The' other defendant whose claim was-rejected, Ella Collins, took no appeal. Payment of the fund has been stayed pending the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">The appeal raises two questions, each of narrow scope and each revolving about Exhibit A, the designation of beneficiary card, produced from the files of the Trustees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This exhibit was offered by the appellee and was admitted over appellant\u2019s objection. Finding 12 states that Joseph A. Ryan \u201cduly executed\u201d this designation of beneficiary card on or about August 30, 1951. The court also found that appellant was Ryan\u2019s only lawful wife and became his widow on his death, since their marriage had never been terminated by divorce. Appellant first contends that she is the-beneficiary designated in the card because she is the only lawful \u201cMrs. Joseph A. Ryan * * * wife * * *- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>of the decedent.\u201d This claim cannot be supported. The court found that \u201cThe person intended and described in the designation of beneficiary * * * is the defendant, Helen Mae Blakeny, also known as Helen Mae Ryan.\u201d She and Ryan went through a marriage ceremony in Mississippi in 1947. Although not his legal wife, she was known as Mrs. Ryan, she resided at the stated address in Mobile, and Ryan, since November 1948, had listed that address as his legal residence. Neither \u00a7 24-a, N.Y. Personal Property Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 41 nor the Seafarers Welfare Plan imposes any limitation upon the class of beneficiaries eligible for designation. Had Ryan referred to his designee as \u201cmy friend\u201d rather than \u201cmy wife\u201d no dispute as to whom he intended could have arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Appellant next contends that Exhibit A was improperly admitted into evidence and, since there was no other proof of a designated beneficiary, she is entitled to the fund as administratrix of Ryan\u2019s estate. It is not entirely clear whether the court admitted the card as a business record pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1732 and 374-a, N.Y. Civil Practice Act, or because the judge himself determined that Ryan\u2019s signature on the card was genuine by comparing it with a concededly authentic signature on the separation agreement. During the course of the trial the court remarked: \u201cThe only question is whether Joseph A. Ryan executed this card.\u201d After comparing the signature on Exhibit A with the concededly authentic signature on the separation agreement, Judge Edelstein said: \u201cTo my mind, the signatures are so identical I may say it leaves no question at all in my mind.\u201d This statement supports the finding that Exhibit A was duly executed by Ryan. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1731 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-15\">\u201cThe admitted or proved handwriting of any person shall be admissible, for purposes of comparison, to determine genuineness of other handwriting attributed to such person.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-16\">Very closely in point is Desimone v.
