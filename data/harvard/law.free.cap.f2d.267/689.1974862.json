Appellant submitted her resignation following (1) receipt of written notice of a proposal to separate her from the Civil Service but before any further action thereon, and (2) the advice of officials of the employing agency that the charges would not be withdrawn but would remain in her personnel file with her answer thereto. The resignation was accepted. Thereafter appellant received a copy of the Notification of Personnel Action (Standard Form 50) which recorded her resignation and noted that it had been accepted while removal charges were pending but before final decision was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Appellant thereupon requested withdrawal of her resignation on the ground that she would not have resigned had she known that such a notation would appear. The request was denied by the employing agency and appellant sought review by the Civil Service Commission. The Commission held that the resignation was voluntary and hence it had no power to entertain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">We think the District Court was correct in granting summary judgment for the appellees and in dismissing the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
