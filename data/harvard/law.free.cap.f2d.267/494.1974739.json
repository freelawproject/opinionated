The matter was thoroughly discussed in an opinion by the district judge to whom the case was tried, E.D.Pa.1958, 162 F.Supp. 129, and we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-17\">It was found as a fact that four musical compositions were publicly performed for profit on the premises of Lew Tendler Tavern, Inc., and that no permission for this performance was given by the copyright owners. Tendler was a subscriber to the services of Muse-Art Corporation which transmits music played on records to its patrons by private telephone wire. The customers pay for the service, but may turn the music off or on at will. Tendler\u2019s is a restaurant to which members of the public may resort for food and drink.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-18\">It is true that Muse-Art did not broadcast its music directly to the public, but it did send it to Tendler for the purpose of having it played to Tendler\u2019s customers as and when Tendler wished so to entertain them. Rendition of a musical composition under these circumstances is a public performance for profit by Muse-Art as well as Tendler. The district judge correctly so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-19\">Point was made that it was not proved that on the night in question the music may not have come from Muse-Art, but may have come through the restaurant\u2019s loudspeaker from a radio. But there was no evidence one way or the other that there were musical facilities other than Muse-Art available in Tendler\u2019s and there was positive testimony that there were not such pauses in the rrvisic program either by or for commercials as are found in radio programs. There was sufficient support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the compositions heard in Tendler\u2019s came from music \u201cpiped\u201d in by Muse-Art.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>There was raised in the answer an allegation concerning violation of antitrust law by plaintiffs. No evidence was offered on the point; the district judge did not decide it and neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
