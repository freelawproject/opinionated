This is that the offense complained of in count two was committed in Coosa County, Alabama and should have been tried there.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-26\">The right claimed by defendant is a procedural one and may be waived,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>and the record is devoid of any objection on the trial on the ground of improper venue. Indeed, it is made for the first time here. In addition, the record as a matter of fact does not support the claim that there was no evidence that the offense occurred in the Middle District. On the contrary, the government\u2019s testimony was unequivocal as to the place where the violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The appeal is without merit. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-15\">. Hagner v. United States, 60 App.D.C. 335, 54 F.2d 446; Mahaffey v. Hudspeth, 10 Cir., 128 F.2d 940; United States v.
