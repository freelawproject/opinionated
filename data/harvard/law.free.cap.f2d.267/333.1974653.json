The debtor was continued in possession and transacted business until September 17, 1954 when it was adjudicated bankrupt. While the debtor continued in possession, it withheld $291.41 for taxes withheld from wages of employees but did not segregate the sums so withheld, although ordered to do so by the referee in bankruptcy. The trustee\u2019s final report shows assets of only $544.44. Of this amount the United States claims $291.41 under \u00a7 3661 of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3661, now \u00a7 7501 of the Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7501. Under this court\u2019s decision in City of New York v. Rassner, 127 F.2d 703, the Government is entitled to prevail. The trustee argued and the referee in bankruptcy agreed, that the 1952 amendment to \u00a7 64, sub. a(l) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 104, sub. a(l), made the Rassner case inapplicable. Judge Bryan wrote a very lucid opinion, 156 F.Supp. 403, which overruled the referee. We agree. The order is affirmed on the opinion below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
