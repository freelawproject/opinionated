Thereafter, on July 12, 1956, he appeared again with his attorney and withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty to counts 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9 of the indictment. Counts 4, 5 and 6 were dismissed. He was sentenced on his plea for a period of seven and one half years and is now serving that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment together with his affidavit filed in support of the motion, and the briefs filed in support of his appeal. We conclude that he was lawfully indicted and that Judge Duncan\u2019s finding that he \u201centered his plea of guilty with full knowledge and understanding of the charges made against him\u201d was without error.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">The appeal presents no question of sufficient merit to require discussion and the order appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"ArZ\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
