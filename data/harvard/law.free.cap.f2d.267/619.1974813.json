The evidence showed that the sales of narcotics involved here were made to, and at the request of, a Government informer. Defendant\u2019s sole ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict on the ground of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">Defendant asserts that, under applicable case law, before police authorities may invite one to engage in any particular criminal behavior, they must have probable cause to believe that he is engaging in such conduct. In this case, he says, the Government failed to show that it had such cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">As we read prevailing doctrine, however, probable cause is not required; reasonable suspicion is enough.
