The assault consisted of a shooting by the defendant of the complaining witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-20\">The appellant\u2019s argument emphasizes the privilege of a householder to use force against an unwelcome and unlawful intruder. If the facts were in accordance with the appellant\u2019s story we should give this interesting and difficult question of law thorough consideration. But this case presented sharp clashes in the testimony. The trial judge heard the evidence; he had to make up his mind where the balance of credibility lay. He did so, and his conclusions, supported as they are by adequate testimony are not to be interfered with by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-21\">The. judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
