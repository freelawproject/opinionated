Even at an average price of $200 a unit (the average price of the units in suit was less than $150), substantially more than fifty thousand air conditioning units are involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-16\">Of course, the decision of this court in this case is binding only on the parties to this case, subject to their right to seek a review of the correctness of our holding, by applying to the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-17\">Those who seek to intervene in this court as amicus curiae<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are not bound by either the stipulation of the parties in this case or our opinion and judgment. In other words, this is plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, and not that of the amicus curiae. When and if the government attempts to apply our holding in this case to the amicus curiae, they have a right to litigate their case, and to seek what they consider to be a proper result for them. While our decision might be cited as a precedent in such subsequent litigation, the same as any other case holding, it would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>be binding as res judicata on the amicus curiae, who were not parties to this case. Subsequently, if, conformably to our decision, and assuming it is not reversed by the Supreme Court, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue makes a new ruling to replace that which we have declared invalid, the amicus curiae will be free to go into court and attack the validity of the new ruling. Even if the validity of the new ruling is then sustained, the amicus curiae will still have an opportunity under \u00a7 7805(b) of the 1954 Revenue Code <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to procure a ruling from the Secretary of the Treasury as to \u201cthe extent, if any, to which\u201d the ruling \u201cshall be applied without retroactive effect\u201d. In addition, they would probably have a right to contest in court the Secretary\u2019s ruling under \u00a7 7805(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">We have voted to deny plaintiffs\u2019 petition for rehearing en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-18\">.

Further study and research has convinced me that I was wrong in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The matter now before us is a petition for rehearing before the full court sitting <em>en banc </em>or, in the alternative, for the recall of our order of March 20, 1959, for a modification of our judgment so as to affirm the judgment of the District Court. I am voting to grant the petition for a rehearing <em>en banc. </em>I feel I should state my reasons for so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">The statute taxes self-contained air conditioners of the household <em>type, </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4111. Since 1948 the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, by published rulings, has consistently exempted from taxation the air conditioning units having a total motor horsepower of one horsepower or more. In 1956 the industry\u2019s spokesmen testified before Congress and stated that \u201chousehold type\u201d was generally understood to refer to smaller units and that \u201cThe Bureau of Internal Revenue has stated that in accordance with the legislative intent, the tax applies to household-type equipment and for that reason has drawn the line of demarcation at less than one horsepower.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">Congress has authorized <em>the </em>Commissioner to promulgate rules and regulations to fill in the details in the Internal Revenue Code. Congress has authorized the Commissioner to make all necessary interpretations of the statutory language of said Code. \u00a7 3450, Internal Revenue Code, 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3450; \u00a7 7805 (a), Internal Revenue Code, 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7805(a). After the hearings referred to, Congress made changes in other sections of the Code but left the excise tax on air conditioners intact. I consider this to be a clear example of Congressional acquiescence in the published interpretations of the Bureau of Internal Revenue as to the excise tax on air conditioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">In our opinion herein we held revenue rulings which have been consistently in force since 1948 to be void 1) because the Act makes no reference to horsepower, and 2) the horsepower test is \u201cinconclusive,\u201d \u201cuncertain\u201d and \u201cimpracticable.\u201d The opinion then describes a household type appliance as one \u201cmade to meet the needs of a household.\u201d One may ask \u2014 a large household or a small one? Also, must a manufacturer in some way be able to certify what was the ultimate use of each of the thousands of air conditioners which he has manufactured ? It seems to me that the test laid down in the opinion of this Court qualifies under the terms used by the Court, <em>viz., </em>\u201cinconclusive,\u201d \u201cuncertain\u201d and \u201cimpracticable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">For decades the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has defined the word \u201chousehold.\u201d He has defined household type refrigerators by cubical content (S. T. 845, 1936-2 C.B. 340); household type electric fans by the length of blades <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>(Rev. Rui. 55-146, 1955-1 C.B. 528); household type electric water heaters by wattage (Rev. Rui. 58-115, 1958-1, C.B. 409) and household type lawn mowers by cutting width (Rev. Rul. 116, 1953-1, C.B. 465). As far as I am aware, these rulings have been administered \u201cwithout confusion and controversy.\u201d In any event, knowing of these rulings, Congress has continued to enact and reenact excise statutes using the same general language, <em>viz., </em>\u201chousehold type.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The principal issue in the District Court was that the Government contended the rulings referred to rated horsepower under NEMA standards. The plaintiffs contended the rulings referred to actual horsepower. The District Court found as a fact that plaintiffs\u2019 air conditioners had not only an actual but also a rated horsepower of one horsepower. Thus, the court below found that plaintiffs\u2019 air conditioners were not taxable. However, on this appeal we disregard the District Court\u2019s finding and decide the case on the basis of invalidity of a long established ruling which has been relied on by all members of the industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">I agree with the statement in a recent decision of the Ninth Circuit in Evans v. Commissioner, 1959, 264 F.2d 502, 511, wherein the court said: \u201c \u2018Taxpayers had a right to file their returns in reliance upon the Commissioner\u2019s long-continued interpretation of his own Regulations. * * * Common justice requires that it (the new regulation) be given a prospective construction only.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">I think it is no light matter to hold invalid a ruling which has stood for years. The ruling in question was made in 1948. Congress reenacted the excise statute without change in 1954. Congress was expressly advised in 1956 that the horsepower test was devised to separate household from commercial types \u201cin accordance with legislative intent.\u201d Congress made no change in the excise tax on air conditioners when it revised the code in 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Our decision will have a serious effect on the air conditioning industry which had no previous notice that the Government would attack its own long-established ruling. Many thousands of air conditioning units have been sold. Our decision might result in attempts to collect retroactively 10 %\u2022 on each air conditioner sold which might be placed in the vague classification \u201cmade to meet the needs of a household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">The tax is on the seller and can only be passed on to the buyer by the terms of a contract of sale. Any opportunity to recover such a tax is no longer available to the manufacturers. I believe our decision makes for confusion more confounded. The situation is so serious I think it should have the attention of oui Court sitting <em>en banc.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
