The permit was issued and the work had proceeded almost to completion, when it was discovered that the property in question was located in a portion of Prince George\u2019s County known as the Maryland-Washington Regional District, in respect to which (unlike other areas of the County) building permits are issuable, not by the Commissioners\u2019 Clerk, but only by the Building Inspector, and by him only with the approval of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission as to zoning, etc. The site is located in a residential zone and the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission refused to rezone. The plaintiffs sued the County Commissioners for damages and the District Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. For the reasons fully stated in the District Court\u2019s opinion, 158 F.Supp. 401, its action is</p>\n<p id=\"b990-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
