Department of Labor and Industries of Washington, 1942, 317 U.S. 249, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246. Noah\u2019s dependent mother, therefore, might \u201celect to bring suit under the state com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>pensation law or the federal Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act [33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 et seq.]\u201d. Noah v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, 5 Cir., 1959, 265 F.2d 547, 548. The majority opinion was based on the view that Hahn v. Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Co., 1959, 358 U.S. 272, 79 S.Ct. 266, 3 L.Ed.2d 292, has now \u201csettled it that the jurisdiction in cases of this kind is not exclusive but concurrent\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">On rehearing by the Court en banc, a majority of the Court is of the opinion that Hahn v. Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Co. does not go so far as to hold that a longshoreman is in the twilight zone. The effect of such a holding would be to overrule by implication Southern Pacific Company v. Jensen, 1917, 244 U.S. 205, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086 and to expand the twilight zone to the point where all amphibious workers would be in the twilight zone, contrary to Davis v. Department of Labor and Industries of Washington, 1942, 317 U.S. 249, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246. Both cases were cited with approval in Hahn v. Ross Island. Both are still the law. As pointed out in Flowers v. The Travelers Insurance Co., 5 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 220, 226, certiorari denied 1959, 359 U.S. 920, 79 S.Ct. 591, 3 L.Ed.2d 582: \u201c[The employment of longshoremen to load and unload cargo] is the precise employment described in the Longshoremen\u2019s Act and was indeed the very activity which gave rise to Jensen, to Nogueira v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 281 U.S. 128, 50 S.Ct. 303, 74 L.Ed. 754, 1930 A.M.C. 763, to Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp. v. Cook, 281 U.S. 233, 50 S.Ct. 308, 74 L.Ed. 823, 1930 A.M.C. 760, to Northern Coal &amp; Dock Co. v. Strand, 278 U.S. 142, 49 S.Ct. 88, 73 L.Ed. 232, 1929 A.M.C. 64, and more recently to Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. O\u2019Rourke, 344 U.S. 334, 73 S.Ct. 302, 97 L.Ed. 367, 1953 A.M.C. 237.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We hold therefore that the Louisiana Workmen\u2019s Compensation law is inapplicable. The District Court correctly held that the federal Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act provided the exclusive remedy for Noah\u2019s dependent, and properly dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The Petition for Rehearing is granted; the judgment heretofore entered by this Court reversing the judgment of the lower court and remanding the case for trial is set aside, and the judgment of the lower court is</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">HUTCHESON, Chief Judge, and CAMERON, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Rehearing denied; HUTCHESON, Chief Judge, and CAMERON, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
