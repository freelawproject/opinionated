On November 11, 1935, the Government seized certain alcohol and mash at a place known as Cannon Farm, where a still was being operated. On January 14, 1938, an indictment was returned charging Harry Kaplan and 65 others with a conspiracy to erect the Cannon Farm still, among others, and there manufacture distilled spirits with the intent to defraud the Government of the appropriate taxes thereon. On December 12, 1941, Harry Kaplan pleaded guilty as charged in the indictment, and was convicted upon his plea and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-19\">On February 24, 1945, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed distilled spirit taxes amounting to $21,509.-80 against Harry Kaplan and others covering the spirits produced at the seized still, and on March 2, 1945, made demand on Harry Kaplan for payment. The tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>claim of the Government against Harry Kaplan was tried to a jury, whose verdict was in favor of plaintiff; and judgment was entered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">By three deeds signed, dated, acknowledged and delivered on September 27, 1944, .and recorded on March 12, 1945, Harry Kaplan conveyed three separate parcels of real property to his wife Annie for a stated consideration of \u201cOne and more dollars.\u201d As to each of these three conveyances, the District Court found that the consideration therefor was \u201cmonies theretofore loaned, by Annie Kaplan to Harry Kaplan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">By a fourth deed dated October 15, 1945, and recorded on November 16, 1945, Harry Kaplan for a stated consideration of \u201cOne dollar and other valuable consideration,\u201d conveyed to Annie his interest as co-tenant by the entirety in a parcel known as the \u201cSynagogue property.\u201d As to this conveyance, the District Court found. that the consideration therefor was \u201cnot a fair consideration,\u201d and accordingly decreed that the conveyance be set aside as fraudulent under \u00a7 273 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">On his appeal from the judgment entered on the jury\u2019s verdict for the Government\u2019s tax claim, Harry Kaplan urges that admission in evidence of (1) the conviction upon his plea of guilty to the conspiracy charge, without permitting him to explain his guilty plea, and (2) testimony as to acts done and statements made without his presence as to- the Cannon Farm still, constituted prejudicial error, as did that portion of the District Court\u2019s charge to the jury explaining the evidentiary effect of the judgment of conviction in the criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Judge Burke refused to permit Harry Kaplan, either by his own testimony or through witnesses, to explain the reasons for the guilty plea, and in effect charged the jury that Harry Kaplan\u2019s plea of guilty in the criminal proceeding, in which he was charged with conspiring with others to erect and operate an illegal still without paying the tax imposed by law and with intent to defraud the Government, was conclusive as to all facts covered by the charge, admitted by the plea, and adjudicated as between the Government and Harry Kaplan by the final judgment of conviction which was entered on the plea. Both the ruling, excluding evidence in explanation of the guilty plea, and the charge to the jury were <em>correct. </em>[Local 167 of International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Stablemen &amp; Helpers of America v. United States, 1914, 291 U.S. 293, 298, 54 S.Ct. 396, 78 L.Ed. 804; see United States v. Wainer, 7 Cir., 1954, 211 F.2d 669; cf. Emich Motors Corp. v. General Motors, 1951, 340 U.S. 558, 568-569, 71 S.Ct. 408, 95 L.Ed. 534; Helvering v. Mitchell, 1938, 303 U.S. 391, 397-398, 58 S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917; and see Developments in the Law-Res Judicata, 65 Harv.L.Rev. 818, 878-80 (1952).]</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">The judgment of conviction upon his plea of guilty having conclusively adjudicated Harry Kaplan a member of the conspiracy [Local 167 of International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Stablemen &amp; Helpers of America v. United States, supra, 291 U.S. at page 298, 54 S.Ct. at page 398], the District Court correctly admitted statements made by his co-conspirators during the continuance of, and in furtherance of, the conspiracy. See Delli Paoli v. United States, 1957, 352 U.S. 232, 237-239, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278; Lutwak v. United States, 1953, 344 U.S. 604, 617-619, 73 S.Ct. 481, 97 L.Ed. 593; Pinkerton v. United States, 1946, 328 U.S. 640, 645-648, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">There appearing no error or defect in the trial before the jury, the judgment entered on the verdict in favor of the Government and against Harry Kaplan for the unpaid taxes, penalties and interest must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">Turning now to the Government's appeal from the adv\u00e9rse portion of the judgment on the second cause of action as to the allegedly fraudulent conveyances, we find no challenge by either the Government or the Kaplans to that portion of the judgment setting aside as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>fraudulent as to creditors the conveyance of the so-called \u201cSynagogue property.\u201d As to the other properties involved, after hearing all evidence adduced on the issues raised by the Government\u2019s claim to equitable relief, the District Court found that the three conveyances \u201cwere not made with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors.\u201d According due regard to \u201cthe opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses\u201d [Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) 28 U.S.C.A.], we cannot say that the finding of absence of any actual fraud within \u00a7 276 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The Government insists, however, that the three conveyances in question were nonetheless fraudulent within \u00a7 278 of the Debtor and Creditor Law, which provides that: \u201cEvery conveyance made * * * by a person who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent is fraudulent as to creditors without regard to his actual intent if the conveyance is made * * * without a fair consideration.\u201d [N.Y.L.1925, c. 254, \u00a7 1, 12 McKinney\u2019s Consolidated Laws of N.Y. 242 (1945).]</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">It was the finding of the District Court that, at the time of the three conveyances, \u201cHarry Kaplan was not indebted to the United States,\u201d and further that \u201cby said conveyances he did not become insolvent.\u201d On the record here, we agree with the Government that both of these findings are clearly erroneous. Under the applicable tax statute [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1150(c) (d) (1934 ed.)], the Government was a creditor of Harry Kaplan from the time the alcohol was produced in 1935. United States v. Rizzo, 1936, 297 U.S. 530, 533, 56 S.Ct. 580, 80 L.Ed. 844. And Harry Kaplan\u2019s financial statement of July, 1945 discloses that he was insolvent when the three transfers were made to his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">Inasmuch as the transferor was insolvent at the time, the transfers were fraudulent within \u00a7 273, if made without a fair consideration. It was the uncontradicted testimony of both Harry and Annie Kaplan that all three properties were purchased with Annie\u2019s money. The burden of proof rested upon the Government affirmatively to establish that the conveyances were made without a fair consideration. Strongin v. International Acceptance Bank, 2 Cir., 1934, 70 F.2d 248, 252, certiorari denied 293 U.S. 575, 55 S.Ct. 86, 79 L.Ed. 673; In re Goodman, D.C.S.D.N.Y. 1932, 5 F.Supp. 517, 518; Henry v. First National Bank, Sup., 1951, 110 N.Y.S.2d 115; Fox v. Sizeland, 1938, 170 Misc. 390, 9 N.Y.S.2d 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">It is true, as the Government points out, that the District Court made no express finding of fact as to whether or not there was a fair consideration for each of the three transfers. But as to each conveyance there is the finding, supported by uncontradicted evidence, that the \u201cconsideration for said conveyance was monies theretofore loaned by Annie Kaplan to Harry Kaplan.\u201d See N.Y. Debtor and Creditor Law, \u00a7 272, subd. a; In re North Babylon Estates, 2 Cir., 1948, 30 F.2d 372, 374; Halsey v. Winant, 1932, 258 N.Y. 512, 180 N.W. 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">Moreover, the record here would not sustain a finding that the consideration was not fair, and this record presumably contains all the evidence which both sides could marshal on this issue. So it would be nothing less than a waste of judicial effort to remand this Jarndyce-like litigation to the District Court for an express finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">Accordingly, deeming failure to make an express finding on the issue as to fair consideration to be harmless error on the record in this case made long years after the events in question [Fed.R.Civ.P. 61], we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
