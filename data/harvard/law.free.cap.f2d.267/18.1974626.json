Appendix \u00a7 462(a) for making false statements to his Selective Service Board on August 19, 1953, September 16, 1953, and February 16, 1954, that he was then living with his wife and child. Trial was had before Judge Bruchhausen, a jury having been waived. The sole issue seriously contested at the trial was the truth or falsity of his statements to the Draft Board. The testimony of Termini\u2019s former wife, who had divorced him some time prior to the trial, and that of her parents, with whom she and their child resided during the period in question, provide ample support for the trial judge\u2019s finding that Termini was not living with them as he had said he was. The credibility of these witnesses, of course, is not a matter upon which we may substitute our judgment for that of the court below. Hence the substantial question before us is his contention that the testimony of his former wife was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\"> Two distinct evidentiary privileges have been recognized as arising from the marital relationship \u2014 a right to bar all testimony of one spouse adverse to the other, and a more limited privilege applicable only to confidential marital communications. Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 6, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435; United States v. Walker, 2 Cir., 176 F.2d 564, 567, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 891, 70 S.Ct. 239, 94 L.Ed. 547; United States v. Mitchell, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 1006, 1007-1008, adhered to 2 Cir., 138 F.2d 831, certiorari denied Mitchell v. United States, 321 U.S. 794, 64 S.Ct. 785, 88 L.Ed. 1083. As the present-day justification of the former is said to be its minimizing of marital discord, Hawkins v. United States, 358 U.S. 74, 79 S.Ct. 136, 3 L.Ed.2d 125; United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>v. Walker, supra, 2 Cir., 176 F.2d 564, 568, it is well settled that the privilege ends with the dissolution of the marriage as <em>by </em>divorce. Pereira v. United States, supra, 347 U.S. 1, 6, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435. And while the latter privilege is generally acknowledged to survive the termination of the marriage, it is authoritatively limited to utterances to one\u2019s spouse intended to be kept confidential. Clearly it does not here extend to the testimony of defendant\u2019s ex-wife, which largely dealt with her residence with her parents, the membership of their household, and kindred matters. Pereira v. United States, supra, 347 U.S. 1, 6, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435; United States v. Mitchell, supra, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 1006, 1009. Moreover, we find no merit in defendant\u2019s vigorously urged contention that the recent decision of Hawkins v. United States, supra, 358 U.S. 74, 79 S.Ct. 136, 3 L.Ed.2d 125, supports his position. In that case the Supreme Court did no more than reaffirm the broader of the two marital privileges, despite that privilege\u2019s doubtful efficacy. See Yoder v. United States, 10 Cir., 80 F.2d 665; United States v. Walker, supra, 2 Cir., 176 F.2d 564, 569 (dissent of Clark, J.); United States v. Graham, D.C.E.D.Mich., 87 F.Supp. 237; McCormick on Evidence 145 (1954). We find no suggestion in the Court\u2019s opinion of an intent to disturb the well settled limitations of the privilege as to confidential communications which it had reaffirmed only shortly before in Pereira v. United States, supra, 347 U.S. 1, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Similarly, there is no merit in defendant\u2019s final contention that his statements were not material to his draft classification, since he was entitled in any event to a deferment on grounds of resulting hardship to his child under Selective Service Regulations, 32 CFR \u00a7 1622.30(b). Sec. 462(a), 50 U.S.C. Appendix, by its terms requires only that the false statement be one \u201cregarding or bearing upon a classification or in support of any request for a particular classification,\u201d while under the perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, and the statute dealing with false statements to the Government, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, it suffices to show that the falsehood \u201cis capable of influencing the tribunal,\u201d United States v. Henderson, 7 Cir., 185 F.2d 189, 191, or that it \u201ccould affect or influence the exercise of a governmental function,\u201d Freidus v. United States, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 223 F.2d 598, 601. Moreover, in United States v. Rubinstein, 2 Cir., 166 F.2d 249, 254-255, this court came close to holding that a registrant\u2019s right to draft deferment on one ground is wholly irrelevant to the criminality of false statements supporting an application for deferment on another. But defendant\u2019s contention here may be more narrowly answered. For he has not shown that he would have received a deferment on grounds of hardship to his dependent child had he not been deferred as living with his wife and child.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Conviction affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
