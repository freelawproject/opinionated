In promulgating the order, the Secretary says he merely complied with a statutory duty imposed by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The so-called Westland proviso contained in Section 6(e) of the Statehood Act reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">\u201c[T]he administration and management of the fish and wildlife resources of Alaska shall be retained by the Federal Government <em>under existing laws </em>until the first day of the first calendar year following the expiration of ninety legislative days after the Secretary of the Interior certifies to the Congress that the Alaska State Legislature has made adequate provision for the administration, management, and conservation of said resources <em>in the broad national interest * </em>* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">On January 3, 1959, simultaneously with the effective date of the Statehood Act, the Constitution of the State of Alaska became effective and with it three ordinances adopted by the people of Alaska along with the Constitution. Ordinance No. 3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-13\">\u201cAs a matter of immediate public necessity, to relieve economic distress among individual fishermen and those dependent upon them for a livelihood, to conserve the rapidly dwindling supply of salmon in Alaska, to insure fair competition among those engaged in commercial fishing, and to make manifest the will of the people of Alaska, the use of fish traps for the taking of salmon for commercial purposes is hereby prohibited in all the coastal waters of the State.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 624, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., app. A, 83 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">The Secretary read the words \u201cunder existing laws\u201d in the Westland proviso as including Ordinance No. 3 of Alaska, and concluded that the Statehood Act which \u201caccepted, ratified and confirmed\u201d the Alaska Constitution, amended the White Act by prohibiting the use of such traps in Alaskan waters as set forth in the ordinance. In other words, the Secretary argues that the Congress did not intend that he should suspend the Alaskan ordinance, adopted by popular vote along with the Constitution, in the interim period while he administered the state\u2019s wildlife resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\"> One key consideration in the problem is that we are dealing with a transition measure \u2014 a temporary, not a permanent, provision. What was the intention of Congress concerning the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>terim transition period between federal territorial control and full statehood? In effect the Westland proviso makes the Secretary a \u201ctrustee\u201d for both the federal government and the new state \u201cin the broad national interest\u201d during the transition of administration from the federal to the state authorities. The Secretary, in that unique capacity, could not reasonably disregard a valid law of Alaska which was \u201cexisting\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on January 3, 1959, the effective date of the Alaska Statehood Act which defined his powers over wildlife resources for the interim period commencing on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We would ignore the obvious were we to fail to state that the question posed to us is close; no reading of the words \u2022of the statute, no part of the legislative history, no contemplation of a possible objective leads with absolute certainty to a clear answer. In such a situation, while the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the powers conferred upon him by Congress is not binding on the courts <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> nevertheless it is entitled to considerable weight. In this instance his interpretation is reasonable, and it is consistent with the congressional plan for interim administration of natural resources described in the Westland proviso.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We think his view should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Of necessity, in this unique interim situation, the Secretary must apply a federal sanction to effect the enforcement of a state law. See footnote 3 supra. This apparent anomaly can be explained only by reference to the fact that in this transition of authority the Secretary is operating in a dual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">We have considered appellants\u2019 other contentions, including the argument that procedural errors occurred in the notice and hearings on the Secretary\u2019s action prohibiting fish traps, and we find no error which affects the validity of the Secretary\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">The stay granted by this Court April 14, 1959, is therefore dissolved and the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"Axf\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\">. This is an appeal from the District Court\u2019s denial of declaratory judgment and preliminary injunction. We granted appellants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal and expedited the case. Appellants adequately represent three different interested classes: (1) salmon canning companies dependent to a substantial degree upon fish caught by traps in Alaskan waters; (2) individuals whose livelihoods have been dependent upon Alaskan trap fishing; and (3) companies and individuals who have ownership interests in Alaskan trap fishing locations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\">.

Under this .authority to limit fishing in any areas so set apart and reserved the Secretary may (a) fix the size and character of nets, boats, traps, or other gear and appliances to be used therein; (b) limit the catch of fish to be taken from any area; (c) make such regulations as to time, means, method, and extent of fishing as he may deem advisable.\u201d The White Act provides criminal sanctions for any violation of a regulation of the Secretary made pursuant to its authority. 43 Stat. 466 (1924), 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 226.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b710-17\">. 72 Stat. 339 (1958), 48 U.S.C.A. preceding section 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b710-18\">.
