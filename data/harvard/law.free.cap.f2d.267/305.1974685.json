An injunction against the enforcement of that ordinance was also sought. Two weeks prior to the trial the City repealed this ordinance. It passed a new ordinance apparently delegating the matter of seating to regulation by the Transit Company. The plaintiffs sought to file a supplemental complaint to bring the validity of this new ordinance and practices under it into the suit. The Court adjudged that the original cause was moot and should accordingly be dismissed and that the \u201cmotion for leave to file a supplemental complaint * * * be * * * overruled, without prejudice, however, to the rights of the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>to reassert the matters set out in the purported supplemental complaint in an appropriate proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">This appeal, therefore, involves only the question of the denial of leave to file the supplemental complaint. There is <em>no </em>showing that the Court abused its discretion in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
