On the basis of this she was adjudged a bankrupt by the referee to whom the proceeding had been referred by order of the Clerk, acting in the absence of the Judge. Ten days later appellant moved to vacate these orders under the provisions of Rule 60(b) (1) and (6) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-20\">The motion was heard upon affidavits filed in support of, and in opposition to the relief sought, and was denied. This appeal is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-21\">The record shows the following uncontroverted facts. While appellant executed her \u201cConfession\u201d on the advice of her counsel, the latter\u2019s affidavit, filed in opposition to the motion, states that when he gave that advice he told appellant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that she \u201cwould be given an opportunity to be heard before the referee for the purpose of finally determining whether or not they were in fact bankrupts.\u201d This advice was wholly wrong, as appellant asserts. Appellee does not dispute that.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-22\">The petition alleged that appellant was \u201cdoing business as Bill &amp; Moris Seed Company of Halsey, Oregon\u201d; that petitioners had provable claims \u201cagainst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>him\u201d for seed and feed and money loaned. Appellant\u2019s affidavit stated that she did not do business as \u201cBill and Morris Seed and Grain Company\u201d; that she had no interest in that business \u201cnor any liability for the debts therefor\u201d; that she did not owe the named petitioners, or any of them, the sums set forth \u201cnor any other sums\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">These statements in appellant\u2019s affidavit, which, if true, showed a complete defense on the merits, were not controverted by any counter affidavit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Both sides accept as correct the statement of appellant\u2019s brief that \u201cappellant had, at the time the \u2018Confession\u2019 was signed, a complete defense to the involuntary petition.\u201d That was the record made on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The record also discloses that at the time he denied the appellant\u2019s motion, the trial judge was laboring under a misapprehension as to the consequences of his denial. Just after the attorneys had closed their arguments on the motion and left the court room, the Court stated: \u201cThere is a presumption that things done in the ordinary course of business are done according to the law. I don\u2019t want to foreclose those parties of a right to be heard. They can be heard if they file their answer. That will take care of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZch\">The Judge was wrong. Gratiot County State Bank v. Johnson, 249 U.S. 246, 39 S.Ct. 263, 63 L.Ed. 587. He did not \u201cwant to foreclose\u201d appellant, but foreclose her he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">We think that on this record it was an abuse of discretion for the court to deny the motion to vacate the adjudication. Rule 60(b) is clearly designed to permit a desirable legal objective: that cases may be decided on their merits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe recent cases applying Rule 60(b) have uniformly held that it must be given a liberal construction. * * * Since the interests of justice are best served by a trial on the merits, only after a careful study of all relevant considerations should courts refuse to open default judgments.\u201d Tozer v. Charles A. Krause Milling Co., 3 Cir., 189 F.2d 242, 245; accord, Bridoux v. Eastern Air Lines, D.C.Cir., 214 F.2d 207, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">We need not here be concerned with whether the mistake under which appellant acted was a mistake of law, induced by the erroneous advice given her by the attorney. If we assume that the \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect\u201d, listed in subdivision (1) of Rule 60(b) does not ordinarily apply where the mistake, inadvertence, etc. relates to a mistake of law, yet subdivision (6) provides that relief can be granted for \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">As stated by Mr. Justice Black in Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, 614, 69 S.Ct. 384, 390, 93 L.Ed. 266: \u201cIn simple English, the language of the \u2018other reason\u2019 clause, for all reasons except the five particularly specified, vests power in courts adequate to enable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>them to vacate judgments, whenever such action is appropriate to accomplish justice.\u201d Cf. Bridoux v. Eastern Air Lines, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Here the appellant made a showing that she had a defense which she was misled into waiving through the erroneous action of the attorney. She made that showing very promptly. The trial court, although stating <em>\u201cI </em>don\u2019t want to foreclose\u201d this party, nevertheless, because of its plain misapprehension of the situation, accomplished just that foreclosure by its order. This involved something less than the \u201ccareful study of all relevant considerations\u201d referred to in Tozer v. Charles A. Krause Milling Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The order denying the appellant\u2019s motion is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to set aside the adjudication of bankruptcy and the order of reference, and to permit appellant to file her answer, and to proceed to try the merits of the issues thus framed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-11\">. Rule 60, 28 U.S.C.A. \u201c(b) * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the' court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; * * * (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b912-25\">. And also her husband against whom a parallel bankruptcy petition had been filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b913-8\">. The only affidavit filed in opposition to the motion was that of the attorney who had advised appellant to sign the admission of bankruptcy. Appellant\u2019s affidavit had stated that she was called to the attorney\u2019s office and told that she had to sign in order to keep the insurance on her property in force. She stated that she was not advised as to the effect of the document, and that the attorney did not question her then, or at any other time \u201cconcerning the legal entity of \u2018Bill and Morris Seed and Grain Co.\u2019, or any other facts concerning our farm, the business or our finances.\u201d The omissions in the attorney\u2019s affidavit appear to confirm this, so far as appellant was concerned. He stated he recommended that both appellant and her husband execute confessions in bankruptcy \u201cso that the insurance on their property could be kept in force.\u201d He stated he had discussed with the husband, Mr. Patapoff, the latter\u2019s financial condition, and had discussed it with Patapoff\u2019s auditor. He says nothing about having inquired into the finances or property or ownerships of the appellant. (Oregon is not a community property state).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b913-16\">. Cf.
