We agree that no competent evidence was introduced touching upon the solvency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Greene, since the bookkeeper testified without having the records before the court, and testified only as to book values and not as to \u201cfair valuations.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Langham, Langston &amp; Burnett v. Blanchard, 5 Cir., 246 F.2d 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The weakness of appellant's case, however, is that the referee based his dismissal on the further ground \u201cthat Petitioner has failed to substantiate the allegations set forth in his petition.\u201d These allegations charged several acts of bankruptcy. Except as to solvency, under the first act, the burden of proving these charges was on the plaintiff. The record before us is silent as to several of the essential ingredients in each of the alleged acts of bankruptcy. We cannot say, therefore, that the referee erred in dismissing the petition or that the district court erred in affirming that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-22\">. \u201cA person stall be deemed insolvent \u25a0within the provisions of this Act whenever the aggregate of his property * * shall not at a fair valuation be sufficient in amount to pay his debts.\u201d 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1(19).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
