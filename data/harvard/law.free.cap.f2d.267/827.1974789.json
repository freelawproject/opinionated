Asserting that plaintiff\u2019s complaint was wholly insufficient as a claim, defendant filed its motion \u201cto dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted\u201d, and, alternatively, for judgment on the pleadings, and it was presented to, and heard by, the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Stating that he was of the opinion that the motion should probably be sustained and that \u201cin the nature of a pretrial\u201d he would like to hear testimony on whether a claim could be stated, the district judge heard the testimony of several witnesses and disposed of the case by finding and holding: that the motion to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings was good and should be granted; that no cause of action had been, or could be, alleged; that leave to file the amendment should be denied; and that judgment should be entered dismissing the suit with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"Abe6\">This appeal from that judgment, testing for error the findings, conclusions and judgment of the district judge, presents as basic questions whether the action of the court was in accordance with, or in violation of, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 8(a) \u201cClaims for Relief\u201d,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Rule 15(a) \u201cAmendments\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">Earnestly insisting that appellant\u2019s complaint complied with the requirements of Rule 8(a) and that if it did not, plaintiff should have been permitted to-amend, appellant urges upon us that the judgment should be reversed and the-cause remanded for a trial on the merits..</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">The appellee as earnestly insisting that, the complaint did not state a claim and in addition that the district judge tried and correctly determined the case on the merits against appellant, urges upon us-that there was no error in the judgment and it must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">We do not think so. On the contrary,, we think it clear that, while it is certain that the district judge in taking the position in the case and giving it the direction that he gave it, was earnestly endeavoring to determine in justice to both plaintiff and defendant where the truth of the matter lay, it is equally certain that, under settled law in this circuit,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he erred in holding that plaintiff\u2019s complaint did not state a claim under Rule-8(a) on which relief could be granted. It is also equally true, under the settled' law in this circuit,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that, if it did not state such a claim, the district judge wasin error in dismissing it without granting leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">The judgment is reversed and the-cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-6\">. \u201cRule 8. General Rules of Pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">\u201c(a) Claims for Relief. A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court\u2019s jurisdiction depends, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it, (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for judgment for the relief to which he deems himself entitled. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b876-8\">. \u201cRule 15.
