Appellant further asked an injunction to restrain the appellee corporation, its officers, directors, employees and others from negotiating for any such transfer. Summary judgment was entered for the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">Appellant here insists he is entitled to the claimed relief because of a proviso of D.C.Code, \u00a7 29-903 (1959 Supp.) which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-14\"><em>\u201cProvided further, </em>That no corporation may be organized under this chapter unless the place where it conducts its principal business is located within the District of Columbia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">The District Court order in pertinent part read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-16\">\u201c1. That Sec. 3 of the District of Columbia Business Corporation Act, 68 Stat. 180, \u00a7 29-903 of the District of Columbia Code, does not require the defendant corporation, Washington American League Base Ball Club, Inc., to conduct its principal business at a place within the District of Columbia and therefore does not prohibit said corporation from moving its American League franchise to Minneapolis, Minnesota, or to any other city outside the District of Columbia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">It is clear that Congress spoke prospectively in \u00a7 903 of the District of Columbia Business Corporation Act of 1954, 68 Stat. 180, D.C.Code \u00a7 29-902 et seq. (1959 Supp.) The appellee corporation, although reincorporated under the 1954 Act, is shown to have been \u201corganized,\u201d not under the 1954 Act, but in 1905 under the Act of 1901, 31 Stat. 1284, D.C.Code, \u00a7 29-201 et seq. (1951). The 1901 Act imposed no restriction upon the place where the corporation might conduct its principal business. There is no requirement that corporations in order to be permitted the privilege of reincorporation are to be subject to whatever stricture may be imposed by the proviso of Section 3 to be applied in future to corporations \u201corganized\u201d under the 1954 Act. The District Court did not err in awarding summary judgment in favor of the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
