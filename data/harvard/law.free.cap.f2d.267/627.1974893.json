His administrator, appellant here, brought suit alleging that on January 17, 1956, the insured suffered an incidental injury \u2014 a blow on the chest from a heavy moving object \u2014 which gave rise to a death benefit claim under the insurance contract. The District Court granted summary judgment for the appellee, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-21\">In pertinent part, the insuring clause of the contract covered the insured against loss of life \u201cresulting directly and independently of all other causes, from bodily injuries sustained during any term of this policy, through purely Accidental Means.\u201d It was further provided as to \u201cAccident Indemnities\u201d that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-22\">\u201cIf the Insured shall sustain bodily injuries, as described in the Insuring Clause, which injuries shall, independently and exclusively of disease and all other causes, continuously and wholly disable the Insured from the date of the accident and result in any of the following specific losses within thirteen weeks, the Association will pay:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-23\">For Loss of Life... .$2,500.00\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>In its summary judgment order the District Court recited that it had considered \u201cthe reports of the doctors who attended the deceased prior to and during his terminal illness, the accidental death provisions contained in the contract of insurance between the parties, the points and authorities submitted by counsel * * * and the other pleadings and arguments furnished by counsel * * * and the court being fully advised in the premises and finding as a matter of fact that the alleged injury sustained by the insured was, at most, an aggravation of pre-existing active diseases, and the court finding as a matter of law that the liability of the said defendant * * * is controlled by McKeever v. Prudential Life Insurance Company of America, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 190, 204 F.2d 59\u201d and accordingly granted the appellee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We have carefully examined the entire record. It is clear that for more than twenty-five years appellant\u2019s decedent had been suffering from chronic suppurative bronchitis and emphysema. The official certificate ascribed the cause of death to bilateral broncho-pneumonia. An autopsy performed upon the 67-year-old decedent disclosed far advanced lung disease including pulmonary emphysema, cor pulmonale, pulmonary fibrosis, and bilateral lower lobe tuberculosis. Assuming that appellant\u2019s decedent may have suffered an accidental chest injury, one of his doctors concluded the trauma \u201cmay have been a factor responsible at least in part for Mr. Shulman\u2019s death which occurred two weeks later.\u201d Another advised that the injury to his sternum undoubtedly interfered with his ability \u201calready badly impaired\u201d to expectorate. Upon such bases appellant sought to bring himself \u201cdirectly in line with the holdings of the McKeever case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">We think appellant has quite mistakenly evaluated his case. The contract of insurance in controlling particulars is not greatly dissimilar to many which have engaged the notice of the courts. See for example, Order of United Commercial Travelers of America v. Nicholson, 2 Cir., 1925, 9 F.2d 7, 15; cf. Landress v. Phoenix Mutual Life Ins. Co., 1934, 291 U.S. 491, 54 S.Ct. 461, 78 L.Ed. 934. Allowing the appellant every favorable intendment from the evidence adduced by deposition, answers to interrogatories, exhibits and otherwise, he could not show that loss of life resulted from the trauma \u201cdirectly and independently of all other causes.\u201d Nor, could he demonstrate an injury which \u201cindependently and exclusively of disease and all other causes\u201d brought the decedent within the contract. Rather, the record as a whole is clearly otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">We find no error. Cf. McKeever v. Prudential Insurance Company, 1953, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 190, 204 F.2d 59, affirming, Mun.Ct.App.D.C.1952, 89 A.2d 229; Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Beckwith, 1987, 67 App.D.C. 209, 91 F.2d 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
