Agent Arpaio testified that Dean told them Calvin Gray was his source of narcotic supply; that on February 14, 1958, Dean repeated that statement and picked out Calvin Gray\u2019s picture from seven or eight pictures shown him by Agent Newey. Agent Arpaio knew that the Bureau of Narcotics was investigating Calvin Gray although he had not seen him in person.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">On February 14, 1958, Dean made a telephone call from his apartment, with Agent Arpaio listening on an extension telephone in another room. Chicago Police Officer Robert Lopez remained with Dean and saw him dial telephone number HU 8-2034, which Calvin Gray later testified was his telephone number at the time. Agent Arpaio then heard this conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-15\">\u201cDean: I would like some stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-16\">Voice: Did you want a half?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-17\">Dean: Well, Red might want some also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-19\">Voice: Are you at home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-20\">Dean: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-21\">Voice: Call me back in a little while; I am taking a bath.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-22\">Dean then told Agent Arpaio and Officer Lopez that Calvin Gray was taking a bath and would call later.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-23\">Later Dean placed another call at about 2:15 P.M. to the same number and Agent Arpaio heard the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-24\">\u201cVoice: Cal isn\u2019t here. I will have him call you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-26\">About ten minutes later, the telephone in Dean\u2019s apartment rang and Agent Arpaio heard the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-27\">\u201cVoice: 69th and Perry 3:15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-28\">Dean: 69th and Perry 3:15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-29\">Voice: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-30\">Dean, Arpaio and Lopez all left the apartment. Dean drove his own automobile with Agent Arpaio as his passenger in the rear of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-31\">Dean drove to the intersection of 69th and Perry, with Agent Arpaio concealed on the floor in the rear of the automobile. At 69th and Perry, a vehicle passed them and a voice called out: \u201cCalvin will see you down at the next corner.\u201d Dean drove to 68th and Perry and parked his automobile. In a few minutes, Dean said: \u201cHere comes Calvin. * * * \u201d Agent Arpaio saw. defendant Calvin Gray, whom he recognized as the man in the picture picked out earlier by Dean. When Calvin Gray <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>came up to the automobile, he said: \u201cWell, I see you are on time. It is about 3:15,\u201d and opened the automobile door. Agent Arpaio said, \u201cYou are under arrest. Stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Agent Arpaio testified that defendant ran away from him and had to be pursued. Defendant denied flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">When Agent Arpaio searched Calvin Gray, he found two manila envelopes which proved to contain heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The name of the informer, Robert Dean, was disclosed to defendant by Police Officer John McDermott at the Tenth District Police Station, 75th and Maryland, Chicago, Illinois, shortly after the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">It thus appeared that Agent Arpaio had personal knowledge that a crime was to be committed by Calvin Gray at about 3:15 P.M., in the vicinity of 69th and Perry, in Chicago. He had information about Calvin Gray\u2019s criminal narcotic background and had seen a picture of him. Events occurring prior to the arrest substantiated much of the information given him. He was justified in making the arrest without a warrant and in conducting a search incidental thereto, as he had probable cause to believe that a federal crime had been committed by Calvin Gray. United States v. Walker, 7 Cir., 1957, 246 F.2d 519, 527; Draper v. United States, 1959, 358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Defendant argues that failure to produce Dean as a witness deprived the Court below of the opportunity to determine whether or not the circumstances of the arrest constituted reasonable grounds as contemplated by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution; deprived defendant of an opportunity to cross-examine Dean to demonstrate that the arresting official had not acted reasonably in relying on his information; and presented the Court with mere uncorroborated hearsay testimony of the arresting officer. However, in this case, unlike Roviaro v. United States, 1957, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639, cited by defendant, the informer\u2019s name was disclosed. At the time of the trial, government counsel stated that Robert Dean was in custody, commencing service of sentence imposed in an unrelated case, in which he had been represented by the same counsel who was representing Calvin Gray at his trial. It is, therefore, apparent that defendant had the opportunity of securing Dean as a witness, had he so desired, under the process available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">We find no error in the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
