The trial examiner had preferred the Slaton applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-19\">In brief, the trial examiner found that in 1950 Plainview had a population of 14,044. It now receives primary radio service from six broadcasting stations, one of which is located in Plainview. The proposed station would render service to a population of 144,616 and it would not interfere with any existing broadcast service.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-20\">Slaton, in 1950, had a population of 5,036. It is located 16 miles from Lubbock, Texas, with a population of 71,747, and is within the Lubbock metropolitan area. It receives primary broadcast service from seven stations, six of which are located in Lubbock. It has no transmission station of its own. The proposed station would render service to 145,140, but would cause destructive interference involving 5.97% of the population within the normally protected con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>tour of KCCO, Lawton, Oklahoma.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The area of such destructive interference is, however, served by at least ten other standard broadcast facilities at the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">On these findings, the trial examiner awarded the station to appellant, the Slaton applicant, in conformity with the \u201cCommission\u2019s longstanding policy \u2018to afford every community of substantial size, where possible, with an outlet for local self-expression. * * * \u2019 \u201d Despite the objectionable interference which such a grant would cause to KCCO, the examiner found that a grant to Slaton \u201cwould better provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service * * * \u201d in conformity with the mandate of \u00a7 307(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The Commission reversed the trial examiner, and awarded the permit to Plain-view Radio. The Commission recognized that the interference which KCCO would suffer from a grant to Slaton was well within the standards of permissive interference established as a guide by the Commission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And it acknowledged that, under its own policy with respect to $307(b), Slaton\u2019s need for a local broadcast outlet must be regarded as outweighing the needs of the population losing the KCCO service, and that Slaton must be considered a separate community despite its location within the Lubbock metropolitan area.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the Commission made clear that Slaton\u2019s location, and the interference with KCCO, were factors available for comparative consideration. It relied on Slaton\u2019s proximity to Lubbock\u2019s six stations to find a diminished need for a first local outlet of its own. Then it weighed this diminished need, Slaton\u2019s small size, and the interference with KCCO against the presumption of need that a \u201cpopulation center of substantial size [like Plainview] has for a second medium of local expression * * On this balancing of factors the Commission concluded that an award to Plainview would result in a more eq<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>uitable distribution of radio facilities under \u00a7 307(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"> We think the record is inadequate to support this conclusion. It is elementary that findings of basic facts must be supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. In the present case, the key issue for purposes of the \u00a7 307(b) proceeding was the comparative needs of the two communities. Under such circumstances, the Commission could hardly find that one community\u2019s need was greater or less than the other\u2019s without substantial evidence as to those needs. This was established ten years ago in Easton Pub. Co. v. Federal Communications Comm\u2019n, 1949, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 33, 175 F.2d 344, a \u00a7 307(b) proceeding. The Court was explicit in requiring that the Commission make a determination of the relative needs of the communities, and the relative abilities of the applicants to meet the needs. The Court was equally explicit in pointing to the type of evidence essential for such a determination. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">\u201c * * * we cannot tell from the findings what caused the Commission to say that Allentown\u2019s need was greater. Present and proposed programs would seem to be an essential element in testing comparative community needs * * Id., 85 U.S.App.D.C. at pages 37-38, 175 F.2d at pages 348-349.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">On the present record, however, no such evidence of programming appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Similarly, with respect to the interference a station at Slaton would cause KCCO, there is no evidence of the need for the KCCO service lost by interference, on the one hand, as against the need for the service proposed by the new facility, on the other. The necessity for such evidence, in determining the weight to be given interference resulting from a proposed station, was made evident by our decision in Democrat Printing Co. v. Federal Communications Comm\u2019n, 1952, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 72, 202 F.2d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">, Apparently, the Commission relied upon its expertise in assaying the factor of interference with KCCO, and in assuming that whatever Slaton\u2019s local needs might be, they would be sufficiently filled by Lubbock\u2019s six stations. However, as we said in another context: \u201cCommission expertise alone cannot support [such] pivotal assumption[s].\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">In oral argument in this Court, intervenor urged that the absence of programming evidence was not available to attack the Commission\u2019s determination since the parties had agreed at the hearing before the examiner to limit comparative consideration to engineering statistics. Assuming arguendo that such an agreement was made,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it cannot serve to excuse the absence of the evidence which we have held essential to sustain the Commission\u2019s findings. True it is that the parties need not adduce any evidence they do not wish to. But then, the Commission cannot make any findings which differentiate between the two parties on those issues upon which there is no supporting evidence. Johnston Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Comm\u2019n, 1949, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 40, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>46, 175 F.2d 351, 357. Quite the contrary \u2014 in the present case, without <em>anymore </em>evidence, the Commission would have had to assume that there was \u201cno material difference between the applicants\u201d as to community need, Johnston Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Comm\u2019n, supra, 85 U.S.App.D.C. at page 47, 175 F.2d at page 358, and would therefore have had to award the station to the petitioner on the basis of the \u00a7 307(b) presumption. If it purported to differentiate between the two stations on the basis of the respective needs of the two communities, then it should have required more evidence regardless of any stipulations in the case. Under the circumstances, the case must be</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Remanded for further proceedings upon a re-opened record in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\">.

The Commission has considered the grant of a first local outlet to a community of great importance in allocating broadcast facilities. Southern Media Corp., 11 F.C.C. 688 (1946); Utica Observer-Dispatch, Inc., 11 F.C.C. 383 (1946). This has been true even when the community receiving the award was within the metropolitan area of a community then served by a transmission system or systems. WMAK, Inc., 11 F.C.C. 850 (1947). This has also been true when a grant of a first local outlet would cause considerable destructive interference to an existing service.
