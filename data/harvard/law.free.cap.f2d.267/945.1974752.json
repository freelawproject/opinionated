United States Circuit Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for tbe District of Columbia Circuit, designated t\u00f3 participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019Connell, </em>pursuant .to the provisions of Title 28 United States Code \u00a7 291(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b994-16\">MARTIN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b994-17\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, acting through the Assistant Commissioner, affirming the decision of the Examiner of Trademarks refusing to register \u201cOfficial\u201d as a trademark for seal presses.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-18\">Appellant affixes the mark in question on a press designed to removably receive various dies for impressing embossed seals. The seals impressed may be of any character such as the familiar corporate or notarial seals, or otherwise personalized impressions.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-19\">The Commissioner held that the term \u201cOfficial,\u201d as applied to such presses, \u201c * * * j^g a singie primary connotation which embraces at one and the same time the press, the die and the impression made.\u201d It was found that the impressions made by the dies are commonly used to attest or to authenticate documents and as such are \u201cofficial seals,\u201d pertaining to the authority of some office. So finding, the Commissioner then con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>eluded that \u201c * * * the word does not and cannot, in the minds of ultimate purchasers, .identify and distinguish applicant\u2019s goods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">In reaching the conclusion that \u201cOfficial\u201d \u201c * * * does not and cannot * * * \u201d become distinctive of applicant\u2019s goods, several affidavits submitted by applicant from manufacturers of competitive products and distributors of applicant\u2019s products, introduced in an attempt to show such distinctiveness, were considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Appellant contends that the Commissioner erred in determining \u201cOfficial\u201d to be descriptive of seal presses, as well as of the impressions made by such presses when containing appropriately stamped dies. Appellant urges that the vast majority of its sales are of presses with blank dies, and in no sense can such devices be described as \u201cofficial seals\u201d since they are incapable of delivering an impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">It is further claimed that the affidavits submitted by the competing manufacturers, jobbers, and dealers are representative of 90% of the purchasers of appellant\u2019s seal presses, and that these affidavits are sufficient to establish that \u201cOfficial\u201d has become distinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods in commerce. Appellant therefore argues that the Commissioner erred in considering the \u201cminds of ultimate purchasers\u201d in reaching the conclusion that the word in issue \u201c * * * does not and cannot * * * identify and distinguish applicant\u2019s goods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-17\">There is no question but that the word \u201cOfficial\u201d is basically descriptive of <em>seals </em>and that its primary meaning in connection therewith relates to the authenticity of an impression or configuration of an authentic design, and of the device which imparts the impression of the design on soft substances. However, in spite of this primary meaning we do not believe that \u201cOfficial\u201d comes within the category of words which cannot become distinctive of an applicant\u2019s goods in commerce such as \u201cCarillonic Bells\u201d for electronically operated carillons,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or \u201cConsistently Superior\u201d for bakery goods.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the proper proof of its distinctiveness is presented, we believe that \u201cOfficial\u201d can be registered as a trademark to identify the origin of an article which imprints authentic designs and of the dies upon which the designs are cast, under the provisions of section 2(f) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Trade-Mark Act of 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-18\">The United States Supreme Court and other courts, including ours, have discussed the type of evidence which is required to give descriptive words the characteristic of being distinctive in the trademark sense. In Kellogg Company v. National Biscuit Company, 305 U.S. 111, 59 S.Ct. 109, 113, 83 L.Ed. 73, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-19\">\u201c * * * But to establish a trade name in the term \u2018shredded wheat\u2019 the plaintiff must show more than a subordinate meaning which applies to it. It must show that the primary significance of the term in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer. * * #\u00ab</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">This court in Master, Wardens, Searchers, Assistants and Commonalty of Co. of Cutlers in Hallamshire, York County v. Cribben and Sexton Co., 202 F.2d 779, 784, 40 CCPA 872, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-6\">\u201cThe proper construction of Section 2(f) of the Act of 1946 was exemplified by Federico, Examiner-in-Chief of Trade-Marks, acting for the Commissioner of Patents, in Ex parte Pocket Books, Inc., 91 USPQ 182, 184-185. There the Acting Commissioner held the burden of proof rests upon the applicant to establish that the mark of the applicant has become distinctive in commerce, and distinctiveness as a trade-mark should not be recognized without completely overwhelming proof with respect to all aspects of the matter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-7\">\u201c \u2018It seems to me that before it can be stated that a word which is a generic designation of an article can be considered as having acquired the status of a trade mark of a single company for that same article, more should be shown than use by the applicant and the harmonious attitude of the trade; <em>It would appear that before the word could be considered a trade mark, it must have become practically obsolete as a generic name for the article and must be recognized by the public as a trade mark rather than as a generic term of the English language.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-8\">\u201cThe factual situation upon which the applicant relies in the case at bar is strikingly similar to the situation in Ex parte Pocket Books, Inc. The mere affidavit of appellee\u2019s secretary together with the testimony of several witnesses clearly does not constitute a sufficient basis for appellee\u2019s registration of the mark \u2018Sheffield\u2019 for use on stoves and ranges in this and foreign countries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">However, in In re Hollywood Brands, Inc., 214 F.2d 139, 140, 41 CCPA 1001, our court reviewed the opinion in the Master case, and stated:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-10\">\u201cThere is no doubt that Congress intended that the burden of proof should rest upon the applicant for registration, but it set up no standard by which the \u2018distinctiveness\u2019 of a mark was to be determined other than to suggest that substantially exclusive and continuous use of a mark in commerce for the five years immediately preceding application for registration could be considered as prima facie proof that it had become distinctive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-11\">\u201cThe cases cited by the respective counsel have been examined but we find none of them sufficiently in point to be controlling; we do find, however, an increasing tendency to require more and still more proof from an applicant for registration under Section 2(f) than we think Congress fairly intended to impose. For example, the broad language used in the case of Master, Wardens, Searchers, Assistants and Commonalty of Co. of Cutlers in Hallamshire, York County v. Cribben and Sexton Co., 202 F.2d 779, 40 CCPA 872, 878, was not necessary to the proper disposition of that controversy nor do we think it applicable to the facts at bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">As to the question of what evidence is required to establish that the purchasing public identifies the manufacturer by a specified mark our court in In re Duvernoy &amp; Sons, Inc., supra, said [212 F.2d 203, 41 CCPA 856]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-13\">\u201cThe appellant seemingly concedes that the term in question is, in a sense, laudatory or exclamatory and would require proof of the most convincing character to support a claim to distinctiveness. The affidavits relied upon to establish such distinctiveness, as applied to the appellant\u2019s goods, do not, however, sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>reflect the views of the purchasing public with respect thereto, being attestations from persons in close association and intimate contact with its business. We are in entire agreement with the Solicitor for the Patent Office in his statement that \u2018such persons would be much more familiar with the words and devices employed by bakers than would members of the general public. It follows that the fact that these experts recognize a connection between the appellant and words \u201cConsistently Superior\u201d is insufficient to establish that the public would recognize such a connection.\u2019 Accordingly, despite the long and widespread usage of the term in question, it is our belief that the appellant has failed on the record to establish the requisite public understanding necessary to registration under section 2(f), supra.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">In this connection the Circuit Court of Appeals in Steem-Electric Corp. v. Herzfeld-Phillipson Co., 7 Cir., 118 F.2d 122, 125, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-6\">\u201cAssuming that plaintiff\u2019s testimony in this respect furnishes some support for its contention that the trade-mark \u2018Steem-Electric\u2019 carried a secondary meaning, it must be remembered that its dealers and agents, exclusively engaged in purchasing and selling its product, would naturally associate with plaintiff the product sold under its trade-name. It does not follow that the public or any considerable portion thereof would be thus impressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-7\"> Even though we can draw some general principles from these above cited cases which can serve as guides in deciding the case at bar, this controversy must, as in all cases, be decided upon the specific facts as they appear in the record. However, the following general principles have been established. First of all, the applicant has the burden of proving the distinctiveness of his mark by showing by clear and convincing evidence that the mark identifies the producer or manufacturer and not just the product. In some instances \u201cproof of substantially exclusive and continuous use * * * [of the] mark by the applicant in commerce for the five years next preceding the date of the filing of the application * * * \u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> may be sufficient. On the other hand, when the word is not only descriptive but, as here, connotes an authorized activity, much stronger proof is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">It is incumbent upon the applicant to submit proof that its mark is distinctive, not only to \u201cexperts\u201d in the field, but to the purchasing public. Although in some instances numerous affidavits of retailers<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are all that would be required to establish <em>implied </em>recognition by the ultimate consumers, in others, in order to be convinced that the purchasing public identifies the producer of the goods by the mark, consumer affidavits would be in order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Coming now to the evidence in this case, there is an affidavit by applicant\u2019s president, and five others; three representing jobbers, one a competitor and one a dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">In so far as the affidavit of the president of applicant is concerned it does not meet the requirements of section 2(f) in establishing a prima facie case. In fact, there is no reference to substantially exclusive and continuous use of the mark by the applicant in commerce for the five years next preceding the filing of the application. We find this affidavit to have no probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">The other five affidavits offered in evidence state, <em>inter alia,, </em>that the affiants identify appellant\u2019s seal presses by the designation \u201cOfficial\u201d; that their customers order the presses by this designation; that the word \u201cOfficial\u201d identifies the seals as made by the applicant, Meyer &amp; Wenthe, Inc.; and that this designation has been known to affiants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>for over ten years. Except for the affidavit of the dealer the other four affidavits, in using the word \u201ccustomers,\u201d refer to retailers and not to the ultimate consumer. In some instances, where it may be obvious from other evidence that the general consuming public identifies the origin of the product by the mark in question in the same fashion as do the \u201cexperts\u201d in the trade, \u201cexpert\u201d affidavits would be sufficient; nevertheless, we do not believe that such affidavits are sufficient to maintain applicant\u2019s position here.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">For these affidavits represent the views of persons in \u201c * * * close association and intimate contact * * * \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with the applicant; in fact, various of the declarants are \u201c * * * exclusively engaged in * * * selling its product * * <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and thus would be expected to readily identify the origin of the goods. It remains to be seen whether the public would infer a similar association. Although the affidavit of the dealer refers to the consuming public in using the word \u201ccustomers\u201d we do not believe that in stating \u201c * * * our customers consistently ask for pocket seals by the \u2022trademark name \u2018Official\u2019 * * * \u201d that this affiant has established that these purchasers considered the word official anything more than a descriptive term being used in its primary sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">Other evidence introduced by applicant includes Meyer &amp; Wenthe\u2019s catalogs and price lists mailed to the trade, bulletins and stuffers showing that the word \u201cOfficial\u201d has been used in connection with the particular seal press and dies offered for sale. Of course, this material does not establish that the <em>consuming public </em>identifies the origin of this article by the word \u201cOfficial.\u201d Furthermore, one of the displays in the catalog under the term \u201cCounty\u201d seal states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-10\">\u201cAn extra heavy Press for Great Seals used by States, Counties and Cities. Also for <em>Official Court Seals </em>and Seals for various Governmental Departments and Agencies\u201d [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-16\">Evidently, even applicant uses the word official in its primary sense in advertising its merchandise. Also, we notice on the same page besides \u201cCounty\u201d seal, the presence of \u201cConsular\u201d seal. Except for the fact that more material has been placed in the record involving the \u201cOfficial\u201d seal, we see no reason to treat this mark any differently than \u201cCounty\u201d or \u201cConsular\u201d seals in so far as this record is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-17\">Under these circumstances, where the word involved has not only a primary descriptive connotation but also carries with it a note of authority, much more than the evidence introduced by applicant is necessary to show that \u201cOfficial\u201d has become distinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods in commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-18\">For the above reasons we affirm the decision of the Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-20\">WORLEY, C.
