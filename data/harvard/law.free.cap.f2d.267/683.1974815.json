Mrs. Kelley is a citizen of the District of Columbia. Safeway Stores, Inc., is a Maryland corporation doing business in Maryland and in the District. Mrs. Kelley claims that her damages, amounting to $100,-000, were caused by the negligence of Safeway Stores on May 24, 1957, in the manner hereafter described. At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, the trial court directed a verdict for defendant on the ground that (1) there was not sufficient evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence to sustain a verdict for plaintiff, and (2) that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Judgment was entered accordingly, and Mrs. Kelley has appealed to this Court. For the reasons hereafter stated, we hold that the judgment should be vacated and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>case remanded to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The facts, appearing from stipulations and from the witnesses called on behalf of plaintiff, are as follows: On May 24, 1957, between 8 and 9 p. m., Mrs. Kelley, who was then 79 years old and in good health, went shopping with her daughter and six-year-old grandson at appellee\u2019s store in Wheaton. Upon leaving the store at five minutes before the 9 o\u2019clock closing time, the three of them walked toward the store\u2019s parking lot through a commonly used passageway about seven feet wide. As they reached the corner of the store building, they were suddenly confronted, at a distance of not more than four feet, by a Safeway employee pushing a number of shopping carts combined into a train eight or ten feet long. He was returning the carts, in the course of his employment, from the parking lot to the store. Mrs. Kelley testified: \u00ab * * j gaw these carts coming at me so terribly fast. I was afraid that they were going to hit me, and I stepped aside and hit my toe against the curbing.\u201d This caused her to fall in such a manner that she dislocated her thumb, broke her leg and suffered other injuries. She was taken to the Washington Sanitarium where she received treatment but there was evidence that the injuries have resulted in a permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-15\">The primary negligence charged against appellee is that its employee, who was pushing the train of shopping carts, pushed it with such speed toward the seven-foot-wide passageway as to cause Mrs. Kelley and her daughter, with good reason, to fear that the train would hit them. Mrs. Kelley, her daughter and grandson were in the passageway at the time and each stepped aside quickly in order to avoid the threatened collision. In stepping aside, Mrs. Kelley\u2019s foot struck a curbstone in such a manner that she fell and suffered the serious injuries for which she is suing. The only testimony before us as to these circumstances is that of Mrs. Kelley and her daughter. Their credibility has not been attacked and most of their material statements on the subject are set forth in the margin of this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Although their testimony does not conclusively establish the store\u2019s negligence, it does provide ample basis on which a jury might, in the light of all the circumstances, reasonably conclude that an employee of the store, in the course of his employment, pushed the train of carts with such speed as to threaten the safety of Mrs. Kelley, and thus failed to use the care owed by the store to its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">If Mrs. Kelley had not attempted to avoid the collision with the shopping carts and had been hit by them, there would have been a clear case for the jury to determine the issue of the store\u2019s negligence in causing the collision. Whether Mrs. Kelley\u2019s fall was caused by physical impact with the shopping carts or by her instinctive and natural movement to avoid the apparently impending collision, the negligence of the store is equally a question for the jury. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. George, 1941, 75 U.S.App.D.C. 73, 125 F.2d 739; Jennings v. Philadelphia, B. &amp; W. R. Co., 1907, 29 App.D.C. 219; Washington <em>&amp; G. </em>R. Co. v. Hickey, 1895, 5 App.D.C. 436, affirmed 1897, 166 U.S. 521, 17 S.Ct. 661, 41 L.Ed. 1101; Chalmers v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., 1937, 172 Md. 552, 192 A. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The defendant company, appellee herein, however, claims that even though it may have been negligent in the handling of its train of shopping carts, Mrs. Kelley was barred from recovery because her conduct amounted to contributory negligence as a matter of law. The testimony as to Mrs. Kelley\u2019s conduct in attempting to escape injury from a collision with the shopping carts was sufficient to support a finding that she had acted spontaneously in response to a normal impulse without opportunity for reflection. That such a response does not amount to contributory negligence as a matter of law is illustrated in several decisions. Chief Judge Sobeloff of the Maryland Court of Appeals, in reversing a directed verdict for the defendant, said: \u201cActs which, if done in calm deliberateness, might be judged negligent, may yet not be so regarded where done spontaneously in response to a normal impulse without adequate opportunity for reflection.\u201d Burkert v. Smith, 1953, 201 Md. 452, 458, 94 A.2d 460, 462. \u201cAn act done in the presence or under a reasonably well-founded apprehension of impending danger, for the purpose of escaping therefrom, may not, in the contemplation of law, constitute contributory negligence, though it may in fact have contributed to the production of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>injury complained of.\u201d Jennings v. Philadelphia, B. &amp; W. R. Co., supra, 29 App.D.C. at page 236. See also Wilmer v. Rittenhouse, 4 Cir., 1953, 209 F.2d 554, 556; Ward v. District of Columbia, 1905, 24 App.D.C. 524, 531-532; Washington &amp; G. R. Co. v. Hickey, 5 App.D.C. 436, 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Under the circumstances of this case we hold that the trial court did not err in excluding appellant\u2019s expert witness or in sustaining appellee\u2019s objections to appellant\u2019s interrogatories. Likewise, we agree with the trial court that appellee\u2019s maintenance of the curb was not shown to constitute actionable negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">For the reasons indicated above, the judgment of the District Court is vacated and the case remanded to it for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">WILBUR K.

Mrs. Mary Ellen Kelley (on Direct Examination)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">\u201cA. * * * As we reached the driveway, the pavement that goes into the driveway, I saw this chain of carts coming at me so quickly, and it frightened me so that I stepped aside and stubbed my toe against the curbing or something</p>\n<p id=\"AtV\">and fell over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">\u201cA. * * * we got to the end of the building and I saw these carts coming at me so terribly fast. I was afraid that they were going to hit me, and I stopped aside and hit my toe against the curbing. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">\u201cQ. Now, when you first saw the carts, how far away was the lead cart from you? A. Oh, very close to me. I wouldn\u2019t say more than four feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">\u201cQ. Did you notice the man pushing the carts? A. No, I just saw somebody there. I just saw the top, but I was so busy watching the carts that were coming so fast on me, that is all I looked at. I just watched those.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">\u201cQ. Could you describe for us how fast this man was pushing the train of carts ? A. I don\u2019t know how fast he was going. I know it seemed awfully \u2022fast, and I was so afraid he was going to hit me. I was so frightened and I thought of nothing else but getting out of his way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-17\">(On Cross Examination)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-18\">\u201cQ. When you got down here toward the corner of the building you could see this man coming along pushing the carts, couldn\u2019t you? A. Tes, I saw him coming just as I got to that opening, and he was coming so fast X was afraid he was going to hit me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-19\">\u201cQ. Mrs. Kelley, had the man passed you at the time you fell over the curbing? A. Oh, no, he was just coming right toward me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-20\">(On Redirect Examination)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-21\">\u201cQ. I understood you to testify earlier, in response <em>to one of </em>the questions Mr. Roberson put to you, that the man had passed you when you hit the ground. A. I don\u2019t know. I was so frightened, and I stepped aside just to get away from that rush of carts, lie was rushing them and after that I don\u2019t remember. I was in too much pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-23\">Mrs. Catherine O\u2019Connor, Appellant\u2019s Daughter (on Direct Examination)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-24\">\u201cQ. As you came to the parking lot tell us what happened. A. Well, as we came \u2014 we stayed close to the side of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>store there because that sidewalk slants a little and as we came to the end of the building there, my car was parked over on the next section and the boy had pushed my cart across and as I came around the side of the building there the Safeway attendant was pushing a long line of carts and he was pushing them quite fast. I stepped in and stepped over this curbing, and as I stepped over the curbing, which I had done\u2014 I just knew it was there \u2014 I had stepped over the curbing. As I stepped over, I thought, \u2018Well, my mother might not know that is there, and she might fall.\u2019 When I said, \u2018Look out\u2019 she had started falling. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">\u201cQ. Where was the man who was pushing these carts at that time? Will you describe that for us? A. Well, he was just coming down the lot right beside me and he was \u2014 there is an opening there and he was coming through that opening and it is narrow so, of course, we couldn\u2019t all get through there at the same time, so naturally I stepped to the side here and over this curb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">\u201cQ. Where were you with respect to the corner of the building shown in Exhibit 3 when you first observed this attendant pushing the train of carts? A. Well, you couldn\u2019t see him unless you were right on the corner there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">\u201cQ. Can you estimate for us the length of the train of carts that the attendant was pushing? A. I would say eight or ten feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">\u201cQ. Can you tell us the manner in which this attendant was pushing them? A. He was pushing them quite fast at that time of the evening. They usually do, but in this case he was pushing them fast. He wasn\u2019t running but he was pushing them fast.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">\u201cQ. And what time was this ? A. Just before 9:00. Just before the store closed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
