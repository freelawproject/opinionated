Excess Profits Taxes, \u00a7 474(a) (1) (A), the Tax Court rejected petitioner\u2019s attempt to utilize the earnings experience of these corporations in computing its excess profits tax credit. 30 T.C. 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">We agree with the Tax Court that petitioner was required by I.R.C. 1939, \u00a7 474(a) (1) (A) to acquire substantially all the properties of the selling corporations, not merely substantially all their income-producing properties, in order to qualify as a \u201cpurchasing corporation.\u201d Clearly \u00a7 474(c) (2) \u2014 which requires that the properties acquired be \u201csubstantially all of the properties (other than cash) which were used, or which in the ordinary course of business replaced properties used, by the selling corporation * * * in the production of the excess profits net income\u201d' \u2014 was intended to impose an additional limitation on the section\u2019s applicability, and not to limit the broad and general requirements of \u00a7 474(a) (1) (A). Moreover, we cannot accept petitioner\u2019s contention that it acquired prior to December 1, 1950, the properties which it leased from the three corporations on April 15, 1949. A mere lease of property from a corporation owning a greater interest is not the acquisition required by the statute. Daniels Buick, Inc. v. C. I. R., 6 Cir., 251 F.2d 528, 529. And from the terms of the leases and the fact that no purchase price was set for these properties until their subsequent formal sale in January 1952, we cannot accept petitioner\u2019s contention that the leasing of these properties was in substance itself a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">The Tax Court\u2019s lucid opinion below, 30 T.C. 996, amply answers petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
