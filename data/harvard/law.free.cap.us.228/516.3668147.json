Edwards \u2014 respectively, commenced actions in the Supreme Court of the District, against Edmund K. Fox and others to recover upon notes, given as part of the consideration on the purchase of a yacht'. The defense was interposed in each case that the sale was induced by fraudulent representations and that the plaintiff was not- an innocent holder in due course; so as to exclude the assertion of such defense. By order of the trial'court, the cases were tried together, before the same jury, the issues and the testimony being identical except as to the circumstances under which each plaintiff acquired the promissory note sued upon in the respective caces. A verdict was returned in each case for the defendants, whereupon the plaintiff prosecuted an appeal to the Court of Appeals. That court, after a hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ing upon the merits, sustained a motion to strike out the bill of exceptions, because not prepared in conformity to the rule on the subject, and while a motion for judgment because of the want of a bill of exceptions was pending below, we allowed rul\u00e9s to issue upon petitions filed on behalf of the plaintiffs below, directing the Court of Appeals, to show cause why it should not be commanded to reinstate the bill of exceptions in the cause in . the record thereof. The respondents answered, and, after detailing the facts, averred that the action of the court below complained of \u201c was- simply the. rightful and necessary enforcement by the court, of one of its rules, established in pursuance of the authority to that end conferred upon it by the act of Congress creating it and necessary to the due and proper discharge of the business before it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We deem it unnecessary to detail the contentions as to the compliance or non-compliance by counsel in the bills of exceptions referred t'O with the rule of court on the subject, nor do we think it necessary-to cofasider whether the rule warranted the particular exertion of power and if it did authorize such exertion of power,- whether it was amenable to condemnation. In view of the fact that the case .was heard below on the merits -and it was not until after such hearing that the court sustained the motion to strike out the bill of exceptions, we are of opinion that ther ease presented is not one \u201cwhere an inferior court refuses to take jurisdiction when by law it ought to do so, or where, having obtained jurisdiction, it refuses to. proceed in its exercise.\u201d <em>In re Parker, </em>131 U. S. 221. The court below, in effect, took jurisdiction, and its..action in striking out the bill of exceptions was at best but an error committed in the-exercise of its judicial-discretion, to correct which is the province of a writ of error wh\u00e9re the right to such writ obtains. <em>Ex parte Brown, </em>116 U.
