Accordingly, I would treat appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing as a motion for clarification and grant it. In doing so, I would present the following as clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">In its memorandum in support of motion for rehearing, appellant says, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">\u201cThe Kelleys Island Board of Education is today taking the unusual step of requesting rehearing because it finds it quite possible that at least one Justice voting with the majority in this 4-3 decision may not have realized that the Board of Education in fact <em>exceeded </em>the statutory m\u00ednimums of R.C. 3319.111.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">\u201cThe basic statutory m\u00ednimums of R.C. 3319.111 for teacher evaluation are simply this: that a teacher whose contract is expiring must be <em>evaluated </em>at least twice within certain time frames (R.C. 3319.111[A]) and <em>observed </em>at least four times \u2014 twice for each evaluation (R.C. 3319.111[B]).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">\u201cIn the present case, it is undisputed that these statutory m\u00ednimums were <em>exceeded </em>by the Kelleys Island Board of Education. Specifically, the Board\u2019s evaluator conducted four observations of the teacher (the statutory minimum) and provided <em>four </em>-written evaluation reports (two more than the statutory minimum). While these facts were recognized by the majority opinion, the conclusion drawn is that the Board violated a mandate for a \u2018two-to-one ratio\u2019 between observations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>and evaluations. In essence, the Board is faulted for doing its job <em>too </em>well, and providing the teacher more than the law requires in the way of written feedback.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic </em>and footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Clearly, appellant and all other persons likely situated are entitled to some clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In this case <em>(Farmer v. Kelleys Island Bd. of Edn. </em>[1994], 69 Ohio St.3d 156, 630 N.E.2d 721), I concurred in the majority opinion. At the time of the issuing of the opinion, I agreed with the result and I am still of the same mind now. However, upon further reflection and a more careful reading of both R.C. 3319.11 and 3319.111, I now find that I do not agree with Part I of the opinion (the issue of superintendent recommendation). Further, I now more readily understand appellant\u2019s \u201cevaluation\u201d argument as decided by Part II of the opinion. Appellant\u2019s position that it \u201cin fact exceeded the statutory m\u00ednimums of R.C. 3319.111\u201d is clearly arguable but maybe not technically correct, given that the statute is remedial in nature and, thus, entitled to a liberal interpretation. However, even if I changed my position with regard to the \u201cevaluation\u201d question, I would still concur -with the decision of the majority <em>and, </em>more specifically, the judgments of both the court of common pleas and the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Each of the two issues needs, at least from my standpoint, clarification. In clarifying these two issues, the third issue \u2014 that of remedy (reinstatement) resolves itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">\u201cEvaluation \u2014 Observation\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">Appellant-board\u2019s position is that it is being \u201cfaulted for doing its job too well.\u201d The confusion in this and companion cases arises because the terms \u201cevaluation\u201d and \u201cobservation\u201d are being used interchangeably when they are, in fact, clearly different. The statute, R.C. 3319.111(B)(2), requires two \u201cobservations\u201d for <em>each </em>of <em>two </em>required \u201cevaluations.\u201d R.C. 3319.111(A). It is true that Charles Hoffman, the board-chosen individual who evaluated appellee, observed appellee on four separate occasions \u2014 October 10, 1990, January 22, 1991, March 12, 1991 and March 22, 1991. In reporting his findings, Hoffman issued what he labeled \u201cevaluations\u201d after each of his \u201cobservations.\u201d The October 10,1990 \u201cevaluation\u201d was based <em>solely </em>on the same day (October 10, 1990) \u201cobservation.\u201d The same was true for the January 22, 1991 \u201cevaluation,\u201d which never even referred to the October 10, 1990 \u201cevaluation-observation.\u201d This j apparent violation of R.C. 3319.111(A) and (B) led the trial court, the court of appeals and this court to the conclusion that there were not <em>two </em>observations and <em>one </em>evaluation received by appellee by the then-magic date of February 10, 1991 (former R.C. 3319.111[A]). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>This same sequence is also true for the second evaluation, which was due by April 10, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">Obviously, this reading of the statutes can be attacked as technical. Conversely, the argument is made that the statutes are clear and precise and should be followed. Added to this latter argument is the liberal-interpretation requirement. It is on the basis that the statute was not precisely followed that I concurred with the majority in Part II of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Accordingly, the board was not being \u201cfaulted for doing its job too well.\u201d The board was being faulted for not following the precise dictates of the statute, to wit, two observations for each of two required evaluations. The sentence in <em>Farmer, supra, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 159, 630 N.E.2d at 723, that \u201c[t]he statute, therefore, requires a two-to-one ratio of observations to written evaluations,\u201d means, I believe, that the minimum statutory requirements are at least two evaluations based upon two observations for each of the evaluations and any <em>additional </em>evaluations need not comply with the two-observation rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Superintendent Recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The second issue is where I part ways with both the appellant-board and Part I of the majority opinion in <em>Farmer. </em>Appellant and the majority opinion point out that the superintendent\u2019s <em>recommendation </em>that appellee\u2019s contract be <em>renewed </em>is of no significance. I now emphatically disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">In support of their position, the board and majority cite <em>Justus v. Brown </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 53, 71 O.O.2d 35, 325 N.E.2d 884, paragraph one of the syllabus. That case holds that it is a board of education that has the authority to employ teachers. Thus, the argument goes, it makes no difference what a superintendent recommends, since the sole and ultimate power on the question of teacher reemployment lies with the board. <em>Justus </em>did hold just that and that <em>was </em>the law \u2014 in 1975. Today, things are different because now the General Assembly has specifically spoken on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">In 1961, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 227 was enacted by the General Assembly. The bill was signed by the Governor and became effective October 17, 1961. (129 Ohio Laws 1207.) Among the amendments to R.C. 3319.11, the General Assembly amended a paragraph which relates to <em>limited </em>contracts for teachers. The amended paragraph changed the then-existing 1959 law (R.C. 3319.11) by adding certain language. In part, the paragraph, with the language <em>added </em>being designated by emphasis, follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">\u201cAny teacher employed under a limited contract, <em>and not eligible to be considered for a continuing contract, </em>is, at the expiration of such limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>contract, deemed re-employed <em>under the provisions of this section </em>at the same salary plus an increment provided by the salary schedule unless the employing board, <em>acting on the superintendent\u2019s recommendation as to whether or not the teacher should be re-employed, </em>gives such teacher written notice of its intention not to re-employ him on or before the thirtieth day of April. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">In 1988, effective July 1, 1989, the General Assembly again amended R.C. 3319.11. (142 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3356-3363.) Extensive revisions were contained in Am.Sub.H.B. No. 330. The law substantially changed R.C. 3319.11 and included changes which divided the section (R.C. 3319.11) into lettered and numbered divisions. The parts of R.C. 3319.11 which pertain to <em>limited </em>contracts became R.C. 3319.11(N).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">For purposes of comparison with the portion of the 1961 law quoted above, I now quote the same portion of the 1989 law (R.C. 3319.11[E]) as it appeared in Am.Sub.H.B. No. 330. The emphasized material is that which has been added; the language deleted by the General Assembly is noted by a strike-through.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">\u201cAny teacher employed under a limited contract, and not eligible to be considered for a continuing contract, is, at the expiration of such limited contract, deemed re-employed under the provisions of this section <em>division </em>at the same salary plus any increment provided by the salary schedule unless <em>evaluation procedures have been complied with pursuant to division (A) of section 3319.111 of the Revised Code and </em>the employing board, acting on <em>upon </em>the superintendent\u2019s <em>written </em>recommendation as to whether-or -not <em>that </em>the teacher should <em>not </em>be re-employed, gives such teacher written notice of its intention not to re-employ him on or before the thirtieth day of April. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Several things become immediately apparent when the 1989 law is compared with previous pronouncements of the General Assembly on this specific subject and, in particular, the 1961 law which was amended by the 1989 law.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">As previously indicated, in the 1989 revision, the General Assembly divided R.C. 3319.11 into lettered and numbered parts. The part pertaining to limited contracts is now known as R.C. 3319.11(N). The subsequent changes to be discussed below are in division \u201c(E)\u201d itself. The first is the striking of the word \u201csection\u201d and substituting therefor the word \u201cdivision.\u201d This change is important because division \u201c(E)\u201d is now a self-contained unit \u2014 that is, no reference to any other section or division is necessary or permitted to glean the intention of the General Assembly on the subject discussed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">Next, the General Assembly added language concerning \u201cevaluation procedures\u201d and I have already discussed the effect of this language in Part I of this clarification. Incidentally, \u201cevaluation procedure\u201d language was also added to R.C. 3319.11(A), (B)(2), (C)(3), (D) and (G)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>Then, the legislative body did something else in division (E). In providing for a superintendent\u2019s recommendation, it amended the phrase \u201cacting on the superintendent\u2019s recommendation as to whether or not the teacher should be reemployed\u201d to now read: \u201cacting upon the superintendent\u2019s written recommendation that the teacher <em>not be re-employed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">Accordingly, before a board can decide that a teacher employed under a limited contract is not to be reemployed, two conditions precedent must exist. First, evaluation procedures must have been complied with, <em>and </em>second the board must have a written recommendation of the superintendent that the teacher <em>not </em>be reemployed. In this case <em>(Farmer), </em>Superintendent Richard Acierto recommended that Farmer\u2019s contract <em>be </em>renewed; thus, there was <em>no </em>recommendation of the superintendent (as required by the statute) <em>not </em>to renew.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">This may come as a surprise to many of us, but it <em>is </em>what the law says. I anticipate two arguments against this reading of the statute. First, the case of <em>Justus v. Brown, supra, </em>will be cited for the proposition that the school board has the ultimate authority to hire and fire teachers \u2014 a concept with which I personally agree. However, in <em>1975, </em>when <em>Justus </em>was decided, the current R.C. 3319.-11(E) was not in existence. Thus, <em>Justus </em>could not have decided the law as it exists today.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Second, I anticipate the argument that the General Assembly just could not have meant what it said. There are three answers to this argument. First, it makes no difference what the General Assembly meant to say. It is what it said that this court must apply. Second, given the legislative history of R.C. 3319.11 from 1953, 1959, 1961 and now 1989, I do not believe there was any mistake. Third, and most important, if the General Assembly had wanted to give a school board veto power over a superintendent\u2019s recommendation to renew a limited-contract teacher, it certainly knew how to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">R.C. 3319.11(B)(1) states, in part, that \u201c[u]pon the recommendation of the superintendent that a teacher eligible for continuing service .status be reemployed, a continuing contract shall be entered into between the board and the teacher <em>unless the board by a three-fourths vote of its full membership rejects the recommendation of the superintendent.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 3319.11(C)(3) states, in part, that \u201c[a] board of education <em>shall not reject </em>a superintendent\u2019s recommendation, made pursuant to division (C)(1) of this section, of an extended limited contract for a term not to exceed two years <em>except by a three-fourths vote of its full membership.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Division (E) of R.C. 3319.11, the <em>division </em>we are dealing with, has <em>no </em>such language, and in fact division (E) says that these specific matters are to be determined \u201cunder the provisions of this <em>division.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, this case should have been over after a determination was made pursuant to R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>3319.11(E) (the superintendent-recommendation provision). Appellee Farmer was entitled to her contract and the evaluation procedures of R.C. 3319.111(A) and (B) would never have come into play. Farmer was entitled to reinstatement and back pay and the majority opinion is correct in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Remedy Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Much is made in this and the companion cases concerning the remedy issue. The school boards involved, <em>amicus curiae </em>Ohio School Boards Association, and the dissents in this case and <em>Naylor v. Cardinal Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 162, 630 N.E.2d 725, point out that even if there was an error concerning \u201cevaluation-observation,\u201d the remedy is not reinstatement. The dissents conclude that R.C. 3319.11(G)(7) permits reinstatement <em>only </em>when there is a violation of R.C. 3319.111(A). The argument is that the violation in these cases was noncompliance with R.C. 3319.111(8) and, therefore, by the specific terms of R.C. 3319.11(G)(7), there is to be no reinstatement. This argument fails for at least three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">First, R.C. 3319.111(A) says that a board \u201cshall evaluate such a teacher in compliance with the requirements of this <em>section.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The <em>section, </em>as we have seen, means all of R.C. 3319.111 \u2014 not just part of it. This, of course, includes <em>division </em>(B) of R.C. 3319.111.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Second, the first paragraph of R.C. 3319.11(G)(7) (before we ever examine the second paragraph which contains the reference to division \u201c[A]\u201d of R.C. 3319.111) states that \u201c[a] teacher may appeal * * * on the grounds that the board has not complied with the provisions of section * * * 3319.111 * * * of the Revised Code.\u201d In the clause providing for appeal, there is <em>no </em>reference to division \u201c(A)\u201d or \u201c(B)\u201d of R.C. 3319.111!</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">Third, and most importantly, the dissents overlook R.C. 3319.11(A)(1), which specifically incorporates division \u201c(B)\u201d of R.C. 3319.111 into the term \u201cevaluation procedures\u201d \u2014 the very term (evaluation) used in R.C. 3319.111(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">For the reasons set forth herein, I would convert appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing to one for clarification. I would then grant the motion for clarification and clarify our holding in <em>Farmer </em>in accordance with the foregoing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b808-14\">A.W. Sweeney, Wright, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b809-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>Moyer, C.J., and Deshler, J., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b809-4\">Dana A.

I concur in the substance of Part I of Justice Douglas\u2019s clarification regarding the ratio of observations to evaluations that the statute contemplates. Because I still believe, however, that only a violation of R.C. 3319.111(A), but not of R.C. 3319.111(B), is a ground for reinstatement, I continue to dissent as to the result reached by the court. Furthermore, Parts II and III of the clarification go beyond the scope of the issue raised in appellant\u2019s motion. They should therefore be considered dicta only, and I express no opinion as to them.</p>\n<judges id=\"b809-6\">Deshler, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
