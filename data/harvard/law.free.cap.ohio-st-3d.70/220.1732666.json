Douglas, </em>Assistant Director of Law, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-13\"><em>Lee I. Fisher, </em>Attorney General, and <em>Robert J.

No insurer or other person is entitled to bring an action under a subrogation provision in an insurance or other contract against a political subdivision with respect to such benefits. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">The department\u2019s right of subrogation arises from R.C. 5101.58, which in relevant part states: \u201cThe acceptance of aid * * * gives a right of subrogation to the department of human services and the department of human services of any county against the liability of a third party for the cost of medical services and care arising out of injury, disease, or disability of the recipient. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">The department argues that its statutory right of subrogation prevails over Cleveland\u2019s right of setoff and, therefore, payment should be made by Cleveland to the department to the extent that the department made medical payments to Galanos. The department seizes on the second sentence of R.C. 2744.05(B), arguing that it is not an \u201cinsurer\u201d or \u201cother person\u201d and therefore cannot be bound by the antisubrogation provisions of the statute. This argument ignores the meaning and purpose of R.C. 2744.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">The purpose of R.C. 2744.05(B) is to permit recovery by injured persons for torts committed by political subdivisions while at the same time conserving the fiscal resources of those political entities. <em>Menefee v. Queen City Metro </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 27, 550 N.E.2d 181. The statute expressly states that its provisions apply \u201c[notwithstanding any other provisions of the Revised Code * * In circumstances such as this, the financial burden must ultimately fall on either the state or a political subdivision of the state. The purpose and language of R.C. 2744.05 evidences a legislative intent to place that burden on the state and not the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>We are further unpersuaded by the department\u2019s narrow interpretation of the phrase \u201cor other person.\u201d The department maintains that it is not an insurer or other person and, therefore, R.C. 2744.05 does not apply to it. The word \u201cperson\u201d must be read in light of the language and purpose of the statute. As a general rule of construction, \u201cperson\u201d is defined in its broad sense and is not confined to a living being. R.C. 1.59. Including the department in the definition of \u201cperson\u201d is consistent with the language used in the first sentence of R.C. 2744.05(B), which speaks in terms of compensation from insurance \u201cor any other source.\u201d Any other source would clearly include Medicaid. Therefore, to hold that the department is not included as a person would render the statute internally inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Furthermore, we are persuaded that Medicaid benefits are the type of collateral source benefits contemplated by R.C. 2744.05(B). In <em>Vogel v. Wells </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 91, 566 N.E.2d 154, we held that funds received from the Social Security Administration are benefits under R.C. 2744.05(B). We defined \u201cbenefits\u201d to include \u201c \u2018[financial assistance received in time of sickness, disability, unemployment, etc. either from insurance or public programs such as social security.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 566 N.E.2d at 161, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 158. Medicaid is a benefit received as part of a public program, and is, therefore, subject to the antisubrogation provisions of R.C. 2744.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Since R.C. 2744.05(B) is applicable to this action, Galanos has no right to receive that portion of her judgment associated with the collateral source payments. Consequently, under the general principle that a subrogee cannot succeed to a right not possessed by its subrogor, the department has no right to which it may be subrogated. <em>Chemtrol Adhesives, Inc. v. Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 40, 537 N.E.2d 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-9\">A.W. Sweeney, Wright, Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b340-10\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b340-11\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
