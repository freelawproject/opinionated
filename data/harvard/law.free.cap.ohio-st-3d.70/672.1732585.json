Claimant poses two challenges to the circumstances preceding the commission\u2019s final order. Claimant initially asserts a due process violation based on allegedly <em>ex parte </em>communications between CSOE and the commission. Claimant\u2019s argument fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">First, the record does not identify the extent, if any, to which <em>ex parte </em>communications actually took place. Because the claimant was already on notice as to the disposition of his application after the first denial order issued, the only relevant time frame for examining any <em>ex parte </em>contact is the period between the first hearing and the first denial. The record, however, provides an incomplete picture of events therein. It is known only that on September 3, 1991, CSOE, \u201cpursuant to your [the commission\u2019s] request from our August 22, 1991 hearing,\u201d tendered a proposed denial order. Unfortunately, the parties disagree as to whether the permanent total disability denial and draft request were announced at the permanent total disability hearing. Thus, the extent to which CSOE\u2019s submission of the order was unknown to claimant is not revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">Second, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that <em>ex parte </em>communication occurred, it does not automatically constitute a due process violation. As stated in <em>Southwest Sunsites, Inc. v. Fed. Trade Comm. </em>(C.A.9, 1986), 785 F.2d 1431, 1436-1437:</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">\u201cEx parte communications do not void an agency decision.\u201d <em>PATCO v. FLRA, </em>685 F.2d 547 (D.C.Cir.1982). \u201cThe agency decision is voidable and the court will consider whether \u2018the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process was irrevocably tainted so as to make the ultimate judgment of the agency unfair, either to an innocent party or to the public interest that the agency is obliged to protect.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 564. Relevant considerations are the gravity of the <em>ex parte </em>communication, whether the communication may have influenced the decision, whether the party making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>the communication benefited from the decision, whether opposing parties knew of the communication and had an opportunity to rebut, and whether vacation and remand of the decision would serve a useful purpose. <em>Id. </em>The court is concerned primarily with the integrity of the process and the fairness of the result rather than adherence to mechanistic rules. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s allegation must overcome a presumption of honesty and integrity on the part of the Commission, and thus a presumption that the decision rests on proper grounds. <em>Porter County Chapter v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em>606 F.2d 1363, 1371 (Cir.D.C.1979).\u201d See, also, <em>Withrow v. Larkin </em>(1975), 421 U.S. 35, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 43 L.Ed.2d 712; <em>Haller v. Robbins </em>(C.A.1, 1969), 409 F.2d 857; <em>North Carolina v. Environmental Policy Inst. </em>(C.A.4, 1989), 881 F.2d 1250; <em>Massman Constr. Co. v. Tennessee Valley Auth. </em>(C.A.6, 1985), 769 F.2d 1114; <em>Verdin v. O\u2019Leary </em>(C.A.7, 1992), 972 F.2d 1467; <em>United States v. Frazin </em>(C.A.9, 1986), 780 F.2d 1461.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">We employed similar reasoning in <em>In re Investigation of Natl. Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 81, 609 N.E.2d 156. Rejecting a constitutional claim arising out of alleged <em>ex parte </em>communications, we wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">\u201cIncumbent upon National Union was the burden to overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity affording those serving as adjudicators. <em>Withrow v. Larkin </em>(1975), 421 U.S. 35, 47, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 1464, 43 L.Ed.2d 712, 723. In the absence of such proof and taking the administrative process as a whole, we are unable to agree with National Union that such <em>ex parte </em>communications, standing alone, violated its right to due process.\u201d Id., 66 Ohio St.3d at 88, 609 N.E.2d at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">In this case, claimant has neither established that the commission\u2019s decision to deny permanent total disability was influenced by <em>ex parte </em>contact nor has it overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that attaches to the commission\u2019s deliberations and decisions. Accordingly, claimant\u2019s due process argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Claimant also attacks the commission\u2019s adoption of an order written by CSOE. Claimant, however, cites no authority that requires that an order be personally written by one of the voting commissioners. So long as the order reflects the reasoning of the commission gained by the commission\u2019s meaningful review of the evidence \u2014 as <em>State ex rel Ormet Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 102, 561 N.E.2d 920, demands \u2014 authorship is not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Claimant\u2019s reliance on <em>Logue v. Wilson </em>(1975), 45 Ohio App.2d 132, 74 O.O.2d 140, 341 N.E.2d 641, is misplaced. <em>Logue </em>prohibits a court from adopting and entering judgment on a referee\u2019s report that does not state the basis of its findings and recommendation. Such a deficient report forecloses independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>judicial evaluation, and the adoption of such a report, the court held, equated to judicial rubber-stamping.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The present case is distinguishable in two respects. First, unlike the judge in <em>Logue, </em>the decision-maker in this ease attended the evidentiary hearing. The commission was not, therefore, dependent on another\u2019s assimilation of the evidence. Second, the proposed order in the instant case did not lack written findings in support. To the contrary, the CSOE draft contained extensive findings that the commission was free to either accept or reject upon independent evidentiary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Claimant also challenges the commission\u2019s reliance on the ARS vocational report. The commission, however, is the exclusive evaluator of evidentiary weight and credibility. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. It was the commission\u2019s prerogative to find the ARS report more persuasive than that of Baxter Sportmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Claimant\u2019s challenge, despite his protestations to the contrary, simply reflects, in our view, claimant\u2019s disagreement with the report\u2019s characterization of his medical profile. For example, while claimant viewed his age, education and work history as impediments to reemployment, ARS disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Claimant also accuses ARS of improperly evaluating a \u201ctheoretical individual\u201d rather than claimant. This assertion is based on ARS\u2019s evaluation of claimant\u2019s nonmedical data without actually examining claimant. However, with one exception, claimant does not allege that any of the data evaluated was inaccurate. Moreover, that the evaluator allegedly misunderstood claimant\u2019s most recent job duties is immaterial, since the employer does not dispute the medical consensus that claimant cannot return to that job.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">To invalidate the ARS report under claimant\u2019s theory would in effect be to hold that any report that is not based on personal examination cannot constitute \u201csome evidence.\u201d Such a ruling would conflict with <em>State ex rel. Wallace v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 55, 11 O.O.3d 216, 386 N.E.2d 1109, <em>State ex rel. Teece v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 165, 22 O.O.3d 400, 429 N.E.2d 433, and <em>State ex rel. Paragon v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 72, 5 OBR 127, 448 N.E.2d 1372, all of which have approved the evidentiary validity of reports issued by nonexamining physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Claimant alleges that the ARS report did not consider the effect of his pain on his ability to work. The ARS report, however, was directed primarily at claimant\u2019s %oranedical capabilities. The three physicians\u2019 reports on which the commission relied all acknowledged claimant\u2019s complaints of pain. Thus, pain was factored into the overall analysis of permanent total disability. We accordingly find that the ARS report was \u201csome evidence\u201d on which the commission could rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Claimant lastly complains of the lack of written commission guidelines on permanent total disability evaluations. However, as we have previously held, the lack of guidelines is insufficient to invalidate the commission\u2019s order. <em>State ex rel. Blake v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 453, 605 N.E.2d 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b795-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Wright, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b795-9\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
