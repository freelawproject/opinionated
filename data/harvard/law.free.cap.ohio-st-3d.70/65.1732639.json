Westchester Estates, Inc. v. Bacon </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 42, 15 O.O.3d 53, 399 N.E.2d 81, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">Carter based his entitlement to the requested relief on R.C. 2967.18(A), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>\u201cWhenever the director of rehabilitation and correction determines that the total population of state penal or reformatory institutions </em>for males and females, the total population of the state penal or reformatory institutions for males, or the total population of the state penal or reformatory institutions for females <em>exceeds the capacity of those institutions and that an overcrowding emergency exists, he shall notify the correctional institution inspection committee of the emergency and provide the committee with information in support of his determination. </em>The director shall not notify the committee that an overcrowding emergency exists unless he determines that no other reasonable method is available to resolve the overcrowding emergency.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The remainder of R.C. 2967.18 provides the procedures to be followed after respondent\u2019s determination and notification, ultimately leading to possible sentence reduction or early release due to the overcrowding emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u201cIn construing a statute, a court\u2019s paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute. * * * In determining legislative intent, the court first looks to the language in the statute and the purpose to be accomplished.\u201d <em>State v. S.R. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 590, 594-595, 589 N.E.2d 1319, 1323. Words used in a statute must be taken in their usual, normal or customary meaning. R.C. 1.42. It is the duty of the court to give effect to the words used and not to insert words not used. <em>State ex rel. Cassels v. Dayton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 217, 220, 631 N.E.2d 150, 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Carter contends that R.C. 2967.18 places a mandatory duty on respondent to declare that an overcrowding emergency exists and notify the correctional institution inspection committee of the emergency whenever respondent has knowledge of overcrowding. However, Carter\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 2967.18 would insert the phrase \u201cwhenever the director of rehabilitation and correction <em>becomes aware </em>\u201d for the phrase \u201c[wjhenever the director of rehabilitation and correction determines.\u201d If the General Assembly had intended the foregoing, it could have so provided. However, the General Assembly conditioned respondent\u2019s duty of declaration and notification of an overcrowding emergency on <em>whenever </em>he determines that this emergency exists. R.C. 2967.18(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Further, Carter\u2019s unsupported conclusions in his complaint are not considered admitted and are insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Hickman v. Capots </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 324, 544 N.E.2d 639 (inmate required to plead specific facts on claimed exception to general rule concerning parole revocation to avoid dismissal); cf., also, <em>Hammond v. Dallman </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 666, 668, 590 N.E.2d 744, 746. Carter\u2019s \u201cSTATEMENT OF FACTS\u201d in his complaint stated only that the Ohio prison system was \u201ccurrently overcrowded.\u201d R.C. 2967.18(A) requires more than mere overcrowding; it requires an overcrowding emergency <em>and </em>no other reasonable alternative method available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>to resolve the overcrowding emergency before respondent notifies the committee. Carter\u2019s complaint failed to allege even unsupported conclusions in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing Carter\u2019s mandamus complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
