SHV contends, to the contrary, that R.C. 5733.05(A)(4) allows an exclusion for any recorded appreciation, without taking into consideration those other accounts which reflect losses; and that the statute does not require the \u201cnetting\u201d of accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>We agree with SHY that it is unnecessary to interpret the word \u201cappreciation\u201d to include \u201cnegative appreciation,\u201d and that it is unreasonable and unlawful to add to the statute words not employed by the General Assembly therein. <em>Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Porterfield </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 24, 28, 53 O.O.2d 13, 15, 263 N.E.2d 249, 251; <em>Storer Communications, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 193, 194, 525 N.E.2d 466, 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The commissioner\u2019s reliance upon state income tax cases which deal with \u201cnetting\u201d of value is not appropriate. A company in preparing its franchise tax return on the net worth basis is bound by its books if they are kept according to sound and generally recognized and approved accounting methods. SHV kept separate accounts of its investments in each of its six subsidiaries without netting them, and this practice, according to the evidence, is a sound and generally recognized and approved accounting method. See <em>Gray Horse, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 631, 633, 614 N.E.2d 1038, 1039. Thus, the BTA properly accepted the values as reflected by SHV\u2019s books because SHV reported the appreciation in its franchise tax return as it had on its corporate books.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Accordingly, the decision of the BTA is neither unreasonable nor unlawful, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b515-9\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
