Specifically, we are asked to determine whether a person can be found in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) and (3) where the person is found intoxicated and in the driver\u2019s seat of a parked vehicle with the ignition key in the ignition and the vehicle\u2019s engine not running.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) and (3) provide: \u201cNo person shall <em>operate </em>any vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley within this state, if any of the following apply: (1) The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse; * * *. (3) The person has a concentration of ten-hundredths of one gram or more by weight of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of his breath[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">In <em>State v. Cleary </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 198, 22 OBR 351, 490 N.E.2d 574, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus, this court held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">\u201c1. Operation of a motor vehicle within the contemplation of R.C. 4511.19(A) is a broader term than driving and <em>a person in the driver\u2019s position in the front seat of the vehicle with the key in the ignition while under the influence of alcohol </em>or any drug of abuse <em>can be found in violation of the statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u201c2. Entering a motor vehicle, putting the key in the ignition and starting and engaging the engine in a stationary position are sufficient acts to constitute operation within the meaning of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In <em>Cleary, </em>the defendant had parked his automobile in the parking lot of a Ring Kwik store. He was found asleep in the driver\u2019s seat with the motor running. We held that the defendant\u2019s conduct was proscribed by R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) and stated that:</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u201cWhile this section deals with the prohibition against driving while under the influence and much of the literature and discussion on the subject refer to \u2018driving,\u2019 that word and \u2018operating\u2019 are not synonymous. This statute has been reviewed and amended over the years and the General Assembly continues to adhere to the word \u2018operate.\u2019 Therefore, the prohibition contained in the statute is against \u2018operating\u2019 a vehicle while under the influence, not merely \u2018driving\u2019 it. The term \u2018operating\u2019 encompasses a broader category of activities involving motor vehicles than does \u2018driving.\u2019 Many jurisdictions have found that a person may operate a vehicle even though the vehicle is not moving. <em>Operation of a motor vehicle within the contemplation of the statute is a broader term than mere driving and a person in the driver\u2019s position in the front seat with the ignition key in his possession indicating either his actual or potential movement of the vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or any drug of abuse can be found in violation of R.C. Ip511.19(A)(l).\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 199, 22 OBR at 352, 490 N.E.2d at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Similarly, in <em>State v. McGlone </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 122, 570 N.E.2d 1115, syllabus, we held that \u201c[a]n intoxicated person who is in the driver\u2019s seat of a motor vehicle parked on private or public property with the key in the ignition <em>is operating the vehicle </em>in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1).\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant in <em>McGlone </em>was found asleep behind the wheel of his car with the motor running in a driveway of a private residence. We concluded that the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and reasoned that: \u201cR.C. 4511.19 is not only directed to those who drive on public streets. It prohibits the operation of a motor vehicle anywhere in the state while the driver is under the influence of drugs or alcohol. We agree with the dissent\u2019s observation in the court of appeals that: \u2018[i]f you are under the influence [of alcohol or drugs], don\u2019t drive or put yourself in a position of control of a vehicle. If you do, you pay the penalty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 570 N.E.2d at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Gill (case No. 93-1098) and Robinson (case No. 94-38) propose that <em>Cleary </em>and <em>McGlone </em>are distinguishable from their situations in that the defendants in <em>Cleary </em>and <em>McGlone </em>were found in their vehicles with the engines running. Gill and Robinson suggest that such a distinction is critical and, based on the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the engines to their vehicles had not been started, they could not have violated R.C. 4511.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Gill and Robinson have applied an improper reading of <em>Cleary </em>and <em>McGlone. </em>Those decisions were intended to establish that if a person is found intoxicated in the driver\u2019s seat of a parked vehicle with the ignition key in the ignition, the person is guilty of violating the statute. Our holdings in <em>Cleary </em>and <em>McGlone </em>were never intended to require the state to prove that the defendant had started the vehicle\u2019s engine after consuming alcohol or that the engine was running at the time the defendant is apprehended. A clear purpose of R.C. 4511.19 is to discourage persons from putting themselves in the position in which they can potentially cause the movement of a motor vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of any drug of abuse. Accord <em>Cleary </em>and <em>McGlone, supra. </em>Prohibition of potentially harmful conduct need not await occurrence of the act. As we, in effect, held in <em>Cleary, </em>the intent of the legislature in enacting strong legislation involving drinking and driving was to say, \u201cIf you drink \u2014 do not drive. If you drive \u2014 do not drink!\u201d The cases from this court on the subject have, for good reason, carried out this legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The gravity of the problem of driving while intoxicated is revealed by the number of needless tragic injuries and deaths that occur annually on the roadways in this state. Accordingly, we hold that a person who is in the driver\u2019s seat of a motor vehicle with the ignition key in the ignition and who, in his or her body has a prohibited concentration of alcohol, is \u201coperating\u201d the vehicle within the meaning of R.C. 4511.19 whether or not the engine of the vehicle is running.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Turning to the specific cases before us, it makes no difference that the engines of the motor vehicles were not running. In each case, the defendant was intoxicated and in the driver\u2019s seat of his vehicle with the key in the ignition. That being so, Gill and Robinson were in violation of the statute. <em>Cleary </em>and <em>McGlone, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">As a final matter, Gill (case No. 93-1098) contends that the officers did not have sufficient articulable facts to justify an investigative inquiry and to eventually arrest him. Although this issue was raised in the court of appeals, the appellate court found that the issue was moot, given its determination that Gill was not operating his vehicle within the meaning of the statute. However, given our findings <em>supra, </em>it is appropriate for us to now consider this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">We find that the trial court did not err in determining that the officers, under the circumstances, were warranted in investigating the situation and, based on their investigation, in arresting Gill. The record supports such a conclusion. While on foot patrol at approximately 1:00 a.m. in an Ohio State University parking lot, the officers noticed a vehicle parked with its headlights lit,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the radio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>on and Gill asleep in the driver\u2019s seat. The officers also noticed a strong odor of alcohol emanating from Gill. He was awakened, given a variety of field sobriety tests and then arrested. Under these circumstances, the officers\u2019 initial investigation was reasonable and the arrest proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Based on the foregoing, in case No. 93-1098, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in case No. 94-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\n<em>Judgments accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b273-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Reader and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b273-9\">Wright and Pfeifer, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b273-10\">W.

The result in this case illustrates that this court has gone too far in defining what constitutes operation of a motor vehicle for purposes of Ohio\u2019s drunk driving statute. Here, Bradley Gill did drink too much \u2014 but that in itself is not a crime. His actions after drinking too much were responsible, and there is room under R.C. 4511.19 for someone who acts responsibly to avoid being charged with a crime. There is not enough room under R.C. 4511.19, especially given our rules of statutory construction of criminal laws, to allow for the summary conviction of a person for dozing in a parked car.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\"><em>\u201cGenerally, each \u2018drunken driving\u2019 case is to be decided on its own particular and peculiar facts.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.) Mentor v. Giordano </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 140, 146, 38 O.O.2d 366, 370, 224 N.E.2d 343, 348. The majority\u2019s decision moves Ohio law further away from that seemingly unassailable statement. The majority creates an irrebuttable presumption that if a person is found in the driver\u2019s seat of an automobile with the key in the ignition, <em>but the motor is not running, </em>that person violates R.C. 4511.19(A)(3). Such evidence should create, at most, a rebuttable presumption that a person is operating a vehicle in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">This court recognized that the question of operation is a matter for the trier of fact, even if the automobile\u2019s motor is running, in <em>State v. Cleary </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 198, 22 OBR 351, 490 N.E.2d 574, when it held, in paragraph one of the syllabus, that \u201ca person in the driver\u2019s position in the front seat of the vehicle with the key in the ignition while under the influence of alcohol or any drug of abuse <em>can be </em>found in violation of the statute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the <em>Cleary </em>court did not state that such factors <em>must </em>yield a conviction, but only that they <em>can </em>do so. In the second paragraph of the syllabus of <em>Cleary, </em>this court held that \u201c[ejntering a motor vehicle, putting the key in the ignition and starting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>and engaging the engine in a stationary position <em>are sufficient acts to constitute operation </em>within the meaning of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Again, this court recognized that such evidence was <em>sufficient </em>to support a conviction, but stopped well short of holding that such evidence compels a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Only in <em>State v. McGlone </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 122, 570 N.E.2d 1115, syllabus, did this court adopt, possibly mistakenly, what is essentially an irrebuttable presumption that \u201c[a]n intoxicated person who is in the driver\u2019s seat of a motor vehicle parked on private or public property with the key in the ignition is operating the vehicle in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1).\u201d <em>McGlone </em>concerned basically the same facts as <em>Cleary </em>\u2014 a sleeping, intoxicated driver in a vehicle with its motor running \u2014 except that it took place on private property. Instead of simply expanding <em>Cleary </em>to apply to similar instances which occur on private property, the very short <em>McGlone </em>opinion, which cites only <em>Cleary </em>as authority, perhaps inadvertantly makes the overbroad statement that the majority feels bound by in this case. <em>McGlone </em>should be modified to be consistent with <em>Cleary, </em>and to hold that such acts are sufficient evidence to support a conviction under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">This court should not lose sight of the intent of Ohio\u2019s drunk driving statutes. They are at heart quite clearly designed to keep the state\u2019s roadways safe from intoxicated drivers. As this court held in <em>Giordano:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u201cThe primary purpose of statutes and ordinances making it an offense to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence <em>of </em>intoxicating liquor is to protect the users of streets and highways from the hazard of vehicles under the management of persons who have consumed alcoholic beverages to such an extent as to appreciably impair their faculties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The majority makes the oft-repeated statement that \u201coperation of a motor vehicle within the contemplation of the statute is a broader term than mere driving.\u201d This court has never defined, however, how broad the term \u201coperation\u201d is or what factors should be considered to determine its breadth. Since the obvious intent of the statute is to keep intoxicated drivers off the roadway, the definition of \u201coperation\u201d ought to reflect that. For purposes of the statute, operating a motor vehicle should include driving, attempting to drive, or possessing an immediate intent to drive a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Consistent with <em>Cleary, </em>evidence of a key in the ignition with the motor running could certainly be sufficient to prove operation, <em>e.g., </em>that the person did drive or possessed an immediate intent to drive the motor vehicle. A key in the ignition should rise to the level of a rebuttable presumption of operation. Other factors relevant to operation could include whether the motor is running, whether the person is asleep or awake, and the location of the vehicle, including all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>circumstances relating to how it arrived there. See <em>Hiegel v. State </em>(Ind.App. 1989), 538 N.E.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Triers of fact should have determined the question of operation in both of these companion cases. Bradley Gill did have his key in the ignition of his car. However, he was asleep behind the wheel, his motor was not running, and the automobile was in the same place he had parked it before he visited the bars in the area. Gill was with friends, and it is possible that they could have testified that he returned to the car to sleep and to wait for the designated driver in the group to drive him home.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Noble Robinson was also found intoxicated with his key in the ignition of his vehicle. He was asleep and his motor was not running. There was no evidence which corroborated Robinson\u2019s claim that he was sober when he drove into Secor Metropark.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The outcomes of these two cases might be quite different from each other were they to go to juries. Certainly each defendant deserves the chance to rebut the presumption that he either was driving while intoxicated or had the immediate intent to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">As we interpret drunk driving statutes, we must keep in mind that we are interpreting <em>criminal </em>statutes. The rule of statutory construction is that criminal statutes shall be construed against the state and liberally construed in favor of the accused. R.C. 2901.04(A). Certainly, the majority does not follow that statutory mandate. Also, \u201c[a] criminal statute must be sufficiently definite to give notice of the required conduct to one who would avoid its penalties * * <em>Boyce Motor Lines v. United States </em>(1952), 342 U.S. 337, 340, 72 S.Ct. 329, 330, 96 L.Ed. 367, 371. R.C. 4511.19 certainly is not sufficiently definite to inform people that they may not listen to their car radio while intoxicated, when they possess no immediate intent to drive the vehicle. Drunk driving is a \u201chot button\u201d issue, but not so hot that the rules of statutory construction do not apply to intoxicated persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Under today\u2019s majority decision, coupled with the decision in <em>McGlone, </em>the following scenario can occur: A married couple has the neighbors over for a barbecue. Everyone enjoys a few cold alcoholic beverages with dinner. The wife looks at her watch, and realizes that the Indians game has probably reached the ninth inning. A rabid fan, she runs to the car, which is parked in her own driveway, and turns the ignition key to activate the car radio. She sits on the driver\u2019s seat as Herb Score describes the game-winning home run: \u201cIt\u2019s going, going, gone!\u201d She turns and sees her reflection in the sunglasses of the dutiful city police officer as he says, \u201cYou\u2019re gone too, ma\u2019am \u2014 to the slammer!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The legislature\u2019s intent was to deter and to punish drunk drivers, not to punish drunk radio listeners, or people who use their cars as a four-wheeled, heated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>hotel room. The question of operation under the drunk driving statute ought to be a jury question of whether the. accused was, or intended to be, a driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">It is clear that we cannot depend on prosecutors to prosecute only in those instances when the defendant is thought to have recently driven or is about to drive. The assistant prosecutor in the <em>Gill </em>case admitted that she would prosecute a drunk driving charge even if she were certain that the automobile had not been driven by the intoxicated person. That seems to me to be highly inappropriate prosecutorial discretion. It is evident that some prosecutors do not care about enforcing the spirit of the statute, but are merely concerned with getting convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Prohibition is over. It is not illegal to purchase alcohol, or to drink it to excess, as long as you do not infringe on the rights of others. Under today\u2019s decision, you are just as guilty if you decide to \u201csleep it off\u2019 for the night as you are if you try to drive home. The choice for intoxicated people, then, is whether to be a \u201csitting duck\u201d in an area highly patrolled by police, or to be a moving target. Unfortunately for all of us, many people will choose to take to the highway.</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-7\">Wright, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
