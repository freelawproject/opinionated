Appellant has filed an untimely appeal of the court of appeals decision denying his application for delayed reconsideration and a motion for delayed appeal. This appeal involves a civil, post-conviction matter and not an appeal of a felony case to which the provisions for delayed appeal in S.Ct.Prac.R. 1(A)(4) apply. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b868-22\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>that the motion for delayed appeal be, and hereby is, stricken, effective September 14, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-23\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>that, in that appellant failed to perfect an appeal pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. II(2)(A)(1), this case be, and hereby is, dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
