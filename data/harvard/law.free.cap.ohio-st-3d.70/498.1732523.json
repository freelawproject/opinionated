Appellant also asserts a due process violation arising from the commission\u2019s February 14,1991 decision to reconsider the staff hearing officer\u2019s reversal of the July 7, 1989 regional board order. Claimant, in turn, questions the availability of an adequate remedy at law. For the following reasons, appellant\u2019s objections to the impaired earning capacity award are sustained and the appellate judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">We initially reject claimant\u2019s assertion that declaratory judgment is an adequate remedy at law. At issue is claimant\u2019s entitlement to impaired earning capacity benefits \u2014 an extent of disability question that is the subject of mandamus. R.C. 4123.519.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\"><em>State ex rel. Marks v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 184, 586 N.E.2d 109, on which claimant relies, differs from this case. In <em>Marks, </em>claimant\u2019s initial allowance was denied by the district hearing officer, granted by the regional board and denied by staff hearing officers. The claimant then properly appealed to common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">During the appeal\u2019s pendency, the claimant sought compensation and benefits for the period between the regional board\u2019s allowance and the staff hearing officer\u2019s denial. The commission held claimant\u2019s request in abeyance pending the outcome of her appeal. Claimant then went forward in mandamus to compel compensation and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Anchoring claimant\u2019s request was former R.C. 4123.515, which provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">\u201c[W]here the regional board rules in favor of the claimant, compensation and benefits shall be paid * * * whether or not further appeal is taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">We declined to address claimant\u2019s rights under R.C. 4123.515, finding declaratory judgment to be the appropriate vehicle for relief. Resolution here, however, does not hinge on a declaration of statutory rights under either R.C. 4123.57(A) or R.C. 4123.56, since no one contests the impropriety of concurrent compensation for temporary total disability and impaired earning capacity for the same condition. Instead, the parties disagree as to whether the same condition is indeed involved in both claims. Statutory analysis will, accordingly, be of no assistance, negating the utility of a declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Appellant\u2019s constitutional challenge was initiated by the August 29, 1990 staff hearing officer order which vacated the July 7, 1989 regional board order and disallowed impaired earning capacity compensation. Claimant successfully moved for rehearing, and the merits of the regional board\u2019s order were reheard on April 25, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Appellant\u2019s due process challenge is difficult to decipher. Apparently, appellant believes that the commission should have held a hearing on whether to grant the claimant\u2019s reconsideration motion and rehear the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Appellant cites no authority that requires the commission to hold a hearing on the question of whether to hold another hearing. Equally important, appellant alleges no resulting prejudice. This is not a case where the commission granted a motion for reconsideration <em>and </em>directly proceeded to redecide the merit issue without allowing appellant a chance to respond. Appellant was afforded the opportunity to \u2014 and did indeed \u2014 respond to the substantive merits of the issue of impaired earning capacity on April 25, 1991. Therefore, no due process rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Appellant also challenges concurrent payment of impaired earning capacity benefits and temporary total disability compensation. The former may not be paid concurrently with compensation for temporary total disability or permanent total disability if the disability giving rise to dual benefits involves the same body part. <em>State ex rel. Ohio City Mfg. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 170, 532 N.E.2d 748; <em>State ex rel. Litten v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 178, 602 N.E.2d 624. Contrary to appellant\u2019s representation, however, the <em>mere filing </em>of a motion for permanent total disability compensation does not preclude impaired earning capacity benefits. While claimant indeed seeks compensation for permanent total disability in her second claim, her application has not been adjudicated and, therefore, cannot bar an impaired earning capacity award.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Unlike permanent total disability compensation, temporary total disability compensation in this claim is a reality. The appellate court ruled that because the claims are not allowed for identical conditions \u2014 claim one for \u201csprain/strain low back and hips; bruised stomach and sprain/strain hips\u201d and claim two for \u201celbow, shoulder and aggravation of pre-existing low back injury\u201d \u2014 concurrent payment was not barred. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\"><em>Ohio City </em>permits concurrent compensation for temporary total disability and impaired earning capacity <em>only </em>where \u201cdifferent <em>parts of the body </em>\u201d are involved. (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 171, 532 N.E.2d at 750. It did not, as the appellate opinion suggests, authorize dual compensation where the same body part but different conditions are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Claimant counters that each claim is allowed for conditions other than low back injury. While this is true, there is no evidence indicating that anything other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>than claimant\u2019s low back is the cause of her alleged impairment of earning capacity or temporary total disability. Claimant has presented no evidence indicating that her hip, stomach, shoulder or elbow conditions contribute to either of her alleged disabilities. To the contrary, what little evidence does touch upon these conditions suggests that these injuries have long since healed. The mere existence of these conditions does not revive claimant\u2019s entitlement to concurrent compensation for impaired earning capacity and temporary total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Accordingly, the appellate judgment is. reversed, and the commission is ordered to vacate its November 22, 1991 order and to deny claimant\u2019s motion for compensation for impaired earning capacity in claim one.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ issued.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b621-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
