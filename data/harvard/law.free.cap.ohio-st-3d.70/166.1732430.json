We disagree and affirm the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Contrary to Frigidaire\u2019s contention, the report satisfies the most fundamental permanent total disability requirement \u2014 relating a total inability to work exclusively to claimant\u2019s allowed conditions. Reed specifically says that claimant\u2019s inability to work is \u201cdue to back injury.\u201d This establishes the requisite causal relationship and invalidates Frigidaire\u2019s suggestion that Reed\u2019s disability opinion was based in part on a nonallowed problem due to depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Frigidaire also alleges a lack of supportive findings in the report. We again disagree. Although skimpy, the report pinpoints the claimant\u2019s arthritic condition as the source of his problems. It also indicates that claimant cannot do lifting and is restricted to brief walking, both of which would impact on his ability to work. Given the commission\u2019s authority to evaluate evidentiary weight and credibility, its decision to rely on Reed\u2019s report is not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The commission\u2019s reliance on evidence of a medical incapacity for work dispenses with the need for an evaluation of the commission\u2019s treatment of claimant\u2019s nonmedical factors. <em>State ex rel. Galion Mfg. Div., Dresser Industries, Inc. v. Haygood </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 38, 573 N.E.2d 60. Accordingly, we find that \u201csome evidence\u201d supports the commission\u2019s order. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The appellate court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-10\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
