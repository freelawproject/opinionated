William Sweeney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afj\">In our view, the court of appeals\u2019 decision holding that SERB had exclusive jurisdiction of the instant action since it \u201carguably constitute[d] an unfair labor practice\u201d is clearly erroneous as a matter of law. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The record indicates that the union filed a grievance against the city based on the general order issued by the fire chief which impacted upon the ability of union members to obtain overtime work. The collective bargaining agreement entered into by the city and union establishes a four-step process for resolving grievances. The agreement further provides that if an aggrieved party is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance after the fourth step, he or she can proceed to binding arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the parties herein did not follow their own agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In finding that the trial court below and hence, the arbitrator, lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to settle the grievance, the court of appeals relied on several cases for the proposition that SERB has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide not only any unfair labor practice charge brought before it, but any conduct or grievance which arguably constitutes an unfair labor practice. See, <em>e.g., Gunn v. Euclid City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 41, 554 N.E.2d 130, and <em>State ex rel. Ramsdell v. Washington Local School Bd. </em>(1988), 52 Ohio App.3d 4, 556 N.E.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We agree that SERB has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity, or lack thereof, of unfair labor practices. See <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn. v. Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9 </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 167, 572 N.E.2d 87, where we held in paragraph one of the syllabus: \u201cThe State Employment Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction to decide matters committed to it pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4117.\u201d See, also, <em>Franklin Cty. Sheriffs Dept. v. Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9 </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 173, 572 N.E.2d 93, syllabus, where we held that a court of common pleas is without jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment determining rights established or limited by R.C. 4117.11 \u201c * * * where the State Employment Relations Board is asked to make the same determination in the context of an unfair labor practice charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">However, to hold that only SERB has jurisdiction to hear or determine anything that \u201carguably\u201d constitutes an unfair labor practice is neither a complete nor totally correct statement of the law set forth in R.C. Chapter 4117 or the decisions of this court. In our view, exclusive jurisdiction to resolve charges of unfair labor practices is vested in SERB in two general areas: (1) where one of the parties files charges with SERB alleging an unfair labor practice under R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>4117.11; or (2) a complaint brought before the court of common pleas alleges conduct that constitutes an unfair labor practice specifically enumerated in R.C. 4117.11, and the trial court therefore dismisses the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Neither of these situations is presented in the cause <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">More importantly, however, none of the cases relied on by the city or court of appeals below involved an arbitration proceeding undertaken pursuant to the terms of a valid collective bargaining agreement entered into by the parties. In its apparent haste to bootstrap the \u201carguably\u201d language of <em>Gunn </em>to dismiss the instant action, the court of appeals below ignored the clear language of former R.C. 4117.10(A), which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u201cAn agreement between a public employer and an exclusive representative entered into pursuant to Chapter 4117. of the Revised Code governs the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of public employment covered by the agreement. If the agreement provides for a final and binding arbitration of grievances, public employers, employees, and employee organizations are subject solely to'that grievance procedure * *</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In practical effect, the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, left undisturbed, would effectively eliminate arbitration as a viable alternative to resolving disputes in the public employment sector, since almost any conduct alleged in a grievance raised by aggrieved parties could arguably be categorized as an unfair labor practice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The General Assembly\u2019s vesting of SERB with exclusive jurisdiction to determine unfair labor practices defined in R.C. 4117.11 was never meant to foreclose parties to a collective bargaining agreement from settling differences in interpreting provisions of their agreement through the process of binding arbitration, especially given the clear language of R.C. 4117.10(A) set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">As this court stated long ago in <em>Corrigan v. Rockefeller </em>(1902), 67 Ohio St. 354, 367, 66 N.E. 95, 98: \u201cThe law favors the amicable adjustment of difficulties, and arbitration has been favored by the courts in this state from early times.\u201d Accord <em>Campbell v. Automatic Die &amp; Products Co. </em>(1954), 162 Ohio St. 321, 329, 55 O.O. 195, 198, 123 N.E.2d 401, 405: \u201cIt is the policy of the law to favor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>encourage arbitration and every reasonable intendment will be indulged to give effect to such proceedings and to favor the regularity and integrity of the arbitrator\u2019s acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In any event, adoption of the court of appeals\u2019 rationale cannot be sanctioned or explained under the policy of law set forth above. Carrying the appellate court\u2019s decision to its logical extreme, every grievance filed by an aggrieved party to a collective bargaining agreement could, as mentioned before, arguably be characterized as an unfair labor practice. Under such a standard, SERB would be forced to decide every grievance arising out of disputes related to the interpretation of terms to a collective bargaining agreement, no matter how innocuous they may be, and notwithstanding any binding arbitration process established in the agreement entered into by the parties thereto. Since the court of appeals misconstrued the law in this context, its decision cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Therefore, based on all the foregoing, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b247-9\">Wright, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-10\">. The union correctly points out that the grievance it submitted was a proper subject for arbitration, since the conduct of the city in refusing to rescind the terms of the general order can just as easily be characterized as an \u201cimpasse\u201d in negotiations, as it could be a \u201crefusal to bargain\u201d by the city. See, <em>e.g., Teamsters Local Union No. 175 v. Natl. Labor Relations Bd. </em>(C.A.D.C.1986), 788 F.2d 27, 30: \u201cImpasse is defined as the deadlock reached by bargaining parties \u2018after good-faith negotiations have exhausted the prospects of concluding an agreement.\u2019 <em>[Taft Broadcasting Co. </em>(1967), 163 N.L.R.B. 475, 478.] This court has described the situation as one in which \u2018there was no realistic prospect that continuation of discussion at that time would have been fruitful.\u2019 <em>[Am. Fedn. of Television &amp; Radio Artists v. Natl. Labor Relations Bd. </em>(C.A.D.C.1968), 395 F.2d 622, 628.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b247-10\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARt\">dissenting. It is my belief that the State Employment Relations Board (\u201cSERB\u201d) has exclusive jurisdiction in this matter and, therefore, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">At issue here is the city of East Cleveland\u2019s unilateral imposition of a change in its overtime pay policy. The city\u2019s action was implemented neutrally and was not directed toward a particular individual or group of individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">Both parties agree that R.C. Chapter 4117 grants exclusive jurisdiction to SERB regarding matters involving an unfair labor practice. <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn. v. Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9 </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 167, 572 N.E.2d 87 <em>(\u201cFOP </em>\u201d). In <em>FOP, </em>we recognized that \u201c[t]he [SERB] statutes pertaining to unfair labor practices do not provide for the filing of an original complaint in common pleas court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 572 N.E.2d at 90. Moreover, SERB\u2019S subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived, either by agreement or by failure to raise the issue below. See <em>Fox v. Eaton Corp. </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 236, 2 O.O.3d 408, 358 N.E.2d 536, and <em>Gates Mills Invest. Co. v. Parks </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 16, 54 O.O.2d 157, 266 N.E.2d 552. Indeed, the court itself may raise the issue at any stage of the proceedings, including appeal. <em>Fox, supra. </em>Any action taken by a court which lacks the proper subject matter jurisdiction is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>In order to avoid SERB\u2019S exclusive jurisdiction, the union contends that the city\u2019s conduct did not implicate a matter over which SERB had jurisdiction. The union denies that its action raises a question of a refusal to bargain, even though its grievance, in effect, amounts to a claim that the city\u2019s unilateral modification of the terms and conditions of employment was a refusal to bargain. I cannot disregard this factual background.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We faced a very similar question in <em>FOP, supra. </em>In that case we reasserted the legal principle that \u201c \u2018[wjhere a statute which creates a new right, prescribes the remedy for its violation, the remedy is exclusive; but when a new remedy is given by statute for a right of action existing independent of it, without excluding other remedies already known to the law, the statutory remedy is cumulative merely, and the party may pursue either at his option.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>59 Ohio St.3d at 169, 572 N.E.2d at 89, quoting <em>Zanesville v. Fannan </em>(1895), 53 Ohio St. 605, 42 N.E. 703, paragraph two of the syllabus. We went on to find that R.C. Chapter 4117 \u201ccreated a series of new rights and set forth the remedies and procedures to be applied regarding those rights.\u201d <em>FOP, </em>59 Ohio St.3d at 170, 572 N.E.2d at 90. In light of that holding we unequivocally stated that \u201cif a party asserts claims that arise from or depend on the collective bargaining rights created by R.C. Chapter 4117, the remedies provided in that chapter are exclusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 572 N.E.2d at 91. I find <em>FOP </em>to be the controlling authority in the case at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">As in <em>FOP, </em>the union here is asserting collective bargaining rights created by R.C. Chapter 4117. Thus, because the union\u2019s claims are \u201cdependent on the framework established in R.C. Chapter 4117,\u201d the union is \u201climited to the remedies and procedures provided in that chapter * * <em>Id. </em>at 171, 572 N.E.2d at 92. Therefore, in my judgment, SERB has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the matter we are considering today.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The concerns raised by the majority that upholding the court of appeals\u2019 opinion \u201cwould effectively eliminate arbitration as a viable alternative to resolving disputes in the public employment sector\u201d and that \u201cSERB would be forced to decide every grievance arising out of disputes related to the interpretation of terms to a collective bargaining agreement\u201d are, to say the least, overstated. The types of claims from which the majority seeks to protect SERB are the fundamental types of issues for which the General Assembly designed R.C. Chapter 4117. \u201cThat chapter was meant to regulate in a <em>comprehensive manner </em>the labor relations between public employees and employers.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>FOP, </em>59 Ohio St.3d at 171, 572 N.E.2d at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
