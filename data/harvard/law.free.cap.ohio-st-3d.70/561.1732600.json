Generally, when the petitioner does not attack the jurisdiction of the court, habeas corpus will be denied. R.C. 2725.05; <em>Stahl v. Shoemaker </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 351, 4 O.O.3d 485, 364 N.E.2d 286. However, in certain extraordinary circumstances, habeas corpus will lie even though jurisdiction is not an issue, but only where there is no adequate legal remedy, <em>e.g., </em>appeal or postconviction relief. <em>State ex rel. Pirman v. Money </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 591, 594-595, 635 N.E.2d 26, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">Luna\u2019s petition challenged the validity of his indictment, apparently claiming that Shell, an assistant prosecuting attorney, was disqualified from presenting the state\u2019s case because of his concurrent status as a \u201cspecial deputy sheriff.\u201d It appears from the indictment attached to Luna\u2019s petition that the assistant prosecuting attorney signed for the prosecuting attorney on that document. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Luna contended that the special deputy sheriff was an \u201cintruder\u201d and \u201cusurper\u201d in the grand jury proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Habeas corpus is not available to challenge either the validity, <em>Hammond v. Dallman </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 666, 590 N.E.2d 744; <em>State v. Wozniak </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 517, 522-523, 18 O.O.2d 58, 61, 178 N.E.2d 800, 804, or the sufficiency of an indictment. <em>Wilson v. Rogers </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 130, 623 N.E.2d 1210. Luna possessed an adequate remedy by direct appeal to raise these contentions. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Jackson v. Allen </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 37, 599 N.E.2d 696 (writ of quo warranto to remove special prosecutor and to void indictments issued by him denied where adequate remedy existed by postconviction appeal of trial court\u2019s decision overruling motion to dismiss indictments).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b680-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
