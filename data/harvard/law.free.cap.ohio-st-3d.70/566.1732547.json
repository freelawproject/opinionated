For the reasons to follow, the cause is returned to the commission for clarification and an amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Claimant initially argues that the order of the common pleas court mandated payment, and that therefore compensation should have been paid, regardless of the appellate court\u2019s reversal, pursuant to R.C. 4123.519(F) and (G). We disagree. Had the lower court indeed intended payment pursuant to the earlier order of the district hearing officer, it would not have remanded the cause for further commission proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Claimant alternatively challenges the evidentiary sufficiency of the orders denying him temporary total disability compensation. Finding our review hampered by vagueness in the commission\u2019s orders, we return the cause to the commission for clarification and amended order. In affirming the board\u2019s order without comment, the staff hearing officers on April 19, 1988 inherently adopted the board\u2019s reasoning. <em>State ex rel. DeMint v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 19, 550 N.E.2d 174. With the vacation of the supplemental staff hearing officers\u2019 order and the silence of the commission on temporary total compensation over the relevant period, we view the April 19, 1988 staff hearing officers\u2019 order as the definitive commission order on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Preliminarily, we find that the board\u2019s lack of citation to specific medical evidence relied on does not, as claimant alleges, violate <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721. As the appellate court aptly observed, the board could not \u201chave specified the medical evidence relied upon when it was [its] finding that there was insufficient evidence to support the payment of temporary total disability compensation.\u201d An order cannot identify the evidence \u201crelied on\u201d when the finding is based on a lack of evidence on which to rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Analysis of the board\u2019s and staff hearing officers\u2019 denials is, however, hindered by the vague reasoning stated therein \u2014 \u201cmedical in file does not support payment of compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">The difficulty with the board\u2019s \u2014 and vicariously, the staff hearing officers\u2019\u2014 reasoning is its susceptibility to different interpretations, which stems from the board\u2019s failure to identify which prerequisite to temporary total compensation was not supported by the medical evidence. Dr. Taylor, for example, refers to claimant\u2019s condition as a \u201cpermanent problem.\u201d The board may, therefore, have interpreted the evidence as failing to support the prerequisite of \u201ctemporariness.\u201d It is also possible that the board concluded that work amenability was the unsubstantiated element since, at least at the time of the board\u2019s order, none of the evidence addressed claimant\u2019s ability to perform his former duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">This lack of clarity makes it impossible to evaluate the evidentiary adequacy of the staff hearing officers\u2019 order. Unlike the board, staff hearing officers had Dr. Wikas\u2019s interrogatories, which could affect the validity of the board\u2019s reasoning, inherently adopted by the staff hearing officers in their April 19,1988 order. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>example, if the rationale was permanency, the interrogatories would not undermine that rationale, since Wikas is silent on this element. On the other hand, if the board denied temporary total because no evidence addressed claimant\u2019s ability to work, the staff hearing officers\u2019 adoption of that reasoning is suspect, since Wikas expressly discussed that issue. Clarification of the orders\u2019 underlying rationale is, therefore, critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the appellate court is reversed and the cause is returned to the commission for clarification and an amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause returned.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b688-7\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
