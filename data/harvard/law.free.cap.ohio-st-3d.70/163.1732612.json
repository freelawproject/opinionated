Claimant contests the court\u2019s refusal to order the commission to expressly consider the rehabilitation report and issue an amended order. Only claimant\u2019s challenge is found persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">This case falls squarely under <em>State ex rel. Fultz v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 327, 631 N.E.2d 1057. <em>Fultz </em>returned for further consideration an order that omitted reference to two reports among the evidence purportedly considered. The court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">\u201cNeither the commission\u2019s rehabilitation report nor Riccio\u2019s vocational report is listed in the commission\u2019s order as being among the evidence the commission considered. While the commission correctly contends in essence that it need only enumerate the evidence relied on, the fact that the commission in listing the evidence considered omitted those two reports from that list, leads to only one conclusion \u2014 the commission either inadvertently or intentionally ignored that evidence. Because these reports could be key to the success or failure of claimant\u2019s application, the cause must be returned to the commission for further consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329, 631 N.E.2d at 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\"><em>Fultz </em>also held that <em>Noll </em>review was premature, since a satisfactory evidentiary explanation could not occur unless all evidence had been considered. Y <em>&amp; </em>O\u2019s claim of <em>Noll </em>compliance is not, therefore, ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Accordingly, that portion of the appellate court\u2019s judgment that returned the cause for further consideration and amended order is affirmed. That portion of the judgment which declined to specifically direct the commission to consider the rehabilitation report and issue an amended order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed in part and affirmed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-6\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
