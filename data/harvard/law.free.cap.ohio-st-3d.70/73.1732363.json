We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">The determination of true value or fair market value of property for tax purposes is a question of fact which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities. <em>N. Olmsted Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 98, 99, 561 N.E.2d 915, 917. As we said in <em>R.R.Z. Assoc. v. Cuyahoga </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 198, 201, 527 N.E.2d 874, 877: \u201c * * * [The BTA] has wide discretion to determine the weight given to evidence and the credibility of witnesses before it. Its true value decision is a question of fact which will be disturbed * * * only when it affirmatively appears from the record that such decision is unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Here, the BTA analyzed Kocinski\u2019s appraisal testimony, considered his three approaches to valuation, and found that the true value of the subject property was $34,600,000. The BTA, in adopting Kocinski\u2019s income approach to value, took into consideration the arm\u2019s-length sale of the property on December 11, 1986; the passage of time until tax lien date, January 1, 1988; the upgrades and repairs made immediately after the sale and completed or in process prior to tax lien date; and the primary lessee\u2019s favorable long-term rental rates. The BTA decision is a textbook example of a reasoned decision on the true value of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Moreover, under <em>Banbury Village, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 251, 559 N.E.2d 1356, we reject EOB\u2019s contention that the BTA violated EOB\u2019s constitutional protections by abusing the BTA\u2019s discretion and violating the Constitution of the United States and the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">We conclude, as we did in <em>Banbury:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u201cWe find no violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights and we find that the decision of the BTA is supported by substantial probative evidence, is reasonable and lawful and it is hereby affirmed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254, 559 N.E.2d at 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-10\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
