Chapter 140 bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">Appellant initially asserted also that the BTA erred in finding \u201cthat the Tax Commissioner was collaterally estopped from holding that the independent living facility and parking garage[ ] at Judson Park were not entitled to an exemption from real property taxation under R.C. 140.08.\u201d However, at oral argument herein, both parties conceded the inapplicability of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">In light of our conclusion that the determinative issue is whether the subject property was used as hospital facilities, appellant\u2019s contention with regard to the financing of the renovations with R.C. Chapter 140 bonds becomes academic. Accordingly, there is no significance to the fact that the proceeds of the revenue bonds were used entirely to renovate the Judson Manor portion of Judson Retirement Community.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>On the basis of <em>Dublin School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 255, 631 N.E.2d 604, the BTA\u2019s decision is reversed and the cause is remanded to the BTA with instructions to order the Tax Commissioner to determine whether the independent living facility and the parking garage at Judson Park were used as \u201chospital facilities\u201d as defined in R.C. 140.01(E), and were, therefore, entitled to exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\n<em>Decision reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-5\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
