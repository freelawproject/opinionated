Consequently, so it argues, it may appeal from this notice. The commission responds that the appeals were untimely since North Perry filed them more than thirty days after it received notice of the commission\u2019s actions and because North Perry attempted to appeal the health district\u2019s action, not the commission\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u201cThe right to appeal granted by R.C. 5705.37 is statutory, and an appellant must follow the statute.\u201d <em>Cincinnati v. Budget Comm. of Hamilton Cty. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 252, 253, 520 N.E.2d 232, 234. In <em>Budget Comm. of Brown Cty. v. Georgetown </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 33, 24 OBR 76, 492 N.E.2d 826, syllabus, we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u201cPursuant to the express terms of R.C. 5705.37, the permissible time in which to perfect an appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals may be triggered by a subdivision\u2019s receipt of either the official certificate as set forth in R.C. 5705.37 or by receipt of notice as defined in R.C. 5747.51(J).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The commission, in the instant case, sent the official certificates of resources in August of the year prior to each of the years in dispute. Further, the notice defined in R.C. 5747.51(J) is the published list of the subdivisions and the amount each is to receive from the undivided local governmental fund. The auditor must publish this notice in a local newspaper of countywide circulation, and send it by certified mail to each participating subdivision. This latter notice is not involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Thus, R.C. 5705.37 required North Perry to file its notice of appeal within thirty days of receiving the official certificate of resources. This statute does not provide for filing an appeal from a notice issued by a health district informing subdivisions of its proposed budget, including therein, the actual assessment for the current year. Since North Perry failed to file its appeals within thirty days of receiving the official certificates of resources, the BTA correctly dismissed the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">In truth, North Perry had some knowledge of its assessment prior to receiving the official certificates. According to the testimony of North Perry\u2019s clerk-treasurer, she attempted, in December 1989, to obtain information on 1990\u2019s assessment from the health district to prepare the 1990 budget. North Perry then included an assessment estimate in such budget. Moreover, according to Lake County\u2019s Chief Deputy Auditor, who handles the budgeting process for the auditor, North Perry\u2019s official certificate of resources reflects the assessment because such amount is deducted from real estate tax revenue to determine the exact amount of that revenue source.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the BTA\u2019s decisions because North Perry did not file timely appeals for each of the years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\n<em>Decisions affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-6\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
