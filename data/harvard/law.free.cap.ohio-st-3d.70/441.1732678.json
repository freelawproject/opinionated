See <em>Dorrian v. Scioto Conservancy Dist. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 102, 56 O.O.2d 58, 271 N.E.2d 834, paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus, the auditor has a duty to transfer land on the tax list \u201cwhen rendered necessary by a conveyance,\u201d provided that \u201cthe affidavits required by law\u201d are submitted and R.C. 319.202 has been complied with. (R.C. 319.202 requires the grantee to submit a declaration of the property\u2019s value and the grantor to pay a fee.) Here, the auditor stipulates that he has refused to transfer a parcel for a reason other than noncompliance with these statutory prerequisites for transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">However, the auditor contends that he has no duty to endorse a deed inaccurately describing the property conveyed. He cites <em>State ex rel. Preston v. Shaver </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 111, 15 O.O.2d 202, 173 N.E.2d 758, and <em>State ex rel. Ballard v. McKelvey </em>(C.P.1961), 89 Ohio Law Abs. 407, 20 O.O.2d 465, 184 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>124, affirmed (App.1961), 89 Ohio Law Abs. 415, 186 N.E.2d 144. In <em>Preston, </em>a county recorder refused to accept, record, and index certain instruments granting easements in registered land, on the ground that the instruments did not so describe the easements that the recorder could locate them without a surveyor\u2019s aid. Affirming the denial of mandamus relief, we held that the recorder need not \u201caccept, record and index every instrument presented to him.\u201d 172 Ohio St. at 114, 15 O.O.2d at 203, 173 N.E.2d at 760. Citing <em>Preston, </em>the common pleas court in <em>Ballard </em>extended similar discretion to a county auditor to reject a deed inaccurately describing the land conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We think <em>Preston </em>lends no support to the auditor\u2019s argument. In <em>Preston, </em>we noted: \u2018We are dealing here with registered land, and [R.C.] 5309.79 * * * provides that in every voluntary instrument used to transfer a part of land conveyed by a certificate of title \u2018an accurate description of such part enabling it to be definitely located and platted shall be given.\u2019 \u201d 172 Ohio St. at 114, 15 O.O.2d at 203, 173 N.E.2d at 760. Since a statute specifically required that the instrument accurately describe the land conveyed, the recorder in <em>Preston </em>had no duty to record instruments that did not. But here we are not dealing with registered land, and the auditor cites no comparable statute that applies to non-registered land.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Instead, the auditor claims implied authority to require that a deed presented for transfer accurately describe the land conveyed, and to refuse to make the transfer if the deed\u2019s description is inaccurate. Such authority, he argues, is essential if he is to execute his statutory duties. See <em>Ballard, supra, </em>89 Ohio Law Abs. at 411-412, 20 O.O.2d at 467, 184 N.E.2d at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">We do not doubt that the auditor needs accurate descriptions of real property to do his job. As \u201cthe assessor of all the real estate in his county,\u201d R.C. 5713.01(A), the auditor \u201cappraises each lot or parcel and places the correct value of each property on his tax list and on the county treasurer\u2019s duplicate.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Rolling Hills Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Brown </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 520, 521, 589 N.E.2d 1265, 1266. To appraise each parcel \u201cat its true value,\u201d R.C. 5713.01(B), the auditor needs to know its precise description. He also needs accurate descriptions of real property to carry out his recordkeeping duties under R.C. 5713.01(D), 5713.09, and 5713.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">However, the auditor can obtain accurate descriptions without refusing to perform his duty under R.C. 319.20. R.C. 5713.02 provides that, when an assessor <em>(i.e., </em>the auditor or his delegate) \u201cdeems it necessary to obtain an accurate description of any separate tract or lot in his district, he may require the owner or occupier thereof to furnish such description * * If the owner or occupier does not comply, the assessor may have the property surveyed at the owner\u2019s expense. Thus, the auditor can get an accurate description of a given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>parcel whenever he needs one. He has no need \u2014 and hence no implied power\u2014 to condition his performance of a duty on the making of a survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Formerly, some county auditor\u2019s offices did have the power the auditor claims here \u2014 power to withhold endorsement from deeds inaccurately describing the land conveyed. In 1892, the General Assembly required certain counties \u201cto employ an expert draughtsman * * * who shall be under the control of the county auditor.\u201d 89 Ohio Laws 220, 221, Section 1. The draughtsman was to examine all deeds, determine whether they correctly described the land intended to be conveyed, and <em>\u201creject any and all deeds in which the description of the property is not correct </em>* * * until such descriptions are carefully and accurately made.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 89 Ohio Laws 220, 221, Section 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In 1900, however, the General Assembly deleted from the Act the draughtsman\u2019s authority to examine deeds and reject those with incorrect descriptions. 94 Ohio Laws 558. As subsequent General Assemblies have not restored that power to auditors, we conclude that they did not mean for auditors to have it. See 1936 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 6120, at 1464-1467.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cIt is not the function of the auditor to pass upon the authenticity or validity of deeds.\u201d 1942 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 5142, at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Where an auditor has a legal duty to transfer real property from one name to another on the tax list, mandamus will lie to compel him to do so. See <em>State ex rel U.S. Mtge. &amp; Trust Co. v. Godfrey </em>(1900), 62 Ohio St. 18, 56 N.E. 482. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and allow a writ of mandamus directing the auditor to transfer Parcel No. 06-25-000-194 on the tax list from Taraloca Land Company to Jon D. Moulton, provided Tarabea Land Company and Moulton comply with the prerequisites specified in R.C. 319.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b562-9\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-10\">. The Attorney General overruled this opinion at 1986 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 86-028, at 2-148, fn. 2. However, the overruling opinion relied exclusively on <em>Ballard, </em>a case we reject, and did not consider the legislative history cited in the 1936 opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
