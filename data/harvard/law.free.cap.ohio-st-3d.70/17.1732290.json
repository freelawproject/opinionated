Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai-\">The sole issue before this court is whether the admission of a co-defendant\u2019s taped statement after the co-defendant becomes unavailable violated appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses. For the following reasons, we find that admission of the statement did not violate the Confrontation Clause. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The Confrontation Clause and the hearsay rules stem from the same roots and generally protect the same values; however, the prohibitions of the Confrontation Clause cannot be equated with the general rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay statements. <em>White v. Illinois </em>(1992), 502 U.S. 346, -, 112 S.Ct. 736, 741, 116 L.Ed.2d 848, 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">The Confrontation Clause is a constitutional safeguard that ensures a defendant will not be convicted based on the charges of unseen, unknown, and unchallengeable \"witnesses. <em>Lee v. Illinois </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 530, 540, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2062, 90 L.Ed.2d 514, 525. Thus, the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under a hearsay exception. <em>Idaho v. Wright </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 805, 814, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3146, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, 651. When a hearsay declarant is not present for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause requires a showing that he is unavailable and that the statement bears adequate \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, 607-608. The reliability standard can be satisfied without more in a case where the evidence falls within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>firmly rooted hearsay exception. <em>Id. </em>at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d at 608. Otherwise, to satisfy the Confrontation Clause the evidence must be supported by a showing of \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In the present case, we initially find that Moore\u2019s statement falls within an established hearsay exception as a statement against interest, Evid.R. 804(B)(3). The state called Moore to testify in its case-in-chief, but Moore asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to testify. By doing so, Moore became \u201cunavailable\u201d for purposes of the unavailability requirement of Evid.R. 804. <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 113, 559 N.E.2d 710, 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Pursuant to Evid.R. 804(B)(3), a statement may be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable and it is a \u201cstatement against interest.\u201d To qualify as a statement against interest, it must be shown that the statement \u201ctended to subject\u201d the declarant to criminal liability so that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the declarant believed it to be true. <em>United States v. Garcia </em>(C.A.7, 1990), 897 F.2d 1413, 1420.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Clearly, in the present case Moore\u2019s statement tended to subject the declarant, Moore, to criminal liability. Moore admitted he had driven appellant and Treadwell to Rite Nau \u201cto check it out.\u201d Moore admitted that he assumed this meant they were \u201cgonna rob the place.\u201d Moore further admitted that he had seen a shotgun before the robbery, which he believed Treadwell had brought but Moore thought was owned by appellant. Moore stated further that appellant and Treadwell returned to the car together, with money in a bag, and that Moore drove them away from Rite Nau. This statement exposes Moore to criminal liability and, thus, is a \u201cstatement against interest\u201d as provided by Evid.R. 804(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Finally, Evid.R. 804(B)(3) requires that corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement before the statement against interest becomes admissible. The determination of whether sufficient corroborating circumstances exist generally rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Landrum, supra, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 114, 559 N.E.2d at 720. In the present case, there are sufficient corroborating circumstances which indicate that the statement is trustworthy. The declarant, Moore, gave a statement to Detective Medders while Moore was in custody. Moore was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights and stated that he understood his rights and indicated his willingness to \u2022 voluntarily make a statement. Prior to making the statement, Moore was advised that the statement was in regard to the robbery at Rite Nau. The evidence shows no discussion of any promises or offers in exchange for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>statement. Furthermore, the content of Moore\u2019s statement was corroborated by other witnesses\u2019 testimonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Based on all the surrounding circumstances, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Moore\u2019s statement was trustworthy. Accordingly, we conclude that the statement met the requirements of a statement against interest under Evid.R. 804(B)(3) and, therefore, did not violate the Confrontation Clause as the evidence was admissible pursuant to a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In addition, we also find that Moore\u2019s statement did not violate the Confrontation Clause, since it is supported by \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d See <em>Ohio v. Roberts, supra, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d at 608. The guarantees of trustworthiness must be shown from the totality of the circumstances. <em>Idaho v. Wright, supra, </em>497 U.S. at 819, 110 S.Ct. at 3148, 111 L.Ed.2d at 655. As the lower court concluded, the reliability of Moore\u2019s confession was not as inherently suspect as the typical co-defendant\u2019s confession referred to in the United States Supreme Court case, <em>Lee v. Illinois, supra, </em>476 U.S. at 541, 106 S.Ct. at 2062, 90 L.Ed.2d at 526. Moore\u2019s statement did not attempt to exonerate Moore and shift the blame to another co-defendant. As previously discussed, Moore admitted that he drove Treadwell and appellant to Rite Nau; that he knew these two men planned to \u201crob the place\u201d and that they had a shotgun; and that he waited outside to drive the men away after they left Rite Nau. Other witnesses at trial corroborated Moore\u2019s statement. Thus, the content of the statement is \u201cparticularly worthy of belief,\u201d as the declarant incriminated himself by making the statement. See <em>Idaho v. Wright, supra, </em>497 U.S. at 819, 110 S.Ct. at 3148, 111 L.Ed.2d at 655. In addition, Moore gave the statement to police after having been fully advised of both his rights and the reason for the questioning. The evidence shows no discussion of any promise or consideration in exchange for the statement. Thus, the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement tend to demonstrate its trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Considering the totality of the circumstances discussed above, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the evidence was supported by \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d such that its admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b139-10\">A.W. Sweeney and Wright, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMy\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The majority correctly recognizes that the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible as a hearsay exception. The majority also correctly states the <em>Roberts </em>test that the declarant must be available for cross-examination and the declarant\u2019s statement must bear adequate \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d Finally, the majority correctly states that the reliability standard can be satisfied where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or is supported by a showing of \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Unfortunately, after stating the law correctly to this point in its analysis, the majority misunderstands what constitutes a firmly rooted hearsay exception and a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The majority finds that the <em>Roberts </em>reliability standard is met in both ways: Moore\u2019s statement falls under an established hearsay exception as a statement against interest pursuant to Evid.R. 804(B)(3) and the statement is supported by particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. The majority finds the statement is an established hearsay exception as a statement against interest because Moore\u2019s statement \u201ctended to subject the declarant, Moore, to criminal liability.\u201d What the majority ignores, but the court of appeals recognized, is that the United States Supreme Court has specifically rejected justifying the admission of co-defendants\u2019 statements on this basis. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u201cWe reject respondent\u2019s categorization of the hearsay involved in this case as a simple \u2018declaration against penal interest.\u2019 That concept defines too large a class for meaningful Confrontation Clause analysis. We decide this case as involving a confession by an accomplice which incriminates a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>Lee v. Illinois </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 530, 544, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2064, 90 L.Ed.2d 514, 528, fn. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Since Moore\u2019s statement cannot be admitted against Gilliam as a firmly rooted hearsay exception, it must be supported by a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness to be admissible. The majority makes two errors in concluding Moore\u2019s statement meets this test. First, the majority looks beyond the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement to other evidence admitted at trial. Second, the majority concludes that Moore\u2019s statement is reliable, since Moore implicated himself in criminal activity. Again, the United States Supreme Court has specifically rejected both aspects of the majority\u2019s approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Ironically, the majority cites the very page of the opinion in <em>Idaho v. Wright </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, which repudiates its position. The United States Supreme Court noted that the state of Idaho argued that \u201ca finding of \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 should instead be based on the consideration of the totality of the circumstances including not only the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, but also other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>evidence at trial that corroborates the truth of the statement. We agree that \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 must be shown from the totality of the circumstances, but we think <em>the relevant circumstances include only those that surround the making of the statement </em>and th\u00e1t render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 819, 110 S.Ct. at 3148, 111 L.Ed.2d at 654-655.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The court further stated that \u201c[i]n other words, if the declarant\u2019s truthfulness is so clear from the surrounding circumstances that the test of cross-examination would be of marginal utility, then the hearsay rule does not bar admission of the statement at trial.\u201d The court gave the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d and \u201cdying declaration\u201d hearsay exceptions as examples where \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the making of the statement provides sufficient assurance that the statement is trustworthy and that cross-examination would be superfluous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 820, 110 S.Ct. at 3149, 111 L.Ed.2d at 655. Thus, the majority impermissibly looked to other evidence beyond the circumstances surrounding the making of Moore\u2019s statement to justify its conclusion that Moore\u2019s statement was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The majority also incorrectly concludes that the fact Moore implicated himself in criminal activity makes his statement reliable. To justify this conclusion, the majority states that \u201cthe reliability of Moore\u2019s confession was not as inherently suspect as the typical co-defendant\u2019s confession referred to in the United States Supreme Court case, <em>Lee v. Illinois </em>* * *. Moore\u2019s statement did not attempt to exonerate Moore and shift the blame to another co-defendant.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Again, the majority gives the impression that Supreme Court precedent justifies its position. However, the majority does not discuss the facts of <em>Lee v. Illinois </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 530, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514. Those facts make it apparent that <em>Lee </em>is not distinguishable from the present case. The co-defendant in <em>Lee </em>did not try to \u201cexonerate\u201d himself or \u201cshift\u201d the blame to the other co-defendant. What he did was make a statement which inculpated <em>both </em>defendants. Co-defendants Lee and Thomas were charged with murder. Lee gave a statement to the police indicating the murders occurred without premeditation. Thomas gave a statement to the police indicating that he and Lee had discussed the murders in advance. Despite the fact Thomas inculpated himself in the murder, the Supreme Court ruled that Thomas\u2019s statement could not be admitted against Lee because to do so violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that Moore did not attempt to exonerate himself or shift blame to the other co-defendants also is not supported by the statement itself. What were the circumstances surrounding the making of Moore\u2019s statement? Moore\u2019s vehicle was identified by a witness as the vehicle involved in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>robbery. The police took Moore into custody to interrogate him. Listening to Moore\u2019s statement it is apparent he was trying to minimize his involvement and maximize the involvement of Gilliam and Treadwell. Moore initially claimed that he just gave Gilliam and Treadwell a ride but did not know what they planned to do. Moore said they merely told him they wanted to \u201ccheck something out.\u201d Moore continued to deny any prior knowledge about the robbery. Finally under persistent questioning by police, Moore stated he \u201cguessed\u201d you could say that he knew they were going to the Rite Nau to rob it.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Neither the circumstances surrounding the making of Moore\u2019s statement nor the statement itself overcomes the presumption of unreliability accorded to a co-defendant\u2019s statements. As the Supreme Court has said, \u201c[o]ur cases recognize that this truthfinding function of the Confrontation Clause is uniquely threatened when an accomplice\u2019s confession is sought to be introduced against a criminal defendant without the benefit of cross-examination. As has been noted, such a confession \u2018is hearsay, subject to all the dangers of inaccuracy which characterize hearsay generally. * * * More than this, however, the arrest statements of a co-defendant have traditionally been viewed with special suspicion. Due to his strong motivation to implicate the defendant and to exonerate himself, a codefendant\u2019s statements about what the defendant said or did are less credible than ordinary hearsay evidence.\u2019 * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">G tj: * *</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u201c * * * The true danger inherent in this type of hearsay is, in fact, its selective reliability. As we have consistently recognized, a codefendant\u2019s confession is presumptively unreliable as to the passages detailing the defendant\u2019s conduct or culpability because those passages may well be the product of the codefendant\u2019s desire to shift or spread blame, curry favor, avenge himself, or divert attention to another.\u201d <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>at 541, 545, 106 S.Ct. at 2062, 2064, 90 L.Ed.2d at 526, 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The admission of Moore\u2019s statement into evidence against Gilliam violated Gilliam\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses. For that reason, I would reverse the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b142-8\">A.W. Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
