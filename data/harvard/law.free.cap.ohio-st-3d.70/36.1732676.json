Wunder and Penix, so as to leave Dr. Slemmer\u2019s report as the only competent medical evidence of record. If successful, Dr. Slemmer\u2019s assessment of a medical incapacity for work would negate the need to consider nonmedical disability factors and compel a permanent total disability award. <em>State ex rel. Galion Mfg. Div., Dresser Indus., Inc. v. Haygood </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 38, 573 N.E.2d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>It was the commission\u2019s prerogative to find the reports of Drs. Wunder and Penix more persuasive. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. This is particularly true when the three reports are compared. Dr. Slemmer does no more than scrawl a \u201cyes\u201d to two very leading questions apparently prepared by claimant\u2019s counsel. Drs. Wunder and Penix, on the other hand, comprehensively discuss claimant\u2019s past medical history and subjective complaints, and make objective findings, diagnoses and prognoses. Hopkins\u2019 intimation that Dr. Slemmer\u2019s report was unfairly discounted is thus unconvincing. Dr. Wunder\u2019s conclusion that Hopkins was capable of \u201clifting in sedentary to light ranges\u201d constitutes \u201csome evidence\u201d of light duty capability.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Claimant attempts to discredit Dr. Wunder\u2019s report by claiming that Dr. Wunder\u2019s conclusion was based on insufficient findings. Claimant, for example, asserts that Dr. Wunder\u2019s failure to address claimant\u2019s prolonged ability to stand or walk renders the doctor\u2019s opinion suspect. Claimant\u2019s counsel, however, is not a physician and absent anything other than his speculation that something is amiss, Dr. Wunder\u2019s medical expertise should be given deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">For these reasons, we reject claimant\u2019s objections to the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\n<em>Nonmedical Challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">In <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946, this court emphasized the need for the Industrial Commission to look beyond a claimant\u2019s medical record:</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">\u201cIn determining permanent total disability, the Industrial Commission must evaluate the evidence concerning the degree to which the claimant\u2019s ability to work has been impaired. The ultimate consideration is whether the claimant is \u2018 \u201cunfit for sustained remunerative employment.\u201d \u2019 (Emphasis deleted.) <em>State, ex rel. Paragon, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 72, 5 OBR 127, 448 N.E.2d 1372. Any conclusion with regard to permanent total disability must address the claimant\u2019s ability to work. <em>State, ex rel. Hutt, v. Frick-Gallagher Mfg. Co. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 184, 11 OBR 497, 464 N.E.2d 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">\u201cIn making a determination of the degree to which the claimant\u2019s ability to work has been impaired, and to answer the query as to whether the claimant is unfit to work at any sustained remunerative employment, the commission must look to a broad number of pertinent factors. It must review all the evidence in the record including the doctors\u2019 reports and opinions. The commission must also review any evidence relative to the claimant\u2019s age, education, work record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>psychological or psychiatric factors if present, and that of a sociological nature.\u201d <em>Id., </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 170, 31 OBR at 372, 509 N.E.2d at 949-950.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">These nonmedical factors came to be known as <em>\u201cStephenson\u201d </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In the present case, the commission, after mentioning <em>Stephenson </em>factors such as Hopkins\u2019 age, education, work history and impairment, concluded that the claimant was capable of obtaining remunerative employment and was, thus, not permanently and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">When reviewing a commission\u2019s denial of permanent total disability compensation, this court has looked to see if there is \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987) 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">No evidence supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that, in light of the <em>Stephenson </em>factors, Hopkins is likely to return to the job market. Quite to the contrary, there is uncontradicted testimony of a vocational expert who, based on <em>Stephenson </em>factors, concluded that Hopkins was unemployable. Because there was no evidence presented which supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that Hopkins was capable of obtaining remunerative employment, the commission was obligated to find Hopkins permanently and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and a writ of mandamus is issued to compel the Industrial Commission to award permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-10\">A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b158-11\">Wright, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b158-12\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b158-13\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqa\">concurring. I concur in the judgment reached by the majority because I believe there was an abuse of discretion by the Industrial Commission with respect to the <em>Stephenson </em>factors. I continue to believe, however, that <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666, was poorly reasoned and should not be used as a basis for reaching a decision in any cases except those in which the commission has abused its discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
