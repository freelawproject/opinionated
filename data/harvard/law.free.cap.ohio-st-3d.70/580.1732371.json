Because the commission\u2019s decision is supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d claimant\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">The May 14,1990 starting date coincides with the date of Dr. Ward\u2019s report, on which the commission relied to award permanent total disability compensation. Ward\u2019s report provides \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision. That other evidence could have supported a different date is immaterial, since that evidence \u2014 namely the February 12, 1990 report of Dr. Emmanuel D. Noche \u2014 was not evidence on which the commission relied. While the commission order also cited Dr. Smith\u2019s April 20,1984 report, it did not abuse its discretion in not awarding compensation as of that date since, unlike Dr. Ward, Dr. Smith limited his opinion to the preclusion of claimant\u2019s return to his former position of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">The appellate court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b699-14\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
