OCF alleges multiple defects in the report \u2014 either alone or in tandem with Knight\u2019s deposition \u2014 which OCF claims negates the document\u2019s evidentiary value.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Among other allegations, OCF asserts that Knight retracted any opinion as to permanent total impairment in a subsequent deposition. OCF bases this allegation on the following exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u201cQ. [OCF] Are you aware of Deloris Wolfe\u2019s current medical treatment requirements?</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u201cA. [Doctor] No.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u201cQ. Do you know what medication she is currently taking, if any?</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\"><em>a </em>\u2021 <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">\u201cQ. And with respect to whether this patient can perform some form of remunerative employment, would you agree that a physician who practices pulmonary medicine who is currently treating the patient would be in a better position to judge her ability to return to employment than are you?</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">\u201cA. Certainly at this time in view of the length of time that\u2019s gone by.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">\u201cQ. Well, with respect to her current ability to work or her current limitations with respect to work, you don\u2019t have an opinion today in 1989 as to what limitation she might have; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">\u201cA. I would have to agree with that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">The final question in the quoted excerpt gives rise to OCF\u2019s claim. OCF interprets Knight\u2019s response as an admission that he doesn\u2019t know whether claimant is still incapable of sustained remunerative employment. We consider this to be a credible interpretation of that exchange. Elsewhere in his testimony, however, Knight reaffirmed his opinion that claimant\u2019s condition was permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">To characterize Knight\u2019s testimony as a repudiation of the opinion expressed in his report requires removal of his report from evidentiary consideration. <em>State ex rel. Jennings v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 101, 1 OBR 135, 438 N.E.2d 420. Even a disability opinion that is merely equivocal is fatally defective. <em>State ex rel. Paragon v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 72, 5 OBR 127, 448 N.E.2d 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">Given his reaffirmation of permanency, we cannot characterize Knight\u2019s testimony as an outright repudiation. However, we do find that his ultimate disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>opinion is fatally equivocal. Therefore, pursuant to <em>Paragon, </em>we find that Dr. Knight\u2019s opinion is not \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the appellate court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b384-7\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.

I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and support the decision of the Industrial Commission. This is a \u201csome evidence\u201d case. Artful cross-examination cannot change that fact. The commission and the court of appeals found \u201csome evidence.\u201d We should not reverse such a decision especially where, as the majority finds, a doctor, Dr. Knight, \u201creaffirmed his opinion that claimant\u2019s condition was permanent.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b384-9\">Resnick, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
