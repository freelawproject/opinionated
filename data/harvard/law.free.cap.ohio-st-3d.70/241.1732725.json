Oakwood contends that the BTA\u2019s decision is unreasonable and unlawful because (1) it accepts Braman\u2019s testimony, which failed to adjust for improvements made to the subject property subsequent to tax lien date, or for the subsequent sale of excess land from his principal comparable sale, and (2) it did not determine the true value of the subject property but instead determined the \u201cvalue in use\u201d of the property, contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">While the appraisers disagreed on several points, they did agree that the highest and best use of the property was as a private country club and that the use of the income approach to value was inappropriate. Both appraisers used the Marshall Evaluation Service, but disagreed regarding costs of replacement and depreciation deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Braman testified about the market approach and the cost approach. He made adjustments based upon the time of sale of comparable properties, location, building size, site improvement and the indoor tennis facility. He structured the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>appraisal by computing a per-hole value of the selected comparable country club properties and of the subject property. He estimated the adjusted value of the comparables at $236,500 to $261,750 per hole and Oakwood\u2019s at $245,000 per hole. On that basis Braman concluded that the true value of the subject property was $4,410,000. This evidence did not constitute \u201cthe forbidden \u2018current use method\u2019 \u201d discussed in <em>Dinner Bell Meats, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 270, 271, 12 OBR 347, 348, 466 N.E.2d 909, 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The BTA\u2019s use of the market method of determining value was proper. The BTA was authorized to find, as it did, that the market approach was appropriate and the cost approach was not. See <em>Cincinnati Milacron Industries, Inc. v. Brown Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 32, 517 N.E.2d 896. See, also, <em>R.R.Z. Assoc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 198, 527 N. E.2d 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">We again endorse paragraphs three and four of the syllabus in <em>Cardinal Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d 13, 73 O.O.2d 83, 336 N.E.2d 433:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">\u201c3. The Board of Tax Appeals is vested with wide discretion in determining the weight to be given to evidence and the creditability of witnesses which come before the board. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">\u201c4. The fair market value of property for tax purposes is a question of fact, the determination of which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities, and this court will not disturb a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals with respect to such valuation unless it affirmatively appears from the record that such decision is unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">The BTA\u2019s acceptance of Braman\u2019s appraisal, adjusted as it was for costs of improvements since the tax lien date, and in view of Braman\u2019s explanation of why the sale of excess lands does not affect the true value of comparable properties, is not unreasonable or unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">Oakwood\u2019s argument on value in use is not persuasive. In <em>Dinner Bell Meats, Inc., supra, </em>12 Ohio St.3d at 271-272, 12 OBR at 348-349, 466 N.E.2d at 910-911, we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">\u201cAppellant contends that the appraisal of William Kaplan was based on the forbidden \u2018current use method,\u2019 and, as such, should not have been considered by the board * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">\u201cInitially we note that Section 2, Article XII of the Ohio Constitution mandates that valuations of property cannot be limited to considerations of current use only to the exclusion of all other relevant factors. It does not prohibit altogether any consideration of the present use of a property. A review of the two appraisals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>before the Board of Tax Appeals reveals that each appraiser viewed the property as being \u2018special purpose\u2019 in nature. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u201cIt therefore appears, that in utilizing the \u2018cost approach\u2019 for a \u2018special purpose\u2019 building, Kaplan simply considered the utility of the properties in conjunction with the highest and best use of the meatpacking facility. The record supports the conclusion that Kaplan\u2019s report was a proper \u2018cost approach\u2019 appraisal, not a \u2018current use\u2019 appraisal as proscribed under the <em>Park Invest. Co. </em>series of cases [culminating in <em>State ex rel. Park Invest. Co. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 28, 61 O.O.2d. 238, 289 N.E.2d 579]. Accordingly, the appraisal was properly considered by the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">From the record before us, we find that Oakwood failed to present evidence to establish that the decision of the BTA was unreasonable or unlawful. We affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
