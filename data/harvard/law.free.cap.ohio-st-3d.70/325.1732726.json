Finding none meritorious, we affirm his convictions. We have also independently balanced the aggravating circumstances against mitigating factors, and compared the sentence to those imposed in similar cases, as R.C. 2929.05(A) requires. As a result, we affirm the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">I. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">In his first proposition of law, Webb claims that the prosecutor repeatedly commented in <em>closing </em>argument on Webb\u2019s refusal to testify, violating his Fifth Amendment rights. See <em>Griffin v. California </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106. We find that the comments complained of did not violate <em>Griffin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">In closing argument, the prosecutor said that Webb \u201ckilled his son\u201d and \u201ctried to kill every single person in his house.\u201d Webb interrupted the prosecutor, saying: \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d The prosecutor said: \u201cHe spoke.\u201d Webb claims that the words \u201cHe spoke\u201d were an implied comment on the fact that Webb had not testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">We cannot agree. The prosecutor\u2019s remark, on its face, dealt with what Webb said, not what he did not say. The question is \u201cwhether the language used was <em>manifestly </em>intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and <em>necessarily </em>take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>(Emphasis added.) <em>Knowles v. United States </em>(C.A.10, 1955), 224 F.2d 168, 170, quoted in <em>State v. Cooper </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 163, 173, 6 O.O.3d 377, 382, 370 N.E.2d 725, 733. From the record, we cannot conclude that the jury would naturally or necessarily interpret the words \u201cHe spoke\u201d as a comment on Webb\u2019s <em>failure </em>to speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Webb construes many other remarks as comments on his failure to testify. Discussing Pursifull\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor said: \u201cYou will see in [Webb\u2019s] hospital records *\u25a0 * * he was in good health before the fire. * * * This is uncontradicted.\u201d The defense objected. The prosecutor added: \u201cPursifal\u2019s <em>[sic </em>] comments are unrebutted that the defendant told him he had the serious colon cancer * * The defense did not object, and thus waived any error with respect to this comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">A prosecutor generally may note that his or her evidence is uncontradicted unless it is evidence only the defendant could contradict. See Annotation (1967), 14 A.L.R.3d 723, 730-743. The \u201cuncontradicted\u201d medical records were not evidence that only Webb could contradict; he could have called his doctor to rebut them. Thus, \u201cthe comment [was] directed to the strength of the state\u2019s evidence and not to the silence of the accused * * <em>State v. Ferguson </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 5 OBR 380, 383, 450 N.E.2d 265, 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The prosecutor repeatedly said that Webb had not explained what happened to the money he took from the guardianship account, and Webb contends these remarks, violated <em>Griffin </em>as well. However, the context shows that these comments dealt not with Webb\u2019s failure to testify, but with Webb\u2019s failure to explain to the probate court and to his own family what he did with the money. We overrule Webb\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">In his second proposition of law, Webb contends that the prosecutor provoked him into interrupting the prosecutor\u2019s argument, then used the interruption as an excuse to comment on Webb\u2019s failure to testify. According to Webb, on the day closing arguments took place, the prosecutor told him during a recess that \u201che can\u2019t believe they [the defense] would stoop low enough to blame his daughters.\u201d Webb claims this incident somehow provoked his outburst during the prosecutor\u2019s summation, two hours later. Even if we accept this speculation as fact, this proposition of law stands or falls with Webb\u2019s earlier claim that the prosecutor\u2019s response to that outburst was a comment on Webb\u2019s silence. Rejecting that claim, we also reject Webb\u2019s second proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">In his fourth, fifth, and sixth propositions, Webb contends that the prosecutor argued \u201cnonstatutory aggravating circumstances\u201d in the penalty phase. Specifically, Webb objects because the prosecutor\u2019s argument emphasized the horror of Mikey\u2019s death by fire. As he did not object at trial, this claim is waived. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">II. <em>Evidentiary Sufficiency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Webb claims his convictions are not supported by legally sufficient evidence. In his twenty-second and twenty-third propositions, he contends that, in assessing evidentiary sufficiency, we are bound by <em>State v. Kulig </em>(1974), 37 Ohio St.2d 157, 66 O.O.2d 351, 309 N.E.2d 897, syllabus: \u201cCircumstantial evidence relied upon to prove an essential element of a crime must be irreconcilable with any reasonable theory of an accused\u2019s innocence in order to support a finding of guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus, we overruled <em>Kulig </em>and held that evidence, whether circumstantial or direct, is sufficient if a rational factfinder could find the crime\u2019s essential elements proven beyond a reasonable doubt. However, we announced that rule more than eight months after Mikey\u2019s murder. Hence, Webb claims, applying <em>Jenks </em>here would violate the constitutional prohibition of <em>ex post facto </em>laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\"><em>State v. Jones </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 244, 21 O.O.3d 152, 423 N.E.2d 447, supports Webb\u2019s contention. <em>Jenks </em>arguably decreased the quantum of proof necessary for conviction, see 61 Ohio St.3d at 272-273, 574 N.E.2d at 503, fn. 5, and <em>Jones </em>held that no such change could be retroactively applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\"><em>Jones </em>involved a statute giving the defense the burden of persuasion as to affirmative defenses, where before it had had only the burden of going forward; thus, the new statute \u201cdecrease[d] the quantum of proof required for criminal conviction.\u201d 67 Ohio St.2d at 249, 21 O.O.3d at 155, 423 N.E.2d at 450. We noted that <em>Calder v. Bull </em>(1798), 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 1 L.Ed. 648, had defined <em>\u201cex post facto </em>laws\u201d to include \u201c \u2018[e]very law that alters the <em>legal </em>rules of <em>evidence, </em>and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, <em>in order to convict the </em>offender.\u2019 (Emphasis <em>sic.)\u201d Jones, </em>67 Ohio St.2d at 248, 21 O.O.3d at 155, 423 N.E.2d at 449, quoting <em>Calder, </em>3 U.S. at 390, 1 L.Ed. at 650. By imposing a new burden on defendants, the statute allowed conviction on less testimony than required at the time of the offense; it was thus <em>ex post facto </em>as to crimes committed before it took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>However, <em>Jones </em>is fatally undercut by <em>Collins v. Youngblood </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 37, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 111 L.Ed.2d 30. Citing <em>Beazell v. Ohio </em>(1925), 269 U.S. 167, 46 S.Ct. 68, 70 L.Ed. 216, <em>Collins </em>summarized the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause as follows: \u201cLegislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.\u201d 497 U.S. at 43, 110 S.Ct. at 2719, 111 L.Ed.2d at 39. <em>Collins </em>specifically noted that \u201c[t]he <em>Beazell </em>definition omits the reference * * * to alterations in the \u2018legal rules of evidence.\u2019 * * * [T]his language was not intended to prohibit the application of new evidentiary rules in trials for crimes committed before the changes.\u201d <em>Collins, </em>497 U.S. at 43, 110 S.Ct. at 2719, 111 L.Ed.2d at 39, fn. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Retroactive application of <em>Jenks </em>\u201cdoes not punish as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; nor make more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission; nor deprive one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed.\u201d <em>Collins, </em>497 U.S. at 52, 110 S.Ct. at 2724, 111 L.Ed.2d at 45. <em>Jenks </em>changed only the \u201cevidentiary standard,\u201d <em>Jones, </em>67 Ohio St.2d at 248, 21 O.O.3d at 155, 423 N.E.2d at 449, and <em>Collins </em>establishes that new evidentiary rules may be applied retroactively. Therefore, a rule changing the quantum of proof required for conviction may be applied to trials of crimes committed before the rule was announced, without violating the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. To the extent <em>Jones </em>holds the contrary, we overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">We also reject Webb\u2019s argument under Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, which denies the General Assembly power to make \u201cretroactive laws.\u201d That provision speaks only of the General Assembly; it does not apply to judicially created rules. A decision of this court overruling a former decision \u201cis retrospective in its operation, and the effect is not that the former [decision] was bad law, but that it never was the law.\u201d <em>Peerless Elec. Co. v. Bowers </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 209, 210, 57 O.O. 411, 411, 129 N.E.2d 467, 468. Thus, we overrule Webb\u2019s twenty-second and twenty-third propositions of law and apply <em>Jenks </em>to his twenty-fifth proposition, which presents his insufficient-evidence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">As to that claim, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573; accord <em>Jenks, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Webb argues that someone else could have set the fire. But Fire Chief Murphy found a two-liter pop bottle, one-third full of gasoline, in the basement. The bottle had Webb\u2019s fingerprints on it. There is no plausible innocent reason for Webb\u2019s fingerprints to be on a bottle of gasoline in a house that had just been set afire with gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Moreover, the jury could reasonably reject any theory involving an intruder. All doors had been locked. The front door was still locked when firefighters arrived. Investigators found no signs that the other doors had been forced. Moreover, Larry Beck, Webb\u2019s brother-in-law and next-door neighbor, had an alert dog who usually \u201cbarks if there\u2019s a noise outside.\u201d Beck\u2019s dog did not bark on the morning of the fire, a fact remarkable enough for Beck to mention to police. (Although Beck later downplayed the dog\u2019s alertness, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The evidence shows that Webb had domestic, financial, personal and other motives to have his wife and children dead. He was aware that the lives of Susan and the children were insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Webb lied to Amy about his actions during the fire. He told her that he was \u201cgoing to get Susan\u201d and was reaching for the master bedroom\u2019s doorknob when the explosion propelled him into the bathroom. That could be true only if the fire had moved toward the bathroom. But according to Fire Chief Murphy, the fire started at the bathroom door and moved toward the foyer and living room at the hallway\u2019s other end. Moreover, to open the bedroom door, Webb would have had to stand in the path of the flaming gasoline trailer, which extended into the bathroom and master bedroom. In that case, Webb and his clothing would have been burned. Yet his shirt, which the state produced at trial, was not burned at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">A matchbook was found in the toilet, further supporting the state\u2019s theory that the fire started at the bathroom door. That matchbook bore the logo of a Tennessee motel where the Webbs had vacationed earlier that month. The matchbook found outside bore the same logo. It also bore Webb\u2019s bloody fingerprint, and the print\u2019s location indicated that Webb had been lighting a match.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Webb lied to his brother-in-law, telling him a firebomb had been thrown through the bathroom window. Webb knew better; by his own admission, he was near the bathroom when the fire started and broke the window himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">To sum up: physical evidence linked Webb to the gasoline, the matches, and the fire\u2019s point of origin. He had strong motives to kill. He lied to his family about the fire. A reasonable trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, could have found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Webb contends that the state failed to prove intent to kill Susan, Tami, Amy, or Charlie. We disagree. The trailer on the first floor led into the master bedroom up to the foot of Susan\u2019s bed, which was right next to Charlie\u2019s crib. Gasoline was found on Tami\u2019s bed, and Chief Murphy smelled it on Amy\u2019s bedclothes. That is sufficient to show intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Webb contends that no aggravated theft occurred, because Tami and Amy \u201cconsented\u201d to his defalcations. But they told the jury they were unaware Webb was taking their money.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In any case, it was the probate court\u2019s consent Webb needed; his daughters, minor children under guardianship, could not validly consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Webb further argues that the state did not prove he stole over $100,000, the amount required for aggravated theft. We disagree. The record shows that, from 1985 to 1988, Webb pocketed approximately $48,000 by redeeming CDs belonging to his daughters. He also ordered that the interest on the CDs be paid into his checking account; this amounted to nearly $11,700. (For some reason, the state includes only about half this amount, $5,800.) In 1989, Webb stole approximately $50,000 by redeeming CDs belonging to his daughters. He also incurred well over $5,000 in penalties by prematurely redeeming CDs. The premature redemptions facilitated Webb\u2019s stealing and deprived his daughters of additional money. We consider the resulting penalties part of \u201cthe value of the property * * * stolen,\u201d R.C. 2913.02(B), pushing the total to over $115,000. Webb\u2019s twenty-fifth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">III. <em>Opinion Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">In his third proposition of law, Webb complains that two police officers improperly gave opinion testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Sergeant William Johnson was asked: \u201cNow, between you and Chief Sn[y]der * * * following up on what you obtained from both investigation of the fire * * * and from other persons did you later draw a conclusion with regard to Mr. Pursifal\u2019s [sic] involvement?\u201d Johnson said he had concluded Pursifull \u201chad no involvement whatsoever * * A timely objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Johnson\u2019s opinion was inadmissible. Evid.R. 701 limits lay opinion testimony to \u201copinions and inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d Johnson\u2019s opinion was not based wholly on his perceptions, but at least partly on information from Snyder, Pursifull, and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">However, this error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705. The record contains no evidence to implicate Pursifull. (Witnesses did testify that Webb had accused Pursifull of threatening him, but Webb\u2019s out-of-court assertions to that effect could not be used to prove the truth of the matters asserted and were not introduced for that purpose.)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Police Chief Ray Snyder testified that he searched Pursifull\u2019s car and found nothing \u201crelevant to the crime committed earlier that morning[.]\u201d This opinion was admissible. It was based on Snyder\u2019s own perceptions, and it was \u201chelpful\u201d because he would otherwise have had to explain, item by item, why each item in the car was not relevant. It was \u201c \u2018not practicable to place before the jury all the primary facts\u2019 \u201d on which Snyder based his opinion. Staff Note to Evid.R. 701, quoting <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR. Co. v. Schultz </em>(1885), 43 Ohio St. 270, 282, 1 N.E. 324, 332; Jacobs, Ohio Evidence: Objections and Responses (1989) 157, Section 701. We overrule Webb\u2019s third proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">IY. <em>Hospital Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Webb was hospitalized after the fire. At trial, the state introduced Webb\u2019s hospital records to show that his injuries disproved his statements about where he was when the fire started, and to show that Webb had lied about his health to Jim Pursifull in order to \u201cset [him] up,\u201d indicating prior calculation and design. In his fifteenth proposition of law, Webb contends that the use of his hospital records violated R.C. 2317.02(B), the doctor-patient privilege statute. The court of appeals held the records inadmissible but found harmless error. We agree with both conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">R.C. 2317.02(B)(1) provides that a physician may not testify \u201cconcerning a communication made to him by his patient in that relation * * R.C. 2317.02(B)(3) broadly defines \u201ccommunication\u201d to include \u201cacquiring, recording, or transmitting any information, in any manner, concerning any facts, opinions, or statements necessary to enable a physician * * * to diagnose, treat, prescribe, or act for a patient. A \u2018communication\u2019 may include, but is not limited to, any * * * hospital communication such as a record * * Thus, information placed in hospital records by a physician is privileged.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">However, error involving privilege is not a constitutional violation. In the first place, the privilege is not a requirement of due process. Privileges do not make trials more fair; they neither \u201cfacilitate the fact-finding process\u201d nor \u201csafeguard its integrity.\u201d 1 McCormick on Evidence (4 Ed.1992) 269, Section 72. Rather, they protect \u201cprincipled or relationship^] * * * that society deems worthy of preserving and fostering,\u201d even at some cost to the court\u2019s truth-finding function. Lily, Introduction to the Law of Evidence (2 Ed.1987) 381, Section 9.1. But, cf., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>State v. Rahman </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 150, 23 OBR 315, 319, 492 N.E.2d 401, 406-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Nor can we accept Webb\u2019s claim that the records\u2019 admission violated his i-ights under the Confrontation Clause. See <em>State v. Spikes </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 405, 21 O.O.3d 254, 423 N.E.2d 1122, paragraph one of the syllabus. As business records, hospital records fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception, see <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, 608, fn. 8; hence, their admission does not violate the clause. <em>White v. Illinois </em>(1992), 502 U.S. 346, -, 112 S.Ct. 736, 742, 116 L.Ed.2d 848, 859, fn. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Nonconstitutional error is harmless if there is substantial other evidence to support the guilty verdict. See <em>State v. Davis </em>(1975), 44 Ohio App.2d 335, 346-348, 73 O.O.2d 395, 401-02, 338 N.E.2d 793, 802-803, citing <em>State v. Cowans </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 96, 104, 39 O.O.2d 97, 103, 227 N.E.2d 201, 207. See, also, <em>State v. Diehl </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 389, 399, 21 O.O.3d 244, 251, 423 N.E.2d 1112, 1119 (Stephenson, J., dissenting); <em>State v. Nichols </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 65, 73, 619 N.E.2d 80, 86, fn. 6. Here, the state introduced substantial evidence, independent of the hospital records, that Webb\u2019s injuries were inconsistent with his having stood in the path of the blazing trailer. Webb\u2019s own expert witness testified that someone standing in the trailer\u2019s path \u201cwould burn up\u201d and \u201cwould die in three days.\u201d Yet Webb was not killed; his shirt was not burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">We also find substantial evidence of prior calculation and design. Webb poured gasoline down the hallway, into the bedrooms, onto Mikey\u2019s bed, and down the stairs. Physical evidence indicates that after he lit the trailer and broke out of the bathroom, he prepared to light another match. Since the record contains substantial independent evidence of the matters the state sought to prove with the hospital records, we find their admission harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">V. <em>Cumulative Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">In his twenty-first proposition, Webb contends that alleged errors, even if individually harmless, had a \u201ccumulative effect\u201d that denied him a fair trial. We have applied a similar \u201ccumulative error\u201d analysis in the past. See <em>State v. DeMarco </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 31 OBR 390, 509 N.E.2d 1256, paragraph two of the syllabus. In this case, we find only two cognizable errors (improper opinion testimony and improperly admitted hospital records), both harmless. We find that Webb was not denied a fair trial, and overrule this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">VI. <em>Plea Offer as Mitigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">During trial, the state offered Webb a plea bargain; had he accepted, the state would have sought leave of court to dismiss the death specifications. Webb turned it down, but now insists that he is entitled to the benefit of the bargain he refused. In his eighth, ninth, and tenth propositions of law, Webb contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the state\u2019s willingness to make a plea offer renders his death sentence \u201cinappropriate as a matter of law.\u201d Alternatively, he contends that the offer is at least a mitigating factor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">We rejected such a claim in <em>State v. Sneed </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 3, 16-17, 584 N.E.2d 1160, 1172, and see no reason to accept it here. A prosecutor\u2019s willingness to accept a life sentence pursuant to a plea bargain is not \u201crelevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Webb argues that the plea offer indicated that the prosecutor thought the death penalty inappropriate. We disagree. There could have been a multitude of reasons why the prosecutor may have offered a plea bargain. See <em>Wiggins v. State </em>(1989), 324 Md. 551, 574, 597 A.2d 1359, 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Nor is the offer mitigating under the Eighth Amendment, since a plea offer \u201cdoes not relate to the defendant\u2019s character, prior record, or to the circumstances of the offense * * *.\u201d <em>Davis v. State </em>(1986), 255 Ga. 598, 614, 340 S.E.2d 869, 883. See, also, <em>Wiggins v. State, supra; People v. Zapien </em>(1993), 4 Cal.4th 929, 989, 17 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 156, 846 P.2d 704, 738; <em>Huffman v. State </em>(Ind.1989), 543 N.E.2d 360, 377, overruled on other grounds, <em>Street v. State </em>(Ind.1991), 567 N.E.2d 102; but, see, <em>Jeffers v. Ricketts </em>(D.Ariz.1986), 627 F.Supp. 1334, 1358, reversed on other grounds (C.A.9, 1987), 832 F.2d 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">A prosecutor\u2019s offer to negotiate a guilty plea.in a capital case is not a mitigating factor under either R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) or the Eighth Amendment; thus, it follows that such an offer does not affect the appropriateness of the death penalty. Therefore, Webb\u2019s eighth, ninth, and tenth propositions fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">In Webb\u2019s eleventh proposition, he calls his trial counsel ineffective for waiving this issue. Since the issue is not waived, Webb\u2019s eleventh proposition fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">VII. <em>Disclosure of Grand Jury Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">In questioning witnesses Joseph, Larry, and David Beck, the prosecutor quoted from their grand jury testimony. The defense requested disclosure of the grand jury testimony, but the trial court refused. In his eighteenth proposition of law, Webb contends that the defense was entitled to see the Becks\u2019 grand jury testimony under Evid.R. 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Evid.R. 106 provides that, when a party introduces a statement or part thereof, the other party \u201cmay require him at that time to introduce any other part * * * which is otherwise admissible and which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.\u201d However, since the grand jury testimony is not in the record, we cannot determine whether this rule applies. In any event, the issue is not whether the grand jury testimony should have been admitted, but whether it should have been disclosed to the defense. Thus, the court of appeals correctly analyzed this issue, not under Evid.R. 106, but under <em>State v. Greer </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 139, 20 O.O.3d 157, 420 N.E.2d 982. The appellate court held the defense entitled to disclosure, but found harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Under <em>Greer, </em>an accused may not see grand jury transcripts unless he shows \u201cthat a particularized need for disclosure exists which outweighs the need for secrecy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>paragraph two of the syllabus; see, also, <em>State v. Patterson </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 181, 57 O.O.2d 422, 277 N.E.2d 201, paragraph three of the syllabus. Such a need exists where nondisclosure will probably \u201cdeprive the defendant of a fair adjudication of the allegations placed in issue by the witness\u2019 trial testimony.\u201d <em>Greer, </em>paragraph three of the syllabus. Finally, the trial court has \u201cdiscretion as to whether the particularized need * * * has been shown to its satisfaction.\u201d <em>Id., </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 148, 20 O.O.3d at 163, 420 N.E.2d at 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The court of appeals held that Webb showed need because \u201c[wjithout access * * * [he] was not able to evaluate whether or not the statements read to the jury needed to be clarified.\u201d But in citing the mere possibility that the statements \u201cneeded to be clarified,\u201d the court of appeals applied the wrong standard. It is always conceivable that grand jury material might be quoted out of context, but general assertions, citing no specific facts of record, do not establish particularized need. <em>State v. Richey </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 366, 595 N.E.2d 915, 927; <em>State v. Lawson </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 336, 345, 595 N.E.2d 902, 910. Webb had to show that nondisclosure would <em>probably </em>deprive him of a fair trial, and that the trial court abused its discretion by not so finding. There is no basis here to surmise that the prosecutor used the testimony misleadingly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Nor does Webb cite any other <em>specific </em>basis for finding particularized need. Webb speculates that the grand jury testimony might have contained material evidence or might have aided his cross-examination of the Becks by revealing contradictions. These arguments could be made in every case. Nothing in the record supports them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The trial court did not abuse its discretion, but reasonably found that Webb had not shown particularized need. Webb\u2019s eighteenth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">VIII. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Weighing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In his seventh proposition, Webb objects to the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion. None of his complaints has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">After a thorough consideration of the sentencing opinion, we find that the trial court reviewed all of the evidence, applied the appropriate weight to each factor, and made \u201cspecific findings as to * * * the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing * * R.C. 2929.03(F). Having found the indictment\u2019s specifications proven, the court properly set forth the evidence supporting that finding. Finding no merit in any of Webb\u2019s arguments, we overrule his seventh proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Webb contends in his nineteenth proposition of law that the aggravating factors did not outweigh the mitigating factors. After a thorough consideration of the record, we find no merit to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">IX. <em>Jury Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Webb alleges that a venireman proclaimed Webb\u2019s guilt during voir dire in front of other veniremen. In his twelfth proposition, Webb contends that the trial judge should have investigated this allegation more thoroughly.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">After the jury was seated, Jacquelyn Griffis, a spectator, told the prosecutor she had overheard a venireman discuss the case during voir dire; this venireman fit the description of a venireman who had been peremptorily removed. At the defense\u2019s request, the court called Griffis to testify. She testified that, during a recess in the voir dire, she went outdoors. There she saw a \u201cloud and boisterous\u201d man, whom she knew to be a venireman, talking to a black man and a woman; Griffis was unsure whether they were also veniremen. The loud venireman said Webb was guilty; his companions \u201clooked upon [him] with some disdain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">Defense counsel then asked that juror McDonald be voir dired; since only two jurors were male, counsel felt \u201ccertain\u201d he was the black man Griffis had seen the venireman talking to. When examined, however, McDonald didn\u2019t recall talking to anyone about the case, and Griffis told the prosecutor she had not seen McDonald. The defense sought no further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">Webb claims the trial court should have voir dired the whole jury. However, \u201c[t]he scope of voir dire is within the trial court\u2019s discretion * * *.\u201d <em>State v. Bedford </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 122, 129, 529 N.E.2d 913, 920. Here, after doing everything defense counsel asked, the court reasonably found the evidence did not warrant further investigation. We find no abuse of discretion and overrule this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>In his thirteenth proposition, Webb contends that venireman Justice was improperly excluded for opposing the death penalty. \u201c[A] juror may not be challenged for cause based on his views about capital punishment unless those views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties * * <em>Adams v. Texas </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 38, 45, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 2526, 65 L.Ed.2d 581, 589. Accord <em>State v. Beuke </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 29, 38, 526 N.E.2d 274, 284. The trial court\u2019s finding is entitled to deference and will be affirmed absent abuse of discretion. <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 412, 426, 105 S.Ct. 844, 853, 83 L.Ed.2d 841, 853; <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 203, 211, 58 O.O.2d 409, 414, 280 N.E.2d 915, 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Justice initially said she \u201cwould have trouble\u201d .recommending death even if the facts warranted it. She specifically admitted that her views would bias her and substantially impair her ability to sit at the penalty phase. She thought she would hold to those views \u201cunder almost any circumstances,\u201d and said impartiality \u201cwould be * * * extremely difficult.\u201d Asking leading questions, defense counsel got Justice to concede she could follow the court\u2019s instructions and listen to the evidence, but even then she hedged, stating that imposing death \u201cwould be real hard to live with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Justice then asked to approach the bench because \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can say this out in court without getting emotional * * At sidebar, she explained that an event in her past would make it \u201cextremely difficult for me to find a verdict of guilty if I knew * * * that I would sentence him to death * * * even though up here (motioning to head) I was convinced that I did the right thing. * * * <em>I don\u2019t think I could do it based on that.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Justice was properly excused: the record supports a finding that her views would have substantially impaired her performance of duty in accordance with her instructions and oath. Webb\u2019s focus on the answers his counsel extracted from Justice is misplaced; it was the trial court\u2019s job to decide which of Justice\u2019s conflicting \u201canswers reflected her true state of mind.\u201d <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 30, 553 N.E.2d 576, 586. Webb\u2019s thirteenth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">X. <em>Tax Returns</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">In his fourteenth proposition, Webb contends that the state violated his Fifth Amendment privilege when it subpoenaed copies of his federal income tax returns for 1986,1987,1988, and 1989 from his tax preparer and introduced them at trial. However, a taxpayer\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege is not violated by enforcement of a subpoena against his accountant because \u201cthe ingredient of personal compulsion against an accused is lacking.\u201d <em>Couch v. United States </em>(1973), 409 U.S. 322, 329, 93 S.Ct. 611, 616, 34 L.Ed.2d 548, 554. Accord <em>Cincinnati v. Bawtenheimer </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 260, 264, 586 N.E.2d 1065, 1068, fn. 2. Moreover, state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ments on tax returns are not \u201ccompelled.\u201d A taxpayer may assert the Fifth Amendment privilege on his return; if he answers the questions instead, he does so voluntarily. <em>Garner v. United States </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 648, 96 S.Ct. 1178, 47 L.Ed.2d 370. We overrule this proposition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">XI. <em>Character Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In his sixteenth proposition, Webb contends that the state introduced evidence of his bad character, violating Evid.R. 404. The prosecutor asked Tami Webb whether her father\u2019s frequent calls and visits to Nadine Puckett were \u201cout of character\u201d and whether Webb was \u201cthe type of person\u201d to do such a thing. Tami replied: \u201cIt depends on what it was for,\u201d adding that Puckett \u201chad been through a lot, and my father is a very compassionate man. And I think that he was just being a friend to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We agree with Webb that this was character evidence. However, Evid.R. 404(A) and (B) bar such evidence only when it is used to show that a person acted in conformity with a character trait on a particular occasion. The prosecutor did not use Tami\u2019s testimony for that purpose; on the contrary, he used it to show that Tami\u2019s view of Webb\u2019s character was at odds with Webb\u2019s behavior, demonstrating the depth of Tami\u2019s bias. Indeed, had her testimony been used to show Webb\u2019s conduct, it could only have helped him; she spoke nothing but good of his character. Her testimony hurt Webb for precisely the same reason it was admissible \u2014 because it was <em>not </em>used to show conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Webb\u2019s other complaints also lack merit. The prosecutor asked Tami whether it would surprise her to discover that Webb had planned to leave Susan. Tami said it would because \u201cthe relationship was good.\u201d The prosecutor then suggested that a prior statement by Tami was \u201cnot a ringing endorsement of * * * their relationship.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Tami said the relationship \u201cwas average, I guess. * * * \u201d This was not character evidence. Webb\u2019s feelings toward Susan were relevant to show why he tried to kill her. Likewise, evidence of Webb\u2019s relations with Nadine Puckett went to motive. Webb\u2019s sixteenth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">XII. <em>Witnesses Called by Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">At the state\u2019s request, the trial court called Susan and Tami Webb as court\u2019s witnesses, allowing both parties to cross-examine them under Evid.R. 614(A). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>his seventeenth proposition, Webb contends that this was error. According to Webb, a court may not call its own witness at a party\u2019s request, unless the court finds that the requesting party would be entitled to lead the witness on direct under Evid.R. 611(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Webb\u2019s argument has no basis in either rule. Evid.R. 611(C) in no way purports to limit the trial court\u2019s power to call its own witnesses. Cf. <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 22, 514 N.E.2d 394, 398, citing <em>State v. Dacons </em>(1982), 5 Ohio App.3d 112, 5 OBR 227, 449 N.E.2d 507 (Evid.R. 607 requirements inapplicable to witness called by court at state\u2019s request). We reject Webb\u2019s seventeenth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">XIII. <em>Ineffective Assistance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In his twenty-fourth proposition, Webb contends that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not objecting to certain penalty-phase prosecution arguments. (See discussion of propositions four, five, and six, <em>supra.) </em>We disagree. The arguments were relevant to the statutory aggravating circumstances of arson and attempted multiple murder; therefore, counsel could reasonably conclude that they were not objectionable references to \u201cnonstatutory\u201d aggravation. Webb has not shown \u201cthat counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">XIV. <em>Settled Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">We overrule propositions twenty and twenty-six on authority of, respectively, <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus, and <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 371-372, 582 N.E.2d 972, 985-986.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">XV. <em>Independent Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">R.C. 2929.05(A) requires us to review Webb\u2019s sentence independently. We must weigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and consider whether the death sentence is disproportionate to sentences in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">Webb was convicted of two aggravated murder counts; as both involve the same victim, they merge. <em>State v. Huertas </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 22, 28, 553 N.E.2d 1058, 1066. There are two aggravating circumstances. First, Webb committed the murder while committing aggravated arson. R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). In assessing this circumstance\u2019s weight, we think it relevant to take into consideration the method Mikey Webb\u2019s father chose to execute his plan. Mikey suffocated from smoke inhalation, and he also suffered burns over seventy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>eighty percent of his body. He died in fear as well as pain: a firefighter found him hiding under his bed in a fetal position.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Second, the murder was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful attempt to kill two or more persons. R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). Here, Webb attempted to kill four other people. As a result, Susan and Charlie both sustained burns on twenty percent of their bodies. Charlie had to wear a mask for twenty-two hours daily to prevent facial scarring.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In the penalty phase, ten of Webb\u2019s friends and relatives came to plead for his life. Webb also made an unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Webb\u2019s father died when Webb was only twelve. His mother testified that this caused him to withdraw and have \u201cproblems associating with the family.\u201d Webb\u2019s IQ was once measured at sixty-four, and he dropped out of ninth grade. However, by the time he took the GED exam, his IQ was measured at one hundred five.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Webb married his first wife, Linda, in 1968. After two years in the Army, he was honorably discharged in 1970. Tami was born that year and Amy in 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">In 1978, Linda was killed and Amy was badly injured in an auto accident. Though devastated by Linda\u2019s death, Webb visited Amy daily in the hospital and stayed overnight three times a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">Webb later remarried, but his second marriage ended in divorce. He married his third wife, Susan, in 1986, and they had two sons, Mikey and Charlie. Webb experienced financial difficulties during the late 1980s.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">Webb\u2019s family and friends testified that he was a loving, attentive father, and his family would miss him sorely. Tami testified that \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for my father, I couldn\u2019t make it through some of the stuff I\u2019ve been through.\u201d Amy said: \u201cHe\u2019ll always be there if I need to talk to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">Susan testified that Webb is very close to Charlie. \u25a0 \u201c[W]hen Charlie was in the hospital * * *, no one could get Charlie to respond but Mike * *</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">Witnesses described Webb as \u201cfriendly and outgoing,\u201d and the family\u2019s \u201cpeacemaker.\u201d His mother said: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to hurt anything.\u201d Webb got upset when his brother-in-law \u201ccame down on his children a little bit hard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">The witnesses emphasized that Webb\u2019s family will suffer if he is executed. In his unsworn statement, Webb said: \u201cIf you take my life, you\u2019ll be taking my mother\u2019s life.\u201d Webb\u2019s half-brother agreed. Susan said: \u201cI don\u2019t see how Charlie would be able to cope * * * in this community having a daddy who has been killed or is on death row.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">Webb\u2019s family clearly loves him and believes in his innocence, even though some of them were targets of his murder plot. Of course, Webb\u2019s family is biased; it is natural that his loved ones cannot believe him capable of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>horrible crimes, even in the face of the evidence. Their testimony deserves some weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Webb\u2019s history and background afford little mitigation. His honorable military service during wartime (but for an injury, he would have gone to Vietnam) deserves some weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The trial court found the premature deaths of Webb\u2019s father and first wife mitigating, but we do not. While those deaths evoke sympathy, mere sympathy is not mitigation, and Webb has not shown that the murder was \u201cattributable to\u201d those events. <em>California v. Brown </em>(1987), 479 U.S. 538, 545, 107 S.Ct. 837, 841, 93 L.Ed.2d 934, 942 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Nor is Webb\u2019s IQ mitigating. There was neither expert testimony on its meaning nor any indication that low intelligence had any relationship to the crimes. We also disagree with the trial court\u2019s apparent belief that Webb\u2019s relationship with Nadine and his thefts from his daughters are mitigating. However, Webb\u2019s money problems presumably contributed to his crimes, and that is a mitigating factor, though a weak one.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Webb argues residual doubt, but this, if mitigating at all, is weak. No evidence links anyone but Webb to the fire, and Tami\u2019s testimony about a man in a red sweatshirt is unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The aggravating circumstances are unusually significant. Webb tried to destroy by arson five human lives \u2014 the lives of those who loved him most, as the record shows, and whom he should have loved most. We find that aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The. death penalty is therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The death penalty is also proportionate. The most comparable case is <em>State v. Grant </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 620 N.E.2d 50. In <em>Grant, </em>given the same aggravating circumstances and similar facts \u2014 the defendant murdered her two children by arson for insurance money \u2014 we affirmed the death penalty. Grant killed more people than Webb, but Webb intended to kill five. And unlike Webb, Grant was \u201craised in an environment where human life was not greatly valued.\u201d 67 Ohio St.3d at 486, 620 N.E.2d at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b461-12\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\">. Though the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause \u201cdoes not of its own force apply to the Judicial Branch,\u201d <em>Marks v.

Warner </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 31, 66, 564 N.E.2d 18, 50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b452-9\">. We note that R.C. 2921.22(E)(3) requires hospitals to report \u201cany burn injury * * * that shows evidence of having been inflicted in a violent, malicious, or criminal manner,\u201d and R.C. 2921.22(E)(5) provides that \u201cevidence regarding a person\u2019s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury\u201d is unprivileged \u201cin any judicial proceeding resulting from a report submitted pursuant to\u201d R.C. 2921.22(E). However, the record does not show whether any such report was made, nor has the state invoked these statutes at trial or on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b454-11\">. Webb did not argue at trial that the plea offer was a mitigating factor; he thus waived his claim that the trial court should have considered it or instructed the jury to do so. <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 24, 30, 528 N.E.2d 1237, 1244. However, he did argue on appeal that the plea offer was mitigating, thus preserving his claim that the court of appeals should have considered it on independent review. Moreover, Webb contends that the plea offer barred the death penalty altogether; if that is true, Webb\u2019s death sentence is plain error, for the sentence \u201cclearly would have been otherwise\u201d but for the error. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph one of the syllabus. We therefore reach the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b455-9\">. At trial, Webb argued that the prosecutor had taken a witness\u2019s statement to police out of context, and thus might do the same with the grand jury testimony, creating a need for Webb to see it. However, the prosecutor gave the witness an opportunity to explain his statement; hence, we find no prosecutorial duplicity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b458-10\">. Webb also suggests that the copies admitted at trial were inadmissible because they were unsigned. We disagree. The Webbs\u2019 tax preparer testified that the exhibits were copies of the Webbs\u2019 1986-1989 returns and that the Webbs had supplied the information contained thereon. This authenticated the exhibits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b458-11\">. When an investigator asked Tami whether Webb was affectionate to Susan, Tami allegedly said: \u201cHe\u2019s never beat her, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
