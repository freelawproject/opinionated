Where the record contains some evidence to support the commission\u2019s factual conclusions, its decision will stand. Conversely, where the record contains no evidence to support the commission\u2019s order, an abuse of discretion will be found. See <em>State ex rel. Hughes v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 71, 73, 26 OBR 61, 63, 498 N.E.2d 459, 461; <em>State ex rel. Kokocinski v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 186, 188, 11 OBR 499, 500-501, 464 N.E.2d 564, 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">The final SHO order in the case <em>sub judice </em>found that Dr. Yoder\u2019s \u201c[office] notes plus his reports, taken in totality, show the claimant has reached maximum medical improvement.\u201d Indeed, the only evidence cited by the commission was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>generated by Dr. Yoder. The broad issue, therefore, is whether Dr. Yoder\u2019s office notes and reports, taken in totality, constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d that claimant has reached the maximum medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In light of the parties\u2019 arguments, and in light of the opinions rendered in the court of appeals, it is necessary to bifurcate the issue. We must first determine whether Dr. Yoder\u2019s August 27, 1991 report is susceptible of differing interpretations regarding the permanence of claimant\u2019s medical condition. If it is, the matter ends there, and the commission acted within its discretion. If it is not, we must then determine whether Dr. Yoder\u2019s June 6, 1991 report plus his office notes afford the commission some basis upon which to reject the doctor\u2019s August 27 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">R.C. 4123.56(A) provides that TTD payments \u201cshall not be made for the period * * * when the employee has reached the maximum medical improvement.\u201d Maximum medical improvement is equatable with the concept of permanence. <em>State ex rel. Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Co. v. Kohler </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 109, 110, 564 N.E.2d 76, 78. It \u201crelates solely to the perceived longevity of the condition at issue [and not to] the claimant\u2019s ability to perform the tasks involved in his former position of employment * * *. [It is defined] as a condition which will, \u2018 * * * with reasonable probability, continue for an indefinite period of time without any present indication of recovery therefrom.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Vulcan Materials Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 25 OBR 26, 27, 494 N.E.2d 1125, 1127. Thus, so long as the claimant\u2019s condition has not stabilized, and further medical improvement can be expected, TTD benefits are payable. See 1C Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1992), Sections 57.12(b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Accordingly, Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(A)(l) defines \u201cmaximum medical improvement\u201d as \u201ca treatment plateau (static or well-stabilized) at which no fundamental functional or physiological change can be expected within reasonable medical probability in spite of continuing medical or rehabilitative procedures. A claimant may need supportive treatment to maintain this level of function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Although the syntax of Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(A)(l) is less than ideal in other respects, it clearly recognizes rehabilitative procedures as a viable treatment option for effectuating fundamental change in a claimant\u2019s medical condition. Under this provision, the question of maximum medical improvement turns on whether the proposed rehabilitative procedure is expected to improve or merely maintain the claimant\u2019s level of functionability.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">In addition, the nature of the proposed rehabilitative procedure is indicative of whether or not functional improvement is expected. As the court of appeals aptly explained in <em>State ex rel. Matlack, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 648, 659, 598 N.E.2d 121, 128:</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>\u201cFor instance, in <em>State ex rel. Copeland Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 238, 559 N.E.2d 1310, the court found that the claimant had not reached MMI where a doctor opined that claimant \u2018 * * * \u201chas likely reached maximal recovery unless he attends a chronic pain and stress center which I feel might be quite helpful in dealing with the multitude of problems of which he still complains. * * * Unless additional improvement is made in a rehabilitation type program, I feel that he has likely reached maximal recovery.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 239, 559 N.E.2d at 1311. By contrast, in <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 58, 521 N.E.2d 775, the court found permanency in a case involving permanent sensitivity and allergy to chemicals where a' doctor opined that the patient \u2018 \u201c * * * should be evaluated for rehabilitation in a field of work involving no exposure to petroleum products or other toxic chemicals. * * * \u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 59, 521 N.E.2d at 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">\u201cThus, there is a distinction in the case law between physical rehabilitation and occupational-type therapy related to the condition\u2019s improvement, and vocational rehabilitation or job training related to claimant\u2019s vocational improvement. The former type of rehabilitation can signify continuing possibility of medical improvement while the latter cannot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 assertions, the statement on Dr. Yoder\u2019s August 27 report, that \u201cthere is little hope in improvement in Carl Eberhardt\u2019s back symptoms unless he is treated through the Workers\u2019 Compensation rehabilitation program,\u201d is not susceptible of differing interpretations. \u201cUnless\u201d means \u201c1: under any other circumstance than that; except on the condition that * * * ; 2: without the accompanying circumstance or condition that; but that; But * * Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 2503. The stated purpose of the report was precisely to \u201cclear up this matter.\u201d Further, by indicating that it is claimant\u2019s \u201cback symptoms\u201d which can improve if he is \u201ctreated through the Workers\u2019 Compensation rehabilitation program,\u201d Dr. Yoder made clear that the rehabilitation program \u201cis the primary treatment modality that I have recommended * * *.\u201d The only meaning that can be ascribed to Dr. Yoder\u2019s August 27 statements, therefore, is that he was recommending physical or therapeutic rehabilitation with the expectation that it would improve the claimant\u2019s medical condition. In order to ascribe a different meaning, it would be necessary to revive the very ambiguity that the report clarified.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">We are well aware that in <em>State ex rel. Copeland Corp., supra, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 239, 559 N.E.2d at 1311, we considered language in a medical report that bears a striking similarity to the language contained in Dr. Yoder\u2019s August 27 report and remarked that such \u201ccomments are susceptible to differing interpretations.\u201d The only issue in <em>Copeland, </em>however, was whether such language constituted some evidence supporting the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s condition was <em>not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>yet </em>permanent. Thus, it was only necessary to decide in <em>Copeland </em>whether such medical language indicated the potential <em>for </em>improvement in claimant\u2019s medical condition. It was not relevant or necessary to consider and decide whether such language was also susceptible of the contrary interpretation that there was <em>no </em>potential for improvement in claimant\u2019s medical condition. Indeed, there is no indication that we gave any serious consideration in <em>Copeland </em>to the issue of whether the language utilized in the medical report, standing alone, <em>could </em>support a finding that the claimant had reached the maximum medical improvement. Having directly considered this latter issue in this case, we conclude that Dr. Yoder\u2019s August 27 report is not subject to differing interpretations and can only be found to indicate the potential for improvement in claimant\u2019s medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We hold that where an attending physician certifies a claimant as temporarily and totally disabled but indicates that there is little hope for improvement in claimant\u2019s condition unless treated through rehabilitation, and there is no other medical evidence indicating that claimant has reached the maximum medical improvement, it is an abuse of discretion for the commission to deny TTD benefits on the basis that claimant has reached the maximum medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The question remains, however, whether there was some other medical evidence before the commission indicating that claimant had reached the maximum medical improvement. Since the only medical evidence cited by the commission was generated by Dr. Yoder, the question becomes whether Dr. Yoder\u2019s medical statements made prior to his August 27 report afford some basis upon which the commission may reject the doctor\u2019s August 27 report.</p>\n<p id=\"AnC\">\u201c[I]t is the commission which determines the weight and credibility to be given to the medical reports admitted into evidence.\u201d- <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 21, 31 OBR 70, 73, 508 N.E.2d 936, 939. Thus, it is within the commission\u2019s discretion to reject these reports as unpersuasive. <em>State ex rel. Pavis v. Gen. Motors Corp., B.O.C. Group </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 30, 33, 599 N.E.2d 272, 274. Such discretion, however, is not unbounded. The commission is prohibited from arbitrarily rejecting competent medical proof. <em>Id. </em>Thus, there must be some reasonable basis for the commission\u2019s rejection of a physician\u2019s finding, and that basis should be placed in evidence and become part of the record. <em>State ex rel. Hutton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 9, 13, 58 O.O.2d 66, 69, 278 N.E.2d 34, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">In this regard, appellants advance the following argument: \u201cEven if one assumes that Dr. Yoder\u2019s August 27, 1991 letter to Mr. Eberhardt\u2019s attorney expresses a different opinion on maximum medical improvement than the June 6, 1991 report that Dr. Yoder had \u2018little hope of improvement in this patient in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>foreseeable future,\u2019 Dr. Yoder\u2019s reports are still nothing better than contradictory on the subject of that opinion. Mr. Eberhardt is the proponent of the award of compensation and bears the burden of proof on entitlement. This court has held that contradictory or equivocal statements by the same physician cannot, as a matter of law, support an award of compensation. <em>State ex rel. Walters v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 71 [20 OBR 402, 486 N.E.2d 94]; <em>State ex rel. Paragon v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 72 [5 OBR 127, 448 N.E.2d 1372].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\"><em>Walters </em>and <em>Paragon </em>do not lead to the conclusion advanced by appellants. A proper analysis must begin with <em>State ex rel. Jennings v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 101, 1 OBR 135, 438 N.E.2d 420. In that case, a physician concluded in his deposition that the claimant was not fit for sustained remunerative employment and was permanently and totally disabled, a statement which was in direct conflict with his original report. We rejected the commission\u2019s contention that the physician\u2019s deposition testimony did not detract from the probative value of the original report and held that \u201cwhere a medical expert has, by deposition testimony, repudiated a conclusion previously made in a medical report, that report cannot constitute evidence to support the order of the commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102, 1 OBR at 137, 438 N.E.2d at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">In <em>Paragon, </em>5 Ohio St.3d at 75-76, 5 OBR at 130, 448 N.E.2d at 1375-1376, we observed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">\u201cAlthough Dr. Cullen opines that appellant is totally disabled, he then states that he is <em>uncertain. </em>Dr. Cullen further indicates he does not believe appellant will ever return to work, yet he subsequently indicates that if the patient was \u2018motivated,\u2019 he could probably work. However, Dr. Cullen <em>fails to clarify </em>what he meant by the use of the term \u2018motivated,\u2019 and furthermore, it is <em>unclear </em>from the report whether the lack of motivation is directly attributable to the depressive neurosis. In short, Dr. Cullen\u2019s report is, at best, equivocal and, accordingly, we conclude that it does not constitute evidence upon which the commission may either grant or deny appellant\u2019s application.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">In <em>Walters, </em>20 Ohio St.3d at 73-74, 20 OBR at 404, 486 N.E.2d at 96-97, we observed that:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">\u201c * * * Dr. McCloud, subsequent to his medical report, changed his view concerning the effect appellant\u2019s impairment had on his employment prospects. For example, during deposition, Dr. McCloud first agreed with Dr. King\u2019s evaluation as to appellant\u2019s total disability, then stated that appellant was not unfit for some type of gainful employment and then again specifically agreed with Dr. King\u2019s findings as to both appellant\u2019s impairment and total disability. At worst, Dr. McCloud contradicted himself; at best, his conclusion that appellant was not totally disabled was equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\u201cThis court faced a strikingly similar situation in <em>[Paragon], </em>* * * We held that such an equivocal report \u2018does not constitute evidence upon which the commission may either grant or deny appellant\u2019s application\u2019 for permanent total disability benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 76 [5 OBR at 130, 448 N.E.2d at 1376]. See <em>[Jennings],</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\u201cIn the instant case * * * [t]he apparent uncertainty in Dr. McCloud\u2019s position gives the commission an insufficient basis to support its order denying appellant permanent total disability benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The rule that emerges from the foregoing is that equivocal medical opinions are not evidence. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Woodard v. Frigidaire Div., Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 110, 113, 18 OBR 143, 145, 480 N.E.2d 403, 406; <em>Kokocinski, supra, </em>11 Ohio St.3d at 188-189, 11 OBR at 501, 464 N.E.2d at 566. Such opinions are of no probative value. Further, equivocation occurs when a doctor repudiates an earlier opinion, renders contradictory or uncertain opinions, or fails to clarify an ambiguous statement. Ambiguous statements, however, are considered equivocal only while they are unclarified. <em>Paragon, supra. </em>Thus, once clarified, such statements fall outside the boundaries of <em>Jennings, supra, </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Moreover, ambiguous statements are inherently different from those that are repudiated, contradictory or uncertain. Repudiated, contradictory or uncertain statements reveal that the doctor is not sure what he means and, therefore, they are inherently unreliable. Such statements relate to the doctor\u2019s position on a critical issue. Ambiguous statements, however, merely reveal that the doctor did not effectively convey what he meant and, therefore, they are not inherently unreliable. Such statements do not relate to the doctor\u2019s position, but to his communication skills. If we were to hold that clarified statements, because previously ambiguous, are subject to <em>Jennings </em>or to commission rejection, we would effectively allow the commission to put words into a doctor\u2019s mouth or, worse, discount a truly probative opinion. Under such a view, any doctor\u2019s opinion could be disregarded merely because he failed on a single occasion to employ precise terminology. In a word, once an ambiguity, always an ambiguity. This court cannot countenance such an exclusion of probative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">In the present case, Dr. Yoder\u2019s August 27 report does not express a different opinion as to whether claimant had reached the maximum medical improvement than was expressed in his June 6 report or his office notes. Each statement made prior to August 27, 1991 which appellants describe as contradictory indicates that Dr. Yoder had exhausted the treatment procedures at <em>his </em>disposal and recommended outside rehabilitative procedures. Nowhere did the doctor indicate that claimant\u2019s condition was stabilized or static or that he had a poor chance of improvement, nor did the doctor ever use any other language suggest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>ing maximum medical improvement without also recommending rehabilitation. Each time Dr. Yoder stated a prognosis, he did so in conjunction with a recommendation for rehabilitation. What Dr. Yoder failed to do was state whether he expected the rehabilitation to improve the claimant\u2019s condition, or to state whether he was recommending physical or vocational rehabilitation. Such ambiguities were clarified in his August 27 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Thus, Dr. Yoder\u2019s statements previous to August 27, 1991 cannot serve as a basis for rejecting his opinion. Where a physician clarifies an ambiguity in stating his opinion, the Industrial Commission may not revive the ambiguity in order to reject that physician\u2019s opinion. There was no evidence, therefore, supporting the commission\u2019s finding that claimant had reached the maximum medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b776-8\">A.W.

This court must uphold a finding of the Industrial Commission when that finding is supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. The documented lack of improvement in the claimant\u2019s medical condition after two and a half years of treatment is in itself some evidence supporting the commission\u2019s finding of maximum medical improvement. Additionally, the treating physician\u2019s June 6, 1991 report can be interpreted as supporting the commission\u2019s finding. Even if the report can only be interpreted to support a temporary total disability finding, the commission could still have properly reached the maximum medical improvement result. Consequently, the commission\u2019s finding is supported by some evidence and therefore should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">The claimant\u2019s medical condition did not improve during the two and a half years he was under Dr. Yoder\u2019s care. Nearly two months after the claimant first came to Dr. Yoder, Dr. Yoder wrote that the claimant\u2019s \u201cback pain is unchanged.\u201d Over two months later he wrote, \u201cI feel [the claimant] has reached maximum potential that I can get him to and have recommended rehab program.\u201d During this time, another doctor, Dr. Hill, also treated Mr. Eberhardt. Dr. Hill also was unable to help the claimant. Over two years later, on June 6, 1991, Dr. Yoder made a recommendation for rehabilitation in his report: \u201cI have repeatedly tried to have [the claimant] involved in W.C. rehabilitation program, which for one reason or another has never worked out. I have reached the limits of my ability to find and correct a lesion and see only rehabilitation program, anti-inflamma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>tory medications as the forms of treatment. <em>I have little hope of improvement in this patient in the forseeable [sic] future.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The majority incorrectly concludes that Dr. Yoder\u2019s June 6, 1991 report can only be interpreted to support a finding of temporary total disability. In <em>State ex rel. Copeland Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 238, 559 N.E.2d 1310, this court unanimously held that a report very similar to the one made by Dr. Yoder was \u201csusceptible to differing interpretations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 559 N.E.2d at 1311. The doctor in <em>Copeland </em>wrote: \u201cI feel that he [claimant] has likely reached maximal recovery unless he attends a chronic pain and stress center which I feel might be quite helpful in dealing with the multitude of problems of which he still complains. * * * Unless additional improvement is made in a rehabilitation type program, I feel that he has likely reached maximal recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Copeland, </em>we held that the commission made a plausible interpretation of the doctor\u2019s report \u2014 that the claimant had not reached maximum medical improvement. We expressly noted that another interpretation was also plausible. The fact that the report was open to differing interpretations was not troubling, however, because it was sufficient that a plausible, though not necessarily the best, interpretation supported the finding of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The majority makes a vain attempt to distinguish this case from <em>Copeland. </em>The two doctors\u2019 reports are in substance identical. The majority\u2019s justification for its determination that the report in this case is susceptible of only one interpretation \u2014 supporting temporary total disability \u2014 is, at best, unconvincing. It is plain from the face of the opinion in <em>Copeland </em>that we found that report susceptible of more than one interpretation. One plausible interpretation was that the claimant had not yet reached maximum medical improvement. The only other possible, \u201cdiffering\u201d interpretation was that the claimant had reached maximum medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Interpreting Dr. Yoder\u2019s report to support a finding of maximum medical improvement is even <em>more </em>plausible in this case than in <em>Copeland. </em>First, the claimant in this case showed no signs of improvement from the beginning to the end of his treatment. Second, unlike the doctor in <em>Copeland, </em>Dr. Yoder\u2019s report did not discuss the nature of the recommended rehabilitation program or the likelihood that the program would aid the claimant. Instead, Dr. Yoder\u2019s report that he was not able to do anything more for the patient but prescribe anti-inflammatory medication and recommend rehabilitation is on its face susceptible of an interpretation that these were merely final gasps of a treatment regimen that had failed to produce results. Consequently, a reasonable interpretation of Dr. Yoder\u2019s statements is that the claimant had reached maximum medical improvement and that should be the end of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The majority\u2019s reasoning is in direct conflict with the regulations of the Industrial Commission. The decision today holds, in effect, that even where a claimant has made no medical improvement over an extended period of time, there is <em>no </em>evidence to support a finding of maximum medical improvement if a doctor suggests rehabilitation. In short, the mere suggestion that rehabilitation may be helpful, without any evidence regarding the likelihood of recovery or the nature of the rehabilitative program, is sufficient to preclude a finding of maximum medical improvement. As discussed above, the result reached by the majority is at war with our decision in <em>Copeland. </em>It is also contrary to Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(A)(l). That regulation provides that a claimant\u2019s enrollment or proposed enrollment in rehabilitation will preclude a finding of maximum medical improvement <em>only if </em>a \u201cfundamental functional or physiological change can be expected within reasonable medical probability * * In this case, Dr. Yoder merely recommended rehabilitation. He failed to opine that a change in the claimant\u2019s condition could be \u201cexpected within reasonable medical probability.\u201d In fact, Dr. Yoder gave no opinion as to the likely positive impact of the rehabilitation program on the claimant\u2019s condition. Dr. Yoder\u2019s August 27, 1991 letter, upon which the claimant and the majority rely so heavily, only indicates that the claimant would not improve without rehabilitation. Dr. Yoder does not state that the claimant\u2019s condition would improve with rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Even if Dr. Yoder\u2019s report can be interpreted to support only a finding of temporary disability, the fact that the claimant made no improvement in over two years of treatment independently qualifies as \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the maximum medical improvement finding. The majority is correct when it finds that the rehabilitation recommendation is not in conflict with Dr. Yoder\u2019s statements that the claimant\u2019s condition is not otherwise expected to improve. Looking at the issue from only that angle, however, misses how the commission could \u2022 have properly arrived at the maximum medical improvement finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The commission could have arrived at its decision after weighing the evidence of no medical improvement against the recommendation of rehabilitation. The majority barely touches on an important part of our jurisprudence: the decision regarding the credibility and weight of evidence is within the <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction of the commission. <em>State ex rel. Hart v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 95, 609 N.E.2d 166. The power to weigh evidence includes the power to weigh different items of evidence differently, as well as the power to assign different weight to portions of a single witness\u2019s testimony. In this case, the commission could have determined that the documented lack of medical success by Dr. Yoder was compelling proof that the claimant had reached maximum medical improve\u2022ment. The rehabilitation recommendation would not have been ignored, but merely would have received less weight in the decisionmaking process. As we discussed in <em>State ex rel. Pavis v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 30, 33, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>599 N.E.2d 272, 274, \u201cWhere a key question is left unanswered, the commission is entitled to conclude that the medical report\u2019s persuasiveness is either diminished or negated.\u201d Therefore, the commission could have properly given the recommendation less weight, because the treating physician did not explain the nature of the rehabilitation program or its chances of improving the claimant\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Because there is a proper way the commission could have arrived at its finding of maximum medical improvement, the commission did not abuse its discretion. Consequently, I would hold that, where a claimant has made no medical improvement in two and a half years of treatment, a commission finding of maximum medical improvement is supported by some evidence. Additionally, I would hold that a doctor\u2019s mere recommendation of rehabilitation, without evidence of a reasonable medical probability that rehabilitation would improve the claimant\u2019s condition, is insufficient to overcome a finding of maximum medical improvement where that finding is otherwise supported by some evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b779-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
