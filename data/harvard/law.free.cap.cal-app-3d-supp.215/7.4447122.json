It was further alleged that appellant had a blood-alcohol level of 0.20 percent or higher within the</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1670\">*1670</page-number>meaning of Vehicle Code section 23206.1. Appellant was charged in count II with driving while having 0.10 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his blood. The Vehicle Code section 23206.1 enhancement allegation was repeated in count II. A jury found appellant guilty as charged in both counts. Appellant admitted the prior convictions. We affirm the judgment as to count I, reverse as to count II, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">Expert Testimony Concerning Partition Ratios</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">Following his arrest, appellant submitted a sample of his breath for chemical analysis. The result of the breath test was converted to a blood-alcohol level by use of a blood-to-breath partition ratio of 2,100 to 1. That ratio is mandated by title 17 of the California Code of Regulations, section 1220.4, subdivision (f) (hereafter Title 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-7\">Appellant\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in limiting examination of expert witnesses concerning partition ratios. It is important to note at the outset that this case comes to us on a limited record. The record on appeal consists of a settled statement, a clerk\u2019s transcript, and a reporter\u2019s transcript covering a portion of the proceedings in the trial court. The settled statement does <em>not </em>set forth the evidence presented at trial <em>except </em>the testimony of the People\u2019s expert witness concerning blood-alcohol levels and partition ratios. The substance of that testimony is set forth below. In addition, the settled statement describes defense counsel\u2019s offer of proof as to the testimony of the defense expert concerning blood-alcohol levels and partition ratios. The reporter\u2019s transcript is similarly limited to proceedings concerning the allowable scope of the expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-8\">According to the settled statement on appeal, the People\u2019s forensic toxicology expert testified that in her opinion \u201call people are under the influence, for purposes of driving an automobile, at a blood alcohol level of 0.10%.\u201d She further testified \u201cthat the 2100:1 [blood-to-breath] partition ratio varies among people.\u201d Defense counsel made an offer of proof as to the testimony of the defense expert in matters of forensic toxicology: counsel expected the defense expert to testify that an individual\u2019s partition ratio is \u201ccharacterized by variations from moment to moment,\u201d and that it is not possible to measure an individual\u2019s partition ratio at any one point in time and then determine what ratio existed at an earlier point in time; further, the defense expert was expected to testify that partition ratios vary \u201cby the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1671\">*1671</page-number>general population\u201d from 600 to 1 to 3,000 to l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No physical tests were performed on appellant by the defense expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">The trial court ruled that under <em>People </em>v. <em>Pritchard </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d Supp. 13 [209 Cal.Rptr. 314], no evidence could be allowed that partition ratios can vary beyond the 2,300-to-l to 1,900-to-l range from which the 2,100-to-l ratio found in Title 17 was derived. This limitation was made applicable to both cross-examination of the People\u2019s expert and to the testimony of the defense expert. Defense counsel subsequently stated that as a result of the trial court\u2019s ruling it would \u201cbe fruitless and a waste of the court\u2019s time to put on a defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">At the time this case was brought to trial the prevailing rule of law had been established in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pritchard, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d Supp. 13 (hereafter <em>Pritchard). </em>In <em>Pritchard, </em>a prior panel of this court found that \u201cthe individual partition ratio is an individual physical characteristic of the defendant, and presumably can only be obtained through means of physical tests upon him. The defendant is in control of this information or at least of access to it. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 16.) Therefore, this court held, the \u201crule of convenience,\u201d whereby the initial burden of producing evidence on an issue is placed on the defendant <em>(People </em>v. <em>Montalvo </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 328, 334 [93 Cal.Rptr. 581, 482 P.2d 205, 49 A.L.R.3d 518]), applies to the partition ratio. Specifically, \u201cby . . . operation [of the \u2018rule of convenience\u2019] the defendant is in effect presumed to have a 2,100 to 1 partition ratio unless he presents evidence as to his personal partition ratio which establishes that the 2,100 to 1 ratio is not valid for him. General evidence of such a possibility of error in the partition ratio will not suffice to rebut this presumption.\u201d <em>(Pritchard, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 17.) The same conclusion was reached two weeks later in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gineris </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d Supp. 18 [209 Cal.Rptr. 317] (hereafter Gineris). And in <em>People </em>v. <em>Herst </em>(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 [243 Cal.Rptr. 83] (hereafter <em>Herst), </em>a prior panel of this court upheld the trial court\u2019s striking of a defense expert\u2019s testimony that partition ratios vary. The defendant in <em>Herst </em>presented no specific evidence as to her partition ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-7\">About a month after the trial in this case before us, the Court of Appeal for the Fourth District issued its opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>McDonald </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 877 [254 Cal.Rptr. 384], The defense expert in <em>McDonald </em>had testified, <em>without objection by the prosecution, </em>that \u201ca person\u2019s blood to breath partition ratio varies over time and does not remain constant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 880.) He further testified that \u201cwhile an individual\u2019s blood to breath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1672\">*1672</page-number>partition ratio could be measured, it would be speculative to say the same ratio existed at an earlier time when the subject took a breath test to measure his blood-alcohol content,\u201d and that \u201cit would be costly to conduct a series of tests to determine the variability of a person\u2019s partition ratio.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>No such tests were performed on defendant McDonald.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">The <em>McDonald </em>court held that on the facts before it \u201cit was error to instruct the jury that it should presume McDonald had a 2,100:1 partition ratio unless he presented evidence as to his personal ratio which either proved the contrary or raised a reasonable doubt. The effect of the instruction was to nullify [the defense expert\u2019s] testimony even though it was admitted without objection. The fact presumed by the instruction\u2014constancy of one\u2019s partition ratio\u2014was in doubt. The resolution of that doubt was a factual question for the jury.\u201d (206 Cal.App.3d at p. 884.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">The <em>McDonald </em>court reviewed the opinions in <em>Pritchard, Gineris </em>and <em>Herst, noting </em>that although those decisions appeared to be in conflict with the holding in <em>McDonald, </em>\u201ccloser analysis reveal[ed] an important factual distinction.\u201d (206 Cal.App.3d at p. 881.) The distinction was that \u201cin none of the three [prior] cases was there admissible evidence that a person\u2019s partition ratio is not constant and may vary over time.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 883.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-6\">Two additional comments by the <em>McDonald </em>court are of interest to us. First, the court stated: \u201cThe significance of [the defense expert\u2019s] testimony cannot be ignored because it directly contradicts facts <em>Pritchard, Gineris </em>and <em>Herst </em>presumed: that one\u2019s partition ratio is constant and can be measured by the defendant. The rule of convenience should not apply unless the \u2018exonerating fact is peculiarly within the defendant\u2019s knowledge . . . .\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pritchard, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 16; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Montalvo </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 328, 334 . . . .) As in <em>Montalvo, </em>the defense here does not \u2018have any substantially greater ability to establish [the exonerating fact] than does the prosecution.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Montalvo, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at pp. 334-335.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McDonald, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at p. 883.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-7\">The second comment of interest is as follows: \u201cIf [the defense expert\u2019s] testimony is incorrect, or not generally accepted in the scientific community (a conclusion we doubt in light of the testimony of the prosecution\u2019s own expert witness [that the partition ratio could be affected by external factors which vary over time]) we presume the next prosecutor will object accordingly in the trial court.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McDonald, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at p. 884.) <em>McDonald </em>did not expressly overrule <em>Pritchard, </em>but it does place in doubt the wisdom of applying the \u201crule of convenience\u201d to partition-ratio evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1673\">*1673</page-number>A review of the case law outside California reveals that several states disagree with the rule of law announced by this court in <em>Pritchard. </em>Those states allow general evidence refuting the accuracy and reliability of breath test readings to go to the trier of fact. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1989) 143 Misc.2d 270 [540 N.Y.S.2d 650]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hvistendahl </em>(1987) 225 Neb. 315 [405 N.W.2d 273]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brayman </em>(1988) <em>110 </em>Wn.2d 183 [751 P.2d 294]; <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarty </em>(S.D. 1988) 434 N.W.2d 67.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>143 Misc.2d at p.275, for example, the defendants brought motions to suppress the results of their breath tests. The court found that \u201cthe issue concerning the variation of an individual\u2019s blood-to-breath conversion ratio is more properly addressed at trial where the defendant will have an adequate opportunity to challenge the validity and reliability of the breathalyzer result. The margin of error in the breathalyzer test should be considered by the trier of facts in deciding whether the evidence sustains a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">The Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, recently overruled a lower court which had held that scientific opinion regarding the variability of partition ratios was admissible to challenge breath test results. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Downie </em>(N.J. Super.Ct. App. Div. 1988) 229 N.J.Super. 207 [550 A.2d 1313], overruling <em>State </em>v. <em>McGinley </em>(N.J. Super.Ct. Law Div. 1988) 229 N.J.Super. 191 [550 A.2d 1305], the appellate division held that it was bound by a New Jersey Supreme Court order that judicial notice <em>shall </em>be taken of the scientific reliability of the breathalyzer <em>(Romano </em>v. <em>Kimmelman </em>(1984) 96 N.J. 66 [474 A.2d 1]). The appellate division noted, however, that \u201c[t]he issues raised by defendants are of significant dimensions . . . .\u201d <em>(Downie, supra, 229 </em>N.J.Super. at p. 212 [550 A.2d at p. 1316].) That court stated further, \u201cWe can only suggest that this matter be reviewed immediately . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Leave to appeal has been granted by the Supreme Court of New Jersey. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Downie </em>(1989) 114 N.J. 498 [555 A.2d 618].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">We are persuaded by all of the above that the time has come to abandon the \u201crule of convenience\u201d adopted in <em>Pritchard. </em>As the Court of Appeal noted in <em>People </em>v. <em>McDonald, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d 877, 883, <em>Pritchard </em>and its progeny presumed that an individual\u2019s partition ratio is constant and can be measured by the individual. The current state of scientific knowledge with respect to partition ratios, as reflected in the proposed testimony of the defense expert here, refutes the premise on which the \u201crule of convenience\u201d rests: that the \u201cexonerating fact is peculiarly within the defendant\u2019s knowledge.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pritchard, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d Supp. 13, 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-7\">We conclude that it is for the trier of fact to determine whether general evidence with respect to the variability of partition ratios raises a reasonable doubt as to the presumed 2,100-to-l partition ratio. Any specific evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1674\">*1674</page-number>a defendant\u2019s partition ratio or range of such ratios is of course also relevant, but general evidence should not be precluded in the absence thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">Does the exclusion here of general evidence concerning the accuracy and variability of partition ratios dictate a reversal of the judgment? It is clear that evidence of appellant\u2019s blood-alcohol level was offered in support of the Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (b) count because that section defines the proscribed act directly in terms of blood-alcohol content. Despite the limited record before us, we find that the exclusion of the general evidence denied appellant a fair trial and requires a reversal of the judgment on the Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (b) charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">\u201cA fair hearing is a requisite of due process in both civil and criminal cases; hence its denial is an act in excess of jurisdiction . . . and reversible error per se.\u201d (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 364, p. 366.) The denial of a fair hearing is error of such a serious nature that article VI, section 13 of the California Constitution does not cure it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (See 9 Witkin, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at \u00a7 362, p. 364.) Where rulings on the admissibility of evidence prevent the defendant from introducing basic evidence in support of a key defense, and where the omission of the evidence is emphasized by jury instructions raising an issue as to the key defense, the exclusion of the evidence requires a reversal of the conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marsh </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 732, 740-741 [26 Cal.Rptr. 300, 376 P.2d 300].) The <em>Marsh </em>court so held in spite of substantial evidence supporting the convictions. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 735, 741.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">In the present case, we think it significant that defense counsel opined that it would be a waste of the court\u2019s time for him to put on a defense. We take that statement to mean that the entirety of appellant\u2019s defense would have been based on general evidence with regard to the accuracy and variability of partition ratios, and appellant\u2019s inability to establish that the 2,100-to-l partition ratio was inapplicable to him. In other words, the excluded evidence was the sole basis of appellant\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">In addition, the jury was instructed that \u201c[a]ny person who drives a vehicle with one-tenth of one percent (0.10%) of alcohol in his blood, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1675\">*1675</page-number>guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d The jury was further instructed: \u201cIf the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) a sample of defendant\u2019s blood, breath or urine was obtained within three hours after he operated a vehicle, and (2) that a chemical analysis of such sample established that there was 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood at the time of the performance of the chemical test, <em>then you may but are not required to infer </em>that the defendant drove a vehicle with 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood at the time of the alleged oifense.\u201d (Italics added.) These instructions correctly informed the jury that it was not required to infer that appellant drove a vehicle with a blood-alcohol level of 0.10 percent or higher. But the trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of general evidence concerning partition ratios prevented appellant from introducing the very evidence which appellant intended to rely upon to create a reasonable doubt whether he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.10 percent or more at the time of the charged offense. We conclude that the excluded evidence was basic to the defense, and the inability to put on a defense necessarily denied appellant his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">It is significantly less clear that evidence of appellant\u2019s blood-alcohol level was offered in support of the Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (a) count. The jury instructions given drew no connection between appellant\u2019s blood-alcohol level and the subdivision (a) charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record before us reveals only one reference to appellant\u2019s blood-alcohol level relative to the subdivision (a) charge: as noted above, the People\u2019s expert testified that in her opinion \u201call people are <em>under the influence, </em>for purposes of driving an automobile, at a <em>blood alcohol level </em>of 0.10%.\u201d (Italics added.) This reference, however, was of insufficient significance to warrant a reversal of the subdivision (a) charge. This is particularly apparent because a blood-alcohol level of 0.10 percent or more is not an element of the subdivision (a) charge. Therefore, general evidence as to the accuracy and variability of partition ratios was not basic to the defense of that charge. It follows that the exclusion of that evidence did not result in the denial of a fair trial as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1676\">*1676</page-number>subdivision (a) charge, and the theory of reversible error set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsh, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 732, 741, is inapplicable to the subdivision (a) count. We therefore must resort to the <em>Watson </em>test of probable prejudice. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">It was appellant\u2019s duty to present this court with a record of the evidence introduced at trial in order to show that error was committed in the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [84 Cal.Rptr. 863].) Appellant has not provided this court with a record of the evidence presented at trial in support of the Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (a) charge. As a result, this court cannot reach the question whether it is reasonably probable a result more favorable to appellant would have been reached had the general evidence at issue been allowed to go to the jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836.) Therefore, we must affirm the judgment as to count I of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">Jury Instruction<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-9\">The judgment is affirmed as to count I, reversed as to count II, and the case is remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-10\">Roberson, Acting P. J., and Swearinger, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1349-8\"> The offer of proof is summarized in the settled statement on appeal. However, it is also set forth in full in the reporter\u2019s transcript which has been made a part of the record on appeal. We rely on the reporter\u2019s transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1352-9\"> Article VI, section 13 of the California Constitution reads as follows: \u201cNo judgment shall be set aside, or new trial granted, in any cause, on the ground of misdirection of the jury, or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or for any error as to any matter of pleading, or for any error as to any matter of procedure, unless, after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d Under <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243], \u201ca \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 should be declared only when the court, \u2018after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence,\u2019 is of the \u2018opinion\u2019 that it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1353-6\"> With respect to the subdivision (a) count the jury was instructed as follows: \u201cAny person who, while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, drives a vehicle, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d (CALJIC No. 16.830 (1981 rev.).) \u201cA person is under the influence of an alcoholic beverage when as a result of drinking such alcoholic beverage his physical or mental abilities are impaired to such a degree that he no longer has the ability to drive a vehicle with the caution characteristic of a sober person of ordinary prudence, under the same or similar circumstances.
