He was convicted in 1958 of selling and concealing narcotic drugs in violation of Title 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705(a). He was given a plenary hearing on his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-25\">He contends that \u00a7 4705(a) is a revenue statute which does not apply to him but is limited to those persons who are required to register and pay the tax; the indictment was defective because it failed to name the person to whom the drugs were allegedly sold; the evidence was insufficient; the jury was not properly instructed; and his rights under the Sixth Amendment were abridged because the person to whom he is alleged to have sold the drugs was not present at the trial. There was no direct appeal from the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-26\">A review of the record convinces us that the District Court gave full consideration to all of the appellant\u2019s contentions and correctly denied the relief sought.
