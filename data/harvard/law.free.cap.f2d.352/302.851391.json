In its first appearance here review was sought of the Board\u2019s order dismissing an unfair labor practice complaint based upon the then petitioner\u2019s charges that he and several other employees had been wrongfully discharged by the employer, the present petitioner. After the original hearing, the Trial Examiner concluded that the discharges involved were discriminatorily motivated. Those evidentiary findings were adopted by the Board but the latter concluded that the employees were discharged for fighting. The Board therefore dismissed the complaint of unfair labor practice against the employer. In our opinion, Greco v. N. L. R. B., et als., 331 F.2d 165, 166 (3 Cir. 1964), we found that the Examiner\u2019s findings of fact, adopted by the Board as to the circumstances surrounding the discharges, \u201c * * * are based upon substantial evidence * * We held p. 169 that \u201cIn our view, these findings clearly preclude any inference that the employees were discharged for fighting. On the contrary, the mere recitation of them compels only one conclusion, that the discharges were discriminatorily motivated.\u201d We decided that, since the findings of fact adopted by the Board did not support its conclusion that the discharges were not discriminatory, its conclusion could not stand. The cause was remanded to the Board for further proceedings in conformity with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The Board thereafter reconsidered the matter, vacated its original order and adopted \u201cnot only the findings, but also the conclusions and recommendations of the Trial Examiner\u201d. The proceedings are now before us on the petition of the employer to review the action of the Board in determining that the employer had discharged the employees in question because of their opposition to the union\u2019s leadership. As we held in our prior opinion and as we reiterate from our own current second examination of the record, the Board\u2019s findings in that regard are \u2022supported by substantial evidence on the whole case. That part of the Board\u2019s order concerning back pay, including the interest allowed, is well within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The petition for review will be denied. The order of the Board will be enforced in full. A proposed decree may be submitted by the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
