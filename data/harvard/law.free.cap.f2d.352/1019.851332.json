On July 17, 1964 the District Court enjoined appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-19\">\u201c * * * from directly or indirectly infringing and from inducing others to infringe any of claims 1, 9, 10 or 12 of United States patent No. 2,932,728, without the consent of or license from the plaintiff SMOOTHOLMAN COMPANY, and specifically, but without limitation, from making and having made, from using, from selling and having sold, and from shipping and having shipped lighting fixtures as exemplified by Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits 35, 38(a), and 76 through 81.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-20\">The injunction was served on Moses, appellant\u2019s president, on that day, and he read it. An appeal was taken and a cash supersedeas bond in the sum of $1,500 was filed and approved on July 23. This effectively stayed the injunction. (Rule 62(d), F.R.Civ.P.). On July 27 appellee moved for an order increasing the amount of the bond and this motion was granted on August 7. The pertinent portion of the order reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-21\">\u201cThe writ of perpetual injunction served upon the defendant on July 17, 1964, will be stayed pending the appeal herein, provided that on or before August 13, 1964, the defendant Western Lighting Corp. shall file with the Court, cash or a bond in the amount of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-22\">No such bond was posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-23\">We think it clear that the injunction was stayed through August 13. The order does not expressly revoke the stay effected by the July 23 approval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>$1,500 bond. The language \u201cwill be stayed\u201d cannot fairly be construed as a revocation of the existing stay. Rather, the purpose and effect of the order was to terminate the stay if the increased bond were not filed on or before August 13. It is equally clear, then, that after August 13, the injunction was in effect. Thus the order appealed from cannot stand unless appellant violated the injunction after August 13. The court found that it did, and its finding is fully supported. Stated most favorably to appellee, the following are the facts shown by the record:</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">On May 1, 1964, appellant received a \u201cpurchase order\u201d from Valley Wholesale Electric Co. for 81 fixtures of a type described in the injunction. A unit price is entered opposite each type of item. Opposite the words \u201cShipping Date\u201d appears \u201cHold for release.\u201d A line is drawn through these words. The order also states \u201cShip Via\u201d \u201cBest,\u201d the latter word written in. Also written on the order is \u201cShip to: Don O\u2019Brian Elect <em>% </em>Madison &amp; Arroyo School \u2014 Pomona, Calif\u201d. On or after July 24, an employee of appellant wrote on the order \u201creleased for delivery 8/26/64 not B4 per Skip 7/24\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">A bill of lading dated August 10 was prepared by appellant. Two copies, No. 1, the original and No. 2, a partial carbon, are in evidence. No carrier is designated. The consignee is entered as \u201cValley.\u201d The bill refers to the May 1 order number and has on it the notation \u201cMark: Madison &amp; Arroyo Schools\u201d. No. 1 shows four items, with prices, a total of $2,257.00.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No. 2 shows only two items and no prices. Each is separately signed, apparently by the same person, for the \u201cShipper\u201d (appellant), and each signature is dated \u201c8/10/64.\u201d Nothing written on either is in the same hand as that of the signer. No. 1 bears, opposite the printed words \u201cDelivering Carrier,\u201d the handwritten letters \u201cO.T.\u201d Admittedly this means appellant\u2019s own truck. No such notation appears on No. 2. It can be inferred that the handwritten words and figures that appear on No. 1 but not on No. 2, were written after these papers were first prepared on August 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">In his affidavit, Moses says that the May 1 order was \u201cfilled\u201d on or about that day, that the fixtures were then stored in appellant\u2019s warehouse, that title passed to the buyer on May 1, that the bill of lading dated August 10 was appellant\u2019s \u201cway of confirming that title had passed,\u201d that appellant shipped the order to its warehouse on or about May 1, and that on September 10, and as a favor to Valley, he was asked by Valley to transport the fixtures to the school site, for which appellant made no charge. He further states that the August 10 bill of lading is the only shipping order in appellant\u2019s records, was issued on August 10, and completed appellant\u2019s \u201cshipping.\u201d (The quotes around \u201cshipping\u201d are his.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-11\">Appellant did not invoice Valley for the order until September 10, the price, $2,257, being the same as appears on the No. 1 copy of the August 10 bill of lading. Terms are stated to be <em>\u201c1% </em>10 days\u2014 net 30.\u201d None of the documents says anything about passage of title or risk of loss. However, appellant\u2019s catalogue states that \u201cdeliveries are F.O.B. Los Angeles with full freight allowed.\u201d It also states, under \u201cCLAIMS\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-12\">\u201cGoods are properly packed for shipping and our responsibility for safe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>delivery ceases when goods have been turned over to the transportation company at which time title passes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmN\">On the stand, Moses testified that appellant sends an invoice approximately at the time of sale \u2014 \u201canywheres from the day after to maybe a week, sometimes a little later,\u201d but \u201cnot necessarily on a hold order.\u201d He did not know when \"this\u201d invoice was prepared. He asserted that an order to manufacture, similar to the order from the original customer, is written up, that there is such an order for this transaction, but that he did not produce it. There is no one in-his concern but himself who can testify that the fixtures were stored in the warehouse, as stated in his affidavit. The warehouse is adjacent to his plant. The statement in his affidavit that \u201ca representative of Valley called me and stated that his truck was tied up and asked if [appellant\u2019s truck would transport] their [Valley\u2019s] property\u201d was incorrect. He was told by his shipping clerk that Valley called appellant corporation. He admitted that appellant\u2019s truck did haul the fixtures to the two schools on September 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">The court found that appellant \u201cdid * * * on or about August 26, 1964, ship certain of the devises [sic] to which the injunction relates as shown by invoices [sic] * * * in the amount of $2,257.00.\u201d It ordered appellant to pay appellee \u201ca fine of $500.00 and a further sum of $250.00 as attorney\u2019s fees incurred * * * in bringing and prosecuting this proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">We think that, except possibly for the date of August 26, the court\u2019s finding is fully supported. It could conclude that there was no \u201cdelivery,\u201d no passing of title, until at least August 26, the earliest shipping date authorized by Valley, that, on Moses\u2019 own theory, there was a \u201cshipping\u201d on that date, and that in any event there was a \u201cshipping\u201d on September 10. The court was entitled to be most suspicious of Moses\u2019 explanations and documents, and to reject the former and give to the latter an effect quite different from what Moses attempted to give them. To say the least, Moses was not candid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The injunction separately and specifically forbids \u201cshipping and having shipped.\u201d It was in effect at all times after August 13, and it was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">The only remaining question is as to the validity of the \u201cfine.\u201d This is a matter largely within the court\u2019s discretion. Yanish v. Barber, 9 Cir., 1956, 232 F.2d 939, 944; Brooks v. United States, 9 Cir., 1941, 119 F.2d 636, 646. The \u201cfine\u201d must bear some relation to, or not exceed, appellee\u2019s actual loss. (Yanish v. Barber, supra). In a patent infringement case, the \u201cactual loss\u201d of a plaintiff resulting from sales by an infringer is not readily proved. If the defendant had not made the sale, would the plaintiff have made it? No one can really know. Perhaps that is why the patent statute contains a very liberal provision as to damages (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284). The \u201cfine\u201d is a little more than 20% of the price\u2014 not an unreasonable gross margin of profit. We think that the award was proper. We think, too, that a deliberate contempt, such as this, falls within the category of cases in which attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded. (Sunbeam Corp. v. Golden Rule Appliance Co., 2 Cir., 1958, 252 F.2d 467; Tobin v. Pielet, 7 Cir., 1951, 186 F.2d 886; cf. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">The order is affirmed. Appellant shall pay to appellee the sum of $500 as attorney\u2019s fees for the defense of this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">. To the affidavit of appellant\u2019s president Moses, submitted in opposition to the motion, a \u201cXerox\u201d copy of this order was attached. The unit prices and the foregoing notation were blocked out by covering them with lined paper similar to that of the form itself. However, the paper was so placed as to make it fairly obvious that this had been done.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">. A \u201cXerox\u201d copy of No. 1 was also attached to Moses\u2019 affidavit. The prices were blocked out, and so was the date. But the blocking out of the prices was much more artfully done. The blocking out of the date was obvious. The prices, both unit and total, are entered in columns headed \u201cweight,\u201d \u201cclass or rate,\u201d and \u201ccheck column.\u201d They are in a different hand from the other entries on the paper, and above the total price appears the word \u201cInvoice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">. When the apparent covering of parts of the papers \u201ccopied\u201d and attached to Moses\u2019 affidavit was called to the court\u2019s attention, appellant\u2019s counsel announced that he had told Moses that it was all right to cover the prices, and that he, not Moses, prepared the affidavit. As we have seen, much more than \u201cprices\u201d was covered. And nothing in the affidavit, which describes each attached exhibit as \u201ca copy,\u201d tells the court that it is a partial or incomplete or \u201cdoctored\u201d copy. Counsel was no more candid in drawing the affidavit than Moses was in swearing to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
