State of Washington v. United States, (9 Cir.) 87 F.2d 421, 427-428.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-22\">It appears that the joinder of the two other insurance carriers as parties, as contended for by the defendant-appellant, would destroy diversity jurisdiction. In the absence of a determination that they are indispensable parties, therefore, the court should be extremely reluctant to require that they be added. See the excellent discussion of this troubled subject of joinder in Wright, Fed. Courts, Section 70, pages 259-63 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-23\">The order of the trial court appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b570-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
