A conscientious, thorough argument is made on behalf of the employer that the group leaders were in fact ordinary employees. However, from our own examination of the record we must conclude that there is substantial evidence on the whole case which supports the Board\u2019s holding that the group leaders are supervisors within the purview of the Act. In that situation it follows that the presence of the group leaders in the polling area attempting to vote could be properly held by the Board, as it was, to interfere with the employees\u2019 full freedom of choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The petition of Crown Aluminum Industries Corporation will be denied. The order of the Board will be enforced in full. A proposed decree may be submitted by the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
