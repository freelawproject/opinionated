Lane, with directions to make his recommendation for conclusions of law on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition. The commissioner has done so in an opinion and report filed May 6, 1965. On May 12, 1965, plaintiff filed an additional brief on defendant\u2019s objection which is treated as a request for review of the commissioner\u2019s opinion and recommendation for conclusion of law. On June 14,1965, defendant filed a reply and the case was submitted to the court on oral argument by the plaintiff and counsel for defendant. Since the court is in agreement with the opinion and recommendation of the trial commissioner, as hereinafter set forth, it hereby adopts the same as the basis for its judgment in this case. Plaintiff is, therefore, not entitled to recover, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition is granted and plaintiff\u2019s petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-25\">Opinion of Commissioner</p>\n<p id=\"b423-26\">This case comes before the court on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition. The petition filed herein does not comply with the provisions of Rule 17 in that it does not identify any jurisdictional statute and does not point out the claims of the patent alleged to be infringed. It must be <em>assumed </em>that petitioner intended this suit to be based on Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498, and that he thus seeks the recovery of reasonable and entire compensation for unlicensed use by defendant of the inventions defined in all 7 claims of United States Letters Patent No. 2,795,341 issued to the petitioner on June 11, 1957. The patent relates to a mail sorting mechanism. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The petition does not claim any specific amount of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The defendant bases its motion to dismiss on several grounds including failure to specify a jurisdictional statute, failure to allege that the patent invention has been used without lawful right, failure to state whether or not petitioner was employed by the defendant when the invention was made, and also on the ground that petitioner alleges that the accused mail sorting mechanism <em>differs </em>from that disclosed in petitioner\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Copies of correspondence accompanying the petition indicate that the petitioner submitted some suggestions to the Post Office Committee on Suggestions and Experiments for the Postal Service as early as March 1952. Copies of correspondence also indicate that petitioner forwarded drawings of a mail sorting machine to the Post Office Chief Engineer in September 1954. The correspondence also indicates that Post Office officials informed the petitioner that the Post Office was unable to utilize the petitioner\u2019s suggestions. Petitioner filed his application for patent May 21, 1953, and received his patent in 1957. The correspondence accompanying the petition herein does not include copies of petitioner\u2019s suggestions or drawings submitted to the Pest Office. The copies of correspondence accompanying the petition contain no indication that the Post Office ever promised to compensate petitioner for his suggestions.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Petitioner\u2019s response filed March 17, 1965, to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss asserts that petitioner was employed at the Church Street Post Office, New York City, from 1950 to 1958, and that in 1952 he invented the mail sorting mechanism. Petitioner\u2019s response asserts that he displayed a homemade model of his mail sorting machine at the General Post Office and an improved model at some later date. A further paper filed April 19, 1965, by the petitioner asserts that doubts concerning structural differences must be resolved in favor of an inventor, that petitioner seeks a reasonable price, that a picture of his mail sorting machine appeared in a Czechoslovakian newspaper in 1961 and that it was a Russian mail sorting machine \u201cinvented by an American,\u201d and that he sent drawings of a fully electronic mail sorting machine to the Post Office in 1959. Said drawings are not in the record before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">It is not clear from the incomplete correspondence accompanying the petition whether or not the petitioner, as an employee of the Post Office Department when he made his alleged invention, was in a position to influence or induce use of the invention by the defendant, or whether or not the alleged invention was related to the official functions of petitioner\u2019s employment, and whether or not Government time, materials or facilities were-utilized. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498 contains explicit provisions restricting the rights of a Government employee to bring suit for unauthorized use of a patented invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The petition states that the accused electronic semi-automatic mail sorting machine used by defendant at the New York World\u2019s Fair is structurally different from the mail sorting machine illusstrated and specifically claimed in petitioner\u2019s patent No. 2,795,341. The petition states that the World\u2019s Fair machine picks up mail with a rubber pad and a rotating wheel, opens flaps electronically, and omits the floating plate of the patented machine. Each of the 7 claims in petitioner\u2019s patent, which claims define petitioner\u2019s invention, specifically recites rotating rods to open the flaps mechanically, or calls for a resiliently mounted floating plate depressed by keys. Petitioner admits that this recited structure is not present in the World\u2019s Fair machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">In determining whether or not an accused machine infringes a patent, resort must be had to the words of the patent claims. Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605, 70 S.Ct. 854, 94 L.Ed. 1097 (1950). While patent claims may be limited by reference to the patent specification, petitioner\u2019s patent claims cannot be broadened to encompass mechanisms not hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ing a plurality of operating rods. The patent claims alone define the scope of the protection afforded by the patent. Kuhne Identification Systems, Inc. v. United States, 82 Ct.Cl. 237, 258 (1936), 28 U.S.P.Q. 151. The patent claim is a statutory requirement, prescribed for the very purpose of making the patentee define precisely what his invention comprises. It is unjust to the public, as well as an evasion of the law to construe a patent claim in a manner different from the plain import of its terms. White v. Dunbar, 119 U.S. 47, 7 S.Ct. 72, 30 L.Ed. 303 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">It is concluded that petitioner\u2019s statements 'in his petition of the differences between the accused World\u2019s Fair mail sorting mechanism and the mechanism illustrated and claimed in petitioner\u2019s patent fully warrant granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition. The petition does not state a cause of action cognizable under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498, or under any other statute conferring jurisdiction on this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
