Defense counsel did not, however, request an insanity instruction and none was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">After filing the motion for <em>amicus </em>assistance in this court, appellant moved in the District Court for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He alleged that such evidence was found in an \u201cemergency treatment record\u201d of D. C. General Hospital where he was taken immediately after his arrest. That record indicates that appellant was diagnosed as a \u201cnarcotics addict\u201d exhibiting \u201cwithdrawal symptoms,\u201d and contains the following notation: \u201csaid to be heroin addict since 1945. $40 habit, mainliner; has never taken pills. Last fix over 24 hrs. ago. Now withdrawing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">The District Court indicated that it would grant appellant\u2019s motion for new trial if the case were remanded by this court. Following Smith v. Pollin, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 178, 194 F.2d 349 (1952), we grant appellant\u2019s motion for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\">. <em>Cf. </em>Heard v.
