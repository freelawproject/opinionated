The theory of plaintiffs-appellants is that the governing statute, enacted in 1959,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is not being obeyed by appellees. The Act was the basis on which certain salary increases were made, accompanied by suitably increased appropriations, for a period following its passage. Appellants urge that the Act requires appellees to take periodic action to raise appellants\u2019 salaries to levels equal to those prevailing in the United States and that they should be ordered to do so, notwithstanding the fact that Congress has of late years declined to provide appropriations adequate for this purpose. The appropriations actually granted impose a ceiling on the amount which may be expended per pupil.. (To increase teachers\u2019 salaries would reduce the amount available for buildings, equipment, etc., thus necessitating many difficult decisions by appellees as to relative needs and priorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">We think that the complaint was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In our view this is an unconsented suit against the United States; and in any case mandamus is not available because the courts will not interfere with the exercise of executive discretion in situations as confused and difficult as the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-20\">.
