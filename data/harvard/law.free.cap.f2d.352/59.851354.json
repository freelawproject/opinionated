Instead of a reply brief, appellant has filed with the clerk of this court a letter, dated June 14, 1965, stating that if counsel for appellee is correct in saying that because of appellant\u2019s guilty plea, the search and seizure, coercion and confession issues cannot be considered in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, leaving only the waiver of counsel question, then appellant wishes to withdraw his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">In view of the allegation of fact made by appellant on this appeal with respect to the search and seizure, the coercion, and the confession issues, we agree with appellee that appellant\u2019s plea of guilty prevents any consideration thereof on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-17\">On the issue \u201cwhether or not I intelligently waived my right to counsel,\u201d appellant represents to us that he was \u201cwithout legal counsel when he signed a waiver of indictment and pleaded guilty,\u201d and that thereafter the court appointed an attorney. The reporter\u2019s transcript of the proceedings shows otherwise. Douglas Peterson, Esq., of the State Bar of Arizona, was appointed as appellant\u2019s attorney <em>before </em>he waived indictment and pleaded guilty. (Clerk\u2019s transcript, document 4, page 2.) On four occasions the appellant' stated he wanted to plead guilty before his plea; once <em>before, </em>and three <em>after, </em>an attorney was appointed. (Document 4, page 2, line 14; document 4, page 3, line 12; document 4, page 5, line 15; document 4, page 6, line 3.) He then plead. (Docum\u00e9nt 4, page 6, line 4.) His attorney was present at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-18\">Appellant urges he had discharged his attorney. The court did not accept the discharge. The court was not required to nor could it force an attorney on defendant. Proof of defendant\u2019s guilt depended on his plea alone; not on the skills or knowledge of any attorney. But here defendant had an attorney\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-19\">Defendant \u201cmust know what he is doing, and do it with his eyes open.\u201d That he did so here is fairly demonstrated by the record. The defendant knew of his right to counsel, he made the plea voluntarily and without coercion, and apparently with a full understanding of what he was doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
