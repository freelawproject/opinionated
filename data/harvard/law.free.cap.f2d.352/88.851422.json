The ground relied upon by appellant is that he was not mentally competent to stand trial at the time of his plea. (See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-18\">This court in a previous decision (310 F.2d 841) directed that a hearing be conducted as to this vital question. Thereafter, Judge Metzner held a hearing in which he gave appellant and his competent and resourceful counsel every opportunity to develop the facts relevant to the inquiry. The detailed opinion of Judge Metzner reveals the painstaking care exercised by the court to safeguard appellant\u2019s rights and to develop and weigh all the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-19\">On this appeal, appellant <em>pro se </em>has filed a brief and court-appointed counsel has submitted a brief <em>amicus curiae. </em>The arguments on the facts and the law have been well presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The order denying appellant\u2019s motion is affirmed on the opinion of Judge Metzner.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The thanks of this court are extended to Arnold Hoffman, Esq., for the able services rendered to appellant at the behest of the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
