Appellant filed a compliance report. Action was brought by the United States in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under Section <em>5(1) </em>of the F.T.C. Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(0, for $50,000 civil penalties, on ten counts, for violation of the consent order. The District Court, Edward Weinfeld, Judge, ruled defendant was guilty on nine counts, assessed penalties of $18,000 and issued an injunction commanding compliance with the consent order, Section 9 of the F.T.C. Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 49. 234 F.Supp. 710, S.D.N.Y.1964. We find no error and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-25\">In a considered opinion, Judge Weinfeld rejected appellant\u2019s claims that the order was not final, that the violations were inadvertent, and that the mere terms of the compliance proposal submitted by it insulated it from sanctions for violation. For the reasons given in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Judge Weinfeld\u2019s opinion, we likewise reject these contentions. The further argument that the acts of appellant were not covered by the Federal Trade Commission Act is without substance and is in any case raised too late for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The judgment is in all respects affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
