Ribicoff, 305 F.2d 638 (6th Cir. 1962), to support her contention that \u201cthere must be substantial evidence of what kind of work [claimant] is able to do and what employment opportunities are available for a [person] who can do only what claimant can do\u201d [305 F.2d at 641], before the Court will affirm the administrative determination of the Secretary. We have held, it is true, that once a claimant has established that he is unable to work at his usual occupation, it is incumbent upon the Secretary to adduce evidence that the claimant is able to engage in some other kind of \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d, in order to support a denial of disability benefits. [See: Thompson v. Celebrezze, 334 F.2d 412 (6th Cir. 1964); Jones v. Celebrezze, 321 F.2d 192 (6th Cir. 1963); Rice v. Celebrezze, 315 F.2d 7 (6th Cir. 1963).]</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">However, it is also the rule that where the Secretary has found from the evidence that the claimant is able to engage in a former trade or occupation, such a determination \u201cprecludes the necessity of an administrative showing of gainful work which the appellant was capable of doing and the availability of any such work\u201d. [Ward v. Ribicoff, 309 F.2d 157, 157-158 (6th Cir. 1962); accord, McMullen v. Celebrezze, 335 F.2d 811, 816 (9th Cir. 1964).]</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">In the case at bar, it is evident from the record as a whole that the Hearing Examiner concluded and found that appellant had failed to establish that she was disabled from following her usual occupation. [See: Mark v. Celebrezze, 348 F.2d 289, 292 (9th Cir. 1965); McMullen v. Celebrezze, supra, 335 F.2d at 816; Ber v. Celebrezze, 332 F.2d 293, 295 (2nd Cir. 1964).] It does not appear that the Examiner considered the evidence as relating to any other occupation in which appellant might have been expected to engage. [See Mark v. Celebrezze, supra, 348 F.2d at 292.]</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Accordingly, the only remaining consideration is whether there is substantial evidence in the record before us to support the findings of the Secretary adverse to appellant\u2019s claim of \u201cdisability\u201d. [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).} We have fully reviewed the evidence, and it is unnecessary to repeat it here, other than to point out that the physical examination and tests made by Dr. Willien, and his expert opinion based thereon, were fairly considered by the Hearing Examiner, and they alone must be held to be substantial evidence in support of the Secretary\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
