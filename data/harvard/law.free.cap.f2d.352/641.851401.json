As a part of her defense, appellant put on two character witnesses to testify to her good reputation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecuting attorney, on cross-examination, asked both of them whether they had heard of appellant\u2019s two previous arrests for assault with a dangerous weapon and her conviction for disorderly conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This jurisdiction apparently has endorsed the general rule that the prosecutor can in some circumstances inquire on cross-examination whether a defendant\u2019s character witness \u201chas heard\u201d of defendant\u2019s prior arrests or convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>tions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such cross-examination is not admitted to establish that such events took place, but only to test the foundations and reliability of the witness\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is, in general, inadmissible to establish the defendant\u2019s bad character or his propensity to commit the crime charged, and the defendant is entitled to a limiting instruction. Nonetheless, the risks of undue prejudice to the defendant are great;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the inadequacy of a cautionary instruction to protect the interests of the defendant is obvious. Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. at 484-485, 69 S.Ct. at 222-223. Cf. Jones and Campbell v. United States, 119 U.S. App.D.C. 213, 214, 215 n. 4, 338 F.2d 553, 554-555 n. 4 (1964); Marshall v. United States, 360 U.S. 310, 79 S.Ct. 1171, 3 L.Ed.2d 1250 (1959); Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">The use of such evidence must be closely supervised by the trial judge, not only to assay the prosecuting attorney\u2019s good faith but to consider whether the probative value of the information which might be elicited outweighs the prejudice to the defendant. The Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Michelson </em>decision, while it sustained the practice of cross-examining character witnesses on the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>ant\u2019s prior arrests, stressed the need for the exercise of judicial discretion in deciding whether to permit this line of cross-examination. \u201cWide discretion is accompanied by heavy responsibility on trial courts to protect the practice from any misuse.\u201d 335 U.S. at 480, 69 S.Ct. at 221.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Yet the rules as formulated in this jurisdiction <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> might appear to suggest that the judge\u2019s role is a mechanical one: if the defendant puts on a character witness, the prosecutor may ask if the witness has heard of defendant\u2019s prior arrests or convictions, without a further exercise of judicial discretion. The supposed automatic operation of the rule is suggested by the metaphorical statement that the defendant \u201chas opened the door.\u201d But the Supreme Court has made it clear that even though the defendant has opened the door, the trial judge is to decide what passes through. Cf. Luck v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C.-, 348 F.2d 763 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In the light of these principles, the trial judge in the instant litigation clearly erred in permitting the prosecuting attorney to cross-examine defendant\u2019s character witnesses on appellant\u2019s prior arrests and conviction. It is unclear whether the trial judge knew that it is within his discretion to exclude this line of questioning.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The information about the prior arrests came in during the cross-examination of defendant\u2019s first character witness, Reverend Norman Kelly. The witness testified on direct that defendant had been a member of his church choir, and that her reputation for peace and good order in Speneerville, Maryland, about fifteen miles from the District, had been good. Cross-examination brought out that Reverend Kelly knew defendant when \u201cshe was just a kid,\u201d and that she had left Spencerville about three years previously. He knew nothing about her reputation in Washington, where she had lived since leaving Spencerville. The defendant\u2019s arrests and conviction had all taken place after she left Reverend Kelly\u2019s community. With these facts established, defense counsel asked for a bench conference and \u201cquestioned the admissibility\u201d of the prior conviction and arrests. The judge ruled that this line of questioning was proper.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>. The information elicited was highly prejudicial; the character witness\u2019 testimony was weak to begin with since it went to an earlier period and a different community; it had already been impeached and could be impeached further without reference to the prior arrests. Indeed, the prosecuting attorney could have had the character testimony stricken since it did not relate to defendant\u2019s reputation in the community in which she lived or worked at the time of the alleged crime. Lomax v. United States, <em>supra, </em>37 App.D.C. at 417-418. Under these circumstances, the trial judge abused his discretion in permitting cross-examination on defendant\u2019s prior arrests and conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">The cross-examination of defendant\u2019s other character witness, Delores Thomason, her former supervisor, was also improper. On direct examination, Miss Thomason testified that she did not know defendant\u2019s reputation in the community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>for peacefulness and good order, the character traits relevant to the crime charged. The prosecuting attorney could have objected at this point and had hex testimony excluded. See Morris v. District of Columbia, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Miss Thomason testified only that she had \u201cnever had any complaints about Irene\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] behavior or any complaints about her work.\u201d On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney immediately established that the witness knew nothing about appellant after 1961. Despite this fact the prosecuting attorney asked whether the witness had heard of appellant\u2019s arrests in 1963 and 1964 for assault with a dangerous weapon and her conviction for disorderly conduct in 1962. Her ignorance of these post-1961 events</p>\n<p id=\"b695-18\">could not have impeached her testimony; her repeated assertions that she knew nothing about the defendant since 1961 precluded any likelihood that she would know of arrests subsequent to that year. This line of questions could not be thought to test the accuracy, reliability, or credibility of the testimony; it served only to prejudice the defendant by the introduction of past offenses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-19\">Intimations of past crimes, especially crimes similar to the crime charged, are extremely damaging to an accused. Merely putting the question, even if the witness has no knowledge of the events adverted to, creates in the minds of the jurors the impression that the events had occurred.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cautionary instructions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>copiously provided by the trial judge in this case, do not give the accused adequate protection. They cannot prevent the jury from considering prior actions in deciding whether appellant has committed the crime charged. The courts need not rest on the assumption that juries can compartmentalize their minds and hear things for one purpose and not for another. The Supreme Court took the lead in Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), by going behind the historic assumptions of the law of evidence and considering the psychological reality of the jury\u2019s functioning, in that case as it related to its consideration of the voluntariness of confessions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The use of this mode of impeachment must be closely supervised and cautiously limited. In the instant case the cited questions were clearly improper; their effect was highly prejudicial, and they</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">did not fulfill the only purpose for which such cross-examination is admitted. The use of cross-examination of a character witness to show defendant\u2019s prior arrests has been much criticized but widely practiced. We do not reverse this long practice at this time. We do, however, urge the trial judges to confine the'use of such cross-examination to those situations in which it is highly relevant to establish a character witness\u2019 reliability; and even in those situations, to exercise their discretion and exclude the cross-examination where prejudice outweighs probative value.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">In the light of these principles, the trial judge in the instant case clearly abused his discretion in permitting the prosecuting attorney to cross-examine defendant\u2019s character witnesses on appellant\u2019s prior arrests. The case is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-12\">. McCormick Evidence \u00a7 158 (1954). In this jurisdiction the reputation subject to proof is supposed to be defendant\u2019s good reputation for the trait of character involved in the offense charged. Morris v. District of Columbia, 75 U.S. App.D.C. 82, 124 F.2d 284 (1941). The reputation to be proved should be the defendant\u2019s reputation in the community in which he lives at the time of the alleged crime or shortly preceding that time. Lomax v.

The precise scope for cross-examination on these matters is unclear. See Sacks v. United States, 41 App.D.C. 34 (1913); Clark v.

United States, 77 U.S. App.D.C. 321, 135 F.2d 809 (1943) (cross-examination should be limited to \u201cacts inconsistent with the trait of character about which the witness has testified\u201d).

District of Columbia, 95 A.2d 332 (D.C.Munic.Ct.App. 1953) (character witness in a paternity suit who testified that he had never heard anything bad about the defendant was properly cross-examined on whether he had heard of defendant\u2019s having been arrested for assault); Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 483-484, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The \u201cgeneral rule\u201d is not universally accepted.

He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">\u201cMy own preference and, I think, the only fair rule would be to foreclose the entire line of inquiry concerning specific incidents in the defendant\u2019s past, both on cross-examination and on new evidence on rebuttal.\u201d 335 U.S. at 496, 69 S.Ct. at 228.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b693-9\">. \u201cThe rationale given for allowing such questions is that, if answered afiirmatively, they might cast serious doubt on the witness\u2019s testimony, thus serving a legitimate rebuttal function, and that, if answered negatively, they would show that the witness did not know enough about the accused\u2019s reputation to testify.\u201d Note, 70 Yale L.J. 763, 779 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b693-14\">. Wigmore comments on the prejudicial effect of such cross-examination, III Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 988 (1940):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-15\">\u201cThe rumor of the misconduct, when admitted, goes far, in spite of all theory and of the judge\u2019s charge, towards fixing the misconduct as a fact upon the other person [defendant], and thus does three improper things, \u2014 (1) it violates the fundamental rule of fairness <em>(ante, </em>\u00a7 979) that prohibits the use of such facts, (2) it gets at them by hearsay only, and not by trustworthy testimony, and (3) it leaves the other person [defendant] no means of defending himself by denial or explanation, such as he would otherwise have had if the rule had allowed that conduct to be made the subject of an issue. Moreover, these are not occurrences of possibility, but of daily practice. This method of inquiry or cross-examination is frequently resorted to by counsel for the very purpose of injuring by indirection a character which they are forbidden directly to attack in that way; they rely upon the mere putting of the question (not earing that it is answered negatively) to convey their covert insinuation. The value of the inquiry for testing purposes is often so small and the opportunities of its abuse by underhand ways are so great that the practice may amount to little more than a mere subterfuge, and should be strictly supervised by forbidding it to-counsel who do not use it in good faith.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\">.

The trial judge stated that the prosecuting attorney had a \u201cright\u201d to test a character witness\u2019 credibility by questions on prior convictions.

Although defense counsel did not object to the similar cross-examination of her second character witness, she had ample reason to believe that such objection would be futile.

In closing to the jury, the prosecuting attorney stressed that neither of the character witnesses offered evidence of the defendant\u2019s reputation in the community in which she lived at the time of the crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\u201cAnd I don\u2019t care if up to three years ago she [the accused] went to church every day in the week or she worked as a nurses\u2019s [sic] aid or whatever else she did back in 1959 or 1960.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\">.

To the layman, arrest often is regarded as the equivalent of a finding of guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b696-5\">. In Michelson v. United States, <em>supra, </em>Justice Jackson, writing for the majority, recognized the fact that \u201cthe jury almost surely cannot comprehend the Judge\u2019s limiting instructions.\u201d He justified his adherence to the old rule on the ground that pulling \u201cone misshapen stone out of the grotesque structure\u201d of the law in this area would be \u201cmore likely simply to upset its present balance between adverse interests than to establish a rational edifice.\u201d 335 U.S. at 484, 486, 69 S.Ct. at 223, 224. He stated that a rational approach to this problem would be useless unless other rules of evidence were similarly reappraised. But the Supreme Court has embarked on the enterprise, so the force of this argument is diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In Jackson v. Denno, <em>supra, </em>the Court asked rhetorically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">\u201cIf it finds the confession involuntary, does the jury \u2014 indeed, can it \u2014 then disregard the confession in accordance with its instructions? If there are lingering doubts about the sufficiency of the other evidence, does the jury unconsciously lay them to rest by resort to the confession? Will uncertainty about the sufficiency of the other evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt actually result in acquittal when the jury knows the defendant has given a truthful confession?\u201d 378 U.S. at 388, 84 S.Ct. at 1787.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">We need not consider whether the Jackson v.
