The record also discloses that the arrest warrant shows an entry on the same date \u201cnot executed by arrest of Samuel J. Marroso at Warren, Michigan, on February 19, 1965, because of his confinement to Plymouth General Hospital, Detroit, Michigan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">On February 24,1965, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion for return of the seized property and for an injunction restraining the United States Attorney from disclosure of the contents of the seized records and from \u201cmaking any use of the information contained therein in any manner whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">On March 8, 1965, this motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-17\">Subsequently on March 16, 1965, the record also discloses that Marroso was indicted by the Grand Jury on the same charge described above and that that criminal proceeding is still pending before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-18\">In our opinion the facts we have recited bring this case squarely within the holding of the United States Supreme Court in DiBella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121, 131-132, 82 S.Ct. 654, 7 L.Ed.2d 614 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-19\">The motion with which we deal herein is clearly tied \u201cto a criminal prosecution <em>in esse.\u201d </em>DiBella v. United States, supra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>at 132, 82 S.Ct. at 660. It should not be dealt with on the merits \u201cuntil the evidence at the trial has brought all circumstances to light.\u201d DiBella v. United States, supra at 129, 82 S.Ct. at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
