He did so pursuant to section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 66 Stat. 214 (1952), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h) (1964), on the ground that, if deported to Yugoslavia, he would be subject to \u201cphysical persecution.\u201d The application was denied by a special hearing officer, and the order of denial was affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals. This review proceeding was then instituted pursuant to section 106 of the Act, 75 Stat. 651 (1961), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">On October 3, 1965, after the review proceeding reached this court, section 11(f) of Public Laws 89-236 was enacted, amending section 243(h) of the Act, 79 Stat. 911. The amendment struck out the words \u201cphysical persecution\u201d and inserted in lieu thereof \u201cpersecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">Pointing out that section 243(h) relief is thus no longer expressly limited to cases where the applicant would be subject to \u201cphysical\u201d persecution, petitioner contends that the Service should be asked to reexamine the application in the light of the statute as it now reads.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">We agree. The orders of the special inquiry officer and of the Board, in keeping with the statute as it then read, discuss only the possibility of \u201cphysical persecution.\u201d It is true that, through developing decisional law the quoted term has been given a rather broad reading. However, there is nothing in the record to indicate how broadly the Service read that term in deciding this case, or whether its construction accords with the meaning which must now be given to the statutory term \u201cpersecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-17\">The proceeding must therefore be remanded for further consideration, it being left for the Service to determine, in the exercise of a sound discretion, whether such reconsideration should be had on the present record, or whether the proceeding should also be reopened on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-18\">We express no view at this time concerning the construction to be given the term \u201cpersecution,\u201d as it appears in amended section 243(h). Nor do we now discuss or decide the other questions presented on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-19\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
