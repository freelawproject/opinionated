See Robinson v. Mann, 5 Cir., 1965, 339 F.2d 547. Intent to defraud creditors was not there involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-24\">The case is now here on appeal from an order finding that the same conveyance was made with intent to defraud creditors with the result that appellant\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy was denied under \u00a7 14, sub. c(4) of the Act. 11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 32, sub. c(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-25\">This finding of the referee, which was affirmed by the District Court, is not clearly erroneous. No error appearing and appellant having had his day in court, it follows that the judgment must be and it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
