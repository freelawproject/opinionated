Intervenor and another subsequently requested similar, mutually exclusive facilities in nearby Spring Valley, New York. The Commission found that Spring Valley is the largest city in Rockland County and its commercial center and therefore has a greater need for a first local transmission service than Blauvelt. Relying on \u00a7 307(b) of the Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 307(b) (1952), the Commission excluded appellant from a comparison of the Spring Valley applicants, in which the intervenor prevailed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant argues that all applications were for facilities to serve the region of Rockland County rather than the designated station locations and that therefore appellant should have been consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>ered with the Spring Valley applicants under the standard comparative issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The Commission\u2019s view of the case is consistent with the view it has usually applied to mutually excusive applications for different station locations serving the same region. Under this view the Commission determines the community to be served by an applicant solely according to the proposed station location.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It first selects that location with the greatest need for transmission service and then compares the abilities of only the applicants for that location.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In some recent cases, however, it has treated mutually exclusive applications for different station locations serving the same region as equivalent for \u00a7 307(b) purposes and therefore entitled to consideration on the basis of the standard comparative issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the Commission apparently finds merit in this approach to its difficult task of allocating facilities, it did not follow it here and offered only a meager explanation for adhering to its earlier view.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">We do not reach the question whether the explanation is sufficient for review purposes, because we think affirmance may adequately rest on appellant\u2019s inaction after applications for Spring Valley appeared. It could readily have sought then to amend its application to provide principal-city service to Spring Valley or to obtain waiver of the Commission rules establishing requirements for principal-city service by promising to create some substantial connection with Spring Valley, such as an auxiliary studio.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We think its failure to do so could properly be taken as signifying a willingness to be treated as a Blauvelt application.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">The orders of the Federal Communications Commission in granting intervenor\u2019s application and denying appellant\u2019s application and petitions for reconsideration are</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-17\">BURGER, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-15\">.
