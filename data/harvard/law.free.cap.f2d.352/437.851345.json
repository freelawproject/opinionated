Respondent\u2019s drivers LaCivita and Weeden attended that meeting and signed cards, and driver Kuneli, who was not present, signed the membership card shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">On June 2 Kuneli was discharged by manager Mohl, allegedly for burning up a truck motor some six weeks earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">On June 3 the Teamsters Union representative called Mohl and asked for contract negotiations. In that conversation he also informed Mohl that LaCivita, the oldest employee in the plant from the point of view of continuous service, was one of the men who had joined the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">On June 3 LaCivita and Weeden were told they were being laid off for lack of work. Weeden was another employee with much seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">On June 4 the Teamsters Union called a strike of the drivers only, and on that date asked for and did confer with manager Mohl, requesting reinstatement of the three discharged drivers and that the company sit down and discuss a contract with them. Mohl in turn indicated that he would have to call the home office in Pittsburgh, and subsequently did so, receiving the advice from respondent\u2019s president, Brown, \u201cnot to bother talking with\u201d the union. There was no further contact with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">On June 6 employees from the production-warehouse portions of the plant joined the strike. Subsequently in early July they transferred their membership from the Teamsters Union to the Steelworkers Union.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The strike continued With joint participation of both unions until July 15, when both unions advised the company of the strike\u2019s termination, and that the striking employees all unconditionally offered to return to work on July 17. On that date all but one of the strikers presented themselves for work, and the company refused to rehire anybody except LaCivita and Weeden. LaCivita was returned to work immediately; Weeden was reinstated several weeks later. Neither subsequently was allowed overtime, although both had received it prior to layoff, and other truck drivers with less seniority continued to receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">This set of facts represents a classic pattern of company response to a union organizing drive. The inference drawn here that the discharges were based on antiunion and, hence, illegal motives rather than on lawful grounds, finds much support just in this outline of events. N. L. R. B. v. Putnam Tool Company, 290 F.2d 663 (C.A.6, 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">As Judge Medina said in a somewhat similar case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-12\">\u201c[T]he unexplained coincidence of time with respect to the principal events was really no coincidence at all, but rather part of a deliberate effort by the management to scotch the lawful measures of the employees before they had progressed too far toward fruition. * * * If employees are discharged partly because of their participation in a campaign to establish a union and partly because of some neglect or delinquency, there is nonetheless a violation of the * * * Act.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Jamestown Sterling Corp., 211 F.2d 725, 726 (C.A.2, 1954).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">If there be any need for additional evidence of antilabor motive, we think LaCivita\u2019s testimony pertaining to his discharge warrants quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-16\">\u201cQ. Now, you said you quit at 5:30 p. m. on Monday, June 3, 1963. Before we go any further, was there any indication to you during your working hours on that day that you would be laid off and that you would not be able to work the next day ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-17\">\u201cA. No, there was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u201cQ. All right. Now, did Mr. Mohl call you that evening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201cA. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\u201cQ. What time did he call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201cA. About 6:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">\u201cQ. Was that at your home ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">\u201cA. Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">\u201cQ. All right. Tell us from the beginning as best as you can recall what Mr. Mohl said to you and what you said to him during this conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">\u201cA. Well, he began by saying, \u2018This is Vic.\u2019 He stuttered around a bit and said, \u2018He had got a call from Pittsburgh. That he had been given instructions to make a cut back. That I had to be one of them.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">\u201cI asked him, \u2018What do you mean laying me off? I am one of the oldest men out there.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-13\">\u201cHe said, \u2018He had just been given those instructions and that was it.\u2019 He went on to say, \u2018He had got a call that afternoon from Mr. Sammartino,\u2019 another agent from the Teamsters, \u2018that he had some of our men and they had gone and signed cards. That he wanted to sit down and negotiate a contract.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-14\">\u201cQ. Mr. Sammartino had told that to Mr. Mohl you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-15\">\u201cA. Yes. He said, T don\u2019t know what is going on out there. I know you guys aren\u2019t satisfied.\u2019 He said, T guess you know that there is another dime coming in July,\u2019 he said, \u2018but I know you guys aren\u2019t satisfied with that.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-16\">\u201cQ. You said that he said something about you fellows getting another dime, that he knew that you weren\u2019t satisfied with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-17\">\u201cA. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-18\">\u201cQ. All right. What else was said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-19\">\u201cA. I asked him; \u2018How he could lay me off when he just hired other men the previous week that couldn\u2019t go out into the warehouse and pull a load? They didn\u2019t know anything about it. You don\u2019t learn it overnight.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-21\">\u201cHe said; \u2018He knew that. He had been given the word from Pittsburgh. He had no choice in the matter.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-22\">There is much more evidence in this record of a generally similar nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-23\">This record reviewed as a whole convinces us that there was substantial evidence to support the findings of fact and the inferences drawn therefrom by the Trial Examiner and the Board.
