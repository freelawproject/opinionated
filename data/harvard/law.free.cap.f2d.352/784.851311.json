This suit was filed to restrain defendants from using this trade-mark and to recover damages for trade-mark infringement and breach of contract. Defendants filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment, seeking to declare void the registration of this trademark by plaintiff, and also sued for injunctive relief and damages arising from an embargo caused by the trade-mark registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">District Judge Ralph M. Freeman granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, holding that plaintiff had no interest in \u201cSum Log\u201d except under a letter granting exclusive sales rights \u201cso long as we are satisfied with your sales result.\u201d He held plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark to be void, and enjoined plaintiff from utilizing his trade-mark registration or obstructing defendants from importing, selling and distributing in the United States goods bearing the trade-mark \u201cSum Log.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">The facts are set forth in the opinion of the district court, Spencer v. VDO Instruments, Limited et al., 232 F.Supp. 735 (E.D.Mich.) and will not be repeated here in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">The principal contention of plaintiff on this appeal is that the case presents genuine issues of material facts and that the district court therefore erred in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">We agree with the holding of the district court that the record presents no genuine issue as to the following material and dispositive facts: The device in question has been manufactured and marketed in Sweden under the trademark \u201cSum Log\u201d since 1952. In 1959 plaintiff\u2019s predecessor became interested in the device as a result of seeing an advertisement in a Swedish magazine. On February 14, 1959, plaintiff\u2019s predecessor placed an order for a supply of the devices. Thereafter he continued to import and sell the devices without any written license for shortly more than one year. Under date of April 10, 1960, he was granted an exclusive sales right in North America, which was to remain in effect only so long as the licensor was satisfied with the \u201csales result.\u201d This license was granted by the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-16\">\u201cWe are writing to you in order to grant you and your firm \u2018Hurricane Marine Company\u2019 exclusive sales right of the Sum-Log in North America <em>as long as we are satisfied with your sales result. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-17\">\u201cWe have learned from your letter that you are planning to incorporate other persons in your firm in order to have an improved financial backing. Should these plans be realized we are quite willing to transfer the exclusive right to you under another name of your firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-18\">Yours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-19\">A. B. Moskinaffaren (Signed by Stieltjes)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-20\">The record shows that neither the inventor of \u201cSum Log\u201d nor any of his assignees ever granted any rights to plaintiff greater than those set forth in the foregoing letter. Both in extended correspondence and by a trip to Europe, plaintiff tried to obtain exclusive sales rights within the United States. After another distributor began to sell the device in California, plaintiff filed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>trade-mark application on February 24, 1961, and it was registered on the principal register of the Patent Office on March 13, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">We agree with the district court, upon the basis of the authorities set forth in his opinion hereinabove cited, that plaintiff was never the owner of the trade-mark within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 et seq. To the contrary, plaintiff and his predecessors in interest were nothing more than importers under a license that was terminable at the will of the licensor. He obtained no rights of ownership under which he was entitled to register the trade-mark as his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Since there is no genuine issue as to these material facts, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment. Rule 56(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">We agree with the holding of the district court that plaintiff\u2019s registration of the trade-mark in question is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
