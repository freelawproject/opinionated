He cited <em>Kortwright </em>v. <em>Cady </em>(21 N. Y., 343) ; <em>Hartley </em>v. <em>Tatham </em>(1 Robertson, 246); 1 Keyes, 222.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">He also insisted that the fees in such case being fixed by statute as compensation for seizing, taking care of, and selling the property, there could be no extra compensation charged, citing <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Richmond </em>(38 How. Pr. R., 173); that if the lien was not discharged by the tender, the right to sell was lost or suspended, and that the subsequent sale by the sheriff was an abuse of process for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>he, as well as the defendant, who was present, consenting, were liable, citing <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Sudam </em>(2 John. Ch., 172); <em>Tiernan </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(6 id., 411); <em>Jackson </em>v. Law (5 Cow., 248); <em>Cantine </em>v. Clark (41 Barb., 629); <em>Waterbury </em>v. Westervelt (9 N.

Cook (11 Barb., 642); <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Russell </em>(30 Barb., 300); <em>Crary </em>v. <em>Sprague </em>(12 Wend., 41); also that there is no power to tax sheriff\u2019s fees on execution from the Marine Court of New York given to any officer, citing Crocker on Sheriffs, \u00a7 1, 111; 2 R. S., 840, \u00a7 1, 4th ed.; Laws 1857, chap. 295, \u00a7 1; Laws 1862, chap. 484, \u00a7 4; Laws 1865, chap. 400, \u00a7 3; 2 R. S., 427, 4th ed.; <em>Huff </em>v. <em>Knapp </em>(5 N.

To show that the affirmative of the question as to sufficiency of tender was with plaintiff, <em>Boyden </em>v. <em>Moore, admin'x </em>(5 Mass., 368). He also cited Crocker on Sheriffs, \u00a7 1094, 2d ed., \u00a7 1144; 2 R. S., 652 ; \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b173-5\">Present\u2014Mullin, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzP\">A tender of money does not discharge a debt, but it does relieve the debtor from damages and costs. <em>(Wolcott </em>v. <em>Van Santvoord, </em>17 J. R., 248, 253; <em>Trovinger </em>v. <em>McBurney, </em>5 Cow., 253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">And although the debt is not discharged, a lien given or obtained as security for it is discharged by a tender. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>18 J. R., 110; <em>Kortright </em>v. <em>Cady, </em>21 N. Y., 343 ; <em>Hartley </em>v. <em>Tatham, </em>1 Robt., 240; <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Kortright, </em>1 Keyes, 222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">It was held in <em>Crozer </em>v. <em>Pilling </em>(4 B. &amp; C., 26), that the plaintiff in a case, to whom the amount remaining due on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>judgment had been tendered, together with the sheriff\u2019s fees, was liable for maliciously refusing to direct the sheriff to discharge the defendant. It must follow, from the principle decided in this ease, that a plaintiff in a <em>fi. fa. </em>would be liable, after tender of the damages, costs and sheriff\u2019s fees, for directing a sale of defendant\u2019s lands or goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">But the very point was decided in <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Sudam </em>(2 J. C. R., 172). In that case the chancellor held a sale of defendant\u2019s real estate, after tender of the amount due thereon, was entirely in defendant\u2019s own wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The amount tendered was <em>prima facie </em>sufficient; it was considerably more than the whole debt, interest and sheriff\u2019s fees. If the defendant or the sheriff was entitled to demand anything more, it was his duty to show what it was for and what was its amount. Ho such proof was given, and we must hold the tender sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The defendant was present when the tender was made. He was then apprised that the right to sell upon the execution was gone, and it was his duty to have instructed the sheriff to stop the sale and release the property. Had he done so, the liability for proceeding with the sale would have been thrown upon the sheriff, and the plaintiff would have been obliged to sue him instead of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">But instead of attempting to stop the sale and release the property, he remained during the sale and bid upon the property. I cannot doubt his liability under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
