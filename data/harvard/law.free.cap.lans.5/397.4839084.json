S., 248, \u00a7 177) that no person without the written permission of a canal commissioner shall construct any basin, &amp;c., on any canal, and that every basin, &amp;c., so constructed shall be held during the pleasure of the canal commissioners and subject to their control, and the party constructing such basin, &amp;e., without permission is subject to a penalty (\u00a7 178) and the destruction thereof at his own expense, these provisions having been taken from the Laws of 1820; that the presumption was that the right was originally taken front a canal commissioner, and subject to the above provisions of law.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b416-5\">That an injunction therefore, restraining a ca\u00f1al commissioner from the obstruction of suck basin, pursuant to the direction of the canal hoard, was improper and rightly dissolved.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">Appeal from order dissolving injunction. The action was brought for the purpose of enjoining the defendants from closing a certain basin, known as Child\u2019s basin, situated in the city of Buffalo, and communicating with the waters of the Erie canah The plaintiffs were proprietors of mill seat lots, situated upon the basin, and alleged, among other things, that for more than forty years the basin had been used in common by the proprietors of lots adjacent thereto, under claim of right, without payment of rent or profits, and that the same had been a common way for all the proprietors of mill seat lots situated thereon, as marked and laid out upon a map thereof made by original proprietors. That the -defendants were proceeding to close the basin, to the great and irremediable injury of the plaintiffs, who had 'erected valuable buildings for milling purposes upon such lots, the use of which depended upon communication with the canal by means of the basin. That the defendant Fay was a canal commissioner, in charge of that section of the canal Into which the basin entered; and that the other defendants were acting under his orders, and that their acts were author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ized by the canal board.

This right must be shown by the complaint, as the injunction was granted on the complaint alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The plaintiffs allege in their complaint, on information and belief, that they have such right by grant and prescription, which cannot be taken away without compensation, and that the basin could not be closed without their consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">This allegation, on information and belief, is not sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to an injunction. The fact is, however, stated with sufficient certainty that the plaintiffs and their grantors have been in the uninterrupted use of the basin, in connection with the canal as it was before the acts complained of, for a period of over forty years under claim of right, without dispute or adverse claim by any other party. If this fact of peaceable occupancy, under claim of right, for this period, is sufficient to raise the presumption of a grant from the State of a perfect title to the right, the injunction was properly granted, and should have been retained. At common law, title by prescription could not be made to land or corporeal hereditaments, or to such incorporeal rights as must arise by matter of record, but was restricted to such things as might be created by grant. The right must be consistent with the presumption of a grant. (Best on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Presump., 88; Co. Litt., 114 <em>a ; Foxley\u2019s Case, </em>5 Coke, 109 a ; Bouv. Law Dic., tit. Prescription.) If, by law, no grant of the right could ever have been rightfully made, no presumption of grant arises, and the right cannot rest in prescription. The presumption must be, in such case, that the party held by such right only as might have been lawfully obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">By our State Constitution the legislature has been prohibited, ever since 1821, from selling, or disposing of in any way, any portion of the canals of the State. (Canst, of 1821, art. Y, \u00a7 10; Cons, of 1846, art. Y, \u00a7 6.) By these provisions of the organic law, it was ordained that the canals of the State should remain its property and under its management forever. By the Revised Statutes (1 R. S., 248, \u00a7 1YY), it is provided that no person, without the written permission of a canal commissioner, shall construct any wharf, basin or watering place on any canal, or make or apply any device whatever for the purpose of taking water from a canal, and that every wharf, basin, watering place or device constructed with such permission shall be held during the pleasure of the canal commissioners, and subject to their control. By section 1YS of the same statute, every person constructing any such wharf, basin or device, without permission, is subjected to a penalty, and becomes liable to have his construction destroyed at his own expense. These sections were incorporated into the Revised Statutes from the Laws of 1820, and have been in force ever since they were first enacted. The legal presumption, therefore, from the facts alleged positively in the complaint, is that the plaintiffs, or their grantors, took their right from a canal commissioner, and such right only as he had power to give, and that such right has ever since been held and enjoyed under such imperfect and uncertain tenure. The complaint shows that the act of closing the basin and . cutting it off from the canal was authorized by the canal board; that the defendant, Fay, is a canal commissioner, having charge of that portion of the canal, and that the other defendants were acting under his orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u2022 The privilege about to be taken away bv the acts com <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>plained of is undoubtedly exceedingly valuable to the plaintiffs, as an appurtenant to their mills and other property; but it is their misfortune to hold it by such a precarious right. The acts were lawful on the part of the canal commissioner, and the motives of any of the parties acting under Mm, or in influencing Mm or the canal board to act, cannot be inquired into. If the law justifies the act, the motive is of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The injunction was properly dissolved, and the order must be affirmed, with costs of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
