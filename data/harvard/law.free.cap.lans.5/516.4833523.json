But by mistake the plaintiff\u2019s attorney omitted to insert in the notice of appeal \u201c an assent on the part of the appellant that if the order be affirmed, judgment absolute shall be rendered against the appellant.\u201d (See Code, \u00a7 11, sub. 2.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-9\">The plaintiff made a motion at the Rensselaer Special Term, in January, 1872, for leave to amend his notice of appeal by inserting therein the above mentioned assent, required by section 11 of the Code, and allowing the plaintiff to file such amended notice, <em>nunc fro </em>tune, as of the time of filing the original notice of appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-10\">That motion was denied with ten dollars costs, <em>\u201c </em>upon the \u25a0 ground that, the court has not the power to grant such amendment, as it would in effect enlarge or extend the time of appeal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-11\">The plaintiff appealed from the order denying such motion to the General Term of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b534-12\"><em>E. F. Bullard, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b534-13\"><em>J. W.

Pr. Rep., 522), this court, at a General Term in New York city, held, if a party has appealed in time and given an informal notice of it, the court may allow him to amend his notice, <em>nunc pro tune.\u201d </em>(See <em>Wood </em>v. Kelly, 2 Hilton\u2019s Reps., 334.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">We are aware of the decisions that no amendment can be allowed to a notice of appeal, the effect of which is to extend the time of giving such notice; but we are of the opinion that we shall not extend the time for giving notice of appeal, in this case, by allowing the plaintiff to amend his notice of appeal. That notice was given within the time limited by the Code for appealing in such a ease. Now, by allowing the plaintiff to amend it, we shall only permit him to supply an omission in it, or do an act which he omitted to do through mistake, to make his appeal perfect and effectual. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>If we do this, it will he in accordance with the spirit and meaning of sections 174 and 327 of the Code; and, in our judgment, it will be in furtherance of justice and in conformity with numerous decisions of this court and of the Court of Appeals, allowing amendments and supplying omissions in pleadings and proceedings in different actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The justice at the Special Term did not exercise any discretion in refusing to allow the amendment proposed by the plaintiff; but denied the motion for leave to amend the notice \u201c upon the ground that the court has not the power to grant such amendment, as (in his opinion) it would in effect enlarge or extend the time of appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Now, as he erred in refusing to exercise any discretion on the question, and did not refuse to allow the proposed amendment on the ground that its allowance would not be in furtherance of justice, an appeal lies from his decision to the General Term of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">For these reasons the order appealed from should be reversed, and the plaintiff\u2019s motion should be granted, allowing him to amend his notice of appeal, <em>mme pro tuna, </em>in conformity with his notice of motion for leave to amend it. But, as the plaintiff is asking for a favor resting in the discretion of the court, he should pay ten dollars costs of his motion at the Special Term of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Ordered accordingly</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
