The plaintiff claimed in her complaint for injuries received by jumping against the wall of the Vanderbilt House, in Syracuse, and laid her damages at $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-10\">, The plaintiff gave evidence showing that she bad been injured by suddenly springing aside from the sidewalk against the wall of the Vanderbilt House; that she was alarmed by the driving of the driver in charge of the defendant\u2019s express wagon, who had driven his horse upon the sidewalk behind and near to her, and startled her by his rapid driving. The plaintiff, without looking to see the wagon, sprang suddenly aside and was injured by striking her face against the wall, badly cutting and bruising her forehead and cheek. There was evidence on the part of the defendant to show that the wagon was not driven upon the walk, and that it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>driven rapidly; and it was shown that the plaintiff would not have received injury if she had not jumped aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">The case was submitted to the jury, who found a verdict for the plaintiff for $200, and the defendant objecting to its reception, the plaintiff moved to amend his pleading, and the court, against defendant\u2019s objection, allowed an amendment so as to make the plaintiff\u2019s claim for judgment $200, and without imposing any terms or conditions upon the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">The defendant moved for a new trial in the county court, and appealed from the order refusing it, and from the judg ment entered upon the verdict</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pA3I\"><em>R. H. </em>Gardner, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b86-8\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\">If the defendant\u2019s driver drove on to the sidewalk, on which the plaintiff was walking, in a rapid manner, and near enough to her to give her reason to deem herself in danger, and if, under this belief, she instinctively jumped against the wall and injured herself, the defendant is liable, and the plaintiff was not chargeable with negligence. <em>(Buel </em>v. <em>N. Y. Central R. R., </em>31 N. Y., 314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">This was a question for the jury, and they have decided upon conflicting evidence that the defendant\u2019s driver was, and the plaintiff was not, guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">This disposes of the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">.Granting leave to amend, and whether any and what terms should be imposed rests, as a general rule in the discretion of the court, and that discretion cannot be reviewed by the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">But it seems that this rule is not without its exceptions. One well-established exception is an amendment of the complaint after verdict, increasing the damages claimed in it to the amount of the verdict, unless upon the condition that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>plaintiff relinquish the verdict, pay the costs of the trial, and consent to a new trial. <em>(Corning </em>v. Corning, 2 Seld., 97, 105; <em>Dox </em>v. Dey, 3 Wend., 356; <em>Curtiss </em>v. Lawrence, 17 J. R., 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The County Court, therefore, had no power to permit the amendment, and the order is reviewable on appeal. <em>(Corning </em>v. Corning, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In this case the plaintiff should be permitted to enter a remittitur of the damages, and the judgment to stand for the amount claimed in the complaint. But if she does not do so within twenty days after notice of this decision that then the judgment be reversed, and new trial granted. Costs t\u00f3 abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
