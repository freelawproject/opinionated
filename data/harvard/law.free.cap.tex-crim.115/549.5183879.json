The term of court did not adjourn until August 31st. The statement of facts was filed in the court below on November 1st, which was within 80 days from adjournment, but more than 90 days from the date notice of appeal was given. Our attention is directed to this by our state\u2019s attorney. Art. 760, Subdivision 5, C. C. P., provides that the time for filing statement of facts \u201cshall not be so extended as to delay the filing thereof within ninety days from the date the notice of appeal is given.\u201d Under the provision of the statute quoted the statement of facts cannot be considered.
