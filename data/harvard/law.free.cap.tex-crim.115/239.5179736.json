It appears that a young lady rented two of appellant\u2019s rooms. This young lady <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>stated to the officer when the search was made that she would assume the entire responsibility, as she had no one to take care of. Appellant testified that the beer belonged to the young lady who rented the rooms. Appellant was present when the search was made. There was testimony to the effect that automobiles frequently stopped at appellant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\">We are unable to reach the conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction. Appellant contends that the state failed to offer any proof tending to show that the beer was intoxicating. It was undisputed that the liquor in question was beer. The burden resting upon the state to prove that such liquor was capable of producing intoxication was discharged by the proof showing it to be beer, which, within the judicial knowledge of the court, is an intoxicating liquor.
