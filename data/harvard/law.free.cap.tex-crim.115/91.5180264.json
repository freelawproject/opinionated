The motion is accompanied by the affidavit of Leslie Stegall, Sheriff of McLennan county, Texas, in whose custody appellant was at the time, showing that on May 23, 1930, he made his escape from jail by sawing out certain bars and fleeing from said jail. The motion will be granted. The fact that later said prisoner was recaptured does not affect the law of the situation. Laughlin v. State, <em>97 </em>Texas Crim. Rep. 370; Pendergrass v.
