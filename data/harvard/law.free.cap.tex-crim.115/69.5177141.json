This defense was presented by the Court in the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\u201cIf you believe from the evidence in this case that the defendant had no interest in the whiskey found in his car, if you believe whiskey was found in his car, and no purpose save and except the innocent purpose to make some legal disposition of same, or if you have a reasonable doubt as to this, you will find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Appellant properly excepted to this charge because same was too restrictive, did not submit appellant\u2019s defense in an affirmative manner, was confusing and left the jury to speculate on what is meant by \u201clegal disposition.\u201d The accused is always entitled to a distinct and affirmative presentation of his defense in the charge of the trial court. For collation of authorities see Vernon\u2019s Texas C. C. P., Art. 658, Note 2. To submit the question of what is a legal disposition of whiskey to a jury is obviously to turn them loose without any guide and leave for their determination a matter which in its intricate niceties is calculated to tax the ability of a trained legal mind. It is impossible for us to determine what their conclusion was. They may have determined that a disposition perfectly legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>was not in fact so. If appellant\u2019s purpose was only to get the whiskey away from the garage and transport same to a destination where he could seek advice about it before determining its disposition, he would violate no law and this defense should have been pertinently submitted. For authorities deemed analogous see: Lewis v. State, 98 Tex. Crim. Rep. 78; Love v. State, 103 Tex. Crim. Rep. 521; Waddell v. State, 37 Tex. 354; Huff v. State, 51 Tex. Crim. Rep. 441; Upton v. State, 33 Tex. Crim. Rep. 231; Deuschle v. State, 4 S. W. (2nd) 559. We believe the special charge requested by appellant more correctly presented this defense and should have been given and that the charge of the Court was erroneous in the respects pointed out above.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We think the Court should have permitted the appellant to prove that he frequently consulted with his brother and sought his advice in respect to matters of business, though we doubt the sufficient seriousness of this, standing alone, to justify a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Other alleged errors are not likely to occur again and will not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">For the error above mentioned, the judgment is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
