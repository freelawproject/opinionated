Dawson, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, of Austin, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b634-17\">MARTIN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Az88\">Offense, the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor; penalty, three years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-18\">Prosecuting witness, O. D. Williams, testified to the purchase from appellant of a pint of whiskey on or about the date alleged in the indictment, for which he paid $2.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-19\">Bill of Exception No. 2 presents as error the action of the Court in overruling appellant\u2019s challenge for cause to Juror Busby and being forced to exercise a peremptory challenge on said juror. The effect of this bill is to show that this juror with many others had signed a statement commending the efforts of the Sheriff\u2019s department in enforcing the law and suppressing the liquor traffic. It is sufficient to show a bias of the juror in favor of the prohibition law and a prejudice against liquor law violators. This is not sufficient to disqualify the juror where the juror, as in this case, answered that he had- no prejudice against the defendant nor against people charged with violation of the liquor law nor any opinion that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>affect his verdict. Bartlett v. State, 82 Tex. Crim. Rep. 468; Cooper v. State, 72 Tex. Crim. Rep. 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Questions of similar import are raised in other bills and will not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Objection was made to the appellant being forced on cross-examination to testify that he was under indictment in another liquor case happening subsequent to the date of the offense for which he was on trial. Having offered himself as a witness, this was admissible as affecting his credibility as such. Branch\u2019s P. C., Sec. 167; Lights v. State, 21 Tex. Crim. App. 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Bill of Exception No. 7 shows that appellant offered Ray Cunningham as a character witness in his behalf. The exact trait of character put in issue is not disclosed by the bill, but it is shown that on cross-examination this witness was asked about whether or not be had heard of a certain incident of appellant stealing from one McAlister. Objection to this was overruled and exception taken. It is well settled that a witness who has testified to the good character of an accused may be asked on cross-examination with reference to some specific instance which reflects unfavorably on the trait of character put in issue. Branch\u2019s P. C., P. 117; Howard v. State, 37 Tex. Crim. Rep. 498; Forrester v. State, 38 Tex. Crim. Rep. 245; Williamson v. State, 167 S. W. 360. Since the State had a right to follow the predicate laid by appellant, this bill would manifest no error, in the absence of a showing in the bill that the issue involved in the matter inquired about had not been tendered by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Bill No, 9 is in question and answer form without any certificate from the trial judge showing necessity therefor and cannot be considered. Minor v. State, 1 S. W. (2d) 315, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Other contentions have been carefully examined and are deemed without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
