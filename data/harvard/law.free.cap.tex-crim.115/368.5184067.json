It was the defensive theory that appellant\u2019s wife was suffering from an ailment that whiskey would do good and that the whiskey in question was in his possession not for sale but for the use of his sick wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-20\">Bills Nos. 2 and 3 relate to the alleged improper questions asked a physician by the District Attorney on cross-examination. This physician was offered as a witness by appellant and his testimony tended to show that whiskey was good for the malady with which appellant\u2019s wife was suffering. This physician was asked if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>thought a quantity of whiskey flasks would be good for defendant\u2019s wife and further if he thought the defendant\u2019s wife would need five or six gallons of whiskey at a time. We are of the opinion that these questions were not of.such prejudicial character as would compel a reversal. These were undoubtedly understood by the jury as sarcastic thrusts at the defense interposed by appellant. It hardly could be contended that the District Attorney had to treat appellant\u2019s defense seriously without any right to indulge in facetious and sarcastic references to same. The more appropriate place for these was in argument, but their occurrence under the circumstances recited above \"was not necessarily reversible. The facts already stated furnished ample basis for a legitimate criticism by the District Attorney of appellant\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">After appellant had testified, the effect of his testimony being already set out, the State then introduced one Corbett, who testified that just \u201cone, two or three days\u201d prior to the said search he had purchased from appellant a pint of liquor. This was so closely related in point of time to the offense charged as to- be admissible as original evidence of appellant\u2019s' guilt, that is to show the purpose for which he possessed the liquor. Hood v. State, 10 S. W. (2nd) 94. Under the particular circumstances of this case we think it was also admissible in rebuttal of the testimony offered by appellant and his witnesses in that it tended to show that at the very time appellant claims this whiskey was possessed and used for medicine, some of it was sold to this witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The importance of appellant\u2019s other bills does not seem to justify discussion. Distinguished counsel for appellant cites no authorities in support of any of his contentions and we know of none that could be cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b397-11\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AMZ\">We have re-examined the record in connection with the appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing and regard the disposition of the case upon the original hearing as correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
