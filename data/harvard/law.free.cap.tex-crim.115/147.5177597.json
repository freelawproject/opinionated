A recital of the evidence is deemed unnecessary. The burglary was proved by the owner of the premises, and a part of the stolen property was found in the possession of the appellant. An accomplice testified, detailing the entire transaction and connecting the appellant with the commission of the offense, and the corroboration is adequate to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b176-11\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b176-12\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AKfa\">In the indictment the appellant is charged with entering and breaking into a \u201chouse\u201d then and there occupied and controlled by Gus Dennis. It is claimed that there is a failure to prove that there was an entry into a house. Dennis testified that \u201cmy place was burglarized\u201d; that he saw tracks leading to his \u201cplace\u201d; that the burglary was at night and \u201cat my place.\u201d It has been said that the word \u201cplace\u201d expresses simply locality and not kind. Hence qualifying words are necessary to indicate the kind of place. It may mean a city, house, or open space. See Words &amp; Phrases, 1st Series, Vol. 6, p. 5383; Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, p. 1646. That in a prosecution under the statute the evidence must conform to the averment that the house was entered is supported by many precedents of this state. See Williamson v. State, 39 Tex. Cr. R. 60; Anderson v. State, 17 Tex. Cr. R. 306; Bigham v. State, 31 Tex. Cr. R. 244; Willis v. State, 33 Tex. Cr. R. 168. In the statute, \u201chouse\u201d is defined as a building or structure erected for public or private use. See Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., p. 1279, and authorities collated under sec. 2342.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>By reason of the failure to prove the burglary by the entry of a house, the motion for rehearing is granted, the order of affirmance is set aside, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
