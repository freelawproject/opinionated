The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>parties were tried jointly and all convicted under the count last named and each was assessed a punishment of one year in the penitentiary. Separate verdicts were returned and separate judgments entered and the cases reach this court under separate records as though there had been separate trials, but with identical transcripts and statements of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The evidence has been rather fully set out in the opinion in No. 13,155, Walter Duffer v. State, this day decided, and it is unnecessary to repeat it here. It was stated in that opinion what disposition should be made of the present case. Reference is made to that opinion for the reasons upon which an affirmance of the judgment in the present case is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b547-9\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ATuv\">The record has been re-examined in the light of the appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing.
