Petty, that appellant had several acts of sexual intercourse with her; that she was under fourteen years of age at the time such relations were had; that she consented to said acts of intercourse; that thereafter she and appellant went to the State of Oklahoma where they were married; that upon their return to Texas appellant secured work; that appellant supported her and treated her kindly until he was arrested and charged with the offense of rape. Appellant offered no testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Over proper objection the state was permitted to prove by the mother of prosecutrix that J. C. Anthony, brother of appellant, had stated to the witness in the absence of appellant, in substance, that appellant ought to be ashamed of himself and that if prosecutrix were his daughter he would want appellant punished. The effect of this testimony was to get before the jury the opinion of appellant\u2019s brother that appellant was guilty. Opinions expressed in the absence of the accused to the injured party or others as to the guilt of the accused are hearsay and inadmissible.
