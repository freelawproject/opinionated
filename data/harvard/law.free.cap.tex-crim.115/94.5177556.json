Calvert </em>and <em>Frank Harmon, </em>both of Dallas, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-13\"><em>A. A. </em>Dawson, State\u2019s Attorney, of Austin, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b122-14\">CHRISTIAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">The offense is forgery; the punishment, confinement in the penitentiary for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">Appellant bought some wearing apparel from the Rainbow Apparel Shop, and in the presence of the salesman executed a check for $9.96, purporting to be given by Mrs. G. Mahonie. In the corner of the check appellant noted that Mrs. Mahonie lived at 3308 Gunter Street in Dallas. She also noted Mrs. Mahonie\u2019s telephone number. Only appellant and her family lived at 3308 Gunter Street. Mrs. G. Mahonie appears from the evidence to have been a fictitious person.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-16\">A physician who had treated appellant for a number of years testified that she possessed the mentality of \u201ca child about 7 or 8 years of age.\u201d He attributed her condition to female trouble, saying : \u201cUnless she is operated on and the female organs removed she is sure to go to a further and more marked mental deterioration than at the present time. Having known her and examined her, it is my opinion at this time and in December of 1929 she was not of that sufficiency of mind to know and understand right from wrong.\u201d Another of appellant\u2019s witnesses, who testified that he was \u201ctechnically an Assistant Criminal District Attorney of Dallas County\u201d expressed the opinion that she was of unsound mind. He testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>to a long acquaintance with appellant. Other witnesses were of the opinion that appellant was insane. The state introduced several witnesses who had known and observed appellant. They expressed the opinion that she was sane.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">A deputy sheriff was permitted, over proper objection, to testify in effect that he was of the opinion that appellant was sane. He had charge of appellant on one occasion during the trial, at which time he took her \u201cdown stairs and back.\u201d He gave no description of her demeanor; nor did he recount any word or action of hers, but said: <em>\u201c1 </em>never paid any particular attention to her.\u201d He said he talked to appellant \u201ca little.\u201d We quote the language of Judge Lattimore in Shields v. State, 283 S. W. 844 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u201cIn this connection, however, we may say that it being manifestly impossible for this court to lay down any hard and fast rules as to the exact amount and extent of the predicate which should precede the testimony of a nonexpert witness offered to prove the sanity of the accused, we will not hold such testimony incompetent in a given case unless there appears to have been so little knowledge, opportunity, etc., shown to form a conclusion in the regard mentioned, as would manifest an abuse of the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The opportunity the witness had for forming the opinion that appellant was sane was not, in our opinion, sufficient. The issue of insanity was closely contested. Under the facts of this case, we are unable to reach the conclusion that the testimony of the deputy sheriff might not turn the scales against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
