Thereafter the case was affirmed by this court arid mandate issued on January 27, 1928. On the 11th day of February, 1928, the district clerk of Chambers County issued a capias for the arrest of relator. Relator was not arrested until November 9, 1928, at which time he was taken into custody by the sheriff of Chambers County and delivered to the penitentiary authorities, being received in the penitentiary on November 9, 1928. About May 8, 1928, the sheriff found relator in his father\u2019s home. Relator was ill at the time, it appearing that he had been in a hospital in Houston and had recently been removed to his father\u2019s home. The sheriff did not arrest relator but permitted him to remain with liis father. This agreement was entered into by the relator, the sheriff and relator\u2019s bondsmen. Finally, in November, 1928, the sheriff went back to the home of relator\u2019s father and carried relator to the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Relator contends that the time he was ill in the home of his father and in the hospital in Houston prior to the time he was taken to the penitentiary should be deducted from his sentence. If relator had been credited with such time he would have been entitled to release on the 4th day of February, 1930, taking into consideration overtime and time off for good behavior. If the time appellant was at large can not properly be deducted from his sentence, he is not entitled to be discharged at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The agreement of the sheriff to permit appellant to remain at large was void, and during such time the law treated appellant as a prisoner at large. Ex parte Wyatt, 16 S. W. 301. No deduction from relator\u2019s sentence could accrue for the time he was at large. Ex parte Lawson, 266 S. W. 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">The foregoing opinion of the Conjmission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
