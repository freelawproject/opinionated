Appellant was alone in the car. The officers testified that appellant\u2019s wife had been ill. It appears that she died shortly after appellant\u2019s arrest. Appellant testified that his wife used whiskey for medicinal purposes. The court properly submitted to the jury appellant\u2019s defense. The issues having been resolved against him, we are unable to say that the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>The search warrant under which the officers operated was invalid and the court erroneous permitted the officers to testify touching the result of the search. Appellant having testified to the same criminative facts embraced in the testimony of the officers relative to finding the whiskey in his car, he is in no position to assert that the erroneous reception of the testimony of the officers was harmful.
