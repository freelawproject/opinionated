Appellant contends that state\u2019s witness Raynie Cooper was an accomplice, and that the corroborative evidence is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">The testimony of Cooper was to the effect that he and J. Scott Hall went to appellant\u2019s residence and that Hall bought approximately thirty gallons of whiskey from appellant. It does not appear that Cooper was interested in the whiskey. He drank some of it and aided Hall in carrying it away from appellant\u2019s home. It appears that appellant\u2019s contention that Cooper was an accomplice is based upon the fact that the witness testified that he helped appellant and Hall place the whiskey in some kegs and jugs that Hall had procured. As we understand the record, Cooper merely aided Hall in taking possession of the whiskey and carrying it away. We are constrained to hold that the witness was not an accomplice as a matter of law. There was no request that the question as to whether he was an accomplice be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Believing the evidence sufficient to support the conviction, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">\n<em>A lfirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b443-15\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b443-16\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ALn\">Appellant again raises the question that the State witness Co'oper was an accomplice. We have again reviewed the record, but are of opinion that he was not shown to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>an accomplice. The purchaser of intoxicating liquor is expressly exempted from being such accomplice, and one who acted with the purchaser would appear to stand in the same relation to the matter. If Cooper be considered an accomplice, there would appear in the record ample corroboration. There are no bills of exception in the record, and no objection to the testimony of the sheriff, which is also complained of in the motion. We see no reason for finding fault with the jury for accepting and believing the testimony of the State witness, and in concluding appellant guilty of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
