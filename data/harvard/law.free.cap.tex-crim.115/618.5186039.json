This is absolutely essential. Art. 827, C. C. P.; Palmer v. State, 141 S. W. 109; Gentry v. State, 10 S. W. (2d) 732; See Notes under Art. 827, Vol. 3, Vernon\u2019s Tex. C, C. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">A hasty examination of the record further reveals that it shows no judgment of conviction. It does show the verdict of the jury, but if judgment was entered thereon the record fails to bring it forward. Donegan v. State, 89 Tex. Cr. R. 193; 230 S. W. 166; Cane v. State, 91 Tex. Cr. R. 500, 239 S. W. 948; Kolos v. State, 90 Tex. Cr. R. 492, 236 S. W. 473. For other authorities see Note 4, Sec. 123, Vol. 4, Texas Jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">The transcript shows an \u201cinformation,\u201d but no \u201ccomplaint\u201d is found furnishing a basis for the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">ON MOTION TO REINSTATE APPEAL.</p>\n<author id=\"b647-15\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Avy\">The appeal in this case was dismissed because the record contained no notice of appeal, no judgment of conviction, and no complaint upon which the information was based. Within the time prescribed appellant has filed with the clerk of this court a supplemental transcript containing properly certified copies from the minutes showing notice of appeal , given and entered of record, also a judgment of conviction; and also there appears a duly certified copy of the complaint. which was on file and part of the record when the case was tried. The appeal will be reinstated, and the case considered on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">The complaint and information charge that appellant \u201cunlawfully with premeditated design, and. by the use of means calculated to inflict great .bodily injury, to-wit: by the use of a piece of. pipe, in and upon N. C. Curry, did commit an aggravated assault.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>his charge to the jury the court instructed them as follows: \u201cAn assault becomes aggravated when committed under the following circumstances: When committed by a person of robust health or strength upon one who is aged and decrepit.\u201d An exception was directed at this part of the charge as not being in conformity with the grounds of the assault laid in the complaint and information, and further that the giving of said charge was prejudicial because the facts showed appellant to be a person of robust health and strength and the prosecuting witness to be aged- and decrepit. Clearly the giving of this charge was erroneous. The charge of the court to the jury should only submit the question of guilt predicated upon an assault committed in the manner and by the use of the means set out in the indictment or information. Appellant testified in his own behalf, affirming that he did not strike Curry, the injured party, with any pipe, but did strike him with his hand. We are constrained to believe that the giving of the charge above referred to, which was manifestly erroneous, may have been of material injury to the cause of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">For the error referred to, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
