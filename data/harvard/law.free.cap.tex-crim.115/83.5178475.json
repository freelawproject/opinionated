Appellant denied the sale and proved by two or three witnesses his good reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-20\">Bill of exception number one reflects that during the selection of the jury counsel for appellant asked a prospective juror: (1) if he belonged \u201cto any organization for the promotion of prohibition,\u201d and (2d) if he donated money \u201cto any such organization.\u201d From the court\u2019s qualification it appears that the juror answered that he did not belong to any organization for the promotion of prohibition, but over objection from the district attorney he was not permitted to answer the second question. The bill does not show what his answer would have been. The court certifies in his qualification that appellant made no claim of being forced to exhaust his challenges or having to accept any objectionable juror. This bill is fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ther defective in not showing what became of the juror being questioned. So far as the bill shows he may have been accepted by appellant. Some distinction has been made as to who will be regarded as an objectionable juror, depending on whether the question is the exercise of peremptory challenge, or the right to challenge for cause. Kerley v. State, 89 Tex. Cr. R. 199, 230 S. W. 163; Tubb v. State, 5 S. W. (2d) 152. However, we are aware of no case where a reversal has been predicated on so meager a bill as that here relied on. In Kerley\u2019s case it was shown that appellant was compelled to take three jurors whom he would have challenged peremptorily but for the error of the court in denying him the number of. challenges he was entitled to.' In Tubb\u2019s case it is stated that \u201cappellant exhausted his peremptory challenges, but was nevertheless forced to take objectionable jurors.\u201d The bill is thought not to present error calling for reversal. Willis v. State, 91 Tex. Cr. R. 329, 239 S. W. 212; Johnson v. State, 108 Tex. Cr. R. 499, 1 S. W. (2d) 896; Grille v. State, 20 S. W. (2d) 424. .</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\">Appellant complains (bill number two) because the court refused to give a requested charge defining \u201csale.\u201d Assuming that the requested charge was correct in form the necessity for it in the present case is not perceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u201cIf the undisputed proof shows that the transaction, if it occurred at all, was a sale, it is not error to refuse to define the term sale, but where the transfer of whisky is made in such a manner as that it becomes a question as to whether it was a sale, then it is necessary for the court to define that term. Stephens v. State, 50 Texas Crim. Rep. 251, 96 S. W. Rep. 7; Trinkle v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep., 187, 131 S. W. Rep. 583.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Bramblett v. State, 94 Tex. Cr. R. 250, 250 S. W. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The requested charge brought forward in bill number three was sufficiently covered in the main charge, hence its refusal was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b112-10\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"APd\">In an earnest and courteous motion appellant- insists that we erred in overruling his bill of exception complaining that he was not allowed to ask certain questions of each individual juror. He insists that the record shows that he did exhaust his peremptory challenges. We have again carefully scrutinized same, but fail to find anything therein verifying his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>tention. Without reviewing the cases cited in appellant\u2019s motion, we think the authorities not applicable. Because of the defective bills of exception in this case, we did not get to the contentions embraced and discussed in the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>Oi'erruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
