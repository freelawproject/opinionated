Appellant and two witnesses gave evidence to the effect that at the time of the alleged sale he was in another county and did not return to O\u2019Donnell until Sunday, the day after the sale is claimed to have occurred, The state introduced evidence of other parties than Moore that appellant was in O\u2019Donnell on the Saturday in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-19\">The issue of alibi was properly submitted and the jury has decided it against appellant. We see no reason to disturb their finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-20\">The only bills of exception in the record complain that the trial court excluded evidence which appellant expected to elicit from the alleged purchaser on cross-examination. Each of the bills sets out the question to which objection was sustained, but neither of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>shows what the answer of the witness would have been. Manifestly the bills are incomplete. For authorities see Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., Sec. 212, page 136, Note 31, Art. 667; Vernon\u2019s Ann. Cr. Statutes of Texas, C. C. P.

For this refusal the charge was excepted tor</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Appellant was indicted for selling intoxicating liquor to Moore. Moore\u2019s testimony showed much familiarity with whisky. He swore repeatedly and positively that he arranged to buy whisky from appellant; that he did buy it from him and pay therefor. He said that later in meeting an officer he broke the bottle of whisky and spilled its contents, but that he smelled same. We quote from his testimony: \u201cI did not touch this liquor I bought. I did not even uncork the bottle. I know it contained whisky. I know it was whisky. When I broke it it smelled like whisky. * * * I know the contents of that bottle were intoxicating.\u201d This is positive testimony. The court did not err in his refusal to instruct the jury as desired by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
