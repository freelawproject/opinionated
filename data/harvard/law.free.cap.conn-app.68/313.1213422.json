On appeal, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a bill of particulars and the admission of certain evidence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">The court found the following facts. The victim lived with her divorced mother in Wallingford. The victim was six years old in 1990 when her mother met the defendant. In July, 1991, the defendant began living with the victim\u2019s mother, the victim and her sister, and the victim\u2019s grandmother. The victim\u2019s mother and the defendant married in 1992 and had a child of their own in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">From approximately June, 1990, through July, 1996, the defendant repeatedly sexually abused and attempted to sexually abuse the victim. The sexual abuse and attempted sexual abuse occurred in the family home. On July 11,1996, the victim\u2019s mother took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>victim, who was then twelve years old, to a physician\u2019s office for treatment of a vaginal rash. Mary Peterson, a certified nurse practitioner, saw the victim and preliminarily diagnosed that the rash was likely a manifestation of the herpes virus. On July 17, 1996, the results of a vaginal culture taken from the victim on July 11, 1996, confirmed Peterson\u2019s preliminary diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">While in the physician\u2019s office on July 17, 1996, the victim\u2019s mother informed Peterson that it was the defendant who had transmitted the herpes virus to the victim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The victim explained to Peterson that the defendant had been sexually abusing her for the last six years. In response, Peterson contacted the department of children and families. The victim now resides with her biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The state filed five separate informations. Each information stated that the defendant was accused of offenses against the victim and that such offenses occurred on \u201cdivers dates between approximately June, 1990, through July, 1996 . . . .\u201d They further stated that the offenses occurred at the family home and listed the address of that residence. Subsequent to the state\u2019s filing its last information, the defendant filed a motion for a bill of particulars, which the court denied. The defendant was subsequently found guilty of the charges against him, and this appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">The defendant first claims that the court abused its discretion when it denied his motions for a bill of particulars and for a new trial because the charges against him lacked sufficient particularity. The defendant claims that this denial violated his due process right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>notice of the charges against him and that such denial prejudiced his defense. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the state\u2019s failure to provide specific dates of the charged offenses violated his constitutional right to a fair trial. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u201c[T]he denial of a motion for a bill of particulars is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will be overturned only upon a clear showing of prejudice to the defendant. ... A defendant can gain nothing from [the claim that the pleadings are insufficient] without showing that he was in fact prejudiced in his defense on the merits and that substantial injustice was done to him because of the language of the information.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kyles, </em>221 Conn. 643, 653, 607 A.2d 355 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The defendant asks this court to determine whether the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a bill of particulars, in the absence of specific dates in the state\u2019s information, denied him his due process right to notice of the nature of the charges against him. In support of this claim, the defendant makes various overlapping assertions, but essentially argues that the state failed to apprise him of the nature of the charges against him because the state failed to provide the defendant with the \u201cdates, times and places\u201d of the offenses charged. The defendant further argues that the inexactness of the state\u2019s allegations precluded him from presenting an alibi defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Our Supreme Court has held numerous times that \u201c[t]he state has a duty to inform a defendant, within reasonable limits, of the time when the offense charged was alleged to have been committed. The state does not have a duty, however, to disclose information which the state does not have. Neither the sixth amendment [to] the United States constitution nor article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution requires that the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>choose a particular moment as the time of an offense when the best information available to the state is imprecise.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Laracuente, </em>205 Conn. 515, 519, 534 A.2d 882 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1036, 108 S. Ct. 1598, 99 L. Ed. 2d 913 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasius, </em>211 Conn. 455, 559 A.2d 1116 (1989), the state charged the defendant with sexual abuse that it alleged occurred over approximately a six month period. Our Supreme Court held that the state did not breach its duty to inform the defendant of the nature of the charges against him because the state did not know to a \u201creasonable certainty that the [offenses were] committed within a narrower time frame than that provided in the [information] . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Saraceno, </em>15 Conn. App. 222, 234\u201435, 545 A.2d 1116, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 823, 824, 552 A.2d 431, 432 (1988), the state, \u201cto the best of its ability,\u201d identified in a substitute information the time and date of when the charged offenses of sexual assault occurred. We held that \u201c[t]he general rule in Connecticut is that [t]ime is not an essential ingredient of the crime of [sexual assault].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 236. Furthermore, we noted that there was no evidence that the state knew the precise dates of the offenses and deliberately withheld them from the defendant. Id. Had that been the case, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s claim . . . would [have been] more convincing.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn. 359, 363, 556 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 933, 110 S. Ct. 322, 107 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989), the information alleged that the defendant committed the crimes of sexual assault and risk of injury to a child between October, 1984, and January 3, 1985. Our Supreme Court noted that \u201c[i]t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>would have been virtually impossible to provide the many specific dates upon which the acts constituting the offenses occurred. . . . The reluctance of the court to force the state to furnish the exact dates of the many continuing acts of the defendant during the . . . period covered by the information and which were claimed, in toto, to have constituted [the charged offenses] was shown to be clearly reasonable by the testimony of the trial.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 386-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In this case, the record shows that the state was merely aware of possible dates on which the offenses might have occurred, but that it chose not to plead them in its final information because those dates were unsubstantiated by the evidence. For example, the information filed on March 7, 2000, pinpointed a ten day window, from July 5 to 15, 1996, during which some of the offenses might have occurred. The final information, however, did not include those dates because, as the record demonstrates, the information was imprecise. Before ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars, the court asked the assistant state\u2019s attorney about his knowledge of specific dates. The assistant state\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cI cannot give the defendant anything I don\u2019t have.\u201d The record supports the assertion that the state did not have knowledge of the specific dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">At trial, the victim\u2019s testimony was inconsistent in various respects. The victim testified that she told Peterson that the defendant sexually assaulted her on July 3, 1996. Just moments later, she testified that she did not tell Peterson that she had been sexually assaulted on that date. The victim was otherwise unable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>to pinpoint any specific dates throughout the six year time period ranging from June, 1990, to July, 1996. It is reasonable to conclude, on the basis of the record, that the state had imprecise information regarding the exact timing, or a narrower time frame, of the sexual assaults and necessarily omitted such dates from its final information.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The record reveals that the state\u2019s best information regarding the exact times of the charged offenses was imprecise. On the basis of the information available to it, the state reasonably and to the best of its ability set forth the time period of the charged offenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state did not breach its duty to disclose information to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>defendant because it did not have such information. The court acted within its sound discretion when it denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars. Because we reach this conclusion, we likewise conclude that the court\u2019s ruling did not cause the defendant to suffer harm and that he is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In addition, the defendant asserts that he was impermissibly precluded from presenting an alibi defense by the state\u2019s inability to provide exact dates of the offenses. Our Supreme Court has rejected this precise claim several times. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>205 Conn. 528, 535, 534 A.2d 1159 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 988, 108 S. Ct. 1292, 99 L. Ed. 2d 502 (1988). \u201cThat a defendant may offer an alibi defense is a factor to be considered by the court in deciding whether to grant a motion [for a bill of particulars], but an alibi defense does not create a per se requirement that the state limit the times in the information more narrowly than the evidence available warrants.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 387. On the basis of <em>Evans </em>and our previous discussion in this opinion, we conclude that the defendant was not impermissibly precluded from presenting an alibi defense by the state\u2019s inability to provide exact dates of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly allowed into evidence detailed constancy of accusation testimony in violation of <em>State v. Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 677 A.2d 917 (1996) (en banc), and that such testimony caused him substantial prejudice. The defendant claims that the court improperly allowed constancy of accusation witnesses to testily as to the \u201cspecifics\u201d of the victim\u2019s complaint. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Because constancy of accusation testimony is evidentiary in nature, a trial court\u2019s admission of such testimony will be reversed on appeal only where there has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>been an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant that such abuse has caused him substantial prejudice or injustice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Beliveau, </em>237 Conn. 576, 592, 678 A.2d 924 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The defendant has asked this court to determine whether the testimony of the state\u2019s constancy of accusation witnesses exceeded the boundaries of admissibility established by our Supreme Court in <em>Troupe. </em>He alleges that the court allowed into evidence the testimony of Peterson, the certified nurse practioner who had examined the victim; Christina King,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the arresting officer from the Wallingford police department; Shelly Glaser, a social worker for the department of children and families; and the victim\u2019s grandmother concerning the substantive details of the offenses charged, rather than for any permissible corroborative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Constancy of accusation testimony is deeply rooted in Connecticut common law. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>257 Conn. 156, 187, 777 A.2d 604 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 294-97. In <em>Troupe, </em>our Supreme Court limited the common-law rule,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> holding that \u201ca person to whom a sexual assault victim has reported the assault may testify only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint; any testimony by the witness regarding the details surrounding the assault must be strictly limited to those necessary to associate the victim\u2019s complaint with the pending charge, including, for example, the time and place of the attack or the identity of the alleged perpetrator. In all other respects, our current rules remain in effect. Thus, such evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Furthermore, \u201c[i]n determining whether to permit [constancy of accusation] testimony, the trial court must balance the probative value of the evidence against any prejudice to the defendant. . . . [Constancy of accusation evidence is not admissible unless the victim has testified, and is subject to cross-examination, concerning the crime and the identity of the person or persons to whom the victim has reported the crime . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>60 Conn. App. 562, 573, 761 A.2d 766 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 925, 767 A.2d 100 (2001). Our Supreme Court has reaffirmed <em>Troupe\u2019s </em>limitation on the admissibility of constancy of accusation testimony on several occasions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 187; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>244 Conn. 640, 645, 712 A.2d 919 (1998); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 297-98, 303-304; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>229 Conn. 557, 565, 643 A.2d 854 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">This court, as well, has reviewed numerous trial court decisions in light of <em>Troupe. </em>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Orhan, </em>52 Conn. App. 231, 243, 726 A.2d 629 (1999), we held that \u201c[t]he controlling language from <em>Troupe </em>does not limit the identifying information that may be provided. It limits only the extent of the information provided. Our Supreme Court merely gave examples of how a sexual assault might be identified; it did not hold that that was the only testimony that could be provided.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barile, </em>54 Conn. App. 866, 872-73, 738 A.2d 709 (1999). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Lisevick, </em>65 Conn. App. 493, 508, 783 A.2d 73, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 933, 785 A.2d 230 (2001), we recognized that \u201c[o]ur Supreme Court did not limit the exact terms a constancy of accusation witness could use in her testimony.\u201d Most recently, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>65 Conn. App. 449, 465, 783 A.2d 53, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 927, 783 A.2d 1032 (2001), we were confronted with a defendant charged with various counts of sexual abuse based on various actions taken by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>defendant against the victim. We held that \u201c[u]nder <em>Troupe, </em>the state is allowed to introduce any constancy of accusation testimony found necessary to associate the victim\u2019s complaint with the pending charges.\u201d Id. 464-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The defendant in this case was charged with various counts of sexual assault. The victim testified as to the details of those sexual assaults<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and as to the identities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>of those to whom she reported such incidents. The state, thereafter, corroborated the victim\u2019s testimony with the testimony of four additional witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Peterson\u2019s testimony corroborated the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant tried to put his penis inside of her vagina after she came out of the shower. Peterson testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that the victim told her that \u201ctwo weeks prior to the [victim\u2019s] visit [to her] office . . . [the victim] was getting out of the shower and . . . her stepfather approached her and attempted to put his penis in her and tried to kiss her.\u201d Peterson\u2019s testimony, therefore, supported the victim\u2019s direct testimony and was permissible to corroborate that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The court also heard Glaser\u2019s testimony. Glaser testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that the victim told her \u201cshe had been sexually molested in her vaginal area and her breasts by the defendant. [The victim] also explained oral sex performed by the defendant on her. [The victim] also explained that [the defendant] attempted to put his penis inside of her.\u201d Like Peterson\u2019s testimony, Glaser\u2019s testimony supported the victim\u2019s direct testimony and was permissible to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony on direct and cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Additionally, King\u2019s testimony further corroborated the victim\u2019s direct testimony. King testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that the victim complained that the defendant \u201chad asked her to touch his penis . . . [and] had attempted to . . . perform oral sex on her and touch her breasts . . . [and that the defendant also] attemptfed] to put his penis between her legs.\u201d King stated further that the victim told her that the sexual assaults usually \u201coccurred when [the victim] was leaving the shower to go get her clothes.\u201d King\u2019s testimony, like that of Peterson and Glaser, was corroborative of the victim\u2019s testimony on direct and cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Finally, the court had the benefit of testimony from the victim\u2019s grandmother. The grandmother testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, as to what she overheard the victim say to one of the victim\u2019s friends while they were seated in the back of the grandmother\u2019s car. She testified<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that she heard the victim say, \u201c[The defendant] asked me to put his penis in [my] mouth . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The defendant argues that the court improperly admitted the testimony of the victim\u2019s grandmother because it cannot be classified as constancy of accusa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>tion testimony. He argues that testimony can qualify as constancy of accusation testimony only if it was elicited from a person to whom the victim intentionally and directly reported an alleged sexual assault. We recognize that our case law discusses such testimony in that context; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 187; <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 304; but we do not, however, read <em>Troupe </em>as creating such a defined limitation. On the basis of our reading of <em>Troupe </em>and its progeny, we conclude that the distinction that the defendant attempts to draw in this regard is of no consequence. The import of such constancy of accusation testimony is that the victim made prior allegations of abuse, not the identity of the person or persons to whom such statements were made. We decline, therefore, under the present circumstances, to hold that the court improperly admitted the testimony of the victim\u2019s grandmother and we hold that it falls within the purview of constancy of accusation testimony. The court properly admitted the grandmother\u2019s testimony because the grandmother heard from the victim\u2019s mouth her statement of abuse and, thus, her testimony was constancy of accusation testimony, which served to corroborate the victim\u2019s direct testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">After a careful review of the evidence, we conclude that the court properly admitted all of the challenged constancy of accusation testimony because such testimony corroborated the victim\u2019s accusations and associated the defendant with the pending charges. The defendant has shown neither that the court abused its discretion in admitting the constancy of accusation testimony nor that he has been substantially prejudiced by the admission of such testimony. The court, therefore, acted within its sound discretion and did not exceed the limitations set forth in <em>Troupe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly permitted the state to elicit expert testimony without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>requiring the state to make an adequate showing of reliability. The defendant argues that the court improperly concluded that the evidence satisfied the standard set forth in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), as adopted by our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 698 A.2d 739 (1997) (en banc), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S. Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1998), and codified in the Connecticut Code of Evidence \u00a7 7-2, which requires a trial court to make a threshold inquiry into the admissibility of scientific evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Underlying the defendant\u2019s claim is the presumption that the testimony of John Leventhal, professor of pediatrics at the Yale Medical School and attending pediatric physician at Yale-New Haven Hospital, constitutes \u201cscientific evidence.\u201d Specifically, the defendant argues that the state offered, and the court improperly admitted, Leventhal\u2019s testimony to explain that victims of sexual abuse often lack precision in their allegations and to show the common factors regarding a victim\u2019s delay in reporting sexual abuse. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">We first note our standard of review. \u201c[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility . . . of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Copas, 252 </em>Conn. 318, 326, 746 A.2d 761 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The defendant has asked this court to determine whether the trial court properly concluded that Leventhal\u2019s reasoning or methodology was scientifically valid. The defendant contends that Leventhal\u2019s testimony was based on \u201cnothing more than mere speculation\u201d and, as such, fails to comport with the <em>Daubert </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">It is first necessary to determine whether such evidence is of the kind contemplated by <em>Porter </em>before subjecting it to the <em>Daubert </em>standard for admissibility. Stated differently, we must determine whether Leventhal\u2019s challenged expert testimony qualifies as \u201c \u2018scientific evidence.\u2019 \u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>254 Conn. 540, 546, 757 A.2d 482 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">In <em>Porter, </em>our Supreme Court \u201cexplicitly adopted the <em>Daubert </em>test to determine the admissibility of scientific evidence . . .

Courts apply the <em>Daubert </em>standard only when such testimony involves \u201cinnovative scientific techniques . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 546. To determine if such a technique exists, we look to see whether the trier of fact is \u201cin a position to weigh the probative value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the testimony without abandoning common sense and sacrificing independent judgment to the expert\u2019s assertions based on his special skill or knowledge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

(Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 547;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hasan </em>supra, 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">On the basis of our review of relevant case law, Leventhai\u2019s testimony did not rise to the level of scientific evidence. We recognize that no appellate court in this state has held that the technique for evaluating the behavior of sexually abused children is not \u201cscientific evidence.\u201d In <em>Borrelli, </em>however, our Supreme Court held that expert testimony concerning battered wom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>an\u2019s syndrome was not scientific because it was based on the expert\u2019s \u201cobservations of a large number of battered women through the lens of his educational background and experience\u201d and that the purpose of the testimony was \u201cto provide an interpretation of the facts.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Borrelli, </em>227 Conn. 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Further examination of Leventhal\u2019s testimony reveals that it was very similar to the nonscientific expert testimony admitted in <em>Borrelli. </em>Like the expert in <em>Borrelli, </em>Leventhal did not personally examine the victim. Although he formed a personal opinion as to the defendant\u2019s ultimate guilt and testified that there were signs that the victim had herpes before she was diagnosed, he did not offer any opinion as to whether the victim in fact had been sexually abused. Leventhal \u201cdid not apply any scientific instrument or test to specific evidence in the case\u201d and he \u201cdid not apply any scientific test to a hypothetical question posed by the state.\u201d Id., 164-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Leventhal merely explained, on the basis of his experience and education, how children subjected to sexual abuse might act under certain circumstances. Additionally, his method of studying and comparing the allegations of numerous child victims of sexual abuse based on his education and experience was accessible to the court, and the value of his testimony was rooted in its assistance to the court in viewing and evaluating the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">We find, on the basis of the circumstances of this case, that the court was in a position to weigh the probative value of the testimony without abandoning common sense and sacrificing independent judgment to the expert\u2019s assertions based on his special skill or knowledge, and that this evidence was not based on obscure scientific theories that were potentially misleading to the trier of fact. We conclude, therefore, that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>like the testimony in <em>Borrelli, </em>Leventhal\u2019s testimony was not scientific. As a result, the court was not required to determine whether his testimony satisfied the <em>Daubert </em>standard for admissibility. Because we conclude that Leventhal\u2019s testimony was not scientific, the court acted within its sound discretion in admitting his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court\u2019s evidentiary errors deprived him of a fair trial. The defendant claims that the court\u2019s admission of constancy of accusation testimony, coupled with Leventhal\u2019s expert testimony, constituted reversible, cumulative evidentiary error. Specifically, he argues that the court allowed the state\u2019s constancy of accusation witnesses to testify \u201cmechanically\u201d and \u201crepeatedly\u201d as to the details of the victim\u2019s allegations, and that Leventhal\u2019s testimony was speculative. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Because we have concluded that the trial court properly admitted the challenged constancy of accusation testimony, along with Leventhal\u2019s expert testimony, no error exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">In this opinion O\u2019CONNELL, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-10\"> At trial, however, the victim\u2019s mother asserted that the defendant was innocent and that the victim had lied about the entire six year period during which she was repeatedly sexually abused.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> The court in the present case held that while the victim\u2019s testimony \u201ccontained inconsistencies in various respects, [it found] her basic story of sexual abuse by the defendant to be credible.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\"> Because we conclude that the state neither possessed reasonably precise information regarding more specific dates nor breached its duty to provide such dates, we likewise conclude that the defendant has not suffered any harm. Alternatively, were we to assume that the state had access to reasonably certain information or that the court abused its discretion when it denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars, we nevertheless would conclude that the defendant has failed to show any prejudice that resulted from the court\u2019s denial of his motion. \u201cTo establish prejudice, the defendant must show that the information was necessary to his defense, and not merely that the preparation of his defense was made more burdensome or difficult by the failure to provide the information. . . . [T]his court has on numerous occasions adverted to sources extrinsic to the specific count or information to determine whether the defendant was sufficiently apprised of the offense charged.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kyles, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">In the present case, before the trial began, the defendant had access to the same information concerning the alleged dates of the charged offenses as did the state. The defendant cannot now claim that he was unaware of the specific dates omitted from the state\u2019s final information because he had access to such information through discovery. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Madagoski, </em>59 Conn. App. 394, 404-405, 757 A.2d 47 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 924, 767 A.2d 100 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Additionally, the defendant has not demonstrated that such information was necessary to his defense. The focus of his theory of defense was that the victim lied about the entire six year period in which she claimed that he had sexually abused her. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s assertion that information regarding specific dates within a two week period that occurred in the last month of a six year time frame was \u201cnecessary\u201d to his defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kyles, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 654.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\"> Both the defendant and the state refer to King by her former last name, Hill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\"> See <em>State </em>v.

It is clear from this victim\u2019s testimony that she was never asked to pinpoint the dates of her assaults until her cross-examination and when asked was able to pinpoint the month and year in which she said they began. The prejudice to this defendant was obvious. He was required to defend against an unparticularized information, which would permit a conviction for occurrences within a six year time period, when a narrower time frame than that provided in the information was available. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasius, </em>211 Conn. 455, 461, 559 A.2d 1116 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 242, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S.
