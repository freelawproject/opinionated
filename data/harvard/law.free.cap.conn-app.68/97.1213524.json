J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABv\">The defendant, Michael Spyke, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-54a and possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 29-38. The jury also found that the defendant had committed a class A, B or C felony with a firearm, and that finding was used by the court to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence. He raises seven claims on appeal, six of which we can review. The defendant claims that (1) the court improperly denied his motion to suppress, (2) the court improperly failed to disclose all relevant material for cross-examination following an in camera <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>review, (3) the court improperly barred cross-examination regarding prior misconduct by the arresting officers, (4) the state\u2019s attorney committed prosecutorial misconduct in her closing argument, (5) the court\u2019s \u201cChip Smith\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charge coerced the deadlocked jury to reach a verdict on the charge of murder as an accessory and (6) the court improperly failed to give a jury instruction that the jury could consider the circumstances under which the defendant\u2019s statement was taken. The defendant agrees that the seventh issue, that our Supreme Court should exercise its supervisory power to order that the Chip Smith charge be modified or abandoned, is an issue for that court alone to decide. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately 10:15 p.m. on December 20, 1997, the defendant and two others jumped out of a stolen van and shot the victim, Malik Shannon, four times with handguns and an assault rifle in the Blue Hills Avenue section of Hartford. The victim died as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">On April 22,1998, Detectives Robert Dionne and Stephen Grabowski of the Hartford police department arrested the defendant pursuant to a warrant for his involvement in the killing. He was brought to the police station for questioning, executed a <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>waiver and confessed to taking part in the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The state charged the defendant with murder, conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-54a, possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle and commission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his confession as involuntary on December 1, 1999, and a jury trial began shortly there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>after. At trial, the defendant maintained that he had been only a passenger in the van and did not shoot the victim, and again claimed that his confession was involuntary. The defendant was found guilty on December 13, 1999, of all charges except the conspiracy charge. On the conspiracy charge, the jury was deadlocked eleven to one in favor of conviction, and a mistrial was declared as to that count. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The defendant challenges the court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the written statement that he made to Dionne and Grabowski in which he admitted that he shot the victim. The court found that the defendant was in custody and that the police were required to read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to interrogation, but that the defendant\u2019s waiver of those rights was knowing, intelligent and voluntary. The defendant does not challenge the test used by the court or most of its factual findings, but claims that it improperly concluded that the confession was voluntary. He claims that his statement was involuntary in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u201c[T]he use of an involuntary confession in a criminal trial is a violation of due process. . . . The state has the burden of proving the voluntariness of the confession by a fair preponderance of the evidence. . . . The ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>mate test remains ... Is the confession the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker? If it is, if he has willed to confess, it may be used against him. If it is not, if his will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired, the use of his confession offends due process.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinder, </em>250 Conn. 385, 418-19, 736 A.2d 857 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">A trial court determines the voluntariness of a confession on the basis of the circumstances. The factors may include the age of the accused, his level of education, his intelligence, whether he was advised of his constitutional rights, \u201cthe repeated and prolonged nature of the questioning; and the use of physical punishment, such as the deprivation of food and sleep.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 419. Other factors are the accused\u2019s prior interaction with the criminal justice system; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>65 Conn. App. 59, 73, 782 A.2d 149, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 923, 782 A.2d 1251 (2001); and voluntary use of illegal drugs or alcohol. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>184 Conn. 121, 134, 439 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">On appeal, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s findings as to the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s interrogation and confession are findings of fact . . . which will not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinder, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 420. We accord plenary review to the legal conclusion that the confession was voluntary based on our own scrupulous examination of the record. Id., 420-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">We conclude that the court took the appropriate factors into account and gave them the proper weight. In a thoughtful and well reasoned oral decision, the court found that the state met its burden to show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary under the totality of the circumstances. Although the defendant had a limited formal education and testified that he had dropped out of school the year before his confession after three unsuccessful attempts to complete the ninth grade, the court found there was no evidence of mental defect and that a letter that the defendant wrote to the court evinced his ability to read and write at a level that \u201cfar surpasse[d]\u201d the minimum. The court also found that the defendant had a \u201cvery easy way of communicating.\u201d It rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that his age of sixteen years and eleven months strongly counseled that his confession was involuntary, and properly concluded that \u201cit has been left for me to decide in the case of anybody over the age of sixteen, to make a determination on a case-by-case basis depending on the unique circumstances of each individual involved . . . .\u201d The court also noted that the defendant had heard a recitation of <em>Miranda </em>rights during a prior interaction with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">As to the contours of the interrogation and confession, the court stated that the account of what occurred was largely a \u201cconflict of credibility,\u201d and credited the detectives\u2019 testimony, concluding \u201cthat the testimony of the defendant in many respects was not credible . . . .\u201d Citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>202 Conn. 39, 50-51, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987), the court noted that an oral or written waiver is \u201cstrong proof\u2019 of its validity and that the defendant signed the waiver form and initialed the individual rights that he was waiving. As to the defendant\u2019s assertion that he was under the influence of illy,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court did not find \u201cany qualitative evidence other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>[the defendant\u2019s] testimony\u201d that he was impaired. It noted that no drugs were found on the defendant\u2019s person, that Dionne testified that he did not smell the odor of illy when he and Grabowski arrested the defendant and that the defendant testified that the drug had the effect of giving him a lot of energy, a condition that dissipated when he was questioned. The court also discredited the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was physically abused and threatened by Dionne. Additionally, the court took into account that the defendant was \u201callowed to make the telephone call to his mother\u201d beforehand and that he was allowed to make other telephone calls after the confession. It also found that the questioning lasted approximately three and one-half hours of the five hours that the defendant was at the station, which it concluded was not unduly long. The defendant was not deprived of food or other comforts, and the court noted that the defendant refused Grabowski\u2019s offer for food. Finally, it found that the defendant did not request an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">On appeal, the defendant asks us to weigh some of the court\u2019s findings differently. Specifically, he argues that his lack of education and the length of interrogation \u201cweigh heavily\u201d in making his confession involuntaiy. He restates allegations that he was under the influence of illy, \u201ca powerful and bizarre intoxicant,\u201d and curiously claims that Grabowski\u2019s offer of food and drink may have contributed to the interrogation\u2019s coerciveness. According to the defendant, \u201c[although [an offer of food] can be seen as an effort to alleviate the coercive atmosphere in which the defendant finds himself, it also serves to underline the remorseless and continuing nature of the interrogation.\u201d He argues that his youth, however, is the factor that \u201cmust be given the highest precedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The defendant\u2019s assertion that he was under the influence of illy is undercut by his own testimony as to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>effects. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>221 Conn. 315, 323 n.8, 603 A.2d 1138 (1992). Furthermore, the court\u2019s factual finding that there was no corroborating evidence that the defendant was even on the drug is not clearly erroneous. The defendant\u2019s educational level; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Northrop, </em>213 Conn. 405, 418, 568 A.2d 439 (1990), and cases cited therein; and the length of the interrogation; see <em>State </em>v. <em>DeAngelis, </em>200 Conn. 224, 233-35, 511 A.2d 310 (1986); cf. cases cited in <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>189 Conn. 631, 638, 458 A.2d 379 (1983); do not implicate involuntariness. As to the defendant\u2019s claim that his youth \u201cmust be given the highest precedent,\u201d our Supreme Court repeatedly has held that an individual\u2019s minority is only one factor in the totality of circumstances. See <em>In re Manuel R., </em>207 Conn. 725, 736 n.6, 543 A.2d 719 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>201 Conn. 395, 415, 518 A.2d 35 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>178 Conn. 116, 144-45, 422 A.2d 749 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1013, 100 S. Ct. 661, 62 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>160 Conn. 85, 94, 273 A.2d 867 (1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 946, 91 S. Ct. 1637, 29 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1971). Although General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires a parent to be present and the police to give the equivalent of <em>Miranda </em>warnings where confessions are made by a \u201cchild,\u201d that applies only to a person <em>under </em>the age of sixteen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>Whitaker, </em>215 Conn. 739, 748, 578 A.2d 1031 (1990). The defendant here was a month shy of his seventeenth birthday and was not entitled to the statutory protection. Additionally, the police allowed the defendant to call his mother before questioning, which is beyond what is required. See id., 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The defendant also claims that the court made improper evidentiary rulings that affected his ability to question the arresting detectives effectively. First, he asks that we review the personnel files of Dionne and Grabowski that were viewed by the court in camera and order the court on remand to disclose any information that would be probative of their veracity. He also claims that the court improperly limited his cross-examination of Dionne and Grabowski, depriving him of his right to confrontation under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Shortly before the motion to suppress, the defendant raised the possibility that he might cross-examine Dionne and Grabowski about an incident on February 26, 1998, between themselves and another officer that resulted in extensive media coverage and arrest warrants for both detectives for breach of the peace in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181. The defendant had obtained a copy of Grabowski\u2019s arrest warrant and claimed that it showed that the police investigators had concluded that Dionne and Grabowski lied about their role in the incident. The defendant argued that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>should be allowed to ask the detectives about whether they had lied in order to attack their credibility. At the suppression hearing, defense counsel argued that \u201cif Dionne and Grabowski can assault .... [an] off-duty police officer, can interfere with on-duty officers who come ... to thwart that incident and then he about that, allegedly, afterward, they certainly can do the same thing to my client two months later.\u201d He also subpoenaed the detectives\u2019 personnel files and internal affairs reports regarding the incident and asked the court after an in camera review to disclose any information that would bear on their veracity. Both parties and the court agreed at the start of the trial that the defendant would be allowed to ask the detectives whether they had made any false statements in connection with the February, 1998 incident, but would not allow extrinsic evidence on the matter. During the trial, however, the court reversed itself and announced sua sponte that it would sustain an objection to any question about whether the detectives lied to investigators. It also stated that after the in camera review, it did not find anything in the personnel files that bore on veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u201cA trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is afforded great deference. . . . The trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination. Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion. . . . Furthermore, [t]o establish an abuse of discretion, [the defendant] must show that the restrictions imposed upon [the] cross-examination were clearly prejudicial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>255 Conn. 61, 69, 762 A.2d 1278 (2000). After our own review of the challenged evidence, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The defendant asks that we review the personnel files of the arresting detectives and order the court to turn over any additional material that should have been disclosed. The court reviewed the files in camera and concluded that they were \u201cbarren of anything which I would consider go to the issues of truth and veracity.\u201d To the extent that there were any issues that had a \u201cslight\u201d bearing on credibility, the court determined that it would \u201cinject a number of collateral issues into these proceedings, which potentially could be confusing to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Although public records generally are available pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, General Statutes \u00a7 1-200 et seq., the confidentiality of information in police personnel files that may be relevant to a witness\u2019 credibility is protected by General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>31 Conn. App. 178, 198, 623 A.2d 1052, cert. granted on other grounds, 226 Conn. 912, 628 A.2d 985 (1993) (appeal withdrawn January 7, 1994). To comply with the federal confrontation clause, a court should reveal such information to a defendant, usually after an in camera inspection, only if it is \u201cclearly material and relevant to the issue involved.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 173, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>224 Conn. 325, 337, 618 A.2d 32 (1992). \u201c[E]vidence is material only if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>227 Conn. 751, 762, 631 A.2d 309 (1993). Such a determination should be made on a case-by-case basis. <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>supra, 173. In the event that a trial court does not turn over an entire file to a defendant, we analyze the sealed undisclosed portion to determine whether the court abused its discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 762-63; see also Practice Book \u00a7 40-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">After our own in camera review, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in refusing to turn over any information that the defendant did not already have because the material was neither clearly material nor relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The defendant next challenges the court\u2019s ruling disallowing him from asking Dionne or Grabowski whether they lied to the internal affairs department regarding the February, 1998 arrest. He argues that the court abused its discretion in not allowing him to question the detectives, even with the agreement that he would not attempt to introduce external evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">At the same time that it stated that it would not turn over any information in the personnel report, the court also informed the defendant that it would sustain an objection to any question regarding the February, 1998 incident, even if he did not attempt to offer extrinsic evidence. It stated that it interpreted the arrest warrant to indicate that there were competing stories about the dispute and \u201cthat there may [have been] more backers of one side than the other, and, therefore, Detectives Dionne and Grabowski may not have been the persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>who were ultimately believed. But I don\u2019t think that rises to the level of saying that this presents an issue of veracity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u201cThe sixth amendment to the United States constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him. . . . [T]he primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination . . . and an important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying. . . . Therefore, an accused\u2019s right to cross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice may not be unduly restricted by the wide discretion of the trial court. ... In determining whether a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination has been unduly restricted, we consider the nature of the excluded inquiry, whether the field of inquiry was adequately covered by other questions that were allowed, and the overall quality of the cross-examination viewed in relation to the issues actually litigated at trial. ... In order to comport with the constitutional standards embodied in the confrontation clause, the trial court must allow a defendant to expose to the jury facts from which [the] jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u201cWe have emphasized in numerous decisions, however, that the confrontation clause does not give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination. . . . [T]he right to cross-examine a witness pertaining to specific acts of misconduct is limited in three distinct ways. . . . First, cross-examination may only extend to specific acts of misconduct other than a felony conviction if those acts bear a special significance upon the issue of veracity .... Second, [w]hether to permit cross-examination as to particular acts of misconduct . . . lies largely within the discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>tion of the trial court. . . . Third, extrinsic evidence of such acts is inadmissible.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Valentine, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 70-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">While the court could have allowed the defendant to question the detectives on that subject with the understanding that he would not be able to introduce extrinsic evidence; see, <em>e.g., State v. Chance, </em>236 Conn. 31, 59-61, 671 A.2d 323 (1996); it did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting the questioning in these circumstances. Recently, our Supreme Court upheld a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion in limine that prohibited a defendant from questioning a detective about a prior incident where the detective allegedly had coerced a witness to make a false statement in an affidavit and was later found liable in a civil trial for false arrest and malicious prosecution. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 72-74. Holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, the <em>Valentine </em>court concluded that the previous judgment did not directly implicate the detective\u2019s veracity in that case and that the court properly could have found that it was a collateral matter. Id., 73-74. In light of <em>Valentine, </em>we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in limiting the defendant\u2019s proposed cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The defendant also alleges that portions of the state\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments were improper, depriving him of a fair trial. He argues that the assistant state\u2019s attorney asserted that the defendant was a liar and interjected a fact not in evidence. Although he did not object during the trial, he asks us to undertake <em>Gold</em>ing<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> review.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The defendant first claims that the assistant state\u2019s attorney improperly argued that he was lying during his testimony. During her closing, she stated that \u201c[the defendant] admitted to you that he lied under oath at his preliminary hearing to try to get his confession thrown out,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and, in rebuttal, she stated: \u201cI submit to you that the defendant was not truthful when he took the witness stand.\u201d As the defendant correctly notes, and the state conceded at oral argument, the defendant never testified that he had lied at the suppression hearing, but rather testified that he had said that he did not remember because he did not want to answer certain questions at that time.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant also claims that the assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>tant state\u2019s attorney\u2019s statement that the decision of the Hartford police not to audiotape or videotape confessions was up to Dionne and Grabowski\u2019s supervisors is unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u201c[P]rosecutorial misconduct of constitutional proportions may arise during the course of closing argument .... [T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, and not the culpability of the prosecutor. . . . The issue is whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>256 Conn. 291, 306, 772 A.2d 1107, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1068, 122 S. Ct. 670, 151 L. Ed. 2d 584 (2001). Furthermore, our Supreme Court in <em>Brown </em>recently reaffirmed that a defendant\u2019s <em>Golding </em>claim will not be successful if the alleged misconduct \u201cmerely consisted of isolated and brief episodes that did not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 306. Accordingly, we analyze the defendant\u2019s claims under a two step process: (1) first, we determine whether the challenged statements were improper; (2) second, if so, we determine whether they caused the defendant substantial prejudice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>42 Conn. App. 507, 515-16, 681 A.2d 362, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 928, 929, 683 A.2d 398 (1996). We conclude that because the statements were either fair inferences supported by the record or of such a brief character and later cured by a jury instruction, this claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>258 Conn. 153, 165-66, 778 A.2d 955 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Although it is improper for a prosecutor to express an opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or the credibility of witnesses; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 541, 529 A.2d 653 (1987); it is not improper to use the words \u201cI submit\u201d to highlight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>reasonable inferences that the jury could draw from the evidence presented. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>59 Conn. App. 638, 647, 757 A.2d 1175 (2000), cert. granted on other grounds, 255 Conn. 935, 767 A.2d 1214 (2001). Furthermore, even though it is unprofessional, a prosecutor can argue that a defendant is a \u201cliar\u201d if such an argument is supported by the evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Oehman, </em>212 Conn. 325, 334, 562 A.2d 493 (1989). Accordingly, we conclude that the assistant state\u2019s attorney\u2019s submission that the defendant was not truthful during his testimony was a fair inference to draw, in light of the contrary testimony of other witnesses. It was also a fair inference that the decision not to videotape the defendant\u2019s confession was outside the control of Dionne and Grabowski, as Grabowski testified that he did not know why the department did not videotape confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The statement that the defendant admitted that he lied in his suppression hearing, however, is not supported by the evidence. \u201cA prosecutor, in fulfilling his duties, must confine himself to the evidence in the record. . . . Statements as to facts that have not been proven amount to unsworn testimony, which is not the subject of proper closing argument.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>254 Conn. 290, 306, 755 A.2d 868 (2000). Although this portion of the closing argument was unsupported, we conclude that this single instance of misconduct was not so egregious that it substantially prejudiced the defendant. Not only was it limited to a single instance, but the court also charged the jury that the closing arguments are not evidence and that its memory of the evidence was the controlling one.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such an instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>mitigated any adverse effect that the impermissible statement may have had. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540 (setting forth factors to be taken into account by appellate court when reviewing prosecutorial misconduct claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The defendant\u2019s final two claims allege improprieties in the court\u2019s jury charge that he claims deprived him of his rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant devoted a large portion of his brief and most of his oral argument to the claim that the court coerced a deadlocked jury into reaching a verdict on the murder charge. He also claims that the court improperly failed to charge the jury that it could consider the circumstances under which his statement was taken, which largely constitute the factors that he claims made his statement involuntary. In both instances, he concedes that he did not raise the claim at trial but again asks us to undertake <em>Golding </em>review. See footnote 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The defendant argues that the court\u2019s instructions taken as a whole coerced a jury that had shown the intent to deadlock on the murder charge. He points us to selected portions of three separate instructions. At the end of the second full day of deliberations, the jury submitted a note to the court stating that it was unable to reach a verdict on the murder charge. The defendant points to the portion of Judge Gallagher\u2019s<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> response given on the beginning of the third day of deliberations in which she directed the jury that \u201cwith respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>[murder] count, you need to reach a verdict on the offense charged.\u201d Later in the day, the jury submitted a note to the court asking if it could be unanimous on some counts but not on others. The court stated that it could, but asked the jurors to \u201ckeep working.\u201d Still later, the jury sent a note stating that it was unanimous on the possession of a weapon in the vehicle charge, but deadlocked eleven to one in favor of conviction on the remaining counts. The note concluded: \u201cWe strongly feel that further deliberation will not help one juror. We have a serious problem.\u201d In response, the court gave a \u201cChip Smith\u201d instruction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the defendant concedes that the \u201cChip Smith\u201d charge has been approved on numerous occasions by our Supreme Court; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Feliciano, </em>256 Conn. 429, 439, 778 A.2d 812 <em>(2001), </em>and cases cited therein; he argues that it exacerbated the previous instruction as to the \u201cneed\u201d to reach a verdict on the murder charge. Essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>tially, he argues that the court\u2019s instructions coerced the dissident juror to find the defendant guilty. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Although \u201ca defendant is not entitled to an instruction that a jury may hang ... he is entitled to a jury unfettered by an order to decide.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>235 Conn. 206, 239, 663 A.2d 1026 (1995). \u201cA jury that is coerced in its deliberations deprives the defendant of his right to a fair trial under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution .... Whether a jury [was] coerced by statements of the trial judge is to be determined by an examination of the record. . . . The question is whether in the context and under the circumstances in which the statements were made, the jury [was], actually, or even probably, misled or coerced.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinder, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The defendant asks us to order a new trial on the basis of selected portions of selected instructions. Looking at the challenged instructions as a whole, we conclude that the court did not coerce the jury to reach a verdict. The court\u2019s instruction on the jury\u2019s \u201cneed\u201d to reach a verdict on the murder count should not be read in isolation, but in context with the circumstances and the surrounding language. The jury\u2019s note read, \u201cThis jury is unable to reach a verdict on [the murder charge].\u201d The <em>court, following the defendant\u2019s recommendation, </em>decided to limit its supplemental charge to the murder count and the lesser included offenses, as the jury could have reached a verdict on the remaining counts. Consequently, the court charged the jury: \u201cI don\u2019t know where you are in your deliberations. And it is not necessary that I know where you are. I don\u2019t need to know, don\u2019t want to know where you are. But at this time, I would say to you with respect to the [murder charge] you need to reach a verdict on the offense charged. And that is . . . . accessory to murder. If you were to find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>defendant guilty of the offense charged of accessory to murder, then, of course, you would not consider the lesser included offense that Judge Solomon already gave you a charge on. However, if you were to find the defendant not guilty of . . . the offense charged, then you would go on to consider the lesser included offense. So basically, ladies and gentlemen, you cannot consider the lesser included offense unless and until you have reached a verdict on the offense charged.\u201d Such an instruction is neither coercive nor improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The court later reemphasized that it was not coercing the jury into reaching a verdict. In response to the note asking if the jury could be unanimous on some charges but hung on others, the court instructed that it could, but <em>asked </em>that it keep working on it. Such a request is consistent with Practice Book \u00a7 42-28, which provides that a judge \u201cmay require the [deadlocked] jury to continue their deliberations,\u201d as long as it is not for an unreasonable amount of time. Immediately prior to the \u201cChip Smith\u201d charge, the court gave what our Supreme Court previously has called \u201cpatently fair threshold instructions\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that informed the jury that the charge to follow was not \u201ccoercive in any manner.\u201d See <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>v. <em>O'Neill, </em>200 Conn. 268, 283, 511 A.2d 321 (1986). Accordingly, we conclude that the instructions were not coercive and that the defendant failed to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that because the jury found the defendant guilty of murder but hung on the conspiracy to commit murder charge, it believed that it needed to come to a verdict on the murder charge but not on the other ones. A factually inconsistent verdict may be indicative of negotiation and compromise among the members of the jury and will not be overturned on appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, 242-44, 745 A.2d 800 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The defendant also asks us to review his claim under the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. We decline to do so in instances such as these where the challenged conduct by the court is not incorrect. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 343 n.34, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly failed to charge the jury sua sponte that it could take into account the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s confession when determining if it was voluntary. We decline to review this claim because it is evidentiary and not of constitutional magnitude, and thus fails <em>Golding's </em>second prong. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Riddick, </em>61 Conn. App. 275, 291, 763 A.2d 1062, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 946, 769 A.2d 61 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\"><em> State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>49 Conn. 376, 386 (1881).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-10\"> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.
