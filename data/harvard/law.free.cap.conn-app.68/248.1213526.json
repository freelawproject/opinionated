We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On May 22, 1998, an undercover Norwich police officer, Gregory Post, purchased crack cocaine from an unknown male, whom he had never before encountered, on Lake Street in Norwich. Post provided a description of the individual who sold him the narcotics to Officers Mark Rankowitz and Christopher Ladd. After returning to the police station, Post examined a book compiled by the Norwich police department that contained approximately 200 photographs of persons in the area suspected to be involved with narcotics. Post did not recognize any of the photographs as being of the person who sold him cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">On June 16, 1998, while walking in the vicinity of Lake Street, Officers Rankowitz and Michael Blanchette noticed amale matching Post\u2019s description. The officers approached the male, who identified himself as the defendant. The officers took a photograph of the defendant and placed the picture in the police book. That same day, Post again reviewed the book and, upon seeing the photograph, identified the defendant as the person who sold cocaine to him on May 22, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Thereafter, the defendant was arrested and charged with the sale and possession of narcotics in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 (b) and 21a-279 (a). A jury trial ensued, and the defendant was convicted of both counts. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth where relevant to the claim raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly denied his motion to suppress the photograph of him that was taken by the police because the photograph was a result of an illegal search and seizure in violation of his <em>Terry </em>rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The following facts are pertinent to our disposition of this claim. The defendant filed two motions to suppress the photograph and the photographic identification by Post, one on April 28,1999, and another on May 4, 1999. The defendant filed the April 28, 1999 motion on the ground that \u201cthe photographic identification of the defendant made by [Post] was derived from unnecessarily suggestive procedures in violation of defendant\u2019s State and Federal Constitutional rights and is therefore unreliable.\u201d After a two day hearing regarding that motion, which was held on April 29 and 30, 1999, the trial court denied the motion. In his April 28 motion to suppress, the defendant did not raise the issues of a <em>Terry </em>violation and whether he was subject to an illegal stop and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The only mention of <em>Terry </em>and the principles involving an illegal stop arose at the very end of the suppression hearing, when the state objected to the relevancy of one of the defendant\u2019s questions on cross-examination of Officer Blanchette. The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection and stated that the <em>Terry </em>issue was not relevant to, and not part of, the defendant\u2019s suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>motion. The defendant did not take an exception to that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The defendant then filed another motion to suppress the photograph on May 4, 1999, in which he claimed that the photograph was procured as a result of an illegal stop and seizure. Although the court apparently denied this second motion, the defendant has failed to provide a copy of the transcript indicating the trial court\u2019s ruling. Moreover, after filing the present appeal, the defendant filed a notice pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 64-1<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the trial court had failed to provide either a memorandum of decision or a signed transcript of its denial of the May 4, 1999 motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">In its response pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 64-1, the court did not address the <em>Terry </em>issue and whether the picture taken of the defendant occurred as a result of an illegal search and seizure. Rather, the court stated: \u201cWithout going into the substantive issues raised therein, there were procedural reasons for denying [the May 4, 1999 motion to suppress]. For instance, it was untimely. . . . Nor, should a defendant be allowed seriatim motions on the same, or substantially similar, issue(s). ... In any event, the state did not introduce any photograph(s) of the defendant into evidence at trial. ... At trial, [Post] . . . testified that on June 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>1998, he again looked through the book of photographs and recognized a photograph of the defendant .... While this testimony was being elicited, the defendant made no objection^). . . . Officer Post then identified the defendant in court as the person from whom he had made the [drug] purchase. There was no objection by the defendant. . . . [W]hen the defendant cross-examined Post, the defendant asked Post how the book of photographs had been used. . . . The defendant introduced the book of photographs [into evidence], ... It contained the June 16 photograph of the defendant. The defendant introduced this specific photograph also as a separate exhibit. ... At trial, the defendant did not file any requests to charge touching upon [whether] the court should instruct the jury on any identification issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The trial court concluded by \u201crespectfully requesting] that it be excused from complying with [Practice Book] \u00a7 64-[l] (a) . . . .\u201d The defendant did not file a motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-5 or a motion to compel the trial court to file a memorandum of decision pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 60-2 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">It is well established that it \u201cis the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 61-10. \u201cWhile we do not condone the court\u2019s failure to comply with [Practice Book] \u00a7 4059 [now \u00a7 64-1 (a)] . . . we would not exalt form over substance if the deficiency were of a technical nature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Beliveau, </em>52 Conn. App. 475, 480, 727 A.2d 737, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 920, 733 A.2d 235 (1999). Here, the inadequate record is of a fatal and not technical nature and, thus, prevents our review of the merits of this claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosedom, </em>34 Conn. App. 141, 143, 640 A.2d 634 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>In this case, the record is devoid of the court\u2019s decision and explanation regarding the motion to suppress the photograph and the <em>Terry </em>claim. Although the court, in response to the Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 notice, stated that the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was procedurally flawed, it did not affirmatively state that it denied the motion because of those defects, nor did it provide its basis for denying the motion. Moreover, the record does not reveal any specific findings by the trial court with regard to the defendant\u2019s <em>Terry </em>claim. We additionally note that the defendant failed to file the transcript of the hearing on the May 4, 1999 motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The defendant could have ensured the adequacy of the record by filing a motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-5 or by filing a motion to compel the trial court to file a memorandum of decision pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 60-2. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosedom, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 144-45. The defendant, however, declined to pursue either route. \u201cOur role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court . . . any decision made by us respecting [the defendant\u2019s claims] would be entirely speculative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>63 Conn. App. 851, 861, 779 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 907, 782 A.2d 1250 (2001). In light of the inadequate record before us, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly denied his motion to suppress the photograph taken of him because Post\u2019s identification resulted from unnecessarily suggestive procedures in violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. The defendant argues that because Post\u2019s identification arose from unnecessarily suggestive procedures, Post\u2019s subsequent in-court identification of the defendant was unreliable and, therefore, impermissible. We decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In essence, the first part of this claim arises from the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s April 28, 1999 motion to suppress. The defendant based his April 28, 1999 motion to suppress on the ground that Post\u2019s identification was derived from unnecessarily suggestive procedures. Although the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, the defendant has failed to provide this court with a signed transcript or a memorandum of decision reflecting the court\u2019s decision. In its response pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 64-1, the court did not address the April 28, 1999 motion to suppress other than to state that the \u201cdefendant does not seek the court\u2019s decision on this April 28,1999 motion.\u201d Furthermore, a thorough review of the transcripts does not reveal the basis of the trial court\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">As set forth in part I of this opinion, this court will not review claims where there is an inadequate record. Accordingly, to the extent that the defendant challenges the denial of his April 28, 1999 motion to suppress the photograph and Post\u2019s identification, because of the absence of a memorandum of decision or signed transcript here, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The defendant additionally asserts that Post\u2019s in-court identification was unreliable and, thus, improperly before the jury. We note at the outset that the state did not introduce into evidence the photograph of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>defendant or the photographic book. Moreover, during the trial, the defendant did not challenge or object to any reference to the photograph. Specifically, the defendant did not object when Post testified that he recognized a photograph of the defendant in the book or when Post identified him in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">This \u201ccourt shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. \u201cAppellate review of evidentiary rulings is ordinarily limited to the specific legal issue raised by the objection of trial counsel. ... By failing to object . . . the defendant failed to preserve this claim.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Moore, 65 Conn. App. 717, 721-22, 783 A.2d 1100, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 940, 786 A.2d 427 (2001). Because the defendant failed to object to Post\u2019s identification and testimony and, further, neglected to raise this issue before the trial court, this claim is unpreserved.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we will not review this unpreserved claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The defendant next contends that the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct and thereby deprived him of a fair trial and his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during his cross-examination<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>argument<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> were improper. Because the defendant did not properly preserve this claim, he now seeks our review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">It is well settled that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>court may dispose of a claim on the ground that a defendant has failed to meet any one of the <em>Golding </em>criteria. <em>State </em>v. <em>Heredia, </em>253 Conn. 543, 560, 754 A. 2d 114 (2000). As the defendant cannot satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>the defendant\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u201cWe will not afford <em>Golding </em>review to [unpreserved] claims of prosecutorial misconduct where the record does not disclose a pattern of misconduct pervasive throughout the trial or conduct that was so blatantly egregious that it infringed on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. ... In determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s conduct was so egregious as to deny a defendant a fair trial, we note that some leeway must be afforded to the advocates .... [W]e must review the comments complained of in the context of the entire trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cansler, </em>54 Conn. App. 819, 827-28, 738 A.2d 1095 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Furthermore, \u201c[i]n considering the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct, we ask whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>58 Conn. App. 603, 619, 755 A.2d 279, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 923, 761 A.2d 755 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">After thoroughly reviewing the transcripts and record, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s questions of the defendant on cross-examination and his comments during closing argument did not so infect the trial with unfairness as to deny the defendant his right to a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>59 Conn. App. 207, 212, 757 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>A.2d 597, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 937, 761 A.2d 763 (2000). Even if we assume arguendo that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper, when considered in the context of the entire trial, the statements were isolated and brief and did not constitute a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial or conduct that was blatantly egregious, nor did they violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>supra, 58 Conn. App. 621. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails to meet the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>supra, 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly restricted his examination of an adverse witness whom he called to testify.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We decline to review this claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">We first note, as set forth in part II of this opinion, that this court will not review a claim \u201cunless it was distinctly raised at the trial <em>....'\u201d </em>Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. \u201cWe have repeatedly held that this court will not consider claimed errors on the part of the trial court unless it appears on the record that the question was distinctly raised at trial and was ruled upon and decided by the court adversely to the appellant\u2019s claim. . . .
