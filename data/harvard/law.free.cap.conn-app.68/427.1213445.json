Manson Youth Institution pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-12 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The respondent first claims that \u00a7 17a-12 (a) is unconstitutional on its face. We need not reach that claim. In the alternative, he argues that the application of the statute is unconstitutional because he was denied due process of law. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>court rejected his claims. We disagree and vacate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The respondent is a mentally disabled youth with the intellect of a four to five year old.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1991, he was committed to the custody of the commissioner on the basis of a finding of parental neglect. On July 15, 1998, the respondent was transferred to Riverview Hospital (hospital).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, the respondent faced charges, including disorderly conduct and criminal mischief, on the basis of altercations with hospital personnel. On April 14, 1999, the court ordered a competency evaluation performed and committed the respondent to the custody of the commissioner, placing him at Long Lane School for eighteen months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">After the respondent was arrested and charged with assaulting personnel at the hospital, the commissioner filed a motion, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-12 (a), to transfer him from Long Lane School to John R. Manson Youth Institution, claiming that he was dangerous to himself and others.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On April 3, 2000, the court heard arguments regarding the transfer. At the hearing, after the respondent\u2019s counsel informed the court that he could not ascertain his client\u2019s position regarding the transfer order, the court appointed a guardian ad litem to represent the respondent. The court ordered the respondent transferred from Long Lane School to John R. Manson Youth Institution. At no time did the court determine the respondent\u2019s competency. On August 30, 2000, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>court held a hearing to receive reports about the respondent\u2019s pending adult criminal matters and to review with the department of mental health and addiction services whether there were any other facilities available and appropriate for the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Thereafter, on November 6, 2000, the petitioner removed the respondent from John R. Manson Youth Institution and transferred him to Arbor-Fuller Hospital in South Attleboro, Massachusetts. The respondent resided at Arbor-Fuller Hospital until November 11, 2000, when he was discharged and again placed at Long Lane School by the commissioner, where he remained until his eighteenth birthday.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">As a preliminary matter, the petitioner argues that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal because it is moot. She argues that because the respondent was returned to Long Lane School, and because he has reached the age of majority and was discharged from the commissioner\u2019s custody pursuant to his delinquency commitment, he no longer is subject to \u00a7 17a-12 (a). We agree that our decision will not affect the respondent personally. We conclude, however, that all three requirements are met to qualify for appellate review under the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception to the mootness doctrine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we address each of the issues raised on appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The respondent first claims that \u00a7 17a-12 (a) is unconstitutional on its face because it (1) deprives him of his liberty interest without procedural due process, (2) mandates penal confinement without conviction after a fair trial, (3) is too vague and overbroad, (4) arbitrarily impacts youth committed to the commissioner and deprives them of a liberty interest, and (5) amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We decline to address the claim that \u00a7 17a-12 (a) is unconstitutional on its face. Rather, we address the respondent\u2019s claim that as the statute was applied, he was denied procedural due process. \u201cA party has standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute only insofar as it has an adverse impact on his own rights. As a general rule, if there is no constitutional defect in the application of the statute to a litigant, he does not have standing to argue that it would be unconstitutional if applied to third parties in hypothetical situations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Korhn, </em>41 Conn. App. 874, 878, 678 A.2d 492, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 910, 682 A.2d 1010 (1996). We therefore conclude that the respondent has no standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 17a-12 (a) on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>We now turn to the respondent\u2019s procedural due process claim. Specifically, the respondent argues that he was denied due process of law because the court improperly failed to determine his competency prior to ordering his transfer from Long Lane School, a department of children and families (department) facility, to John R. Manson Youth Institution, a correctional institution. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u201cThe requirements for a successful due process claim are well established. The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides that the State [shall not] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law .... In order to prevail on his due process claim, the [respondent] must prove that: (1) he has been deprived of a property [or liberty] interest cognizable under the due process clause; and (2) the deprivation of the property [or liberty] interest has occurred without due process of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel C., </em>245 Conn. 93, 104, 715 A.2d 652 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u201c[I]t is important to understand that commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Jason C., </em>255 Conn. 565, 579, 767 A.2d 710 (2001), quoting <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 463 U.S. 354, 361, 103 S. Ct. 3043, 77 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1983). Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has noted that due process protections may be extended to a decision to impose solitary confinement because \u201c[it] represents a major change in the conditions of confinement and is normally imposed only when it is claimed and proved that there has been a major act of misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vitek </em>v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 488, 100 S. Ct. 1254, 63 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1980). We conclude that the circumstances in this case give rise to a liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u201cThe United States Supreme Court clearly has established that constitutional due process protections apply in the juvenile setting. <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967). In <em>In re Gault, </em>supra, 27-28, the court explained that \u2018[i]t is of no constitutional consequence\u2014and of limited practical meaning\u2014that the institution to which [a child] is committed is called an Industrial School. The fact of the matter is that, however euphemistic the title, a \u201creceiving home\u201d or an \u201cindustrial school\u201d for juveniles is an institution of confinement in which the child is incarcerated for a greater or lesser time. ... In view of this, it would be extraordinary if our Constitution did not require the procedural regularity and the exercise of care implied in the phrase \u201cdue process.\u201d Under our Constitution, the condition of being a [child] does not justify a kangaroo court.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Jason C., </em>supra, 255 Conn. 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u201c \u2018A proceeding where the issue is whether the child will be found to be \u201cdelinquent\u201d and subjected to the loss of his liberty for years is comparable in seriousness to a felony prosecution.\u2019 <em>In re Gault, </em>supra, 387 U.S. 36. \u2018[Commitment is a deprivation of liberty. It is incarceration against one\u2019s will, whether it is called \u201ccriminal\u201d or \u201ccivil.\u201d \u2019 Id., 50.\u201d <em>In re Jason C., </em>supra, 255 Conn. 579. When an adult is prosecuted, due process mandates that the person be legally competent to stand trial before he can be convicted of a crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>65 Conn. App. 59, 84, 782 A.2d 149, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 923, 782 A.2d 1251 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">A juvenile cannot be transferred from Long Lane School to John R. Manson Youth Institution unless the court orders the transfer after a hearing. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-12 (a). Prior to the respondent\u2019s transfer hearing, he was diagnosed as suffering from dysthymia, conduct disorder, mild mental retardation and borderline personality disorder. Furthermore, the petitioner acknowledges that there was concern regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>respondent\u2019s competency with respect to pending adult criminal proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In fact, the court appointed a guardian ad litem to represent the respondent\u2019s interests. Nonetheless, the court ordered the transfer of the respondent from Long Lane School to John R. Manson Youth Institution without making a finding as to the respondent\u2019s competency.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We hold that to comply with procedural due process, the court must first determine the competency of the juvenile before ordering a transfer from a department facility, Long Lane School, to a department of correction facility, John R. Manson Youth Institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Additionally, \u00a7 17a-12 (a) requires that a transfer from one facility to another be in the best interest of the child. \u201cThe State has \u2018a parens patriae interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child,\u2019 <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 766, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982), which makes a juvenile proceeding fundamentally different from an adult criminal trial. We have tried, therefore, to strike a balance\u2014to respect the \u2018informality\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019 that characterize juvenile proceedings, <em>In re Winship, </em>[397 U.S. 358, 366, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970)], and yet to ensure that such proceedings comport with the \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 demanded by the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>In re Steven G., </em>210 Conn. 435, 440-41, 556 A.2d 131 (1989). To comport with fundamental fairness, and in accord with the state\u2019s parens patriae interest, the court must determine whether the proposed transfer is in the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>interest of the child after it finds the juvenile to be competent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Although our decision here cannot affect the respondent, for pmposes of future transfer proceedings, the court must first consider the child\u2019s competency and then determine if the transfer is in the best interest of the child, including considering evidence of alternatives to incarceration at John R. Manson Youth Institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The judgment is vacated and the matter is remanded with direction to render judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">In this opinion PETERS, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-12 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen the commissioner, or his designee, determines that a change of program is in the best interest of any child or youth committed or transferred to the department, he, or his designee, may transfer such person to any appropriate resource or program administered by or available to the department, to any other state department or agency . . . and further provided no transfer shall be made to any institution, hospital or facility under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction . . . unless it is so ordered by the Superior Court after a hearing. When, in the opinion of the commissioner, or his designee, a person fourteen years of age or older is dangerous to himself or others or cannot be safely held at Long Lane School, or any other facility -within the state available to the Commissioner of Children and Families, the commissioner, or his designee may request an immediate hearing before the Superior Court on the docket for juvenile matters where such person was originally committed to determine whether such person shall be transferred to the John R.

First, the challenged action, or the effect of the challenged action, by its very nature must be of a limited duration so that there is a strong likelihood that the substantial majority of cases raising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>a question about its validity will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. Second, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in the pending case will arise again in the future, and that it will affect either the same complaining party or a reasonably identifiable group for whom that party can be said to act as surrogate. Third, the question must have some public importance.

We have repeatedly apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the [respondent] has provided an independent analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue. . . .

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALy\">concurring. I concur in the result reached by the majority, but I write separately because I believe that under the circumstances of this case, the department of children and families breached the duty that it owed to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The respondent has multiple disabilities. He frequently displays aggressive behavior, and his large size makes him difficult to manage. It is clear that the state of Connecticut could not formulate a plan to handle the respondent adequately. In that regard, the record reflects that on March 17, 2000, an interagency committee met to review the respondent\u2019s case and to develop a coordinated plan to serve him. Twenty-six professionals were present at that meeting, representing the department of correction, the department of mental health and addiction services, the department of mental retardation, and the department of children and families. Robert W. Plant, superintendent for Riverview Hospital, and Patrick Russolillo, supervising psychologist for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Long Lane School, also were present at that meeting. Plant and Russolillo jointly authored a letter to the court, dated March 17, 2000, which indicated that the respondent should be treated in a specially designed and secure treatment setting; however, because no such setting was available, Plant and Russolillo recommended transfer to Hartford Detention or to John R. Manson Youth Institution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the department of children and families could not facilitate an adequate mental health placement for the respondent, he was transferred to John R. Manson Youth Institution, where he was incarcerated in solitary confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 17a-12 (a) allows for the transfer of \u201ca person fourteen years of age or older\u201d who is \u201cdangerous to himself or others or cannot be safely held at Long Lane School . . . .\u201d The statute does not take into account an individual with the respondent\u2019s disabilities. I believe, however, that transferring the respondent to a penal institution, and incarcerating him in solitary confinement when he is not a criminal, is not within the contemplation of the statute. Individuals such as the respondent require appropriate mental health services, not incarceration in a prison cell. Unless the respondent is placed in an appropriate therapeutic setting, he will not learn how to modify his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>It is not the respondent\u2019s fault that the state was unable to provide adequate mental health or mental retardation services. The respondent filed the present appeal on June 6, 2000. On November 6, 2000, he was transferred from his placement in solitary confinement at John R. Manson Youth Institution to the Arbor-Fuller Hospital in Massachusetts. Less than one week later, on November 11, 2000, he was transferred back to the Long Lane School and remained there until his current placement as set forth in footnote 6 of the majority opinion. That placement could have been made much earlier so that the respondent did not have to suffer a Dickens \u201cBleak House\u201d experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Children with mental illness who are committed to the department of children and families must be offered adequate treatment programs corresponding to their individual needs. The respondent has a profound need for such services. Instead of providing appropriate services, the respondent was incarcerated in a prison cell. In taking that action, the department of children and families breached the duty that it owed to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">I am writing this concurrence so that no mentally handicapped child will ever have to suffer the debilitating treatment suffered by the respondent. If the department of children and families does not have a facility to handle a disabled child in its custody, it has a duty to find a facility equipped to handle the disability and place the child in a proper setting.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\"> The letter stated in relevant part: \u201cBased on a review of his history and current functioning the team has determined that [the respondent] can only be effectively treated in an environment equipped to safely contain his rage and aggression. At present, there is no known facility of this kind outside of a correctional facility. In the long term, the team is in agreement that [the respondent] will best be served outside of the correctional system in a specially designed and secure treatment setting that we are working together (DMHAS, DCF, DMR &amp; DOC) to develop. In the short-term we feel that he is best served in a highly secure setting such as Hartford Detention or Manson Youth. DCF is committed to arranging for Mental Health Services and Restoration of Competency to be provided in whatever setting can safely maintain him. Our experience has been that he cannot be safely maintained at either Long Lane or Riverview Hospital.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
