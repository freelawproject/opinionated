Because the evidence was sufficient and properly admitted in the discretion of the court and because the unanimity charge did not sanction a nonunanimous verdict, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Between October 1, 1995, and May 9, 1997, the defendant lived in New Britain with his girlfriend and her children, including the victim, as a family. While in New Britain, the family lived in three different residences. From September, 1995, through June, 1996, the family lived in their first residence in New Britain, and the victim attended third grade at a local elementary school. When the victim was living at that residence and attending third grade in New Britain, the defendant sexually assaulted her by having vaginal intercourse with her in a bathtub. Near the end of November, 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the family moved to a new residence in New Britain, and the victim, then in the fourth grade, transferred to another school in town. The defendant sexually assaulted the victim during the process of moving from the first residence to the second residence by performing cunnilingus on her when the two returned to the first residence to pick up some items. The family moved again to a third residence in New Britain in February, 1997. At that residence, the defendant sexually assaulted the victim by attempting to have vaginal intercourse with her on a couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In May, 1996, the department of children and families (department) began monitoring the family. In April, 1997, after a one year period of frequent observation, the department decided to close the family\u2019s case file. The victim made no mention of sexual abuse during the department\u2019s span of observation although she did make other unrelated complaints. About two weeks later, the victim, who was then ten years old, reported to her teacher and then to a department investigator, as well as to the police and others, that the defendant had been sexually assaulting her for the past two years, with the most recent incident having occurred within the last two weeks. The victim and her siblings were subsequently removed from their home and placed into separate foster care homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">On January 20, 1999, after a jury trial in which these facts came to light, the jury returned a verdict against the defendant, finding him guilty of all three counts. On March 10, 1999, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of thirty years of incarceration, execution suspended after twenty years, with fifteen years of probation. On May 20, 1999, this appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We address the defendant\u2019s sufficiency of evidence claim first because this claim, \u201cif successful, would necessitate the entry of a judgment of acquittal . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>254 Conn. 472, 478, 757 A.2d 578 (2000). The defendant argues that the court improperly convicted him on each count because the evidence at trial was not sufficient to prove that the alleged acts occurred in Connecticut and, therefore, the court lacked territorial jurisdiction in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant contends that the victim\u2019s testimony so intermingled alleged acts in Connecticut with alleged acts in New York (New York evidence) that it cannot constitute sufficient evidence of acts occurring in Connecticut. Alternatively, the defendant argues that a new trial should be granted because, even if there was sufficient evidence to convict him for acts occurring in Connecticut, the jury was likely to have used prejudicially the New York evidence in arriving at its verdict. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>tive force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the jury if there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>254 Conn. 694, 732, 759 A.2d 995 (2000). Moreover, \u201c[e]vidence is not insufficient . . . because it is conflicting or inconsistent. [The jury] is free to juxtapose conflicting versions of events and determine which is more credible. ... It is the [jury\u2019s] exclusive province to weigh the conflicting evidence and to determine the credibility of witnesses. . . . The [jury] can . . . decide what\u2014all, none, or some\u2014of a witness\u2019 testimony to accept or reject.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>44 Conn. App. 84, 96, 688 A.2d 336, cert. denied, 240 Conn. 912, 690 A.2d 400 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to upholding the verdict, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant had sexually touched and assaulted the victim in her various residences in New Britain. Although originally arguing to the contrary, the defendant concedes in his reply brief that he misread the transcript of the victim\u2019s testimony and that, therefore, the victim testified that the defendant had had vaginal intercourse with her in a bathtub and, by virtue of the same concession, performed cunnilingus on her in the first of the victim\u2019s New Britain residences.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The victim also testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the defendant sexually assaulted her on the couch in her third New Britain residence. These events constitute sufficient evidence for the jury\u2019s verdict, and, as a result, this court cannot undermine the jury\u2019s determination. While the victim may have sometimes put forth confused, apparently forgetful, or even contradictory testimony, it was solely up to the jury to determine the weight of each part of the victim\u2019s testimony. The jury, therefore, reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. For these reasons, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our determination that the defendant, in his alternative claim, has failed to show that the admission of evidence of events in New York was prejudicial. Before trial and at points during the trial, the defendant objected to the admission of any testimony related to criminal acts allegedly occurring in New York. The defendant argued that introducing such evidence would be confusing and prejudicial, that it would cause jurisdictional problems, that it would be difficult to cross-examine witnesses concerning such evidence and that it would implicate the unanimity of a jury verdict against the defendant. The court ordered and the parties agreed that questions posed to the victim would be framed in such a way as to limit her testimony to events occurring in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Outside the presence of the jury, the state indicated clearly and repeatedly to the victim that she should limit her testimony to Connecticut events occurring while she was in the third and fourth grades. When questioning of the victim resumed, the state focused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the victim\u2019s testimony on the appropriate time frame. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked the victim if she ever bled when the defendant sexually assaulted her, and she answered that she had in \u201cNew York on the couch.\u201d Defense counsel asked the court immediately to instruct the jury, and the court ordered that the answer be stricken and for the jury to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Later in the trial, over the objection of defense counsel, a ten minute redacted videotape made up of six short segments of the victim\u2019s interview with a police officer on May 22, 1997, was admitted as constancy of accusation evidence and was played for the jury. The redacted videotape showed the victim stating that the defendant sexually harassed her from when she was eight until she was ten years old. The victim stated that this meant that the defendant raped her. In an effort to better understand the victim\u2019s allegations, the police officer then pursued what the victim meant by the word \u201crape\u201d in a number of exchanges shown on the videotape. During one of those exchanges, the police officer had the victim write down what \u201crape\u201d meant to her, and he read it aloud afterward.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relating the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>definition of rape to her allegations, the remaining portions of the redacted videotape showed the victim stating specifically that the defendant raped her in March or April of 1997, in New Britain.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">At the conclusion of the trial, the court instructed the jury that certain things are not considered evidence for the jury\u2019s evaluation during deliberation. Elaborating on that instruction, the court further instructed the jury that the constancy of accusation evidence, specifically, the redacted videotape and the testimony of certain witnesses, was not admitted for the purpose of proving its truth and could not be used as substantive evidence to convict the defendant. Rather, the court instructed the jury that the only use for that evidence was to corroborate the in-court testimony of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The defendant must show, in challenging the evidentiary rulings of the court, that the court abused its discretion in a manner that resulted in substantial prejudice or injustice to him. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Orhan, </em>52 Conn. App. 231, 237, 726 A.2d 629 (1999). Other than the victim\u2019s stricken answer regarding bleeding in New York, which the court timely instructed the jury to disregard, the defendant has not shown that evidence of criminal events taking place in New York entered substantively into the trial, and there is no indication that any such extrajurisdictional evidence influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. The jury was sufficiently instructed against any use of the extrajurisdictional testimony it heard and against the substantive use of the constancy of accusation evidence, and we presume, because nothing indicates otherwise, that the jury followed those instructions. See <em>State </em>v. Reddick, 224 Conn. 445, 454, 619 A.2d 453 (1993). In addition, the jury had sufficient evidence of illegal acts occurring in Connecticut on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>which to arrive at its verdict. The defendant has failed to show that the introduction of any New York evidence caused substantial prejudice or injustice to him, and his alternative claim, therefore, is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly admitted as constancy of accusation evidence a redacted version of a videotaped police interview with the victim. In support of this contention, the defendant claims, per his objection at trial, that the redacted videotape exceeded the bounds of constancy of accusation evidence and prejudiced him by bolstering the victim\u2019s in-court testimony through its impermissible use as substantive evidence. Further, the defendant contends that the redacted videotape was more prejudicial than probative because it showed the demeanor and actions of the victim. The defendant also claims that the segments of the full interview viewed by the jury prejudiced his right to a fair trial because they described, without the jury\u2019s knowledge, sexual abuse that allegedly took place in New York.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201cThe constancy of accusation doctrine has its origins in common law. Since 1876, statements admitted under the constancy of accusation theory have been labeled by Connecticut courts as exceptions to the hearsay rule, and admitted only as corroborative evidence to strengthen the credit of the principal witness by showing constancy in her declarations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bispham, </em>48 Conn. App. 135, 145, 708 A.2d 604, cert. granted on other grounds, 244 Conn. 929, 711 A.2d 728 (1998), appeal dismissed, 249 Conn. 264, 731 A.2d 294 (1999). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 677 A.2d 917 (1996) (en banc), our Supreme Court concluded that \u201ca person to whom a sexual assault victim has reported the assault may testify only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint; any testimony by the witness regarding the details surrounding the assault must be strictly limited to those necessary to associate the victim\u2019s complaint with the pending charge, <em>including, for example, </em>the time and place of the attack or the identity of the alleged peipetrator. . . . Thus, such evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 304. The court noted, however, that the articulated doctrine \u201cdoes not affect those cases in which the details of a sexual assault complaint are otherwise admissible . . . .\u201d Id., 304 n.19. The court also held that \u201cthe trial court must balance the probative value of the evidence against any prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Id., 305. Furthermore, our Supreme Court has recognized that a videotaped interview of a victim of a sexual assault, so long as it is not made for the puipose of preparing a victim for trial, is admissible at trial as constancy of accusation evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>246 Conn. 799, 810-11, 717 A.2d 1224 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 568-69, 638 A.2d 578 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The determination, therefore, of \u201c[w]hether evidence is admissible under the constancy of accusation doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>trine is an evidentiary question that will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Orhan, </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 243. \u201cSound discretion, by definition, means a discretion that is not exercised arbitrarily or wilfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law .... And [it] requires a knowledge and understanding of the material circumstances surrounding the matter .... In our review of these discretionary determinations, we make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The defendant argues correctly that under <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 304, constancy of accusation evidence in a prosecution for sex related crimes is admissible solely to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not as substantive proof of the charges against the defendant. Our review of the record and the redacted videotape in comparison with the full videotape indicates, however, that the defendant is incorrect in his proposition that the redacted videotape exceeded the bounds of the <em>Troupe </em>standard. Based on the facts concerning the videotape, as discussed in part I of this opinion, it is apparent that the redacted videotape introduced only those details necessary to demonstrate the fact, timing and place of the reported sexual crimes and the identity of the perpetrator. In addition, the court exercised its discretion reasonably in allowing the victim\u2019s definition of rape to be included on the redacted videotape, especially considering the age of the victim. The victim\u2019s original statement on the videotape that the defendant was sexually harassing her may have been unclear for the jury, and the definition not only better identified the alleged crimes, but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>cleared up any confusion as to what the victim was alleging.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">For these reasons, the defendant also has failed to show that the videotape was used impermissibly as substantive evidence rather than simply to strengthen the credibility of the victim\u2019s in-court testimony by showing constancy in her accusations. Moreover, the defendant has failed to show that the introduction of the videotape caused him substantial prejudice. It is reasonable to presume that the court took into account the victim\u2019s demeanor and actions on the redacted videotape, and there is no indication that the court abused its discretion in admitting the videotape as constancy of accusation evidence under the circumstances here and the <em>Troupe </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Furthermore, even if we were to conclude that the videotape or portions thereof were improperly admitted, we still could not conclude that the defendant has shown substantial prejudice or injustice. First, we presume, and there is no contrary indication, that the juiy followed the court\u2019s instruction to use the videotape only as a means of corroborating the victim\u2019s in-court testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 454. Second, it is well established that \u201cif erroneously admitted evidence is merely cumulative of other evidence presented in the case, its admission does not constitute reversible error.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bispham, </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 146. Here, the videotaped constancy of accusation evidence was merely cumulative because it was repeated during the testimony of other witnesses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, even if the admission of the videotape was improper, it does not follow that the admission was prejudicial or consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>tuted reversible error. We conclude, therefore, that the court properly admitted the videotape as constancy of accusation evidence and that the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The defendant next claims that the court abused its discretion by twice permitting on redirect examination of the victim testimony that went beyond the permissible scope of cross-examination. The defendant contends that the testimony allowed during the redirect examinations amounted to unfair surprise and prejudice against the defendant because the victim described unmentioned sexual acts perpetrated by the defendant and it allowed the state to represent its case to the jury two more times. Furthermore, the defendant emphasizes that, dining a lunch break between the defendant\u2019s cross-examination and the state\u2019s redirect examinations, the prosecutor coached the victim to enter this new and prejudicial evidence into the trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant claims that by allowing this evidence the court foreclosed any opportunity that the defendant had to challenge the victim\u2019s credibility and, thereby, any chance for his acquittal. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The following additional facts gleaned from the record are necessary for our resolution of this issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> During the victim\u2019s direct testimony, she testified that the defendant sexually assaulted her multiple times \u201cat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>different houses in different, rooms.\u201d On cross-examination, defense counsel implied that the victim had made false accusations to the department because she was angry with the defendant for disciplining her and she knew that the department would react harshly to such accusations. Defense counsel also attempted to show that the victim asked fellow students at her school to hurt her.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> During the state\u2019s redirect examination, and over the objections of defense counsel, the victim testified to an incident where the defendant had performed cunnilingus on her during a move from her first residence to her second residence in New Britain. The victim further testified that the defendant had vaginal intercourse with her in a bathtub at the first residence in New Britain when she was in third grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">During its recross-examination, defense counsel explored the veracity of the victim\u2019s earlier testimony, to whom she had made her allegations and why, other problems that she had at home and school, and the relationships between herself, her mother and the defendant. On re-redirect examination, over further defense objections, the victim identified photographs of her three New Britain residences, when she lived in each and in which residence the defendant\u2019s various sexual assaults occurred. Finally, in the last cross-examination and subsequent redirect examination of the victim, the victim testified further about the sexual assault that occurred in the bathtub.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">As with the defendant\u2019s other challenges to the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, we review this claim under an abuse of discretion standard that requires a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Orhan, </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 237. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Supreme Court \u201chas made it clear that a witness is permitted on redirect examination to explain or clarify any relevant matters in his testimony which may have been weakened or obscured by his cross-examination. . . . The extent and scope of redirect examination, however, may be limited within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Conrod, </em>198 Conn. 592, 596, 504 A.2d 494 (1986). Moreover, \u201cthe court has discretion, even on redirect examination, to permit explanation or clarification of evidence given on the direct examination although not touched upon in the cross-examination.\u201d <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Dacey, </em>154 Conn. 129, 152, 222 A.2d 339 (1966), appeal dismissed, 386 U.S. 683, 87 S. Ct. 1325, 18 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1967). It is fundamental as well \u201cthat when the credibility of a witness is attacked on cross-examination, the other party has a right to rehabilitate his witness during redirect examination. Under our adversary system of trials the opponent must be given an opportunity to meet this attack ... by evidence sustaining or rehabilitating the witness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>11 Conn. App. 185, 187, 526 A.2d 14 (1987). An examination of the record is necessary, therefore, to determine if the court exercised its discretion properly in this case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Conrod, </em>supra, 596. We also note that child witnesses are often granted special accommodations regarding their testimony due to their young age and inexperience with the courts. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>McPhee, </em>58 Conn. App. 501, 507-508, 755 A.2d 893 (no abuse of discretion in allowing child witness to hold stuffed animal while testifying), cert. denied, 254 Conn. 920, 759 A.2d 1026 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hydock, </em>51 Conn. App. 753, 765, 725 A.2d 379 (no abuse of discretion in allowing state to ask child sexual assault victim leading questions), cert. denied, 248 Conn. 921, 733 A.2d 846 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Our examination of the record shows that defense counsel attacked the credibility of the victim on cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>examination and that on redirect examination her testimony both responded to that attack and explained relevant matters brought out during direct examination. The evidence presented by the state through the victim\u2019s testimony during redirect examination rehabilitated the victim\u2019s credibility appropriately, and explained and clarified her less detailed direct testimony. As such, the victim\u2019s testimony neither went beyond the permissible scope of cross-examination, nor did it visit unfair surprise on the defendant, as it was the defendant who repeatedly attacked the credibility of the victim and opened the door to rehabilitation evidence. Likewise, the testimony did not afford the state impermissible opportunities to prove its case or deprive the defendant of opportunities to refute the credibility of the victim. The defendant, in fact, had three full opportunities to cross-examine the victim. Furthermore, considering that the victim was a child witness, it was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion to allow wide latitude during the entire course of her testimony. The defendant has failed to show substantial prejudice or injustice here, and we conclude, therefore, that the court acted well within its discretion in allowing the victim\u2019s testimony as it proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In this final claim, the defendant urges us to hold that the court improperly failed to give a unanimity instruction to the jury with regard to the charges against him. The defendant concedes that the court instructed the jury with a general unanimity charge requiring a unanimous decision as to his guilt or innocence. Nevertheless, the defendant claims that the court violated his constitutional rights to a unanimous verdict and a fair trial when it instructed the jury to consider as to each count whether it believed that the victim\u2019s testimony, which related several separate acts of intercourse and inappropriate sexual touching by the defendant, sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>ported a guilty verdict. The defendant argues that the court\u2019s instructions in this regard sanctioned a non-unanimous verdict on each count because the court did not expressly require unanimity from the jury as to which specific acts, if any, established the defendant\u2019s guilt under each count. As a result of this alleged failure \u201cto promote a unanimous verdict,\u201d the defendant submits that the jury could have disagreed about which acts supported the verdict and still have convicted him improperly by agreeing in general that he was guilty of each count. Because nothing in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict, we conclude that this claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The following additional facts are pertinent to the defendant\u2019s claim. At the inception of its instruction to the jury, the court announced that it might refer to certain evidence for illustration and clarification, but that the jury would not be limited to considering that evidence alone or to accepting the court\u2019s view of that evidence. The court then instructed the jury that the defendant \u201cis presumed innocent unless, and until, he is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The court instructed the jurors specifically on their \u201cduty to accept the law . . . [and] to determine the facts.\u201d The court also told them to \u201capply the law to those facts and render your verdict of guilfy or not guilty.\u201d Furthermore, the court stated, \u201c[I]f you find that the state has failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, any one of the elements of a crime, you must then find the defendant not guilty of that crime.\u201d The court urged the jury to \u201c[r]emember, there are three counts in this case. . . . You must consider each count separately and render a verdict of guilty or not guilty on that count, depending upon your findings concerning the elements of that count.\u201d Finally, the court stated to the jury that the verdict \u201chas to be unanimous on each count.\u201d The defendant took exception to the court\u2019s instruction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>stating that the court should have instructed the jury to be \u201cunanimous as to what act they\u2019re agreeing on for each count.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">A jury\u2019s verdict in a criminal matter \u201cshall be unanimous and shall be announced by the jury in open court. \u201d Practice Book \u00a7 42-29. Regarding a court\u2019s instruction to a jury prior to its deliberations, \u201cwe have not required a specific unanimity charge to be given in every case .... We have instead invoked a multipartite test to review a trial court\u2019s omission of such an instruction. We first review the instruction that was given to determine whether the trial court has sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict. If such an instruction has not been given, that ends the matter. Even if the instructions at trial can be read to have sanctioned such a nonunanimous verdict, however, we will remand for a new trial only if (1) there is a conceptual distinction between the alternative acts with which the defendant has been charged, and (2) the state has presented evidence to support each alternative act with which the defendant has been charged.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietli, </em>219 Conn. 605, 619-20, 595 A.2d 306 (1991). This court is required to conclude, when reviewing a court\u2019s instruction to the jury, that \u201c[t]he absence of language expressly sanctioning a nonunanimous verdict means that the defendant has not met the first part of the <em>Famiglietti </em>test.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cramer, </em>57 Conn. App. 452, 461, 749 A.2d 60, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 924, 754 A.2d 797 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The defendant cites the court\u2019s references to the victim\u2019s testimony as language in the court\u2019s instruction that sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict. We conclude that this language is inapposite and that there is a complete absence of language sanctioning a nonunanimous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>verdict. Indeed, after explaining the elements of each charge to the jury with reference to the victim\u2019s testimony, the court reminded the jury to consider each count separately, to make findings related to each element of each count and to act unanimously on each count. We note also that \u201c[a] trial court often has not only the right, but also the duty to comment on the evidence. . . . The purpose of [which] is to provide a fair summary of the evidence, and nothing more . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>67 Conn. App. 194, 204, 786 A.2d 1147 (2001). Given the court\u2019s admonitions concerning unanimity, \u201cwe must presume that the jury, in the absence of a fair indication to the contrary . . . followed the court\u2019s instruction as to the law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 454. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s claim must fail because the court\u2019s instruction to the jury did not expressly sanction a nonunanimous verdict. Having so concluded, we need not address the defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the remainder of the <em>Famiglietti </em>test. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 619-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person ...

General Statutes \u00a7 51-1a (b); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 195, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995). The state charged the defendant with crimes occurring in Connecticut. We need not address the defendant\u2019s jurisdictional claim any further than to point to our conclusion in this part of the opinion that the jury had sufficient evidence regarding acts occurring in Connecticut on which to base, beyond a reasonable doubt, its verdict on each count. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Beverly, </em>224 Conn. 372, 618 A.2d 1335 (1993). Given such evidence, the court clearly had territorial jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\"> The defendant\u2019s reply brief provides in relevant part: \u201c[T]he state argues that defendant\u2019s claim that the \u2018bathtub\u2019 incident may have happened [when the victim] was in first grade ... is without merit . . . because the defendant has misread [the victim\u2019s] testimony. The defendant maintains that [the victim\u2019s] testimony is confusing and contradictory in many respects, but he acknowledges that a fair' reading of the relevant transcript citations demonstrate[s] that the state\u2019s point is well taken. Specifically, the house . . . appears to be the <em>first </em>of three New Britain houses that [the victim] lived in . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The defendant\u2019s original argument was that the victim\u2019s testimony during direct examination did not place the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>bathtub or the cunnilingus incidents within any of her homes in New Britain. In his reply brief, the defendant admits that he misread the victim\u2019s testimony and that her testimony actually connected the incidents to her first residence in New Britain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b600-7\"> A review of the unedited videotape reveals that the exchange shown in this portion of the redacted videotape does indeed follow references to an alleged sexual assault in New York, which the jury does not see on the redacted videotape. Nevertheless, the victim\u2019s account of the New York incident was interrupted by the police officer\u2019s request that she write down what the word \u201crape\u201d meant to her. This subset of the larger exchange is the only part of that exchange that the jury did see. Furthermore, the police officer had asked the victim earlier in the interview, before discussing the alleged New York events, to tell him what \u201crape\u201d meant to her. In this overall context, the victim\u2019s definition of \u201crape\u201d did not refer to any specific New York incident, even though it was juxtaposed with a description of alleged New York events. Instead, the victim\u2019s written definition of \u201crape\u201d consisted of an explanation of her basic allegations against the defendant. This inference is made all the more concrete by a portion of the unedited videotape, also not seen by the jury, in which the victim stated that she had been raped by the defendant in New Britain in the same manner as described in her written definition of rape. The jury, therefore, witnessed only the victim\u2019s general definition of \u201crape,\u201d even though the unedited videotape reveals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>that the victim applied the same definition to alleged New York events and Connecticut events.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\"> The defendant concedes, however, that he did not raise this issue at trial in this context. Consequently, the defendant argues that plain error review is required because the redacted videotape presents unique circumstances in that it was \u201crigged through splicing\u201d to include extrajurisdictional evidence for the purpose of bolstering the victim\u2019s credibility. Plain error review is \u201creserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Solman, </em>67 Conn. App. 235, 239, 786 A.2d 1184 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 917, 791 A.2d 568 (2002). We are not persuaded that plain error review is warranted here. Furthermore, \u201c[t]o permit a party to raise a different ground on appeal than was raised during trial would amount to trial by ambuscade, unfair both to the trial court and to the opposing party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>59 Conn. App. 469, 477, 757 A.2d 643, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 919, 763 A.2d 1043 (2000). Moreover, although couching the claim in constitutional terms, the defendant makes no effort to analyze it under the <em>Golding </em>standard. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We will review under the abuse of discretion standard, therefore, only those of the defendant\u2019s claims regarding the videotape that were raised at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\"> The testimony of five witnesses offered similar accounts of the victim\u2019s reports of sexual abuse in New Britain.

Rather, the defendant claims only that the incident exemplifies the inherent prejudice of allowing new evidence to surface during redirect examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b606-10\"> We note, at the outset, that the record reveals that the court was quite aware that certain evidence, if admitted, could potentially prejudice the trial and that it took pains to direct counsel for both sides away from introducing such evidence.
