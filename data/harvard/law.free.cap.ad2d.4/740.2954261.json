Certain findings of fact disapproved and reversed and new findings made. Memorandum: This is an action of ejectment in which plaintiff claimed title to the disputed area by adverse possession, and defendant counterclaimed for a determination of a claim to real property (Real Property Law, art. 15). We think that plaintiff\u2019s attack on defendant\u2019s record title must fail. Plaintiff relies chiefly on a certain fence, which, however, was in disrepair during most of its existence and could not be regarded as a \u201csubstantial inclosure\u201d (Civ. Prae. Act, \u00a7 40). It was originally erected in the most convenient place and was never regarded by defendant or plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in title as a line fence. Furthermore, plaintiff\u2019s claim, not having been asserted continuously and adversely for 15 years, depended upon \u201c tacking \u201d, which is not permissible in this case for two reasons. (1) Plaintiff\u2019s predecessors never asserted a claim of right to the disputed area; (2) The deed to plaintiff excluded that area. Plaintiff, therefore, was not in privity of title with his predecessors as to the parcel in issue <em>(Bogoff </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt Sons Corp., </em>263 App. Div. 841, affd. 290 N. Y. 666; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Beich, </em>80 Hun 287, affd. on opinion below 151 N. Y. 642; <em>Staples </em>v. <em>Sehnackenberg, </em>148 App. Div. 161; <em>Melbowrn </em>v. <em>Kukla, </em>237 App. Div. 834). The judgment should be reversed, the complaint dismissed, and judgment awarded to defendant on the first affirmative defense and counterclaim contained in the answer. All concur.
