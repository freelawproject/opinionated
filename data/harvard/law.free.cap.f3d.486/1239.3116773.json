Martinez also appeals the restitution order in his sentence. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-26\">Defendant Martinez is a prisoner at the Federal Detention Center (\u201cFDC\u201d) in Miami, Florida. A grand jury indicted Martinez for forcibly assaulting a correctional officer at the FDC by striking the officer\u2019s face and body with a liquid that was or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>appeared to be urine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">\n<em>A. Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">At trial, the government called Officer Jorge Giraldo, an FDC Miami corrections officer. Giraldo described the cells in the Special Handling Unit (\u201cSHU\u201d), which had a door with a window and a food slot wide enough to put hands through. Giraldo testified that, on October 25, 2002, he and Officer Daniel Parodi were bringing linens to the SHU cells when Defendant Martinez, who was alone in his cell, requested a towel. As Giraldo turned to get the towel, he heard a commotion and Defendant Martinez yelling, \u201cI got you motherfucker.\u201d Giraldo saw Martinez standing with his hands outside the food slot, spraying a liquid all over Parodi. The liquid was in a bottle of V05.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">Giraldo pushed Martinez\u2019s hands back into the cell and closed the food slot. A small amount of the liquid also got on Giraldo\u2019s shirt. Giraldo thought the liquid was urine because of its smell and because he, after closing the food slot, saw Martinez urinate into another bottle and say, \u201cI got more for you.\u201d After the incident, Defendant Martinez apologized to Giraldo for getting urine on him, stating that the urine was not meant for him. Apparently, the urine was meant for only Parodi, who was sprayed first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">On cross-examination, Giraldo stated that all areas of the SHU were within observation of cameras, which were movable. However, Giraldo did not know if the cameras were turned on or whether, on the date of the incident, they were facing the cell doors. Giraldo admitted that he did not know whether the incident had been videotaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">The government also called Officer Par-odi to testify. According to Parodi, Martinez was angry with him on the day of the incident because Martinez blamed Parodi for losing his position as an orderly, which had given Martinez special privileges. Parodi asked Giraldo to assist him with the linen exchange at Martinez\u2019s cell because he knew Martinez was angry with him and Parodi did not want problems. As Parodi and Giraldo began to exchange Martinez\u2019s linens, Defendant Martinez squeezed the liquid contents of a bottle at Parodi. The liquid, which smelled like urine, covered Parodi\u2019s entire chest and got in his mouth, nose and eyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-10\">After he sprayed Parodi, Defendant Martinez laughed and said, \u201cI finally got you, motherfucker.\u201d Martinez then said, \u201cI got more for you, come on in.\u201d Parodi saw three bottles of what appeared to be urine in Martinez\u2019s cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-11\">Parodi washed his face, eyes, mouth and chest and went to the FDC Miami doctor. Parodi explained that he was concerned because he did not know if Martinez had a communicable disease. After Parodi was evaluated by medical staff at FDC Miami, he went to a hospital to have a blood check because he did not know Martinez\u2019s medical history. Parodi has not experienced any health problems as a result of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-12\">On cross-examination, Parodi testified that cameras were positioned to cover all areas of the SHU, except inside the cells. However, Parodi was not sure whether the cameras were always on or if they were supposed to be on. When asked if an incident such as the one at issue could be on videotape, Parodi responded, \u201cI believe so.\u201d Parodi did not know if the incident had been videotaped or if the cameras were connected to a video recording device. The government rested, and Defendant Martinez presented no witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-13\">\n<em>B. Closing Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-14\">Prior to closing arguments, Defendant Martinez contended that he should be able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>to argue that the government had failed to produce a videotape of the incident. The district court ruled that Martinez could not make this argument in closing because there was no evidence that the cameras in the SHU could record or were merely for monitoring, or that the cameras had in fact recorded the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">\n<em>C. Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">Prior to trial, the government filed a motion requesting that the district court modify the Eleventh Circuit pattern jury instruction\u2019s definition of forcible assault, which addresses cases involving threats or attempts but not any actual physical contact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government requested that \u201cforcible assault\u201d be defined as \u201can assault which results in physical contact, but which does not involve a deadly weapon or bodily harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">The government also argued that, because \u00a7 111 is a general intent statute, the pattern jury instruction's specific intent definition of \u201cwillfully\u201d should not apply. Instead, the government requested that the instruction be modified to state that the government needed to prove that \u201cthe act was done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-8\">At the close of the evidence, the district court granted the government\u2019s requests over Defendant Martinez\u2019s objections. After closing arguments, the district court instructed the jurors as the government requested, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-10\">Title 18, United States Code, Section 111, makes it a federal crime or offense for anybody to forcibly assault a federal officer while the officer is engaged in the performance of official duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-11\">You are instructed that a correctional officer is one of the federal officers referred to in that law. A defendant can be found guilty of that offense of assaulting a federal officer only if all the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-12\">First, that the defendant forcibly assaulted the person described in the indictment as that term is hereafter defined;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-13\">Second, that the person assaulted was a federal officer, as described above, then engaged in the performance of an official duty as charged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-14\">And third, that the defendant acted knowingly and willfully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-15\">\n<em>The term forcible assault means an assault which results in physical contact which does not involve a deadly weapon or bodily harm.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-16\">The phrase \u201cknowingly and willfully,\u201d as that phrase is used in the indictment or in these instructions, means that the act was done voluntarily and intentionally, and not because of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-17\">(Emphasis added). Martinez renewed his objections to the jury instructions. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>district court again overruled his objections. The jury found Martinez guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-3\">\n<em>D. Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Parodi provided medical bills showing $1,801.63 in losses. Par-odi\u2019s losses resulted from visits to his physician and the emergency room and lab work for testing of diseases that he could have contracted from Defendant Martinez\u2019s actions. The PSI recommended that Martinez pay $1,801.63 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">At sentencing, Martinez objected, arguing that he should not have to pay for Parodi\u2019s measures to ensure that he was not injured. The district court ordered Martinez to pay $1,801.63 in restitution. The district court sentenced Martinez to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutive to the sentence Martinez is currently serving, and one year of supervised release. Martinez filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AfRq\">\n<em>A. Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">Defendant Martinez argues that the district court erred in giving the government\u2019s proposed jury instructions on the elements of the offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-8\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a), a person commits forcible assault if that person forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates or interferes with a federal officer in the performance of his official duties. Section 111 provides for different penalties depending on the severity of the offenses, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-11\">(a) <em>In </em>general-Whoever\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-12\">(1) forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with any person designated [as a federal officer] while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-13\">shall, where the acts in violation of this section constitute only simple assault, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both, and, in all other cases, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-14\">(b) <em>Enhanced </em>penalty.-Whoever, in the commission of any acts described in subsection (a), uses a deadly or dangerous weapon ... or inflicts bodily injury, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1270-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 lll(a)-(b) (2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In sum, \u00a7 111(a) establishes these categories of forcible assault, each with its own penalty: (1) \u201csimple assault,\u201d punishable by not more than a year of imprisonment; (2) \u201call other cases\u201d of forcible assault, which are punishable by not more than three years\u2019 imprisonment; and (3) \u201call other cases\u201d of forcible assault where the defendant uses a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>deadly or dangerous weapon or inflicts bodily injury, which are punishable by not more than ten years\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-4\">In the statutory language of \u00a7 111(a) Congress did not define \u201csimple assault\u201d or the difference between a forcible assault that should be considered a \u201csimple assault\u201d and an \u201call other cases\u201d forcible assault. However, in a recent \u00a7 111(a) case, this Court discussed the difference. <em>See United States v. Fallen, </em>256 F.3d 1082, 1088 (11th Cir.2001). In <em>Fallen, </em>this Court first noted that simple assault at common law \u201cis defined as \u2018a <em>willful attempt to inflict injury </em>upon the person of another, <em>or </em>... <em>a threat to inflict injury </em>upon the person of another which, when coupled with an apparent present ability, causes a reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (alteration in original); <em>see also United States v. Renfro, </em>620 F.2d 497, 500 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-9\">The <em>Fallen </em>Court also said that \u201call other cases\u201d of forcible assault in \u00a7 111(a) \u201chave to be something more, <em>such as </em>a willful attempt or threat to inflict <em>serious </em>bodily injury, coupled with an apparent present ability, which causes the intended victim a reasonable apprehension of immediate <em>serious </em>bodily harm <em>or death.\u201d Fallen, </em>256 F.3d at 1088 (first emphasis added). <em>Fallen </em>involved verbal threats to shoot two federal officers where there was no physical contact. <em>Id. </em>at 1087-88. The <em>Fallen </em>Court expressly rejected the argument that the second category of forcible assault must always involve actual physical contact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-10\"><em>Fallen, </em>however, did not address the proper category of a \u00a7 111(a) forcible assault when the assault conduct at issue involves physical contact.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, every circuit to address the question has held that an assault that involves physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>contact falls within the \u201call other cases\u201d provision of \u00a7 111(a) and is not a \u201csimple assault\u201d under \u00a7 111(a). <em>See United States v. Hathaway, 318 F.3d </em>1001, 1008-09 (10th Cir.2003) (involving a defendant who pushed a social security administration agent in the chest and grabbed his tie, thereby choking him); <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>233 F.3d 318, 321-22 (5th Cir. 2000) (involving a defendant who threw a cup of urine/feces at a correctional office, striking him in the chest and lower body), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Longoria, </em>298 F.3d 367, 372 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6 (5th Cir.2002) <em>(en banc); United States v. Chestaro, </em>197 F.3d 600, 605-06 (2d Cir. 1999) (involving a defendant who wielded a boxcutter and struggled with postal police officers); <em>see also United States v. Yates, </em>304 F.3d 818, 822 (8th Cir.2002) (involving a defendant who drove a car at United States marshals, but did not make physical contact and limiting \u201csimple assaults\u201d under \u00a7 111(a) to assaults without physical contact).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">Turning to this case, we first note that the indictment charged that Martinez \u201cknowingly and intentionally did forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, and interfere with\u201d a federal correctional officer \u201cby physically striking [him] about the face and body with a liquid that was or appeared to be urine\u201d in violation of \u00a7 111(a)(1). In other words, Martinez\u2019s charged offense involved actual physical contact rather than mere threats or attempts to inflict bodily injury (i.e., \u201csimple assault\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we agree with our sister circuits and conclude that Martinez\u2019s offense, which involved actual physical contact, falls within the \u201call other cases\u201d provision of \u00a7 111(a) and not within the \u201csimple assault\u201d provision. Furthermore, since minimal contact is sufficient to violate \u00a7 111(a), <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>921 F.2d 1569, 1577 (11th Cir.1991), the physical contact need not have resulted in actual bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">We also reject Martinez\u2019s argument that the second category of forcible assault always requires a threat to inflict serious bodily injury. While a threat to inflict serious bodily injury without any actual physical contact is sufficient under <em>Fallen </em>to establish an \u201call other cases\u201d forcible assault, an assault with actual physical contact is also sufficient to prove an \u201call other cases\u201d forcible assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">The pattern jury instruction that Martinez urged the district court to use addresses an \u201call other cases\u201d forcible assault in which a defendant makes threats or attempts to inflict serious bodily injury but no actual physical contact occurs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That pattern jury instruction was not appropriate in Martinez\u2019s particular case because his offense involved actual physical contact rather than threats or attempts. Thus, the district court properly rejected Martinez\u2019s request to give that particular pattern jury instruction and instead properly defined a forcible assault in his case as \u201can assault which results in physical contact which does not involve a deadly weapon or bodily harm.\u201d The definition as instructed accurately reflected the applicable law given the evidence presented in Martinez\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">Martinez also argues that the district court erred when it defined the phrase \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d as used in the indictment as \u201cdone voluntarily and intentionally, and not because of mistake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>or accident.\u201d Martinez\u2019s contention that this instruction modified the offense from a specific intent offense to a general intent offense is without merit and we need not discuss it further. <em>See United States v. Ettinger, </em>344 F.3d 1149, 1154 (11th Cir. 2003) (recognizing that specific intent is not an element of a \u00a7 111 offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">\n<em>B.Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">Martinez also argues that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to inflict serious bodily injury to Parodi.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This argument hinges on Martinez\u2019s argument, which we have already rejected, that an \u201call other cases\u201d forcible assault requires an attempt or threat to inflict serious bodily injury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As discussed <em>swpra, </em>the district court correctly instructed the jury on the term \u201cforcible assault\u201d under the evidence in this case. Specifically, the district court made it clear that the government needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) Martinez \u201cforcibly assaulted\u201d Parodi by committing an assault that resulted in physical contact, but that did not involve bodily injury or a deadly weapon; (2) that Parodi was a federal officer engaged in the performance of official duties; and (3) that Martinez acted knowingly and willfully, meaning his actions were voluntary and intentional and not the result of mistake or accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">The government\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish Martinez\u2019s guilt. The evidence showed that Martinez sprayed a urine-like liquid through the slot in his cell door; that the stream of liquid made physical contact with Parodi\u2019s chest and head, but did not result in serious bodily harm; that, at the time of the incident, Parodi was a correctional officer conducting a linen exchange in the SHU where Martinez was housed; and that Martinez intended the liquid to make contact with Parodi and, indeed, had planned the offense ahead of time. From this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that all the elements of a \u00a7 111(a) offense were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-11\">\n<em>C. Closing Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-12\">Martinez contends that the district court abused its discretion when it prohibited him from arguing during closing about the government\u2019s failure to produce a videotape of the incident. Although evidence was presented at trial that video cameras were present in the SHU, there was no evidence that the cameras were connected to a recording device or that a videotape of the incident actually existed. A district court does not abuse its discretion by prohibiting counsel from making arguments that are unsupported by the record. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398, 400 (11th Cir.1996) (explaining that reversal is warranted \u201conly if counsel is prevented from making all legal arguments supported by the facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-13\">\n<em>D. Restitution Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-14\">Finally, Martinez challenges the district court\u2019s order requiring Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>tinez to pay restitution to Parodi for his medical bills.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d) applies to a conviction for an offense: (1) that is a crime of violence, which is a crime that has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another; and (2) in which an identifiable victim suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16, 3663A(c)(l). The MVRA provides that the restitution order shall require the defendant to pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary medical and related professional services and devices relating to physical, psychiatric and psychological care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">Martinez does not dispute that forcible assault is a crime of violence under the MVRA. Rather, Martinez contends that restitution should not be awarded for medical consultations and check-ups for uninjured victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">The MVRA permits restitution for both physical injury and pecuniary loss. Thus, even though Parodi was not seriously injured by Martinez\u2019s assault, Parodi had to expend $1,801.63 in medical tests to make that determination. Some of the urine-like liquid Martinez sprayed on Par-odi got in his mouth, nose and eyes, and Parodi did not know Martinez\u2019s medical history. Until Parodi had the medical tests performed, he did not know whether he had contracted a communicable disease as a result of Martinez\u2019s actions. Therefore, Parodi at a minimum suffered a pecuniary loss under the MVRA. Furthermore, because these medical tests were necessary to rule out serious injury, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Martinez to pay an amount equal to their cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1269-9\">. Offense Instruction 1.1 of the Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal) provides that a defendant can be found guilty under \u00a7 111(a)(1) if the following facts are proven beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) \"[t]hat the Defendant \u2018forcibly assaulted' the person described in the indictment, as that term is hereinafter defined\u201d; (2) \"[t]hat the person assaulted was a Federal officer ... then engaged in the performance of an official duty, as charged\u201d; and (3) \u201d[t]hat the Defendant acted knowingly and willfully.\u201d Offense Instruction 1.1 further defines \"forcible assault\u201d in full as \"any willful threat or attempt to inflict serious bodily injury upon someone else, when coupled with an apparent present ability to do so, and includes any intentional display of force that would give a reasonable person cause to expect immediate and serious bodily harm or death even though the threat or attempt is not actually carried out and the victim is not actually injured.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1270-9\">. We review the legal correctness of a jury instruction <em>de novo. United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir.2000).

Some circuits have concluded that the second category of forcible assault (i.e., the \"all other cases\u201d of forcible assault) requires some touching or physical contact. <em>See, e.g., McCulligan, </em>256 F.3d at 104 (requiring proof of actual contact to sustain a conviction for a \u00a7 111(a) offense beyond simple assault). However, the Eighth Circuit in <em>Yates, </em>304 F.3d at 822, like this Court in <em>Fallen, </em>has said that actual physical contact is not required in \u201call other cases\u201d of forcible assault. Rather, the Eighth Circuit concluded that \"all other cases\u201d of forcible assault in \u00a7 111(a) includes all other assaults that are not within the common law definition of simple assault. <em>Yates, </em>304 F.3d at 823.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1271-13\">. We need not address whether a threat or attempt to throw urine in someone\u2019s mouth, nose and eyes constitutes a threat of serious bodily injury because, here, Martinez actually threw the urine, making physical contact with Parodi.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">. Because Martinez's offense involved physical contact, rather than threats of serious bodily injury, his reliance on <em>Fallen </em>is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">. We review the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the government and making all reasonable inferences and credibility determinations in favor of the government and the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1269 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">. We likewise reject Martinez\u2019s claim that the government was required to prove that the liquid thrown at Parodi was actually urine. Nonetheless, we note that the government presented evidence that the liquid smelled like urine to Parodi and Giraldo, that Giraldo observed Martinez urinating in another bottle and saying \"I got more for you\u201d after spraying the liquid, and that Martinez himself apologized to Giraldo for hitting him with urine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1274-7\">. We review a district court's restitution order for an abuse of discretion, but the legality of the order is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1227 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
