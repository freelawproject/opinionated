Stat. \u00a7 784.045(l)(b), constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2 of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-21\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-22\">On March 16, 2006, Llanos-Agostadero, a native and citizen of Mexico, was indicted for illegally re-entering the United States following his Florida conviction for aggravated battery on a pregnant woman and subsequent deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. At his plea hearing, Llanos-Agostadero admitted the factual basis of the indictment and pleaded guilty without a written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-23\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) stated that Llanos-Agostadero had been twice convicted for aggravated battery on a pregnant woman. According to the PSI, he punched, grabbed the throat of, and pushed his pregnant wife while committing the first offense, and he pushed her several times during the second. The PSI assigned Llanos-Agostade-ro a base offense level of 8 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), and recommended (1) a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on the determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>nation that Llanos-Agostadero\u2019s convictions for aggravated battery constituted \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d and (2) a 3-level reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) for acceptance of responsibility. With a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of III, the resulting range under the Sentencing Guidelines was 46 to 57 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Llanos-Agostadero objected to the 16-level enhancement on the grounds that the jury did not find, and he did not admit, that the prior offenses were crimes of violence. He also asserted that the offenses did not qualify as crimes of violence because the use of physical force was not a necessary element. He further objected that an unwarranted sentencing disparity was created by the absence of a \u201cfast-track\u201d or early-disposition program in the Middle District of Florida, thereby violating the Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause and the terms of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). To that end, he moved for a 4-level downward departure to account for the absence of a fast-track program. Llanos-Agostadero did not, however, object to facts underlying his aggravated battery convictions as set forth in the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">At sentencing, the district court overruled Llanos-Agostadero\u2019s objections and denied his motion for a downward departure. Regarding the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), the court admitted into evidence the charging documents and consolidated final judgment for Llanos-Agostadero\u2019s convictions for aggravated battery on a pregnant woman. The court then examined the Florida statute defining the offense of aggravated battery on a pregnant woman, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.045, determined that this offense met the definition of felonious battery, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041, and concluded that aggravated battery on a pregnant woman was a crime of violence for purposes of the enhancement. Regarding the lack of a fast-track program in the Middle District of Florida, the court held that there was no equal protection violation and noted that the Eleventh Circuit had determined that there was no unwarranted disparity. Adopting the PSI\u2019s recommendations, the court sentenced Llanos-Agostadero to 50 months imprisonment. Llanos-Agostadero now appeals this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">\n<em>II. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">\n<em>A. 16-Level Enhancement for Conviction of a Crime of Violence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-9\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 16-level enhancement <em>of </em>a defendant\u2019s offense level if the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after a conviction for a felony that is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The Application Notes for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) provide that a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cany offense under ... state ... law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l), comment. (n.l(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-10\">On appeal, Llanos-Agostadero argues that the district court erred in concluding that his Florida convictions for aggravated battery were crimes of violence for purposes of the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l). Whether a previous offense of conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Glover, </em>431 F.3d 744, 747, 749 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">Generally, in determining whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense for enhancement purposes, we apply a \u201ccategorical\u201d approach \u2014 that is, we look no further than the fact of conviction and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>statutory definition of the prior offense. <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159-60, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <em>United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1273 (11th Cir.2006). But where the judgment of conviction and statute are ambiguous, \u201cwe remand for the district judge to look at the facts underlying a state conviction.\u201d <em>Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d at 1273. In examining the facts underlying a prior conviction, the district court is generally limited to relying only on the \u201ccharging document[s], written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Id.; Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 19-26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1259-63, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Under Florida law, aggravated battery on a pregnant woman is committed \u201cif the person who was the victim of the <em>battery </em>was pregnant at the time of the offense and the offender knew or should have known that the victim was pregnant.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.045(l)(b) (emphasis added). A person commits the offense of \u201cbattery\u201d (that is, \u201csimple battery\u201d) under Florida law when he \u201c[ajetually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other; <em>or </em>... [i]n-tentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(l)(a) (emphasis added). Thus, an \u201cessential element\u201d of the offense of aggravated battery on a pregnant woman is that the defendant commit simple battery \u2014 that is, he \u201c[ajctually and intentionally touches or strikes another person\u201d against the latter\u2019s will, or \u201c[ijntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\u201d <em>Small v. State, </em>889 So.2d 862, 863 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004) (construing Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 784.03(l)(a), 784.045(l)(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">This court has yet to address the issue of whether aggravated battery on a pregnant woman, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.045(l)(b), constitutes a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l). We have, however, addressed closely analogous issues in <em>Glover </em>and <em>United States v. Griffith, </em>455 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">In <em>Glover, </em>this court set forth the elements of simple battery under Florida law and held that simple battery on a law enforcement officer, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 784.03 and 784.07, is a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>Glover, </em>431 F.3d at 749. Notably, like the Application Notes for \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l), \u00a7 4B1.2(a) defines a crime of violence as, <em>inter alia, </em>any offense that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l)). And in <em>Griffith, </em>this court held that simple battery under Georgia law (which occurs when a person \u201c[intentionally makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with the person of another\u201d) constitutes a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9), which, like the Application Notes for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l), defines a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d to include, <em>inter alia, </em>any offense that \u201chas, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force.\u201d <em>Griffith, </em>455 F.3d at 1340-45 (citing O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5 \u2014 23(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921(a)(33)(A)(ii), 922(g)(9)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">In our view, the offenses at issue in <em>Glover </em>and <em>Griffith </em>cannot be meaningfully distinguished from the offense at issue in the instant case, at least with regards to determining whether the offense is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l). First, there is no meaningful distinction between the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) (at issue in the instant case), the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (at issue in Glover), or the definition of a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d under 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) (at issue in <em>Griffith). </em>Moreover, the offense of aggravated battery on a pregnant woman under Florida law has as an element that the defendant commit simple battery, <em>Small, </em>889 So.2d at 863, and there is no persuasive reason why simple battery on a law enforcement officer is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as this court held in <em>Glover, </em>431 F.3d at 749, while simple battery on a pregnant woman (which constitutes aggravated battery) is not. We therefore conclude that aggravated battery on a pregnant woman, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.045(l)(b), is a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l). Accordingly, the district court did not err in holding that Llanos-Agostadero\u2019s prior convictions for aggravated battery on a pregnant woman were crimes of violence for purposes of the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">\n<em>B. Fast-Track Departure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">Llanos-Agostadero also argues that his sentence is unreasonable in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that it violates his rights under the Equal Protection Clause because defendants in judicial districts with fast-track programs are eligible to receive lower sentences than similarly-situated defendants in districts without fast-track programs (such as the Middle District of Florida). We review issues of constitutional law and statutory interpretation <em>de novo, </em>and we review the overall sentence imposed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">\n<em>1. Reasonableness of the Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">After correctly calculating the advisory Guidelines range, a \u201cdistrict court may impose a sentence that is either more severe or lenient than the sentence\u201d this court would have imposed, \u201cbut that sentence must still be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). This court\u2019s review for reasonableness is deferential, and the party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>These factors include: the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics <em>of </em>the defendant, affording adequate deterrence, the Guidelines range, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201cAlthough sentencing courts must be guided by these factors, nothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1357 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">The fast-track departure provision of the Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1, is available to defendants who agree to the factual basis of the criminal charges against them and agree to waive certain rights, but only in judicial districts that participate in an early disposition program authorized by the U.S. Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney for the district in which the court resides. <em>Castro, </em>455 F.3d at 1250-51 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1). Although \u00a7 3553(a)(6) requires the district court to consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities,\u201d in <em>Castro, </em>this court held that \u201csection 3553(a)(6) does not require the district court to depart based on the availability of the [fast-track] departure in only some districts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1253. We reasoned that \u201c[w]hen Congress directed the Sentencing Commission to allow a fast-track departure for only participating districts,\u201d it \u201cimplicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>determined that the disparity was warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252 (citations omitted). Accordingly, a district court may not consider sentencing disparities associated with early disposition programs in imposing sentence. <em>United States v. Arevalo-Juarez, </em>464 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">To the extent Llanos-Agostadero\u2019s argument on appeal could be construed as a claim that the district court erred by denying a downward departure to account for the absence of a fast-track program in the Middle District of Florida, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim, as there is no evidence that the district court misunderstood its authority to depart. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). To the extent he argues that his sentence is unreasonable, we disagree. Here, the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range for Llanos-Agostadero to be 46 to 57 months imprisonment. After expressly considering \u00a7 3553(a), the district court held that 50 months imprisonment was an appropriate sentence. In so holding, the court stated that it was \u201csatisfied that the sentence adequately serves the purposes of sentencing that are reflected [in section] 3553(a)\u201d and \u201cthat the sentence is sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d Again, the district court was <em>not </em>required to state on the record that it had explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of those factors. <em>Thomas, </em>446 F.3d at 1357. Moreover, as discussed above, this court has concluded that a sentencing court may <em>not </em>consider fast-track disparities when imposing sentence. <em>See Arevalo-Juarez, </em>464 F.3d at 1251. Thus, we cannot say that the sentences received by defendants in districts without fast-track programs are \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to achieve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2) <em>solely because </em>similarly-situated defendants in districts <em>with </em>fast-track programs are eligible to receive lesser sentences. We therefore conclude that Llanos-Agostadero\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">\n<em>2. Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">In <em>United States v. Campos-Diaz, </em>472 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir.2006), this court held that \u201cthe absence of a fast-track program in the judicial district where a defendant is sentenced does not violate equal protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1279-80. Accordingly, Llanos-Agostadero\u2019s equal protection argument must fail, and we need not discuss it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
