The defendant also sought to suppress evidence taken from him (his shoes) at the police station after his warrantless arrest, as well as evidence obtained during two subsequent searches of the unit. A Superior Court judge denied the motion to suppress in its entirety, concluding that exigent circumstances had justified the initial warrantless entry and search and that a third search of the unit was undertaken with the consent of the owner. The motion judge made no specific rulings regarding a second search, but his denial of the motion rested on an implicit conclusion that the second search, which was conducted pursuant to a warrant, was permissible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant was convicted on one indictment charging armed robbery while masked, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one indictment charging possession of a Class B substance, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. In an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 1111 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that, at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the Commonwealth failed to introduce evidence sufficient to satisfy its burden of showing that exigent circumstances justified the initial entry and search of the unit. Evidence obtained during that search, including the defendant\u2019s shoes seized at the police station after his arrest, should have been suppressed. We further conclude that evidence as to the armed robbery while masked conviction obtained during the second search was properly seized pursuant to a search war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>rant and supporting affidavit, and that, as to the drug conviction, evidence of drug paraphernalia was properly admitted under the plain view doctrine. Finally, we conclude that the third search was proper because consent was given by the owner of the unit. Because we cannot conclude that the failure to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the initial warrantless entry and search was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the relevant facts from the motion judge\u2019s findings, which are supported by the record, supplemented as necessary with uncontested facts from the motion hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At about 9:15 p.m. on April 8, 2003, the manager of the Sun City Variety Store in Tyngsborough was robbed by two masked men. After responding to the scene of the robbery, the police obtained a description of the two armed assailants from the store manager. He informed the police that the assailants had taken money from him and from the store, and had fled in a white \u201cbox\u201d van.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Tyngsborough Detective Sergeant Charles C. Chronopoulos was informed by another officer at the scene, Daniel Smith, that Raymie Tyree and Wayne Hoffman fit the store manager\u2019s description of the assailants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Officer Smith believed that the two lived at 103 Cardinal Lane. Based on this information, Officer Shaun Wagner was dispatched to 103 Cardinal Lane, a unit adjoining others within a townhouse condominium complex approximately two to three miles from the scene of the robbery. Officer Wagner noticed a white box van in the condominium complex\u2019s common parking lot, noted that the hood of the van was still warm to the touch despite the snowy weather, and relayed this information to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Sergeant Chronopoulos. Sergeant Chronopoulos and other officers then drove to the condominium complex to join Officer Wagner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">At some point, Sergeant Chronopoulos left the complex, returned to the scene of the robbery, and brought the store manager with him to the condominium complex. The manager told the police that the white box van in the parking lot \u201clooked like\u201d the one the robbers had used.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Looking through the van\u2019s window, the manager said that a money band that was visible on the front passenger seat looked \u201csimilar\u201d to the bands that had been on money taken by the assailants from the store. There is nothing in the record to suggest that anyone inspecting the van would have been visible from 103 Cardinal Lane.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Sergeant Chronopoulos drove the manager back to the store and then returned to the condominium complex, joining five other officers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Two, including Sergeant Chronopoulos, were in plain clothes. The six officers then approached 103 Cardinal Lane. Three officers went to the area behind the unit, while Sergeant Chronopoulos and two others went to the front door. All had their guns drawn. There is no evidence that any lights, movements, or activity of any kind had been seen or heard by the police inside 103 Cardinal Lane at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Shortly after 11 p.m., approximately one hour and forty-five minutes after the robbery, Sergeant Chronopoulos knocked on the front door. After two to three minutes, Sandra Markee, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>owner of the unit, opened the door.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Sergeant Chronopoulos identified himself as a Tyngsborough police officer and told Markee that the police were investigating an armed robbery. At the motion hearing, Sergeant Chronopoulos and Markee disputed the details of the ensuing conversation. The motion judge found that the officers told Markee they were looking for the defendant and Hoffman in connection with an armed robbery, that the officers \u201cthen entered Markee\u2019s condominium,\u201d and that Sergeant Chronopoulos \u201cthen directed Markee to open the sliding glass door in the living room area\u201d so that three officers, who had gone around to the back of the unit, could enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Once all six officers were inside, Sergeant Chronopoulos and two other officers went to the basement, with their guns drawn. There they saw and smelled evidence of recent cocaine use. After hearing noises behind a bulkhead door the officers forced the door open and found the defendant, who was \u201cwasted,\u201d \u201cdisoriented,\u201d and \u201cdrooling,\u201d and \u201cappeared to be under the influence of drugs.\u201d Sergeant Chronopoulos also noticed that the shoes the defendant was wearing had soles similar to footprints Sergeant Chronopoulos had seen in the snow outside the Sun City Variety Store shortly after the robbery. The officers arrested the defendant for unlawful possession of narcotics and seized a \u201ccrack pipe\u201d and what appeared to be narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">After taking the defendant into custody and conducting a \u201csweep\u201d of the unit for other individuals, Sergeant Chronopoulos left two officers inside the unit while he went to the Tyngsborough police station to secure search warrants for 103 Cardinal Lane and the white box van. At least one officer remained inside with Markee overnight until Sergeant Chronopoulos returned with other officers at 8:15 a.m. the following day, April 9, 2003, to execute the warrants.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> During this, the second search, the officers recovered drug paraphernalia,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a black winter jacket, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>a black semiautomatic replica gun.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They also recovered a brown paper money band marked \u201c500\u201d from the right front passenger seat of the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Later that day, the police learned that the construction company for which Hoffman worked had reported a white box van as stolen. Hoffman went to the Tyngsborough police station that evening and denied stealing the van. The police did not arrest or charge Hoffman with a crime; they telephoned Markee and asked her to allow Hoffman to stay at 103 Cardinal Lane that night, \u201cpresumably in order to keep track of his whereabouts,\u201d as the motion judge found. The defendant remained in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Two days later, on April 11, 2003, at about 1 p.m. Sergeant Chronopoulos obtained an arrest warrant for Hoffman. After being brought to the Tyngsborough police station, Hoffman told Sergeant Chronopoulos that guns and masks used in the robbery were in the ductwork in the basement\u2019s rafters at 103 Cardinal Lane, but \u201cthey would not be there for much longer.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Sergeant Chronopoulos and three other officers immediately went to 103 Cardinal Lane, taking Hoffman with them. When Markee opened the door, Sergeant Chronopoulos told her he believed there were weapons in the basement and he wanted to search for them. He presented her with a consent to search form, which she signed. Now searching the unit for the third time, the police recovered a closed duffel bag from the ceiling area of the basement, opened the bag, and found two masks and two replica handguns, one black and one silver.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">2. <em>Procedural background. </em>We describe briefly the relevant proceedings in the Superior Court. The defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained during each of the three searches, including his shoes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At the evidentiary hearing on his motion and in their initial written submissions, the parties\u2019 discussion of the initial warrantless entry and search on April 8 focused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>exclusively on whether Markee had consented to the search.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> After the hearing the motion judge issued an order, sua sponte, stating: \u201cAlthough not raised by the parties at the motion hearing or in their Memoranda, the Court would ask both parties to brief the question of whether the entry and search by police of 103 Cardinal Lane on April 8, 2003, was justifiable on the basis of exigent circumstances and/or hot pursuit.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> After supplemental briefing, the motion judge issued findings of fact and rulings of law, concluding that Markee had not consented to the initial entry and search on April 8, but that, because of exigent circumstances, the officers\u2019 initial entry and search was justified. The motion judge further found that Markee had freely and voluntarily consented to the third search of her unit on April 11.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The motion to suppress was denied in its entirety. The defendant proceeded at trial with a defense that he was not the person who had committed the robbery with Hoffman.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">3. <em>Motion to suppress the evidence seized during the initial warrantless entry and search. </em>In reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error. We independently review the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions of law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>449 Mass. 207, 214, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1079 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The Commonwealth does not challenge the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that Markee did not voluntarily consent to the initial warrantless entry and search of 103 Cardinal Lane on April 8. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>We therefore consider first whether that entry and search was justified by exigent circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>439 Mass. 616, 619 (2003). On a careful review of the record we conclude that the Commonwealth did not introduce evidence sufficient to sustain its burden of showing that a search warrant was not required because of exigent circumstances.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The legal principles that govern the resolution of this case are well established. Warrantless searches of a residence presumptively violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vuthy Seng, </em>436 Mass. 537, 549-550, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 942 (2002). The presumption against warrantless searches reflects the importance of the warrant requirement to our democratic society. A warrant ensures that any governmental intrusion into a dwelling \u201cis justified by a careful prior determination of probable cause and necessity\u201d by a neutral arbiter, a judge or magistrate, not by police officers who will themselves carry out the search. K.B. Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4.18 (3d ed. 2007). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marquez, </em>434 Mass. 370, 374 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, </em>367 Mass. 798, 805 (1975) (\u201cThe right of police officers to enter into a home, for whatever purpose, represents a serious governmental intrusion into one\u2019s privacy. It was just this sort of intrusion that the Fourth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>ment [and art. 14 were] designed to circumscribe by the general requirement of a <em>judicial determination </em>of probable cause\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Given the high value that our Federal and Massachusetts Constitutions assign to the warrant requirement, particularly in relation to a dwelling, we impose a heavy burden on the Commonwealth to justify every warrantless search: in the absence of consent, the Commonwealth must prove both probable cause to enter the dwelling<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the existence of exigent circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, supra </em>(for nonconsensual entry to be valid, there \u201cmust be probable cause and there must be exigent circumstances\u201d). Under the exception for exigent circumstances, \u201cthere must be a showing that it was impracticable for the police to obtain a warrant, and the standards as to exigency are strict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, supra </em>at 800, and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>449 Mass. 476, 486 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 904 (1990) (Commonwealth \u201cmust show . . . \u2018that it was impracticable for [officers] <em>to get a </em>warrant\u2019 \u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Notwithstanding these foundational requirements, the Commonwealth asks us to hold that exigent circumstances <em>always </em>justify a warrantless entry and search in the aftermath of a crime involving a firearm where the police have reason to believe (i.e., probable cause) that an armed suspect is in a particular place, even in circumstances where it is not impracticable to obtain a warrant. None of the cases on which the Commonwealth relies, nor any decided since <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, supra, </em>supports so broad a proposition.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The Commonwealth is correct that some of the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>to which courts have looked to determine whether exigent circumstances exist were present in this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, supra </em>at 801, 807 (stating that whether exigent circumstances exist depends on consideration of \u201cthe circumstances in their totality\u201d and suggesting circumstances that \u201chave tended to support a finding of exigency\u201d). There was \u201ca showing that the crime was one of violence or that the suspect was armed.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 807. There was a \u201cclear demonstration of probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And there was \u201cstrong reason to believe that the suspect was in the dwelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, evidence of additional circumstances, one or more of which invariably is present in our cases supporting a conclusion of exigency, was wholly absent in this record. We focus on four such circumstances relied on by the motion judge for which there was no record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">(a) <em>Risk of destruction of evidence. </em>The Commonwealth argues, and the motion judge summarily agreed, that there was a risk that evidence at 103 Cardinal Lane, specifically money and physical evidence such as clothing and guns, would be lost or destroyed absent immediate police action. The record does not suggest any such threat, for at least two reasons. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>439 Mass. 616, 621 (2003) (warrantless entry impermissible \u201cin the absence of specific information supporting an objectively reasonable belief that evidence will indeed be removed or destroyed unless preventative measures are taken\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huffman, </em>385 Mass. 122, 126 (1982) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">First, the circumstances in this case were insufficient to support an objectively reasonable belief that the stolen money imminently would change hands. The Commonwealth argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>stolen \u201ccash is likely to be disposed of quickly,\u201d and we have noted \u201cthe fungible nature of money in general, and the tendency of illicit money to change hands quickly.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>449 Mass. 476, 485 (2007). But in each case in which money was the focus of the warrantless search, the conduct underlying the search involved ongoing illegal drug activities where further drug sales or purchases were possible. See <em>id. </em>at 478 (exigent circumstances where suspects were driving away from drug deal and could have disposed of cash had police not acted immediately); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 748, 750 (1995) (exigent circumstances where surveillance outside apartment building after controlled drug buy could not prevent money from being transferred between apartments inside); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 85, 87-89 (1992) (exigent circumstances where drug sale occurred in defendant\u2019s supermarket and surveillance without entry could not prevent money from changing hands quickly inside and evading detection). Here, the record reveals that the police had no reason to suspect that any illicit drug distribution was occurring at the unit,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the suspects had no way to slip the stolen cash out of the unit while the police maintained their surveillance at the front and rear of the premises. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 478; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Second, the Commonwealth maintains, and the judge found, that any delay risked the destruction of the suspects\u2019 clothing and masks. However, the record reveals no reasonably objective basis to believe that the guns and clothing used in the robbery were \u201csusceptible to destruction or removal\u201d from the unit. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cataldo, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 465, 474 (2007). The police had a presence at the front and the rear of the unit prior to the warrantless entry, no evidence suggests that the occupants were aware of the police presence during that time, and no evidence suggests that they had any incentive to remove or destroy evidence, or that they might be in the process of doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, supra </em>at 620 n.3; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molina, </em>439 Mass. 206, 210 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huffman, supra </em>at 125-127. See also Part 3 (b), <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">(b) Risk <em>of a suspect\u2019s flight. </em>Risk of a suspect\u2019s escape is another circumstance that may support a finding of the requisite \u201cexigency\u201d for a warrantless search. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, </em>367 Mass. 798, 807 (1975) (\u201ca likelihood that the suspect would escape if not apprehended\u201d is one relevant circumstance in evaluation of exigency). The Commonwealth does not argue that any information available to the police before they entered 103 Cardinal Lane supports the motion judge\u2019s statement that any delay to obtain a warrant \u201cwould have also risked the possibility of the assailants fleeing,\u201d and correctly so, for there is no such evidence.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> To the contrary, the assailants were masked and had no reason to believe the store manager might recognize them. (He did not.) Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duarte, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 720 (2002) (that victim and assailant knew one another increased likelihood that assailant \u201cwould flee to avoid apprehension or, at a minimum, take prompt action to conceal\u201d or otherwise dispose of evidence). Nor did they have reason to believe police were likely to locate them in the immediate aftermath of the robbery: there was no evidence that the assailants were followed as they left the store, and the police were led to 103 Cardinal Lane only by information an officer had obtained during the investigation of a wholly unrelated domestic incident.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The police had made no contact with any individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>who was likely to have warned the suspects that the police were searching for them. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, supra </em>at 90 (exigent circumstances where suspect\u2019s son and others had just been arrested and would likely be able to contact suspect soon).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In addition, the presence of officers at both the front and rear of the unit made escape unlikely, and there was no evidence suggesting that anyone inside 103 Cardinal Lane was aware of, or likely to be aware of, the police presence outside the unit before Sergeant Chronopoulos knocked on the front door. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huffman, supra </em>at 125 n.6 (\u201cExigent circumstances may arise if a defendant becomes aware, or is certain to become aware, of an officer\u2019s presence\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> When Sergeant Chronopoulos knocked on the front door, Markee opened the door and gave the police no reason to believe that the possible suspects had been apprised of the police presence, nor did the police see or hear signs of other occupants. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>449 Mass. 207, 217, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1079 (2007) (exigent circumstances where there was no response after police knocked, but officers heard noises inside); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>370 Mass. 10, 12 (1976) (same).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>In short, on the record before us, the police had no reason to believe that the suspects were likely to flee the residence in the time it would have taken to procure a warrant to search the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">(c) <em>Risk of harm to police or others. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, supra, </em>this court held that exigent circumstances existed where the police had reason to believe that seeking a warrant would jeopardize the safety of police or others. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 334, 340 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 875 (2001), <em>S.C., </em>435 Mass. 691 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donoghue, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 108-109 (1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1022 (1987). Although the motion judge stated that any delay in entering 103 Cardinal Lane to obtain a warrant \u201crisked . . . harming the officers and anyone else inside 103 Cardinal Lane,\u201d the record is devoid of any evidence to support that conclusion, and the judge cited none.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The Commonwealth argues that \u201c[ijnherent\u201d in the aftermath of any violent crime or crime involving a firearm is \u201can objectively reasonable belief\u201d that there is a \u201clikelihood\u201d that others will be harmed if police maintain physical surveillance of the premises while seeking a warrant. Were we to agree, no warrant would be required in any case where the police search for suspects in the aftermath of a violent crime. None of our cases supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>such a ruling. Here, no evidence suggests that the police were in any danger prior to their entry or that they believed Markee, whom they knew to be the occupant of the unit, was in danger. The entry occurred in the middle of the night, and there is no evidence that any other persons were in the vicinity, or likely would be. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, supra </em>at 338 (exigent circumstances where officers immediately responded to reports of shots being fired from apartment window); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saunders, supra </em>(exigent circumstances where armed suspect fled from police into densely populated apartment complex at time when children were about to begin leaving for school). The police had no reason to believe that immediate action was necessary to locate any victims. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>448 Mass. 750, 766-767, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 910 (2007) (exigent circumstances where officers feared more victims may be in suspect\u2019s residence after suspect killed seven coworkers in shooting rampage); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 457-458 (1981) (exigent circumstances where trail of blood from murdered body led police directly to apartment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donoghue, supra </em>at 108 (exigent circumstances where \u201cunusually brutal\u201d nature of assault <em>that had </em>just occurred suggested suspect was dangerous and there may be other victims). Nor was there any evidence to suggest that the suspects were likely to engage in violence to avoid capture while the police sought a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">(d) <em>Impracticability of obtaining a warrant. </em>In evaluating whether exigent circumstances existed, we also have placed particular emphasis on whether police \u201c consider[ed] how long it would take to obtain a warrant\u201d before acting, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pietrass, </em>392 Mass. 892, 899 (1984), and whether police engaged in an unjustified delay before seeking a warrant. Here the record is devoid of evidence that obtaining a warrant before the police entered the unit was impracticable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huffman, </em>385 Mass. 122, 125 (1982) (no exigent circumstances where \u201cCommonwealth did not offer any evidence as to the time it would take to get a warrant, or indicate that it would be impractical to get one\u201d).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Warden, Md.

There is no evidence that the police had reason to believe that a warrant would be unobtainable had they sought one before entering the unit. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boswell, </em>374 Mass. 263, 270-271 (1978) (exigent circumstances where probable cause was \u201cin doubt\u201d before police knocked on door and recognized person who answered as suspect).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">(e) <em>Conclusion. </em>For purposes of reviewing whether a warrant-less search falls within the narrow exception of exigent circumstances, we evaluate \u201cthe scene as it could appear to the officers at the time, not as it may seem to a scholar after the event with the benefit of leisured retrospective analysis.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>439 Mass. 616, 620 n.3 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, supra </em>at 456. In this case, neither the police nor the Commonwealth defended the warrantless entry and search on the basis of exigent circumstances until after the motion judge invited them to do so. See notes 15 and 16, <em>supra. </em>We are reticent to apply a \u201cleisured retrospective analysis,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, supra, </em>and to disregard the perceptions of officers at the scene who had not suggested that an exigency existed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGeronimo, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 727 (1995) (finding of exigency \u201ccannot rest on an after-the-fact discovery of a justification that never occurred to, nor was mentioned by, the police but is subsequently imputed to them in an effort to salvage a well-intentioned but flawed prosecution\u201d). No facts in evidence support a conclusion of exigent circumstances.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>discovered and seized during the initial entry and search on April 8 should have been suppressed.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">4. <em>Search pursuant to a warrant on April 9. </em>The warrantless entry into and search of 103 Cardinal Lane on April 8 were invalid. Accordingly, we must now consider whether that initial illegality impermissibly tainted the evidence seized by the police during the second search of the unit on the following day, after the police had secured a search warrant. Here too the law is settled, and in applying it to the facts in this case \u2014 in particular the affidavit of Sergeant Chronopoulos signed in support of the warrant \u2014 we conclude that the evidence seized during the April 9 search was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Evidence obtained during a search pursuant to a warrant that was issued after an earlier illegal entry and search is admissible as long as the affidavit in support of the application for a search warrant contains information sufficient to establish probable cause to search the premises \u201capart from\u201d observations made during the initial illegal entry and search. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>439 Mass. 616, 625 (2003). In such circumstances, the search pursuant to a valid warrant provides an independent source for the challenged evidence \u201cuntainted by information discovered during the initial [illegal] entry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>413 Mass. 823, 830 (1992), quoting <em>Segura </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 813-814 (1984) (\u201cWhether the initial entry was illegal or not is irrelevant to the admissibility of the challenged evidence [if there is] an independent source for the warrant under which the evidence was seized\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">After excluding all information obtained from the impermis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>sible warrantless entry and search, we conclude that the remaining portions of Sergeant Chronopoulos\u2019s affidavit in support of the search warrant contained more than adequate information to support a finding of probable cause to search 103 Cardinal Lane and the white box van for evidence related to the armed robbery.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The untainted information in the affidavit included the store manager\u2019s description of the two assailants and the white box van; Officer Smith\u2019s knowledge that Hoffman and the defendant fit the description of the assailants, were known to be driving a white box van, and were living at 103 Cardinal Lane; the discovery of the white box van parked in the condominium complex\u2019s parking lot with its hood warm to the touch; and the store manager\u2019s identification of the white box van and the money band visible through the van\u2019s window. Because the untainted information in the Chronopoulos affidavit established probable cause to believe evidence related to the armed robbery would be found at 103 Cardinal Lane and inside the van, justifying the issuance of the search warrants, the black jacket found in the unit and the paper money band found in the van as the result of the April 9 search were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The seizure of the drug paraphernalia \u2014 the scale, razors, baking soda, and other drug-related items, see note 11, <em>supra </em>\u2014 during the April 9 search raises a different inquiry. The portions of the search warrant explicitly authorizing their seizure were based on the paragraphs of the Chronopoulos affidavit that described items he had seen in the condominium unit during the illegal search on April 8. Excluding these observations, the Chronopoulos affidavit contains insufficient information to establish probable cause to search 103 Cardinal Lane for evidence of drug use or distribution. Accordingly, those portions of the search warrant permitting officers to search for such evidence were invalid. See <em>United. States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U.S. 573, 577 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>(1971) (\u201cshowing of probable cause\u201d is \u201cnecessary to support a search warrant\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lett, </em>393 Mass. 141, 142 (1984) (\u201ctainted portion of a search warrant is severable from the valid portion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Our conclusion that the drug-related evidence was seized pursuant to tainted portions of the search warrant, however, does not end the matter. As we now explain, the items of drug paraphernalia were properly admissible under the plain view doctrine, which became operative when the valid search was conducted on April 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Items seized pursuant to invalid portions of a warrant need not be suppressed if they were discovered in plain view during a search authorized by the valid portions of the warrant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lett, supra </em>at 147. Under the plain view doctrine, \u201cif police are lawfully in a position from which they view an object, if its incriminating character is immediately apparent, and if the officers have a lawful right of access to the object, they may seize it without a warrant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>437 Mass. 54, 61 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1205 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, </em>428 Mass. 725, 730-731 (1999). \u201cIn the case of contraband and fruits and instrumentalities of crime, the nexus to criminal activity is obvious.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balicki, </em>436 Mass. 1, 8 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, supra </em>at 731. It was immediately apparent to the police that the drug paraphernalia discovered during the valid search on April 9 were instrumentalities of crime.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Under art. 14, the plain view doctrine applies only if the police come across the item inadvertently. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balicki, supra </em>at 8-9. We have concluded, however, that the inadvertence requirement is \u201cparticularly ill-suited when applied to items listed in the invalid portion of a severed warrant, for it [is] at odds with the more . . . basic requirement that search warrants describe things to be seized with particularity.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lett, supra, </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>685 F.2d 942, 954 n.7 (5th Cir. 1982). Where, as here, police seize items listed in the invalid portion of a partially valid warrant, the proper inquiry \u201cis not whether the discovery was inadvertent but whether the items seized in plain view were seized within the scope and intensity of the search permitted under the terms of the valid portions of the warrant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lett, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, supra </em>at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The search the police conducted on April 9 was appropriate in scope and intensity to the valid portions of the warrant. The items of drug paraphernalia were all discovered on a table in the basement bedroom or in the \u201ccellar storage area,\u201d areas where the guns and masks the officers were seeking could have been hidden. The drug paraphernalia seized in plain view during the April 9 search pursuant to the valid portions of the search warrant were properly admitted in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">5. <em>Search pursuant to consent of owner. </em>We turn now to the third and final search, and affirm the motion judge\u2019s finding that the search was justified by Markee\u2019s consent. Police may search a house without a warrant if a person with \u201ccommon authority\u201d over the premises consents, freely and voluntarily, to the search. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171 (1974). In such cases, the Commonwealth \u201cmust show \u2018consent unfettered by coercion, express or implied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 97 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Voisine, </em>414 Mass. 772, 783 (1993). The Commonwealth must also establish \u201csomething more than mere \u2018acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Voisine, supra. </em>\u201cThe voluntariness of an individual\u2019s consent to a warrantless entry is an issue of fact, and must be examined in the circumstances of the case. . . . When reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we accept the motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, supra. </em>Here the motion judge\u2019s finding that Markee voluntarily consented to the officers\u2019 search of her home on April 11 is fully supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Markee signed a consent to search form before the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>entered her home on April 11 to conduct the search.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Markee testified that she did not read the form, nor was it read to her by any of the officers, but she signed the form because she \u201cwas told\u201d her house would be \u201cwrecked\u201d if she did not do so. There was no evidence that Markee could not read, and the judge clearly discredited her testimony on this point, as he was free to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The defendant argues that Markee\u2019s consent was not freely given because it was obtained through the \u201cexploitation\u201d of a prior illegality, specifically the warrantless entry and search on April 8, three nights earlier. We disagree. Police may rely on consent to conduct a search despite a previous invalid entry or search, so long as the \u201cconsent was an act of free will, unaffected by the taint of the [prior] illegality.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>385 Mass. 60, 63 (1982), citing <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603-604 (1975). Three days had passed since the initial invalid entry before Markee gave her consent for the search on April 11, during which time she had agreed, at the request of the police, that Hoffman could stay with her, and the police had searched the unit a second time pursuant to a partially valid search warrant. See Part 4, <em>supra. </em>Based on all the evidence, we conclude that the effects of the illegality of the initial search had sufficiently dissipated and did not taint Markee\u2019s later consent. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loughlin, supra </em>at 64 (consent tainted when suspect was not advised of his right to refuse consent, \u201c[n]o significant time elapsed between the illegality and the \u2018consent,\u2019 \u201d and no \u201cintervening event occurred that dissipated the effect of the illegality\u201d). Finally, as the evidence shows, Markee\u2019s \u201cwords and actions placed no limitations on the scope of the entiy to which [s]he was consenting.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, supra </em>at 99. The guns and masks discovered in the course of the search on April 11 were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">6. <em>Motion to suppress defendant\u2019s shoes seized at the police station. </em>Our conclusions regarding the validity of the three searches do not end our analysis. The Commonwealth, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Street, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 301, 307-309 (2002), argues that the defendant\u2019s shoes, which were seized at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>police station after his arrest, were properly admitted, even if the arrest of the defendant in the condominium on April 8 was invalid because it was made in the course of an illegal entry and search of 103 Cardinal Lane. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The question here is whether evidence \u2014 in this case shoes \u2014 taken from the defendant after his arrest in the course of an unlawful entry or search is the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d and thus not admissible, or whether such evidence is untainted and thus admissible. See <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 484-488 (1963); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Damiano, </em>444 Mass. 444, 453-454 (2005). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pietrass, </em>392 Mass. 892, 900 (1984), this court held that, when police make an arrest within a dwelling after an unlawful warrantless entry, they have \u201cno legal justification for being inside\u201d and can \u201cjustify\u201d their seizure of clothes worn by the defendant at the time of the arrest \u201cneither on the basis of the \u2018plain view\u2019 doctrine nor as a search incident to a lawful arrest. Similarly, the clothing taken from the defendant\u201d at the police station after the illegal arrest \u201cmust be suppressed as \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Street, supra, </em>the Appeals Court concluded that the <em>Pietrass </em>case had been implicitly overruled on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>the issue whether items seized from a defendant outside the home following an illegal warrantless entry or search are admissible by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marquez, </em>434 Mass. 370 (2001) <em>(Marquez). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Street, supra </em>at 308 n.12. In <em>Marquez, supra </em>at 372, 377-379, we \u201cadopt[ed] the principles enunciated\u201d in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>495 U.S. 14 (1990) <em>(Harris), </em>that \u201cwhere the police have probable cause to arrest a suspect, the exclusionary rule [of the Fourth Amendment] does not bar [the admission] <em>of a statement </em>made by the defendant outside of his home, even though the statement is taken after an arrest made in the home in violation of [his rights]\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Marquez, supra </em>at 372 n.1, quoting <em>Harris, supra </em>at 21. The Appeals Court reasoned that, if the exclusionary rule did not bar the admission of statements made by the defendant outside the home following his arrest in the wake of an illegal home search, then items of clothing seized from the defendant outside the home following his arrest in the wake of an illegal home search must also be admissible.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Street, supra </em>at 309, citing <em>Harris, supra, </em>and <em>Marquez, supra. </em>We conclude that the reasoning in <em>Marquez </em>and <em>Harris </em>concerning a defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>ant\u2019s statements does not extend to the seizure of the defendant\u2019s shoes at the police station after he was arrested on the illegal entry of 103 Cardinal Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">As we explained in <em>Marquez, supra </em>at 377, quoting <em>Harris, supra </em>at 20, \u201cthe purpose of the warrant requirement for an arrest in the home is \u2018to protect the home, and <em>anything incriminating the police </em>gather[] from arresting [a defendant] in his home\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). The warrant requirement serves an important deterrent purpose: to ensure \u201cthe police know that a warrantless entry will lead to the suppression of any evidence <em>found, </em>or statements taken, inside the home\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Harris, supra </em>at 20. See <em>Marquez, supra </em>at 378. We also noted, however, that an \u201carrest in a home without a warrant but with probable cause\u201d does not render unlawful \u201ccontinued custody of the suspect once he is removed from the house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377-378, quoting <em>Harris, supra </em>at 18. Thus the <em>statement </em>made by the defendant at the police station \u201cwas not the product of being in unlawful custody [and] [n]either was it the <em>fruit of having been arrested in the home rather than someplace </em>else\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Marquez, supra </em>at 378, quoting <em>Harris, supra </em>at 19. Upholding \u201cotherwise valid statements given by defendants at the police station\u201d after an \u201cinvalid arrest,\u201d we concluded, would not weaken the deterrent purpose of the warrant requirement. <em>Marquez, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">That deterrent purpose would, however, be impaired by allowing the police to acquire items in the defendant\u2019s possession at the time of an arrest in the course of an illegal warrantless entry or search. There is a significant difference in the speech at issue in the <em>Marquez </em>and <em>Harris </em>cases and the item (shoes) seized by the police from the defendant in this case. As an attribute of the person, speech is indistinguishable from the person himself; it goes where he goes, and is not \u201cproperty\u201d that can be \u201cowned\u201d and \u201calienated\u201d in the usual sense of those words. On the other hand, physical items in the arrestee\u2019s possession that are seized following an illegal warrantless search are \u201cthe fruit of [the defendant\u2019s] having been arrested in the home rather than someplace else.\u201d <em>Marquez, supra </em>at 378, quoting <em>Harris, supra </em>at 19. The particular clothing, shoes, or other physical items an arrestee is wearing or carrying depend directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>on the time and place of the arrest. Permitting the postarrest seizure of those items in the wake of a warrantless entry or search would invite the police to circumvent the well-settled rule that, in the course of an illegal warrantless entry and search, any physical evidence police take \u201cfrom the defendant\u201d while still in the home must be suppressed. See <em>Marquez, supra. </em>The risk of manipulation is particularly apparent in cases where, as here, the police note the potential evidentiary relevance of a piece of a suspect\u2019s clothing while they are still unlawfully in the home. Just as statements made in the course of an illegal entry or search must be suppressed, see <em>id.., </em>so, too, must clothing or shoes the defendant was wearing and other items that were in the defendant\u2019s possession at the time of entry. We cannot assume the defendant would have been wearing the same shoes had the police proceeded by summons or waited to arrest him lawfully at another time or place. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>406 Mass. 112, 117 (1989) (unlawfully discovered evidence admissible when discovery of evidence \u201cby lawful means was certain as a practical matter\u201d).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s shoes should have been be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">7. <em>Harmless error. </em>Having concluded that the evidence seized during the initial entry and search on April 8 and the defendant\u2019s shoes, which were seized immediately thereafter at the police station, should have been suppressed, we must now determine whether the erroneous admission of that evidence was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molina, </em>439 Mass. 206, 211-212 (2003) (constitutional errors preserved before or during trial reviewed to determine whether they are \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>411 Mass. 249, 260 (1991) (same). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 163-164, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998) (harmless beyond reasonable doubt standard for preserved constitutional errors is more favorable to defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>ant than standards applicable to certain other errors). We have recognized that a constitutional violation gives rise to presumptive prejudice that can be overcome only where the Commonwealth makes an \u201caffirmative showing\u201d of harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rios, </em>412 Mass. 208, 214 (1992). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacDonald (No. 1), </em>368 Mass. 395, 399 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In considering the \u201cessential\u201d question \u201cwhether the error had, or might have had, an effect on the jury and whether the error contributed to or might have contributed to the verdicts,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perrot, </em>407 Mass. 539, 549 (1990), our focus is not on whether the jury could have convicted the defendant had the tainted evidence been excluded; it is not enough for the Commonwealth to demonstrate that its other, properly admitted evidence was \u201csufficient\u201d to convict the defendant or that the inadmissible evidence was \u201cconsistent\u201d with the admissible evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagraca, </em>447 Mass. 546, 554-555 (2006). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marini, </em>375 Mass. 510, 520-521 (1978) (error not harmless beyond reasonable doubt despite admissible evidence that \u201cwould certainly have been enough to warrant a guilty verdict\u201d). Rather, we ask whether, on the totality of the record before us, weighing the properly admitted and the improperly admitted evidence together, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the tainted evidence did not have an effect on the jury and did not contribute to the jury\u2019s verdicts. We look to factors such as \u201cthe importance of the evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case; the relationship between the evidence and the premise of the defense; who introduced the issue at trial; the frequency of the reference; whether the erroneously admitted evidence was merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence; the availability or effect of curative instructions; and the weight or quantum of evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagraca, supra </em>at 553, and cases cited. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 697 (1983) (these factors, though \u201cuseful,\u201d are \u201cnot exclusive or exhaustive\u201d). We apply the principle of harmless beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cwith restraint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, </em>367 Mass. 474, 498 (1975). An assertion that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is most particularly vulnerable where the over-all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case radiates from a core of tainted evidence. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagraca, supra </em>at 554 (error not harmless: \u201cBy introducing the defendant\u2019s improperly procured admissions twice during trial and then highlighting them during closing argument, the prosecutor unmistakably relied on them in a significant way. This was not surprising, precisely because the defendant\u2019s admissions to the police were the only direct evidence that he lived in the house\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Here, the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, summarizing the evidence she argued to the jury was the most damaging to the defendant, reveals that the Commonwealth\u2019s case stood on a foundation of improperly admitted evidence. The prosecutor repeatedly tied the defendant to the crimes by referring to tainted evidence, and referred to the tainted evidence in order to corroborate the testimony of the police officers and, more important, the critical testimony of Hoffman, who had been called by the Commonwealth and whose credibility was otherwise significantly undermined on cross-examination.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The prosecutor told the jury, among other things, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">(1) The defendant\u2019s shoes seized by the police and the shoe print evidence placed the defendant \u201cat the scene at Sun City Variety that night behind that dumpster exactly where [the store manager] said the man who robbed him was standing,\u201d and \u201calso <em>corroborate[] </em>the other things that Wayne Hoffman told you\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">(2) The drugs and the crack pipe the police found in the warrantless search of 103 Cardinal Lane on April 8, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>well as the defendant\u2019s presence in the bulkhead of the unit\u2019s basement, were <em>\u201cconsistent </em>with what Wayne Hoffman <em>told you </em>happened that night\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">(3) \u201c[Hoffman] <em>told you </em>that they had committed that robbery because they needed money for drugs.

Notwithstanding what the hypothesized typical criminal suspect may or may not know, we will not abandon our settled jurisprudence that the Commonwealth must introduce specific evidence concerning the defendant to meet its strict burden of showing exigency. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, </em>367 Mass. 798, 800 (1975).

There is no reason why they could not have obtained a warrant at that time: the Commonwealth presented no evidence to explain why another officer could not have sought a warrant while Sergeant Chronopoulos drove the manager back to the store. Although the Commonwealth argues the court may infer that the other officers waited for Sergeant Chronopoulos to return before approaching the unit because they determined they needed six officers to make the entry safely, the Commonwealth introduced no evidence to support such an inference; it is a post hoc explanation.

This very crack pipe lit, still smoking.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The Commonwealth argues that \u201cat trial the defense admitted that the defendant used drugs and was guilty of possession of cocaine.\u201d The Commonwealth cites Markee\u2019s testimony that the defendant \u201cused drugs\u201d in the basement of 103 Cardinal Lane at unspecified times, a far cry from an admission by the defendant. The Commonwealth also cites defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, in which counsel stated the defendant \u201cwas doing drugs\u201d when he was arrested. Defense counsel made similar statements in his opening argument. Counsel\u2019s statements must be read in light of the motion judge\u2019s refusal to suppress the drug-related evidence from the unlawful entry and search on April 8. It is \u201cneither realistic nor fair in the circumstances to place much weight\u201d on counsel\u2019s statement as indicia that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hollister, </em>75 Mass.
