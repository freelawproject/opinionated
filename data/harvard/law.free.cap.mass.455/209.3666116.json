L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1), and operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license, subsequent offense, in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 23. The charges arose from his arrest on February 29, 2008, after which he consented to a breathalyzer test. The results, as automatically generated by the breathalyzer machine and reported on an \u201cimplied consent report form,\u201d showed a breath sample having a blood alcohol level of .09 per cent at 4:14 a.m.; a calibration standard analysis of .15 per cent at 4:15 a.m.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; and a breath sample having a blood alcohol level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>of .10 per cent at 4:18 a.m. In a written decision on a motion in limine filed by the Commonwealth, a District Court judge concluded that, in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements, the Commonwealth in its prosecution of the OUI offense could only introduce evidence of the lower of the two breath sample results (or, stated another way, only the lower blood alcohol level result and not, as the Commonwealth wanted, both blood alcohol level results).* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth sought relief from this ruling pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and a single justice of the county court reserved and reported the case to the full court without decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with the District Court judge and remand the case to the county court for entry of a judgment affirming his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">1. <em>Statutory and regulatory framework. </em>\u201c[A]n OUI violation may be established on proof that a driver was operating a motor vehicle either \u2018with a percentage, by weight, of alcohol in [his] blood of eight one-hundredths or greater\u2019 (per se violation), or \u2018while under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u2019 (impaired ability violation).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colturi, </em>448 Mass. 809, 810 (2007). See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1). A driver operating on \u201cany way or in any place to which the public has right to access . . . shall be deemed to have consented to a chemical test or analysis of his breath [breathalyzer test] . . . in the event that he is arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(f) </em>(1). \u201cSuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>test shall be administered at the direction of a police officer . . . <em>\"Id. </em>\u201cIf the person arrested refuses to submit to [a breathalyzer test], after having been informed that his license or permit to operate motor vehicles . . . shall be suspended for a period of at least 180 days and up to a lifetime loss, for such refusal, no [breathalyzer test] shall be made and he shall have his license or right to operate suspended in accordance with this paragraph for a period of 180 days . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In a prosecution of an GUI charge, \u201cevidence of the percentage, by weight, of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood at the time of the alleged offense, as shown by chemical test or analysis ... of his breath, shall be admissible and deemed relevant to the determination of the question of whether such defendant was at such time under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(e). </em>For breathalyzer test results to be \u201cvalid,\u201d the Legislature has imposed several requirements. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24K. Among these requirements is that the breathalyzer test be conducted by a \u201ccertified operator, using infrared breath-testing devices according to methods approved by the secretary of public safety [Secretary].\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the Secretary is obligated to \u201cpromulgate rules and regulations regarding satisfactory methods, techniques and criteria for the conduct of such tests,\u201d <em>id., </em>and to \u201cprescribe a uniform form [the implied consent report form, see 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.09 (2006)] for reports of such chemical analysis to be used by law enforcement officers.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24K. The regulations \u201cshall include\u201d that the breath testing procedure have the following sequence: \u201c(1) one adequate breath sample analysis; (2) one calibration standard analysis [see note 1, <em>supra]; </em>[and] (3) a second adequate breath sample analysis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Under the regulations promulgated by the Secretary, \u201c[a] breath test shall be valid and admissible . . . if it consists of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>(a) a multipart procedure in which two adequate breath samples agree within +/- 0.02 blood alcohol content units,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] and (b) the calibration standard analysis reads 0.14%, 0.15%, or 0.16%.\u201d 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.56(6) (2006). The regulations also provide: \u201cIf the two adequate breath samples, expressed in the two decimal mode, differ within +/- 0.02 blood alcohol content units, <em>the lower of the two adequate breath samples shall be taken as the individual under arrest\u2019s blood alcohol level\u201d </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.57 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">2. <em>Breath sample results. </em>We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the judge\u2019s decision amounts to an error of law and an abuse of discretion. The Commonwealth suggests that the decision cannot stand because the Secretary, as opposed to the Legislature, imposed the requirement that, when the two breath samples differ \u201cwithin +/- 0.02 blood alcohol content units,\u201d the lower of the two samples shall be taken as a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level. 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.57. The validity of a regulation will be sustained, however, so long as it reasonably relates to, and does not conflict with, the controlling statute. See <em>Ciampi </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>452 Mass. 162, 175 (2008); <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 855 (1977). Here, the Commonwealth ignores that the Legislature has expressly authorized, indeed charged, the Secretary with promulgating rules and regulations \u201cregarding satisfactory methods, techniques and criteria for the conduct of [breathalyzer] tests.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24K. Although the Legislature, to some extent, circumscribed the authority it conferred on the Secretary by requiring that the regulations include certain matters, such as a particular sequence for the testing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>procedure (a calibration standard analysis in between two adequate breath samples), the Legislature was silent on the issue of the significance of different results from the two adequate breath samples. Where the controlling statute expressly requires two breath samples, it is reasonable for the Secretary to anticipate different results and to account for such an occurrence. This type of regulation, in our view, is necessarily implicated by \u201cthe conduct of such tests.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24K. Thus, where the regulation reasonably relates to, and does not conflict with the statute, the Secretary\u2019s regulation amounts to a permissible exercise of his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The Commonwealth contends that the Secretary\u2019s decision to designate the lower of the two adequate breath samples as a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level benefits a defendant. While this observation may be accurate, it does not invalidate the applicable regulation. The Secretary was charged with accounting for a situation where a defendant\u2019s two adequate breath samples differed. The regulation reasonably does so. By reconciling the two different readings to the benefit of a defendant, the Secretary avoids a claim that the higher reading is unreliable (as contrasted with the lower reading). The imposition of the applicable margin, within .02 per cent, see 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.57, can be said to safeguard further the reliability of the process. If the results fall outside this margin, the test is altogether invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We are unpersuaded by the Commonwealth\u2019s claim that the higher breath sample result is probative evidence that corroborates a defendant\u2019s designated blood alcohol level and, therefore, must always be admissible. The imposition of a two-part procedure to obtain a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level essentially pertains to the validity of the breathalyzer test and does not speak of evidentiary value. The Secretary could have determined that permitting evidence of both adequate breath sample results in every GUI prosecution<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would unnecessarily confuse a jury on a technical matter not within their common knowledge. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the extent that the two breath samples yield disparate, and not marginal, results, the breathalyzer test, by virtue of the Secretary\u2019s imposition of the requirement that the two samples be within a margin of .02 per cent, see 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.56(6)(a), will not be valid. To otherwise permit introduction of a marginally higher breath sample result only invites jurors to do what the regulatory framework prohibits, namely, to infer, or conclude, that the lower breath sample result is not accurate and that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level has been underreported. We add that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 448-449 (1995), does not aid the Commonwealth, as that case was decided under a different statutory and regulatory scheme corresponding to the date of the offense in that case, September 25, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The case is remanded to the county court for the entry of a judgment affirming the judge\u2019s decision denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-15\"><em>A </em>calibration standard analysis is \u201can analysis consisting of an instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>simulating deep lung air containing a certified alcohol standard.\u201d 501 Code Mass.

Although we are not required to exercise our extraordinary superintendence powers under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, we find it appropriate to do so in this case.

For example, by truncating, a reading of 0.079 [per cent blood alcohol content] would be reported as 0.07 and a reading of 0.089 [per cent blood alcohol content] would be reported as 0.08. The effect of truncating, as opposed to rounding, is to under-report the concentration, to the benefit of the arrestee.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chun, </em>194 N.J. 54, 83, cert. denied, 129 S.

While there may exist cases that are soundly left to the discretion of the trial judge, this case is not such a case. The Commonwealth makes clear that, in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>it sought to admit both breath sample results in order to have the higher number corroborate the lower number. Corroboration was the sole ground for relevancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
