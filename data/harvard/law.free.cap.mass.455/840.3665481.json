We conclude, however, that expert testimony that DNA tests could not exclude the defendant as a potential source of DNA found at the crime scene, absent testimony regarding statistical findings explaining the import of such a result, was likely to confuse and mislead the jury such that any probative value of the test results was substantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect. Because the error in admitting such evidence was prejudicial, we remand for a new trial and provide guidance on issues that may then arise.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The facts as they properly could have been found by the jury are set forth in the decision of the Appeals Court, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattei, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 510, 511-513 (2008). We repeat here the basic details, focusing on facts relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim of insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">At approximately 1 p.m., on April 26, 2002, the thirty-six year old victim returned to her apartment in a housing complex operated by the Andover Housing Authority (housing authority). As she walked down the stairs to her basement apartment, she saw the defendant \u2014 a man she did not recognize \u2014 mopping the floor in the basement hallway. After a brief exchange, the victim entered her apartment, locking the door behind her. Shortly thereafter, through the locked door,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant warned her to be careful if she left the apartment because the floor in the hall was wet and slippery.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">One to five minutes later, while she was standing near her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>bed facing away from her front door, a man grabbed the victim from behind. A struggle ensued, during which the assailant repeatedly pressed his hand over the victim\u2019s mouth and nose, making it difficult for her to breathe. During the struggle the assailant tried to place duct tape over the victim\u2019s mouth,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but was unsuccessful in doing so. Eventually, as she testified, the victim could struggle no more. The assailant then attempted to rape the victim anally, but stopped after ten or fifteen minutes and left the apartment. The victim was unable to see the assailant\u2019s face, and could not identify her attacker. She later described the assailant as \u201cwhite,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and reported that he was wearing a white or light gray sweatshirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in denying his motion for required findings of not guilty of home invasion and assault by means of a dangerous weapon because the jury could not properly have found that the duct tape as used by the assailant was a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d within the meaning of those statutes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>430 Mass. 461, 465-466 (1999), quoting G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C (listing elements of home invasion, including \u201cwhile armed with a dangerous weapon\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 305-306 (1980), citing G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B (discussing \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d element of assault \u201cby means of a dangerous weapon\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On review, \u201cwe determine whether the evidence offered by the Commonwealth, together with reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>able inferences therefrom, when viewed in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to persuade a rational jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Campbell, 378 Mass. 680, 686 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-678 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">We agree with the Appeals Court that resolution of this claim is determined in large part by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>430 Mass. 182 (1999), see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattei, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 510, 519 (2008), where we held that duct tape had been used as a dangerous weapon when an assailant used the tape to gag the mouth of a woman and the mouth of her seven year old daughter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 184, 195. In that case, the child died of asphyxiation because the duct tape covered her nose and mouth, see <em>id. </em>at 184, and we held that \u201cthe jury could permissibly infer from the resulting death that the tape was used as a dangerous weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>408 Mass. 811, 812-813, 822-823 (1990) (sufficient evidence for jury to find that gag, as used by defendant, was dangerous weapon where victim died \u201cfrom a combination of head injuries and asphyxia by the gag\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tarrant, </em>367 Mass. 411, 416 n.4 (1975) (where \u201cneutral object is in fact used to inflict serious injury it would clearly be a dangerous weapon\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Our reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, supra, </em>is based not entirely on the fact that the object at issue here, as in that case, is duct tape. As we noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, supra </em>at 307 n.5, the use of a particular object in one case \u201cshould not be construed to mean that any intentional unjustified touching with an object previously held in a different case to have been <em>capable </em>of being a dangerous weapon constitutes a crime .... A reasonable jury might well reach a different conclusion as to [an object] when used in different circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Thus the \u201cessential question\u201d is \u201cwhether the object, as used by the defendant, is capable of producing serious bodily harm.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tevlin, </em>433 Mass. 305, 310 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 391, 397 (1987). That question is for the jury to determine, \u201ctaking into account the purposes for which the object is intended and the manner in which it is used.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, supra </em>at 822, and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 195, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, supra </em>(\u201cthe question whether a weapon is dangerous as used is always one for the fact finder\u201d). Here the jury were correctly instructed that, in order to find the defendant guilty of home invasion or assault by means of a dangerous weapon, they had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used the duct tape \u201cwith the intent to use it in a dangerous or potentially dangerous fashion,\u201d i.e., that the duct tape was \u201cintentionally used in a way that it is reasonably capable of causing serious injury or death to another person.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It was for the jury to consider, for example, the evidence of the victim\u2019s trouble with breathing during the assault when the assailant placed his hand over her mouth and nose, and the fact that the assailant attempted to use duct tape measuring two to two and one-half inches wide to cover and close her mouth, as they considered whether the use of the duct tape in this case met the definition of a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d as instructed by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">That the victim in this case did not die or suffer serious bodily harm from the attempted use of the duct tape to cover her mouth is not dispositive.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The \u201crelevant behavior\u201d for the offense of assault by means of a dangerous weapon \u201cis an outward demonstration of force,\u201d and requires \u201conly apparent ability to injure.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, supra </em>at 305, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>357 Mass. 686, 692-693 (1970). See <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>v. <em>Tarrant, supra </em>at 414 (relevant focus in evaluation whether item is \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is \u201cinstrumentality\u2019s potential for harm as it might have objectively seemed to a reasonable individual\u201d). An analysis focusing on the object\u2019s apparent ability to injure is equally appropriate under the home invasion statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cApparent ability to injure\u201d of necessity encompasses the <em>particular </em>use that the defendant made of the object. In this case the jury permissibly could find that the assailant used the duct tape to cover the victim\u2019s mouth, potentially cutting off her oxygen supply. \u201cThe law need not wait until the instrument actually does cause serious bodily harm in order to classify the weapon as dangerous.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, supra </em>at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">3. <em>Admissibility of evidence that defendant could not be excluded by a DNA test without accompanying statistics. </em>The defendant argues that it was error to admit expert testimony that the defendant could not be excluded as a potential source of DNA found on the interior doorknob of the victim\u2019s apartment, and that the victim could not be excluded as a potential source of DNA found on the defendant\u2019s sweatpants, without accompanying testimony explaining the statistical relevance of those nonexclusion results. For the reasons that follow, we agree.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">At trial, the Commonwealth presented expert testimony from a forensic chemist from the DNA unit at the State police crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>laboratory, who testified that she had conducted DNA tests on various pieces of evidence collected from the crime scene. The test results fell into two groups: tests of DNA taken from a sweatshirt showed a \u201cmatch\u201d with DNA samples from the defendant and the victim;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> other tests did not result in \u201cmatches\u201d but \u201c[could not] .exclude\u201d the defendant or the victim as a possible contributor to the sample. There were no \u201cmatches\u201d between the defendant and DNA from any samples taken from inside the victim\u2019s apartment, and there were no matches between the victim and DNA from samples taken from the defendant\u2019s clothes when apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Turning to the evidence of a \u201cmatch,\u201d the expert first testified, without objection, that DNA from a sample taken from the sleeve of a white sweatshirt found in a trash barrel in the basement laundry room across the hall from the victim\u2019s apartment \u201cmatched\u201d the DNA in a sample taken from the victim, and that DNA from a sample taken from the front of the sweatshirt \u201cmatched\u201d the DNA in a sample taken from the defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The expert explained that the DNA tests she used assigned numbers to particular locations, or allele sites, on the DNA molecule belonging to the profile being tested.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A \u201cmatch\u201d occurred when the results from all thirteen allele sites and a gender test in the two samples being compared were identical. The expert further testified as to the probability that a randomly selected member of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>the population would have a DNA profile that \u201cmatched\u201d the DNA profiles in the samples from the sweatshirt.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant does not challenge the \u201cmatch\u201d testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The defendant\u2019s challenge focuses on the expert\u2019s testimony concerning two other samples, one taken from the defendant\u2019s sweatpants and the second from an interior doorknob within the victim\u2019s apartment. As to the sample taken from the defendant\u2019s sweatpants, the expert first testified that this was a \u201cmixture\u201d that contained DNA from at least two sources.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the expert then testified that the <em>victim </em>was \u201cincluded\u201d or \u201ccould not be excluded\u201d as a potential source of DNA in the sample taken from the defendant\u2019s sweatpants.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As to the swabbing of blood found on the interior doorknob of the door to the victim\u2019s apartment, the expert testified that this also showed the presence of DNA from more than one source, and a DNA test showed the mixture was \u201cconsistent with\u201d DNA from the victim and from the defendant. According to the expert, the victim and the defendant were both \u201cincluded\u201d as \u201cpotential contributor[s]\u201d to the mixture, i.e., neither the victim nor the defendant \u201cwere excluded as a potential contributor to the DNA mixture on the interior of the doorknob.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The expert explained that a result that certain profiles were \u201cnot excluded\u201d meant that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>\u201cthe numbers that are present in those profiles are also present in the [sample profile] being compared.\u201d The nonexclusion results here were not \u201cmatches,\u201d she explained, because either not enough DNA was available to test all thirteen allele sites or it was not possible to distinguish the major from the minor profile at one allele site.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The expert did not testify as to the probability that an individual randomly selected from the population would also \u201cnot be excluded\u201d by these tests, nor did she provide any other indication as to the meaning of a \u201cnot excluded\u201d result. She merely displayed charts to the jury illustrating the numerical results of the tests at each tested location and stated generally that the alleles at the sites she tested \u201care extremely variable between people.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>We now consider the defendant\u2019s objection to this testimony. A judge generally is accorded substantial discretion in deciding whether evidence is relevant, and if so, whether it nevertheless should be excluded as less probative than prejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Mathews, 450 Mass. 858, 872 n.15 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>444 Mass. 586, 589 n.2 (2005). In this respect DNA test results are generally no different from other evidence, and a judge\u2019s decision to admit or exclude the evidence will be accorded substantial deference. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">We have also held that in a criminal trial we will \u201cnot permit the admission of test results showing a DNA match (a positive result) without telling the jury anything about the likelihood of that match occurring.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, </em>409 Mass. 218, 222 n.7 (1991).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>416 Mass. 347, 357 (1993) (Abrams, J., concurring) (\u201cexpert testimony concerning a DNA match must be accompanied by some background information indicating the probability that the match in question might have occurred by chance\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thad T., </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 497, 505-506 (2003) (same). We have explained our approach by stating that \u201c[ejvidence of a match based on correctly used testing systems is of little or no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>value without reliable evidence indicating the significance of the match, that is, \u2018evidence of the probability of a random match of [the victim\u2019s or] the defendant\u2019s DNA in the general population.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosier, </em>425 Mass. 807, 813 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 20 (1994). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, supra </em>at 230 (Appendix) (\u201cThe fact that two DNA samples produce the same DNA prints, and therefore contain the same alleles, is of little probative value in a criminal prosecution until it is determined how often that combination of alleles occurs in a given population\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The same reasoning applies to evidence that a DNA test, although resulting in less than a complete \u201cmatch,\u201d could not exclude a particular individual as a potential contributor.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Without reliable accompanying evidence as to the likelihood that the test could not exclude other individuals in a given population, the jury have no way to evaluate the meaning of the result.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As the dissent in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattei, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 510, 522 (2008) (Rubin, J., dissenting), noted, there is no way to determine whether the results of nonexclusion in this case mean \u201cthat half the people in the world could have left the DNA that was found in the mixture[s]\u201d on the interior doorknob or on the defendant\u2019s sweatpants. We simply do not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Further, admitting evidence of a failure to exclude without accompanying evidence that properly interprets that result creates a greater risk of misleading the jury and unfairly prejudicing the defendant than admission of a \u201cmatch\u201d without accompanying statistics. As to \u201cmatches,\u201d it is \u201cgenerally well known that DNA testing often allows scientists to identify a particular individual from among millions.\u201d <em>Peters </em>v. <em>State, </em>18 P.3d 1224, 1227 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001). Jurors are routinely presented with exceedingly infinitesimal random match probabilities. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>443 Mass. 245, 249 (2005) (\u201cone in 64 quadrillion African-Americans\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Girouard, </em>436 Mass. 657, 669 n.4 (2002) (\u201cone in fifty-seven trillion\u201d Caucasians); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thad T., </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 497, 505 (2003) (\u201cone in 320 trillion\u201d Afiican-Americans). Indeed in this case, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>to the \u201cmatches\u201d identified on the sweatshirt, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert testified to random match probabilities as small as one in 13.51 quintillion. See note 17, <em>supra. </em>If the jury are not provided with similar statistical evidence where the DNA test result is a \u201cnonexclusion,\u201d there is a real risk that jurors will be misled into thinking that these DNA test results are similarly significant and that the nonexclusion evidence is similarly conclusive as to the \u201cmatched\u201d contributor\u2019s identity, when in fact the actual meaning of such results can vary substantially. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>280 Kan. 146, 154 (2005) (probability of selection of unrelated individual at random having DNA profile that could not be excluded as contributor to various blood samples was one in 431,000 for blood on murder weapon, one in 27,880 for blood on sheets and pillow, and one in seven for blood on dryer door).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>450 Mass. 858 (2008) <em>(Mathews), </em>is misplaced. In <em>Mathews, </em>we permitted the admission of <em>inconclusive </em>DNA test results without accompanying statistics to rebut the defendant\u2019s challenge of \u201cthe integrity of the police investigation,\u201d and \u201cits use of forensics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 872. We used the term \u201cinconclusive\u201d to refer to results that provide <em>no </em>information whatsoever due to insufficient sample material, contamination, or some other problem.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 864 (according to chemist\u2019s testimony, DNA test results were \u201cinconclusive\u201d where \u201cthere was just not enough DNA information\u201d in one DNA profile \u201cto either include or exclude\u201d two known individuals, and where minor profile in mixture from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>another sample did not \u201ccontain enough DNA to make a conclusion, either an inclusion or exclusion\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, </em>452 Mass. 236, 253 (2008) (describing as \u201cinconclusive\u201d DNA test that \u201cyielded \u2018no results,\u2019 meaning that \u2018very little DNA [was] present\u2019 or that it was \u2018very degraded,\u2019 or both\u201d).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The question before us is not whether it was error to admit inconclusive DNA test results; <em>Mathews </em>is inapposite.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNickles, </em>434 Mass. 839 (2001) (McNickles), is similarly unavailing.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s argument in <em>McNickles </em>was not, as here, that the test results were unduly confusing and prejudicial without accompanying statistics. Rather, in <em>McNickles, </em>\u201cthe defendant conceded that the test results yielded some reliable, relevant information, challenging only whether the test could be read to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>yield a more precise result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 850. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Laughlin, </em>446 Mass. 188, 208 (2006) (rejecting similar argument that DNA tests showing random match probability of one in two were insufficiently probative to be admissible); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Benoit, 382 Mass. 210, 221 (1981) (rejecting argument that admission of defendant\u2019s blood type was prejudicial because that type was shared by \u201ca large segment of the world population\u201d). In <em>McNickles, supra </em>at 849-855, we did not have occasion to consider whether the probative value of DNA nonexclusion testimony might be outweighed by the prejudicial possibility of jury confusion. As to that question, DNA test results are not the same as descriptive information about physical traits such as height, weight, and hair color described in <em>McNickles, supra </em>at 854. Because jurors can \u201creadily observe\u201d physical traits within the general population, \u201cthe jury is presumed to have a grasp of the frequency of these characteristics within the general population. DNA evidence is different. Because a juror is unable to observe a person\u2019s DNA, the juror has no idea of the frequency of a particular DNA profile.\u201d <em>Peters </em>v. <em>State, </em>18 P.3d 1224, 1228 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The challenged expert testimony concerning the nonexclusion results should not have been admitted without accompanying statistical explanation of the meaning of nonexclusion. We therefore must determine whether the error \u201cdid not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect,\u201d in other words whether we can say, \u201cwith fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The error was prejudicial. First, the prosecutor emphasized the importance of the nonexclusion DNA evidence in her closing argument. She described the evidence as \u201cvery important in this case.\u201d It \u201ccreate[d] links in the chain,\u201d and \u201chelp[ed] to put all of those pieces of other evidence together,\u201d into \u201ca big, clear picture.\u201d The prosecutor specifically encouraged the jury to \u201cdraw an inference\u201d from the evidence that the defendant could not be excluded as a potential source of DNA on the doorknob inside the victim\u2019s apartment that the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>\u201cin fact, the assailant in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> She pointed specifically to the \u201cdifferent areas of concordance\u201d linking the defendant to the interior doorknob. Her emphasis on the doorknob DNA was hardly surprising, as no other evidence placed the defendant inside the victim\u2019s apartment; the victim twice told the dispatcher in her 911 call that she had locked her door; the defendant did not have a key to the apartment;<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and there were no signs of a break-in. The prosecutor focused on the nonexclusion of the victim as a potential source of DNA on the defendant\u2019s sweatpants, telling the jury that the DNA profile found on the sweatpants was \u201cconsistent at numerous locations on the DNA with [the victim\u2019s] DNA profile.\u201d Her emphasis on this evidence is similarly unsurprising, as no other evidence linked the victim to the defendant through clothing that the defendant was wearing when apprehended. Cf. note 16, <em>supra. </em>That linkage was crucial to the Commonwealth\u2019s case because the victim could not identify her assailant. The Commonwealth concedes in its brief that the nonexclusion DNA results were the \u201cmost damaging\u201d DNA results for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The lack of statistical evidence concerning the nonexclusion test results was particularly harmful to the defendant because the prosecutor, in effect, encouraged the jury to act as their own experts, arguing to them that the results from tests of the defendant\u2019s sweatpants (which could not exclude the victim as a potential contributor) were \u201cconsistent\u201d at \u201cnumerous locations on the DNA\u201d with the victim\u2019s DNA profile. \u201cYou can look at that chart,\u201d she said, \u201cand you can think about what that means, when you analyze the evidence. Those were the defendant\u2019s sweatpants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The \u201cmatches\u201d between DNA from both the defendant and the victim and DNA samples on the sweatshirt discovered by the police in the trash barrel outside the victim\u2019s apartment does not mandate a contrary result. The defendant\u2019s DNA could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>been deposited on the sweatshirt before the attack (there was testimony that he had been given the sweatshirt earlier in the week). Although there was testimony that the defendant had been seen wearing the sweatshirt on the morning of the attack, there was also testimony that a photograph from a bank surveillance camera showed the defendant later that morning, before the attack, without the sweatshirt. We therefore cannot say that the jury were not substantially swayed by the nonexclusion DNA results into discounting the possibility that someone other than the defendant wore the sweatshirt during the attack.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> A new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">4. <em>Limit on cross-examination. </em>Because a similar issue may recur at any new trial, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that his rights to confront witnesses under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution were violated by limitations placed by the judge on his cross-examination of certain witnesses. The defendant was one of four inmates from the Correctional Alternative Center in Lawrence assigned to work that day doing maintenance and cleaning for the housing authority. At trial, the defendant sought to show that the police had focused on him prematurely because he was a convict on work release, and that the police had conducted a flawed investigation by failing to fingerprint, conduct DNA testing, or investigate the background of three employees of the housing authority, two of whom had significant criminal records.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The judge permitted defense counsel to elicit from the investigating police officers that they had not asked the housing authority employees whether they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>criminal records, that they had not run criminal background checks on the employees, and that the lead police investigator had learned only after the investigation that two of the employees had criminal records. The judge did not allow defense counsel to ask the officers whether it would have been important to them to know that one housing authority employee had been convicted of murder in the second degree and another charged with aggravated rape.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Both the Sixth Amendment and art. 12 \u201cguarantee a criminal defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him through cross-examination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>443 Mass. 740, 748, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1035 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>420 Mass. 67, 71 (1995). That right, of course, is not \u201cabsolute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miles, supra, </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>399 Mass. 385, 393 (1987). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>375 Mass. 211, 214, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 872 (1978) (right to cross-examine \u201cmay, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process\u201d). We conclude that the cross-examination of the officers should not have been limited as it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">One focus of the defense was on the inadequacy of the police investigation, and we have concluded that, in such circumstances, a limitation on cross-examination such as occurred here is not proper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miles, supra </em>at 72-73. In that case, we concluded that a restriction on the defendant\u2019s cross-examinatian of the police about their \u201cinvestigation of other suspects\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> was error because \u201ctestimony about the police investigation that led to the defendant\u2019s arrest\u201d after an attack in which the victim did not see her assailant\u2019s face was \u201chighly material to one of the most important issues at trial, the identification of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 73 n.1. We recognize that the judge in this case did accommodate in part the defendant\u2019s \u201clegitimate purpose in seeking to inquire about other suspects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the judge\u2019s refusal to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>the defendant to question <em>the police </em>about their knowledge of the criminal histories of the housing authority employees denied the defendant the opportunity to show that a central defense \u2014 that the police investigation was inadequate in that the police prematurely focused on him to the exclusion of investigating other potential suspects \u2014 was not based purely on speculation. The limitations prevented the defendant from establishing that the housing authority employees \u2014 Dion in particular \u2014 may have had an incentive to misdirect the police during the investigation to deflect attention away from themselves.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Dion and Roman both gave their names and dates of birth to police at the outset of the investigation. It would be reasonable to infer that each knew it was likely that the police could learn of their criminal records, that each may have feared becoming a suspect in the investigation, and that each may have had an incentive to deflect police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>attention away from himself during the immediate investigation. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graziano, </em>368 Mass. 325, 330 (1975) (evidence that witness \u201cthought he was suspected was relevant to his motive in testifying and therefore to his credibility\u201d).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Such an inference would have had particular weight as to Dion (previously indicted for aggravated rape), who had a master key that could provide access to the victim\u2019s apartment and who, around the approximate time of the attack, drove alone to a building next to the building where the victim was attacked, and returned shortly thereafter. Cf. <em>id. </em>(evidence that witness\u2019s \u201cconduct made it likely that he would be a suspect . . . was relevant to his motive in testifying\u201d). Evidence that the police investigation may have suffered from misdirection that went unnoticed due to the failure to investigate the criminal records of certain individuals was critical to the defendant\u2019s core theory of misidentification. Such evidence should not be excluded at any new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">5. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant claims ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to \u201cseek either dismissal of the charges or some other appropriate remediation\u201d for the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to take possession of a roll of duct tape found in the victim\u2019s bedroom, an omission that the defendant claims constituted a loss of potentially exculpatory evidence. We agree with the Appeals Court that the \u201csituation was not one calling for sanctions,\u201d and that the defendant was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattei, </em>72 Mass.

Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>470 N.W.2d 30, 33 (Iowa 1991) (statistics admissible because \u201c[wjithout statistical evidence, the ultimate results of DNA testing would become a matter of speculation\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Other jurisdictions that have rejected claims that DNA test results should not be admitted without accompanying statistics have similarly not distinguished between tests resulting in a \u201cmatch\u201d and those resulting in a failure to exclude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>188 Ariz. 129, 132 (1997); <em>Sholler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>969 S.W.2d 706, 710 (Ky. 1998); <em>People </em>v. <em>Watley, </em>245 A.D.2d 323 (N.Y. 1997).

Other courts have found nonexclusion results admissible where the defendant did not object on the ground that such results were irrelevant or confusing without accompanying statistics. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>502 F.3d 931, 969-970 (9th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 2902 (2008); <em>State </em>v. <em>Edelman, </em>593 N.W.2d 419, 424-425 (S.D. 1999). Still other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>courts have held that trial judges did not abuse their discretion by admitting nonexclusion results without statistics where experts from both the State and the defense agreed that population-frequency statistical information \u201cwas not usually calculated for mixed samples.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>State, </em>924 So. 2d 737, 763-766 (Ala.

Statistical analysis was provided as to the first series of tests, and the \u201csecond series of tests produced similar results [i.e., could not exclude the defendant], but frequency calculations were not performed because\u201d in those tests \u201ca primary contributor\u201d to the mixed samples \u201ccould not be identified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In his objection to the admission of the DNA evidence, the defendant in that case did not argue that it was error to admit in evidence nonexclusion results from the second series of tests because those results were unaccompanied by statistics. See <em>id. </em>at 263. We need not decide whether it would be error to admit the result that a second test could not exclude an individual as a potential contributor to a sample without accompanying statistics, where statistical testimony is presented accompanying the result of a first test of the same sample and the second test \u201cproduced similar results.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The Commonwealth argues that requiring the presentation of statistical analysis as an accompaniment to testimony that DNA test results could not exclude an individual as a potential source \u201ccould prove highly damaging to defendants as a class,\u201d given advancements in technology allowing results short of a complete \u201cmatch\u201d nevertheless to be strongly discriminating among potential contributors. There is nothing in the record to support the claim, and our own precedents reveal that not all DNA tests result in extremely low random match probabilities. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Laughlin, </em>446 Mass. 188, 197 (2006) (\u201cone in two of any randomly selected individuals\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaynor, supra </em>at 250 (\u201cone in 490 African-Americans\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNickles, </em>434 Mass. 839, 851 (2001) (\u201cone out of eighty-three Hispanics\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b871-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s expert in this case distinguished between nonexclusion and inconclusive results, using the term \u201cinconclusive\u201d the same way the term was used in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>450 Mass. 858, 864 (2008). See note 22, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Some confusion may have been caused by our use of the term \u201cinconclusive\u201d in, for example, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Laughlin, supra </em>at 208, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>382 Mass. 210, 221 (1981). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Laughlin, supra, </em>we referred to the nature of the DNA test results that showed a random match probability of one in two as \u201cinconclusive.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, supra, </em>we referred to evidence that both the defendant and the victim had type O blood as \u201cinconclusive\u201d because \u201ca large segment of the world population\u201d shared that characteristic. In both cases it would have been preferable to describe those results as not excluding the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, </em>452 Mass. 236, 254 (2008), we held that \u201cfor inconclusive DNA evidence to be admissible, it must be probative of an issue of consequence in the case.\u201d In this case, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert testified that there was insufficient DNA from the minor profile contributor in the sample from the defendant\u2019s sweatpants, and thus, \u201cthe minor profile in the DNA mixture yielded inconclusive results for comparison with\u201d the defendant. The defendant did not object to this testimony and does not challenge it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b872-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNickles, supra, </em>the Commonwealth\u2019s expert testified that tests showed that the contributor to DNA taken from swabs from a rape victim was homozygous at a particular allele site (i.e., that each of the contributor\u2019s two alleles at that site were identical). See <em>id. </em>at 851. The defendant challenged the reliability of the underlying technology and the reliability of the results because the sample size was too small. See <em>id. </em>at 849. The defendant also presented an expert who testified that the test did not show that the contributor was homozygous, but who agreed that the test showed that \u201cat least one of the contributor\u2019s alleles at that site was a 4.2/3, and that the defendant therefore could not be excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 852. We concluded that the test results were relevant and admissible, even if the defense expert\u2019s view were accepted, because \u201cthe test still provided descriptive information about the perpetrator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 854.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The prosecutor encouraged the jury to look at the charts showing the non-exclusion results, which were in evidence, and to \u201csee how those numbers line up.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b874-8\">As the defendant points out, while there was uncontroverted evidence that the defendant had been outside the apartment immediately before the attack, there was also uncontroverted evidence that at least two housing authority employees were in the vicinity, one of whom had a master key and both of whom had criminal records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The Commonwealth argues that there can be no prejudice because the defendant \u201chas avoided every opportunity to bring to light what the relevant statistics would or might be,\u201d and thus this court may infer that any such statistics would be \u201chighly unfavorable\u201d to him, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. 766, 775 n.8 (2009). That case is inapposite. The issue here is whether any relevance of the nonexclusion DNA evidence was outweighed by the likelihood of prejudicially misleading and confusing the jury in the absence of a statistical explanation of the meaning of the test results. That burden falls to the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Francisco Roman was convicted in Puerto Rico of murder in the second degree in 1995.
