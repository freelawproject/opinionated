Represented by new counsel, the defendant appeals from his convictions and from the order of a Superior Court judge denying his motion for a new trial. On appeal, the defendant argues that (1) his trial counsel was burdened by an actual conflict of interest due to his ongoing representation on an unrelated matter of a witness testifying for the prosecution;</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">(2) separate and apart from the conflict of interest, defense counsel\u2019s representation at trial was so woefully inadequate as to deprive the defendant of his right to effective assistance of counsel; (3) a witness\u2019s reference in testimony to the defendant\u2019s incarceration unfairly prejudiced the jury; and (4) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument improperly invited the jury to convict the defendant without finding that he was the shooter. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions and find no basis on which to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\"><em>The evidence at trial. </em>We summarize the facts the jury could have found from the evidence at trial, reserving certain details for our analysis of the issues raised on appeal. On the morning of December 22, 1998, David \u201cShorty\u201d Tokarz (victim) was found dead in his West Brookfield home. When discovered, he lay on the floor, in rigor mortis, clothed in only a towel, having suffered three gunshot wounds. He had been shot twice through the towel: once in the hip and once in the abdomen. The entry and exit wounds from these two shots indicated that the bullets had traveled in a downward path through the victim\u2019s body as he stood and faced his assailant. The third gunshot wound was to his head, inflicted as the victim lay on the floor, wounded and bleeding from the first two shots; the barrel of the pistol was inside the victim\u2019s ear when the final shot was fired. An old, rusty, and inoperable shotgun lay just inside the door to the house, at the bottom of a set of stairs, and a splintered chunk of its wooden stock lay on the floor nearby. Because the victim\u2019s girl friend, Annette Broberg, testified that she had telephoned the victim at his home and spoken with him between 9:30 and 10 p.m. on December 21, and had telephoned him again between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>11:30 p.m. and midnight, but received no answer, the victim likely was killed at some time between the two telephone calls.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The key witnesses for the prosecution were James Osipov and Neil Potter, who each had been charged as an accessory before the fact to the victim\u2019s murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both testified at the defendant\u2019s trial despite these pending charges. There was no evidence that any promises, rewards, or inducements had been offered or provided in return for their testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">At the time of the murder, the defendant lived with Craig Bosse and Bosse\u2019s girl friend, Kimberly Martelli, at Martelli\u2019s home on South Street in Barre. Osipov testified that he was at the South Street residence in the early evening of December 21, drinking alcohol with the defendant and Bosse until about 7:30 p.m., when he went home. A short time later, the defendant telephoned him, and he returned to the South Street home, picked up the defendant, and drove him to Potter\u2019s home, which was approximately five minutes away. Both Osipov and Potter testified that, at the defendant\u2019s request, Potter gave the defendant a plastic bag containing a loaded .38 caliber revolver as well as a pair of \u201cmotorcycle\u201d gloves.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The defendant and Osipov then returned to Osipov\u2019s house. The defendant asked Osipov to inspect the revolver to ensure it was functioning properly, stating that it was best not to take \u201ca broken sword into battle.\u201d Osipov put on the gloves that Potter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>had given the defendant, inspected the firearm in the driveway of his home, and returned the firearm and gloves to the defendant, informing him that the firearm looked operational.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Osipov then lent his old, beaten-up truck to the defendant. He testified that he had an idea what was happening and wanted nothing to do with it. The defendant drove the truck away, leaving Osipov at home, but returned in the vehicle approximately forty-five minutes later, with the only functional muffler on the truck ripped off, the tailpipe dragging, and the undercarriage scratched. The defendant told Osipov to take care of the dragging tailpipe, which Osipov did by wiring it up with a coat hanger. The defendant then left again in the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">He returned one hour later.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On his return, the defendant told Osipov that \u201cthe deed is done.\u201d The defendant explained that he had gone to see the victim, that the victim had come at him with a rifle, and that he had shot the victim twice in the chest. The defendant told Osipov that he had then bent down over the victim, told him, \u201cSee what that bitch did to you,\u201d and fired a bullet in the victim\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Osipov then assisted the defendant in concealing evidence of the crime. Osipov took the clothes and sneakers the defendant had been wearing, doused them with gasoline, and burned them in a back yard cooking pit, and he provided the defendant with cut-off sweatpants and a sweatshirt to wear in their place.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He also helped the defendant wash his hands with turpentine to remove any residue that might have been left on him from firing the gun. Osipov asked the defendant what he had done with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the firearm, and the defendant told him \u201c[n]ot to worry about it. It was gone.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Osipov then took his brother\u2019s truck and drove the defendant to the South Street residence, a distance of only a few hundred yards, where the defendant changed into clothes of his own.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Following the defendant\u2019s directions, Osipov drove him to Worcester and dropped him off by a dirt road near an airport in Worcester. The defendant instructed Osipov to get rid of the tires on the truck the defendant had driven.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On December 22, Osipov sold the truck to a scrap yard for $35.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The defendant then walked to the residence of Roger LaPlante, who lived in a secluded home off a dirt road near the Worcester airport, arriving around 11 p.m. The defendant told LaPlante that he and Bosse had had an argument and asked if he could spend the night. The defendant slept on a couch in LaPlante\u2019s living room on the nights of December 21 and December' 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">On the evening of December 23, the defendant told a friend at a bar that the police were looking for him, that something bad had happened, and that the friend might not see him for a while. The defendant said that he was going to talk to the police and that it would be better for the friend if he knew nothing about what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The defendant slept at another friend\u2019s home in Rutland on the nights of December 23 and 24. On Christmas morning, that friend drove the defendant to downtown Worcester.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On the morning of December 29, the defendant voluntarily appeared at the State police barracks in Holden to give a statement to police. The defendant told police that he had just learned of the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>death the previous evening when he had called Bosse to ask for a ride home from Worcester; he said that Bosse had told him that \u201cthe cops think you did it.\u201d He denied killing the victim. He told police that the victim was \u201ca good guy\u201d who \u201cneeded to come up with major league cash lately.\u201d He said that one morning during the first week of December, the victim had come with his dog to the defendant\u2019s home and demanded $3,500 that the defendant owed him. According to the defendant, \u201che was bullshit; he was talking to the dog.\u201d When the defendant told him he did not have the money, the victim told him to ask Bosse to sell his motorcycle and give the defendant the money from the sale. The defendant said he told the victim \u201cto go home and get some sleep.\u201d The defendant offered the opinion that the victim was killed because \u201che owed somebody a lot of money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">In his statement, the defendant told police that on the night of December 21, he had spent part of the evening drinking with Bosse, Osipov, and Martelli at his home, and at some point departed with Osipov. He said that he was not sure if he and Osipov had gone to Osipov\u2019s house, but that he knew they had driven to Worcester in Osipov\u2019s red pickup truck, describing the older, dilapidated truck that Osipov had disposed of at the scrap yard. He said he had arrived at the home of his friend, Roger, in Worcester around 10 p.m.; he could not recall Roger\u2019s last name. He explained that \u201cme and [Bosse] get on each other\u2019s nerves now, around Christmas. I just needed to get out of there.\u201d The defendant offered to take a polygraph test. At the end of the interview, the defendant told police that he had been wearing (and had not washed) the clothes he had on since the morning of December 21, and he invited the police to take the clothes into custody, which they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">After taking his statement, police drove the defendant to his South Street residence. On December 31, following additional investigation, they returned to the residence and arrested the defendant for the victim\u2019s murder. As they escorted him from the house, the defendant put his finger to his lips and cautioned Bosse, \u201cRemember, silence is golden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The defense called one witness and presented the jury with two \u201cdemonstrations.\u201d The witness was the keeper of the records of the Hubbardston highway department, where Neil Potter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>was employed in December, 1998. Potter had testified that, on the evening of December 21, 1998, he had been called in to sand the roads from 10 p.m. until 1 a.m. on December 22. The keeper testified that the records reflected that Potter was called in to work at 10:15 p.m. on December 22, not December 21. The records reflected that Potter did not work on the evening of December 21; nor was there any record of a storm that would have triggered the need to sand the roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">In the first demonstration, the defendant attempted to place himself behind the wheel of Osipov\u2019s truck to show that he could not fit because of his girth, and therefore could not have driven Osipov\u2019s truck to and from the scene of the killing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At the demonstration, the jury saw the defendant attempt, but fail, to put himself behind the wheel of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">In the second demonstration, the defendant briefly left the court room, changed into the trousers he had been wearing during his interview with the State police on December 29, 1998, and returned to allow the jury to observe him. The purpose of the demonstration was to allow jurors to evaluate whether he had gained or lost weight in the fourteen months since the time of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\"><em>Motion for a new trial. </em>The defendant, represented by new counsel, moved for a new trial on September 28, 2006, based on the same grounds he now raises on appeal. The motion judge, who was not the trial judge,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> conducted an evidentiary hearing on April 23 and 24, 2008, in which the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, Theodore Harris, and Bosse testified. The judge denied the motion on August 31, 2008, in a memorandum of decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">We summarize the relevant facts as found by the judge, supplemented with undisputed evidence from the record. Harris was appointed to represent the defendant on January 4, 1999, and represented him during pretrial proceedings, trial, and post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>trial proceedings until February 7, 2001. The indictments against the defendant were returned on March 5, 1999. On June 3, 1999, Harris entered an appearance on behalf of Bosse in Worcester District Court, where three months earlier, Bosse had been charged with four misdemeanor offenses unrelated to the charges pending against the defendant. Bosse had asked Harris to represent him after the defendant had told Harris that his friend had a legal problem and that he was going to refer him to Harris. At a court hearing on December 14, 1999, all the charges against Bosse were continued without a finding for sixty days, until February 4, 2000. Bosse was placed on administrative probation during that period and required to return to court with a donation of $500 worth of children\u2019s toys.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Harris charged Bosse $1,500 for his services, which Bosse paid in full before the December 14, 1999, court appearance.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We accept as true the subsidiary findings of fact made by the motion judge absent clear error, deferring to the credibility findings of the judge, who had the opportunity to observe and evaluate the witnesses as they testified. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>433 Mass. 654, 656 (2001), and cases cited. We find no clear error in those findings. We make our own independent determination on the judge\u2019s application of the law to the facts as found. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 550 (1977), <em>S.C., </em>398 Mass. 806 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">1. <em>Actual conflict of interest. </em>The defendant argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial, in violation of State and Federal constitutional guarantees, because his counsel was burdened by an actual or genuine conflict of interest arising from his representation of Bosse. The defendant contends that, on February 1, 2000, when Bosse was called by the prosecution to testify in Mosher\u2019s murder trial, Harris\u2019s representation of Bosse had not concluded because the period of Bosse\u2019s administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>probation had three more days to run before the charges against him could be dismissed under the terms of the continuance without a finding. Consequently, the defendant asserts, Harris had a continuing obligation to Bosse that compromised his ability to provide \u201cuntrammeled and unimpaired assistance of counsel free of any conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>376 Mass. 777, 780-781 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">\u201cUnder the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Commonwealth, criminal defendants have a right to the assistance of counsel unimpaired by loyalties to other clients.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fogarty, </em>419 Mass. 456, 458 (1995). See <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 75 (1942). Under Federal constitutional law, a defendant is entitled to a new trial if he establishes that his attorney had an actual conflict of interest and that this conflict \u201cadversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 350 (1980). However, under art. 12, if a defendant establishes an actual conflict of interest, he is entitled to a new trial without a further showing; he need not demonstrate that the conflict adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance or resulted in actual prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. 16, 20 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>386 Mass. 165, 169-170 (1982). We require no further showing because, when an attorney has an actual conflict of interest, the effect of the conflict on the attorney\u2019s representation of the defendant is likely to be pervasive and unpredictable, while the difficulty of proving it may be substantial, \u201cparticularly as to things that may have been left not said or not done by counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hodge, supra </em>at 170, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>379 Mass. 456, 461, vacated sub nom. <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>449 U.S. 809 (1980), appeal dismissed, 382 Mass. 690 (1981). Where the defendant\u2019s counsel has labored under an actual or genuine conflict, therefore, we are unwilling to put a defendant \u201cto the burden, perhaps insuperable, of probing the resolve and the possible mental conflict of counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">An actual or genuine conflict of interest, however, must be one in which prejudice is \u201cinherent in the situation,\u201d such that no impartial observer could reasonably conclude that the attorney is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>able to serve the defendant with undivided loyalty.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Epsom, </em>399 Mass. 254, 262 (1987). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, supra </em>at 20; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, supra </em>at 782 (actual conflict of interest when counsel is \u201cshackled or impaired by commitments to persons other than the defendant\u201d). We have typically found that an actual conflict exists \u201cwhere an attorney represents codefendants with inconsistent or contradictory lines of defense; where an attorney or an associate maintains an attorney-client or direct and close personal relationship with a material prosecution witness; or where an attorney has business reasons for preferring a verdict unfavorable to the defendant he or she represents.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>396 Mass. 549, 554-555 (1986). The burden rests with the defendant to prove an actual conflict of interest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soffen, </em>377 Mass. 433, 437 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Where, as here, the defendant claims an actual conflict arising from his attorney\u2019s representation of a prosecution witness, we have found an actual conflict only where (1) at the time of trial, the defense attorney continued to represent a prosecution witness who furnished material testimony concerning a critical issue in the case against the defendant; or (2) the defense attorney had previously represented a prosecution witness in a matter related to the defendant\u2019s criminal case who furnished material testimony concerning a critical issue in the case against the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, supra </em>at 555-556, and cases cited. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>425 Mass. 382, 392 (1997) (actual conflict where defense counsel engaged in ongoing representation of key prosecution witness at time of trial on unrelated criminal matters), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>362 Mass. 782, 783-784 (1973) (no actual conflict resulted from previously terminated representation of key prosecution witness on unrelated matter). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geraway, </em>364 Mass. 168, 183 (1973) (Tauro, C.J., and Braucher, J., dissenting) (\u201cit should be noted that in all those cases where courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>found that defence counsel\u2019s prior representation of prosecution witnesses in \u2018unrelated\u2019 civil or criminal cases has resulted in a conflict of interest, there were <em>special circumstances, </em>such as the prosecution witness being the victim of the crime for which the defendant was charged, that indicated that the prior cases involving defence counsel <em>were not in fact </em>unrelated to the defendant\u2019s criminal trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Here, the second alternative does not apply because the criminal matters on which Harris represented Bosse had no relation to the criminal charges against the defendant. As to the first alternative, there is no dispute that Bosse was a prosecution witness who furnished material testimony concerning critical issues in the defendant\u2019s case. The question of actual conflict, then, rests on a single issue: whether Harris continued to represent Bosse when he testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">We conclude that Harris\u2019s representation of Bosse ended on December 14, 1999, more than one month before the defendant\u2019s trial commenced, when Bosse admitted to sufficient facts for a finding of guilt and the District Court judge issued an order continuing his case without a finding for sixty days. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18. The defendant argues that, because Bosse\u2019s criminal charges were continued without a finding at the December hearing, his case remained technically \u201copen\u201d or \u201cin suspense\u201d when Bosse testified on February 1, 2000, in the defendant\u2019s trial. Therefore, the defendant contends, Harris\u2019s professional obligation to Bosse continued at least until February 4, 2000, when Bosse\u2019s period of administrative probation was scheduled to conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument confuses a continuance without a finding, which constitutes a criminal disposition under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, with a continuance under Mass. R. Crim. P. 10, 378 Mass. 861 (1979). A rule 10 continuance postpones a criminal proceeding, which necessarily leaves the pending charges unresolved. In contrast, when a judge resolves a criminal charge by ordering a continuance without a finding, the judge does not suspend the process of adjudication; rather, the judge resolves the underlying criminal charge and makes a \u201cdisposition.\u201d See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18 (defendant may make \u201cdispositional request that a guilty finding not be entered, but rather the case be continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>without a finding to a specific date thereupon to be dismissed, such continuance conditioned upon compliance with specific terms and conditions or that the defendant be placed on probation\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>453 Mass. 320, 324 (2009) (G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, establishes statutory procedure \u201cfor the disposition of criminal cases by means of a [continuance without a finding], the imposition of conditions, and dismissal\u201d). See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 539 (9th ed. 2009) (\u201cdisposition\u201d is \u201cfinal settlement or determination\u201d). A rule 10 continuance admittedly shares a term with a continuance without a finding, but there the resemblance ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">A continuance without a finding closely resembles a sentence of straight probation, except that the former is not a \u201cconviction\u201d under State law if the defendant successfully completes the period of probation or complies with the terms and conditions set by a judge. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Villalobos, </em>437 Mass. 797, 802 (2002) (admission to sufficient facts followed by continuance without a finding not \u201cconviction\u201d under Massachusetts law), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>454 Mass. 559, 566 (2009) (probation constitutes disposition of and punishment for crime). Both constitute dispositions that resolve the underlying criminal case. In both, in the absence of special circumstances, the defense attorney\u2019s work is completed once the disposition is obtained. While under either disposition a defendant may be sentenced to jail or prison if he should commit a new crime or otherwise violate a condition of probation during the probationary term, the attorney is not obliged to continue the representation simply for the purpose of advising the defendant to obey the law and comply with all applicable conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Because Harris\u2019s attorney-client relationship with Bosse ended when the court disposed of the charges against Bosse by ordering a continuance without a finding under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, Harris no longer represented Bosse when Bosse testified on February 1, and no actual conflict of interest arose in the course of his representation of the defendant at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>425 Mass. 382, 388-389 (1997) (termination of conflicting representation prior to defendant\u2019s trial will ordinarily \u201cobviat[e] the risk of simultaneous representation\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>362 Mass. 782, 783 (1973) (no actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>conflict when attorney\u2019s representation of prosecution witness ended one day before trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">2. <em>Potential conflict of interest. </em>Where no actual or genuine conflict exists, an attorney\u2019s personal interests or obligations may still give rise to a \u201cpotential\u201d conflict of interest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soffen, </em>377 Mass. 433, 437 (1979) (potential conflict of interest is one where \u201ca more tenuous conflict appears\u201d). Because the range of interests and obligations that might conceivably give rise to a potential conflict is unlimited, the defendant carries a special burden \u201cto prove, without mere conjecture or speculation, both the existence and the precise character of the alleged conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>434 Mass. 670, 694 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soffen, supra </em>at 438. A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel due to a potential conflict of interest will be entitled to a new trial only if he can establish \u201cmaterial prejudice\u201d to his defense resulting from the alleged conflict. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. 16, 20 (1986). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>379 Mass. 456, 459 (1980), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The defendant argues that Harris\u2019s prior representation of Bosse compromised his representation of the defendant at trial because, due either to a residual sense of loyalty to Bosse or to his fear of eliciting evidence that might have jeopardized Bosse\u2019s administrative probation, or both, Harris refrained from introducing evidence that would have implicated Bosse in the victim\u2019s murder and, more broadly, from impeaching Bosse\u2019s credibility when he testified as a witness for the Commonwealth. Specifically, the defendant contends that a reasonable attorney not constrained by any commitment to Bosse would have offered evidence showing that, at the time of his death, the victim owed $60,000 to the Vigilante motorcycle club (motorcycle club). Bosse belonged to the motorcycle club and had once served as its sergeant-at-arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">A lawyer free of any conflict to Bosse, however, would have recognized at least three formidable problems with pursuing this line of defense. First, the record does not reveal and the defendant has not identified any witness who would have offered admissible evidence of such a debt. The police reports reflected that, after the victim\u2019s death, two members of the motorcycle club told an acquaintance of Annette Broberg that the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>had owed them $60,000 and they expected Broberg to pay the money now that the victim was dead. This information was classic hearsay; the police never confirmed from the supposed declarants that such a debt existed. We have given wide latitude to the admission of relevant evidence that a person other than the defendant may have committed the crime charged, and have permitted hearsay evidence of a third-party culprit that does not fall within a hearsay exception when, \u201cin the judge\u2019s discretion, \u2018the evidence is otherwise relevant, will not tend to prejudice or confuse the jury, and there are other \u201csubstantial connecting links\u201d to the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. 782, 801 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>441 Mass. 291, 305 (2004). Under this standard, it is doubtful that the judge would have admitted this hearsay evidence had it been offered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Second, even if the judge would have admitted this hearsay evidence, there is no reason to believe that it would have helped the defendant; it might well have hurt him. The defendant lived with Bosse and also was linked to the motorcycle club, albeit not as closely as Bosse. In the home they shared at South Street, the police found motorcycle garb associated with the club, including clothing bearing Nazi insignias, which Harris believed to be so prejudicial to the defendant that he successfully moved in limine to prevent reference to these items at trial. The admission of hearsay evidence regarding the debt purportedly owed by the victim to the motorcycle club would have opened the door to admission of the photographs depicting these items and to an examination of the defendant\u2019s connection to the club. Moreover, any suggestion that Bosse was responsible for the killing had little to support it. There was no evidence that Bosse had left his South Street home on the evening of the defendant\u2019s murder. Osipov and Potter, and their respective brothers, all testified that the defendant, not Bosse, had visited their homes on the night of the murder. Consequently, if Harris had pointed an accusing finger at the motorcycle club with the intention of implicating Bosse, the effect would have been to implicate the defendant. In fact, introduction of the alleged debt would have provided a stronger motive for the defendant to have killed the victim than the prosecution had established. A tactical decision by counsel not to introduce evidence that is as likely to be inculpatory as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>exculpatory will not support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>431 Mass. 108, 121, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 864 (2000).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Third, any effort to point to the motorcycle club and to Bosse as the culprits would have undercut Harris\u2019s argument that Osipov and Potter were the true killers, because there was no evidence that Osipov or Potter had any affiliation with the motorcycle club or that they had provided a firearm, transportation, or clothing to Bosse to assist him in committing the murder. Harris had compelling reasons to point to Osipov and Potter, rather than Bosse, as the true culprits. They had already admitted to substantial involvement in the murder, and there were numerous inconsistencies in their version of events that he seized on to suggest that they, and not the defendant, were responsible for the killing.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, Harris needed to attack their credibility, as they provided the only evidence directly tying the defendant to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Just as Harris had legitimate, tactical reasons to point an accusing finger at Osipov and Potter, he had legitimate, tactical reasons to refrain from attacking Bosse as a witness. At trial, Bosse was friendly to the defense and hostile to the prosecution. He met with Harris prior to trial but refused to meet with the prosecutor, and he acknowledged at the hearing on the motion for new trial that he was interested in helping the defendant if he could. Bosse\u2019s direct examination did not materially hurt the defendant. The most incriminating testimony he offered was that the victim had come to the South Street house a \u201ccouple of weeks before Christmas,\u201d trying to collect $3,200 from the defendant, and the defendant had responded by telling the victim to go home and get some sleep, and then slamming the door in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>his face. The defendant said nearly the same in his statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Harris\u2019s cross-examination of Bosse, however, elicited considerable evidence valuable to the defendant\u2019s defense: that the defendant had denied killing the victim; that Osipov, not the defendant, routinely used the phrase, \u201cThe deed is done\u201d; that Bosse asked the defendant to give Osipov a key to the South Street house (which allowed Harris to suggest that Osipov had planted Osipov\u2019s clothing in the defendant\u2019s residence prior to execution of the search warrant); that the defendant could not fit in the driver\u2019s seat of Osipov\u2019s truck and therefore could not have driven it on the night of the murder; that Osipov carried two handguns in two shoulder holsters at all times (one of which was a .38 caliber pistol, which was consistent with the murder weapon); and that it was not unusual for the defendant to leave their South Street house for weeks at a time, which diminished the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the defendant\u2019s flight indicated his consciousness of guilt. If Harris, as the defendant now suggests, had attempted to impeach Bosse\u2019s credibility on the witness stand, he would have undercut this valuable testimony. In short, Harris had sound reasons, unrelated to the prior representation, to decline to pursue a defense strategy that would have depended either on implicating Bosse in the murder, directly or through his association with the motorcycle club, or on attacking his credibility as a witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>432 Mass. 767, <em>777 </em>(2000) (no prejudice when defense counsel declined to impeach witness he had previously represented when testimony \u201cattempted to minimize\u201d guilt of defendant and was \u201cclearly helpful\u201d to defense). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>390 Mass. 103, 108 (1983) (no prejudice from declining to call witness defense counsel simultaneously represented on unrelated matters when witness was \u201clikely to be counterproductive\u201d rather than helpful to defendant). If Harris still felt \u201cany lingering sense of loyalty\u201d toward Bosse from the prior representation, it did not result in prejudice to Mosher at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>3. <em>Other claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant argues that, apart from any prejudice resulting from the conflict of interest he has alleged, Harris\u2019s representation of the defendant at trial fell so far below the standard of an ordinarily fallible lawyer that the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. We examine the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, which is more favorable to a defendant than the Federal or State constitutional standards. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>433 Mass. 185, 187 (2001). We therefore review the record to determine whether there was a serious failure by trial counsel and, if so, whether the failure resulted in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harbin, </em>435 Mass. 654, 656 (2002). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass 678, 682 (1992) (error created substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice if error was \u201clikely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion\u201d). In doing so, however, we give trial counsel\u2019s tactical decisions due deference. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harbin, supra. </em>Many decisions of defense counsel that are characterized in hindsight as errors may have been reasonable tactical or strategic decisions when made: decisions questioned on appeal \u201cdo not amount to ineffective assistance unless \u2018manifestly unreasonable\u2019 when undertaken\u201d at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boateng, </em>438 Mass. 498, 509 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>435 Mass. 113, 133-134 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Apart from the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel he attributes to Harris\u2019s conflict of interest, the defendant argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel by Harris\u2019s failure to pursue two potential lines of inquiry that would have supported the over-all defense strategy of implicating parties other than the defendant in the killing of the victim. First, the defendant complains that in his cross-examination of Annette Broberg, the victim\u2019s girl friend, Harris did not inquire about statements she made indicating that \u201ctwo dark skinned males\u201d had been responsible for the killing. John Tokarz, the brother of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the victim, told police investigators that Broberg had told him that she was present at the time of the killing and had seen the assailants before they blindfolded her. When questioned by police about this version of events, however, Broberg denied ever having made this statement. She told the police that she had not been present at the victim\u2019s home on the night of the killing and that, when she had spoken to John Tokarz about \u201ctwo brown skinned men,\u201d she was only repeating a story that Bosse had passed on to her. The weakness of this evidence is clear from Broberg\u2019s unwillingness to stand by the story John Tokarz had attributed to her. Moreover, even if Harris could have found a means of introducing the possibility that two unknown, \u201cdark-skinned\u201d assailants might have been responsible for the killing, the effort invested in supporting this insubstantial alternative would have undermined his primary strategy of focusing on Osipov and Potter as the two likeliest culprits. For these reasons, we cannot say that Harris\u2019s decision to forgo this line of questioning was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boateng, supra </em>at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Second, the defendant argues that Harris committed a serious failure in representation by not calling Meghan Martone, who would have testified that Osipov had once offered to kill her boss. Martone had reported to the defendant\u2019s investigator that, in the fall of 1998, after hearing her complaints about her boss, Osipov had offered, \u201cIf you want anyone taken out, let me know, and I can knock them off for you.\u201d Although Martone subsequently refused to give the investigator a formal statement, Harris had caused a subpoena to be served to secure her appearance at trial. However, when Harris informed the court of Martone\u2019s anticipated testimony, the prosecutor objected to its admission, and the court sustained the objection. The defendant does not challenge this ruling on appeal, perhaps because the judge plainly did not abuse his discretion in refusing to admit this prior bad act evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graziano, </em>368 Mass. 325, 329-330 (1975) (while defendant may introduce evidence tending to show that crime was committed by another, \u201cevidence should not be too remote in time or too weak in probative quality, and it should be closely related to the facts of the case against the defendant\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>In sum, considering together all the alleged failures by trial counsel, including the potential conflict, we find that Harris\u2019s representation of the defendant at trial did not result in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">4. <em>Testimony that the defendant was in jail at the time of trial. </em>The defendant claims that he was prejudiced when, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s question whether the defendant \u201cstill work[ed]\u201d at a tractor cab manufacturing plant, Bosse answered, \u201cYeah. Well, he is in jail now.\u201d Aware of the potential implications of the question, the judge immediately directed the prosecutor to proceed to his next question, which he did. There was no motion to strike the testimony, nor did the judge provide the jury with a cautionary instruction. The defendant claims that, because the jury learned from Bosse that the defendant was in custody, he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">It can be inferred from the record that the court reporter heard Bosse say that the defendant \u201cis in jail now,\u201d but the judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel did not. At a sidebar later during Bosse\u2019s direct examination, the judge said that Bosse had come \u201cdangerously close to making a reference to [the defendant] being in jail,\u201d and asked the prosecutor if he had admonished the witness to refrain from such remarks. He then added that, if it came out, \u201cwe are probably going for a mistrial.\u201d The prosecutor said he would do whatever he could to avoid that outcome. Neither the prosecutor nor the defense counsel informed the judge that the reference had already been made. Because the record supports the conclusion that neither the judge, the prosecutor, nor defense counsel heard Bosse\u2019s remark that the defendant was \u201cin jail,\u201d we can infer that the jury did not hear it either.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Even if the jury did learn that the defendant was in custody, however, the information would still not result in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. We generally do not want a jury to learn of a defendant\u2019s pretrial custody and certainly do not want the jury to focus on it. See <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>425 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>U.S. 501, 504-505 (1976). Yet, we do not find that Bosse\u2019s single remark that the defendant was \u201cin jail\u201d at the time of the trial, even if heard by the jury, resulted in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. When a defendant has been indicted for murder in the first degree, especially when, as here, the defendant is alleged to have shot the victim in the head at close range and then could not be found for more than one week, learning that the defendant is held in custody pending trial is not likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">5. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>Finally, the defendant argues that in his closing argument the prosecutor impermissibly invited the jury to convict the defendant on a theory of joint venture liability that was not alleged in the indictment and not supported by the evidence at trial. The defendant bases his argument on two portions of the prosecutor\u2019s argument, neither of which triggered an objection, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">\u201cSo is the argument now to you that, well, not only did Osipov actually put it in the ear, well, [Potter] must have helped him. [Potter] must have been there, too. If they did, did they do it on their own for purposes that [haven\u2019t] been produced by any of these witnesses? Or is it that they did it because this defendant wanted it done? I mean is that what you are going to conclude? That is not your evidence, though. But it is interesting the control this defendant had over a number of these people. Seemed to be controlled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Then, twenty-two pages later in the trial transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-8\">\u201cSo, Osipov was there and did it, or was with this man [the defendant] when it was done, or this man did do what Osipov says. Those three are the options, okay. Osipov was there and did it himself, [the defendant] was there with Osipov when it happened, or [the defendant] did it and came back and told Osipov what he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s remarks are not a model of lucidity, and extracting them from their context does not enhance their clarity. Still, we think it unfair to construe them as introducing an argument that the defendant did not himself shoot the victim, but aided and abetted Osipov or Potter (or both). We understand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>first passage, taken in context, to ridicule Harris\u2019s argument to the jury that Osipov had actually committed the murder, possibly with the assistance of Potter. The prosecutor lays out Harris\u2019s theory only to dismiss it: \u201cThat is not your evidence, though.\u201d We understand the second passage to set forth the prosecutor\u2019s explanation of the three alternatives to which the jury were logically limited in explaining how Osipov knew the details of the killing. Nothing in the prosecutor\u2019s argument encourages the jury to find the first two possibilities (\u201cOsipov was there and did it\u201d or \u201cwas with this man [the defendant] when it was done\u201d). Rather, the gist of his argument is that, based on the evidence, the jury reasonably must conclude that only the third possibility described what had actually happened: \u201c[The defendant] did it and came back and told Osipov what he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Two isolated passages of uncertain significance in an extended closing argument do not, without more, create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. \u201cWe analyze the remarks \u2018in light of the entire argument, as well as in light of the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury and the evidence at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Mello, 420 Mass. 375, 380 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marguetty, </em>416 Mass. 445, 450 (1993). Here, the judge gave no joint venture instruction to the jury in his charge, and he specifically excluded such an option when he instructed them that they must acquit the defendant \u201cunless you also are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the person who committed the acts comprising the elements of the crimes of which he is accused.\u201d Considering the totality of the circumstances, the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument did not result in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">6. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>In addition to considering the defendant\u2019s specific claims on appeal, we have reviewed the entire record pursuant to our duty under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We discern no error, considered alone or in conjunction with the defendant\u2019s claims of error, that produced a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.
