L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62H (MEPA). A Superior Court judge allowed CCF\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint because it was not filed timely; judgment entered dismissing the complaint against all defendants. The town appealed. Because we conclude that the judge did not err in determining that the town\u2019s complaint was not timely under the pertinent provisions of G.

At issue here is a provision in the second paragraph of \u00a7 62H, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>provides that, for a \u201cprivate project,\u201d an \u201caction . . . alleging that a [FEIR] fails to comply with [MEPA] shall commence no later than thirty days following the first issuance of a permit\u201d (time limitation). Although \u00a7 62H permits a challenge to a FEIR, \u201c[n]either [it] nor the Secretary\u2019s regulations confer jurisdiction on the Superior Court. Section 62H . . . simply provides, with respect to actions over which a court has jurisdiction from another source, that such actions must be commenced within a certain period following specified events. It is essentially a statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, supra </em>at 613. Jurisdiction is conferred by G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A, third par., which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">\u201cThe superior court for the county in which damage to the environment is occurring or is about to occur may, upon a civil action in which equitable or declaratory relief is sought ... by any political subdivision of the commonwealth, determine whether such damage is occurring or is about to occur . . . provided, however, that the damage . . . constitutes a violation of a statute, ordinance, bylaw or regulation the major purpose of which is to prevent or minimize damage to the environment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">See <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, supra </em>at 614; G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62H, first par. (time for filing notice of intention to commence action overrides time limits set forth in G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A). However, no action challenging a FEIR may be commenced unless the party files a notice of intent. G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62H, first par.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\"><em>Facts and background. </em>We summarize the essential, undisputed facts, as found by the judge in her written memorandum of decision and order. CCF proposed a mixed-use development project (project) located in Westwood, on the boundary with the town. One of the primary means of accessing the project site is Dedham Street, which runs through the town. The town\u2019s concern is that the use of Dedham Street, including its use through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>potential construction of an exit ramp from Interstate Route 95, would increase traffic on the surrounding roads and bridges.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Pursuant to its statutory obligation, in January and September, 2007, CCF submitted, respectively, a draft EIR and a FEIR for its project. The town commented on both EIRs concerning traffic. See G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62C, second par.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">On November 1,2007, the Secretary issued a certificate pursuant to G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62C, that stated that CCF\u2019s FEIR complied with MEPA and the related regulations. The certificate set forth conditions that CCF had to meet in order to pursue the project, including acquisition of certain permits and specific traffic mitigation for Dedham Street. At least two of the permits CCF was required to obtain were from the Massachusetts Highway Department (highway department). On November 21, 2007, pursuant to G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62H, first par., the town filed a written notice of its intent to commence an action for judicial review of the certification. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>The town cited traffic concerns as the ground for the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">In January, 2008, a sewer connection permit was granted to CCF by the Department of Environmental Protection, G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 61, but it did not publish notice of this permit or notify the town directly. Despite the notice of its intention to file suit, the town did not file an action in response to this permit. The town states that it does not object to this particular permit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">On or about September 25, 2008, the highway department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>issued a \u00a7 61 finding concerning traffic and related impacts on the environment that was based on the certification of CCF\u2019s FEIR, and was favorable to CCF. G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 61, first par. In response, the town filed a complaint on October 24, 2008, seeking judicial review of the certification of the FEIR and of the highway department\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">CCF filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the thirty-day time limitation for the town to commence an action began running in January, 2008, after the sewer permit issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The town sets forth several arguments to support its contention that, where there is a private project, the statute\u2019s thirty-day time limitation on commencing an action concerning the adequacy of the FEIR certificate does not begin to run until a permit has been issued that pertains to the specific concern of the party challenging the certification. Accordingly, the town argues, because it had identified traffic as a concern when it filed its notice of intent to commence an action, the time limitation did not begin to run until the highway department issued its \u00a7 61 finding concerning traffic. Therefore, the town contends, the judge erred in dismissing its complaint. The town also argues that, should we conclude that it was required to commence an action within thirty days of the issuance of the sewer permit, we should nevertheless conclude that the time limit was tolled because there was no public notice of the permit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">\u201cWe interpret a statute according to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court for the County of Worcester, </em>446 Mass. 123, 124 (2006). Legislative intent is gleaned from the language of the statute. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983). \u201c[A] statute is to be construed as written, in keeping with its plain meaning.\u201d <em>eVineyard Retail Sales-Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>450 Mass. 825, 831 (2008), quoting <em>Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>v. <em>Urstadt Biddle Props., Inc., </em>433 Mass. 285, 289 (2001). Statutory language \u201cis not to be enlarged or limited by construction unless its object and plain meaning require it.\u201d <em>Rambert </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>389 Mass. 771, 773 (1983). Moreover, \u201cwhere the Legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court for the County of Worcester, supra </em>at 126, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>439 Mass. 826, 833 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The town argues that the judge\u2019s interpretation of the statutory provision is inconsistent with MEPA\u2019s scheme which, it contends, is based on two principles, notice and specificity. Certainly, there are parts of MEPA requiring specificity and notice. However, the issue for analysis here is the plain language of the time limitation in \u00a7 62H, second par., concerning a private project\u2019s FEER, a provision that lacks a specific notice requirement. The town\u2019s argument fails because, as the judge noted, the town does not offer \u201cany theory as to how its reading might be reconciled with the plain language of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Here, the statutory provision states that to challenge the FEER of a private project, an action must be commenced \u201cno later than thirty days following the first issuance of a permit.\u201d We conclude that the words \u201cfirst issuance of a permit\u201d refer, at the very least, to the issuance of the first permit issued from those listed in the FEIR as required. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>The town\u2019s contention that the referenced \u201cfirst . . . permit\u201d means the first permit issued that pertains to a party\u2019s specific concern, would require adding words to the statutory language. We decline to do so where \u201cits object and plain meaning\u201d do not require it. <em>Rambert </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Our interpretation of this provision is consistent with the purpose of the 1977 amendments to MEPA (including the addition of \u00a7 62H), which is to reduce \u201cthe potential unfairness and social and economic loss that may result from the delay inherent in litigation.\u201d <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>432 Mass. 132, 140 (2000), quoting <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>402 Mass. 611, 617 (1988). See St. 1977, c. 947 (purpose is \u201cto immediately expedite environmental approvals\u201d). We are not persuaded by the town\u2019s argument that the Legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>purpose was to expedite environmental approvals, but not to expedite litigation. We agree with the Commissioner of the highway department (commissioner) that allowing litigation to delay the approvals is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s express purpose of expediting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The cases on which the town relies are easily distinguished. As the judge stated, and the town concedes, in neither case was the meaning of timeliness under \u00a7 62H at issue. See <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Mgt., </em>439 Mass. 738 (2003); <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">We also reject the town\u2019s argument that if it commenced an action before any environmental harm specific to the town occurred, it would lack standing to sue. Under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>third par., a municipality may bring an action, alleging that \u201cdamage to the environment is occurring or is about to occur\u201d and \u201cthat the damage . . . constitutes a violation of [an environmental] statute [or] regulation.\u201d See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>364 Mass. 639, 645 (1974) (under former G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 10A, city\u2019s standing \u201cexpressly established\u201d). See also <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, supra </em>at 614 (stating that repealed G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 10A, is predecessor of \u00a7 7A, and \u201clike it in all material respects\u201d). Thus, under the express terms of \u00a7 7A, third par., standing does not require a specific injury to the town, but an injury or potential injury to the environment. Further, under MEPA, a municipality would be able to maintain an action against the \u201cagency or authority or private person proposing a project, and not the [Secretary], as \u2018the person causing or about to cause\u2019 environmental damage.\u201d <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Envtl. Affairs, supra </em>at 616, citing <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Hazardous Waste Facility Site Safety Council, </em>392 Mass. 107, 118 (1984). Here, the town could have commenced an action against, at the very least, CCF.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">We also disagree with the town\u2019s contention that it would have been premature for it to file suit after the sewer permit was issued because environmental harm specific to traffic was not \u201cabout to occur\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7A. Reading \u00a7 7A, third par., and \u00a7 62H, second par., together and considering MEPA\u2019s purpose of expediting environmental approvals, we conclude that the logical interpretation is that the \u201cfirst issuance of a permit\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 62H, second par., marks the time when alleged environmental harm is \u201cabout to occur\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 7A, third par. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>As CCF argues, first issuance of a permit signifies an actual commitment of resources to advance the project to construction, which, in turn, would cause the alleged harm to the environment. Moreover, as the commissioner notes, \u201cGiven the unequivocal statutory deadline of [thirty] days from the first permit, a construction of [\u00a7] 7A that did not allow suit upon the issuance of that same first permit would . . . create a scenario of \u2018it\u2019s not ripe until it\u2019s moot.\u2019 \u201d We construe statutes that relate to the same subject matter as a harmonious whole and avoid absurd results. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336-337 (1982); <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975). See also <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Newton Sch. Custodians Ass\u2019n, Local 454, </em>438 Mass. 739, 751 (2003) (absent explicit command to contrary, statutes are construed as harmonious whole and not so that they undercut each other).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">This reading is consistent with the <em>Cummings </em>case, where the court said that the Superior Court would have jurisdiction under \u00a7 7A because an allegation that a \u201cdeveloper or agency proposing a project failed to comply with the procedural requirement of [MEPA]\u201d would qualify as environmental damage that was \u201cabout to occur.\u201d <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, supra </em>at 614-615, discussing <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., supra </em>at 646-647. Moreover, \u00a7 7A was amended in 1981, after the 1977 amendment to MEPA. See respectively St. 1981, c. 643; St. 1977, c. 947. The 1981 amendment did not change the language of \u00a7 7A relevant here; thus, we presume that the Legislature was aware of \u00a7 62H and of the interpretation given the statute in 1974, in <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., supra.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 580, 582-583 (1994); <em>Andover Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>387 Mass. 229, 240-241 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Two more recent cases also have suggested, albeit in dicta, such an interpretation of the two statutes. In the <em>Enos </em>case, in considering whether the plaintiff property owners had any recourse where they could not maintain a declaratory judgment action against the Secretary\u2019s decision not to require an EIR from the town of Plymouth, the court recited a suggestion made by the Secretary that, under \u00a7 7A, suit could be brought directly against the town. <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>432 Mass. 132, 140, 142 (2000). In <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Mgt., </em>439 Mass. 738 (2003), the court addressed the argument that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge a submitted EIR. The court relied on the <em>Enos </em>case to state \u201c \u2018an action may lie to seek revocation of the approval of the [FEIR] and the submission of a revised report\u2019 after the permit authorizing a project has been approved,\u201d and found that when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>commissioner gave his approval to begin work on a ski lift portion of a project, a permit \u201ceffectively was issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745, quoting <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, supra </em>at 142.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See note 9, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">We also reject the town\u2019s argument that our interpretation of the time limitation on commencing an action would operate solely as a placeholder and make a mockery of the statutory scheme, because the town is already required to file a notice of intent to sue. The Legislature also could have intended such notice to allow negotiations and settlement, because, as the town concedes, the purpose of a notice of intent could be to inform developers about potential concerns. See generally <em>Daveiga </em>v. <em>Boston Pub. Health Comm\u2019n, </em>449 Mass. 434, 439 (2007), citing <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>417 Mass. 718, 721-722 (1994).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The town argues that, in any event, the statute\u2019s time limitation was tolled because it never received notice of the sewer permit. To support its argument, the town states that under the Secretary\u2019s regulations, the project proponent as well as the permitting agency must each file, with the Secretary, a copy of the \u00a7 61 finding and that the Secretary \u201cshall publish notice of . . . the [\u00a7] 61 [finding] in the next Environmental Monitor.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.12(5)(e). As discussed, the Department of Environmental Protection did not file the requisite notice of the \u00a7 61 finding for the sewer permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Although it is true that no permit is supposed to issue before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>an agency makes a \u00a7 61 finding and files it, it does not follow that the filing and publication notice requirement can be grafted onto the provision in \u00a7 62H, second par.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As the judge stated, the plain language of the provision at issue here \u201cmakes no reference to publication or receipt of notice of a permit . . . [or] to a particular type or permit.\u201d Instead, the thirty-day time limitation is tied to the \u201cfirst issuance of a permit.\u201d See <em>eVineyard Retail Sales-Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>450 Mass. 825, 831 (2008) (statute to be construed as written). A literal reading of this provision of \u00a7 62H, second par., is particularly appropriate here given that the provision contains three other deadlines for commencing an action, each of which ties its time limitation to notice.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Clearly where the Legislature wanted notice in \u00a7 62H, second par., it has so provided. See <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, </em>438 Mass. 187, 192 (2002); <em>Tax Collector of N. Reading </em>v. <em>Reading, </em>366 Mass. 438, 443 (1974). \u201cWe do not read into [a] statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there, nor add words that the Legislature had an option to, but chose not to include.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court for the County of Worcester, </em>446 Mass. 123, 126 (2006), citing <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 803 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The town\u2019s argument concerning notice also is undercut by the Secretary\u2019s regulations, which do not tie publication in the Environmental Monitor to an action involving a private project. 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.14(2)(a), second sentence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The judge did not err in concluding that the town had a burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>inquiry. As she stated, the town should have anticipated the issuance of the sewer permit, which was expressly identified in the FEIR, and should have taken \u201csteps to make sure that it would become aware of it promptly, . . . including] properly timed public records requests.\u201d Indeed, CCF and the commissioner identify a number of ways in which the town could have received notice, including requesting, from CCF or the Department of Environmental Protection, a copy of the \u00a7 61 finding that had to precede the issuance of the sewer permit or requesting that the Department of Environmental Protection notify it of the permit itself. See respectively 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.12(5)(e); 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.06(3)(b) (2009).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See generally <em>Cappuccio </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Spencer, </em>398 Mass. 304, 311, 313 (1986) (where statute provided for notice of public hearing and plaintiffs were so notified and attended hearing, no denial of due process to expect plaintiffs subsequently to take notice of pertinent statutory requirements and to make periodic inquiry concerning status of pending action). Cf. <em>Kramer </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Somerville, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 186, 190, 194-195 (2005) (statute required notice to plaintiff who had no other opportunity to receive notice).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the thirty-day limitation for the town to commence an action challenging the certification of the FEIR under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62H, second par., began to run when the Department of Environmental Protection issued the sewer permit. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>We affirm the allowance of CCF\u2019s motion to dismiss and the judgment dismissing the town\u2019s action against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-9\">General Laws c. 30, \u00a7 61, defines \u201cdamage to the environment,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cany destruction, damage or impairment, actual or probable, to any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>the natural resources of the commonwealth and shall include but not be limited to air pollution, water pollution . . .

L. c. 30, \u00a7 62C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b805-9\">In December, 2007, before the sewer permit issued, the Department of Environmental Protection had issued a \u201cbeneficial use determination\u201d permit. This permit was not listed in the FEIR certification as one CCF was required to obtain. The Department of Environmental Protection also did not publish notice or notify the town directly of this permit. The town took no action and does not have an objection to this permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">CCF and the Commissioner (commissioner) of the Massachusetts Highway Department (highway department) argue that we should conclude that the \u201cfirst\u201d permit to which the statute refers is the first permit from among those listed in the FEIR. However, to resolve the issue before us, it is not necessary to address whether, because it was not listed in the FEIR certification, the beneficial use determination permit would have triggered the requisite thirty-day time limitation under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62H, second par. Therefore, we shall refer to the issuance of the sewer permit as the event from which the statute of limitations began to run. See generally G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62 (\u201cpermit\u201d includes \u201capproval or other entitlement for use\u201d); 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.02 (defining \u201c[pjermit\u201d); 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 19.060(1), (5) (2005) (beneficial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>use permits); <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Mgt., </em>439 Mass. 738, 745 (2003) (permit for portion of project \u201ceffectively was issued\u201d when commissioner gave approval for work to begin).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b806-11\">The town conceded that if the statute is interpreted to bar its challenge to the FEIR, then it cannot use the statute to challenge the highway department\u2019s \u00a761 finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">In <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Mgt., </em>439 Mass. 738 (2003), the plaintiffs timely filed suit challenging certification of a supplemental FEIR for expansion of the Wachusett Mountain ski area following the subsequent \u00a7 61 finding and approval for work on ski lifts by the Department of Environmental Management. <em>Id. </em>at 743-744. Before addressing the merits of the appeal, the court considered whether the plaintiffs had standing to sue. The court held that the plaintiffs had standing, but vacated the Superior Court\u2019s judgment and order that the certification and subsequent finding and order lacked record support. <em>Id. </em>at 744-745, 758. The court stated that although it was not required to, it would exercise its discretion to consider another aspect of the project (trails) for which no permit had issued, because it had been fully litigated below and briefed on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 745. The town seizes on the court\u2019s language that it was considering the merits because they \u201cwill be relitigated as other permits are issued if we do not address them now,\u201d <em>id., </em>to argue that the <em>Sierra Club </em>plaintiffs could have waited until after the first permit for trail work was issued to challenge the certification. We agree with the judge\u2019s rejection of the town\u2019s interpretation of this language because \u201cit ignores what actually happened [where] the plaintiff[s] sued within thirty days of the first issuance of a permit,\u201d because it would conflict with the plain language of \u00a7 62H, second par., and because the court\u2019s decision in the <em>Sierra Club </em>case to consider other issues that were raised below had the effect of furthering the statutory goal of expediting the approval process. See <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>432 Mass. 132, 139 (2000) (litigation could delay approval process and frustrate MEPA\u2019s purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">In the <em>Enos </em>case, the issue was whether the plaintiffs had standing to seek a declaratory judgment against the Secretary of Environmental Affairs (Secretary), who had certified a final supplemental EIR. <em>Id. </em>at 133, citing G. L. c. 231 A. No permit had issued in the case and the court held that a direct challenge to the Secretary\u2019s certificate was improper and would cause delay, frustrating the purpose of the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA). <em>Id. </em>at 139 (stating that decision was consistent with <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, 402 </em>Mass. 611, 617 [1988]). Thus, as the judge stated, \u201cNo issue of timeliness was raised or decided in the <em>[Enos] </em>case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">St. 1981, c. 643, amended the eighth paragraph of G.

L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A, are not apt. In <em>Walpole </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Envtl. Affairs, </em>405 Mass. 67, 71-72 (1989), the dismissal of a claim brought under \u00a7 7A did not concern ripeness, and the claim that the court deemed to be premature concerned a request for a declaratory judgment. In <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, supra, </em>the issue before the court was not ripeness but whether an action could be maintained against the Secretary for a determination that a developer did not need to submit an EIR. <em>Id. </em>at 615.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b811-9\">The town\u2019s reliance on <em>Hingham </em>v. <em>Department of Hous. &amp; Community Dev., </em>451 Mass. 501, 505 (2008), to argue that there could be no controversy before the highway department issued its \u00a7 61 finding is misplaced because the <em>Hingham </em>case concerned a declaratory judgment and not G.
