At issue is the meaning of the term \u201csale at retail\u201d in the sales and use tax statutes, G. L. c. 64H and G. L. c. 64I, respectively. The Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) refused to grant the taxpayer, Raytheon Company (Raytheon), an abatement of sales and use taxes relating to certain goods that constituted overhead or indirect cost items purchased by Raytheon in connection with its performance of work on different Federal contracts. Raytheon appealed to the Appellate Tax Board (board), contending that the sales of these indirect cost items to Raytheon fit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>within an exception to the statutory definition of a taxable \u201csale at retail\u201d that applies to sales made for the \u201cpurpose\u201d of \u201cresale in the regular course of business.\u201d G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1. The board rejected Raytheon\u2019s position, and Raytheon appealed. We granted its application for direct appellate review, and we affirm the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On February 20, 2004, Raytheon filed an application with the commissioner seeking an abatement of sales and use taxes on its purchases of certain indirect cost items for the 2001 taxable year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On May 20, 2004, Raytheon made the same abatement request for the 2002 taxable year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Raytheon, which had obtained a direct pay permit from the commissioner on February 1, 2002 \u2014 thereby relieving its vendors from thereafter collecting the sales tax and assuming the direct tax liability itself<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014- claimed that its purchases qualified for the exemption for sales made for the purpose of \u201cresale in the regular course of business\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1. Each abatement request was deemed denied,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Raytheon appealed to the board.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After hearing, the board issued a decision and report affirming the denial of Raytheon\u2019s abatement requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The record before the board included the parties\u2019 statement of agreed facts, stipulated exhibits, and the testimony of four witnesses called by Raytheon. Based on this record, the board found as follows. Raytheon is a corporation organized under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Delaware law with its principal place of business in Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Raytheon was engaged in the business of producing specialized command, control, communication, telecommunication, intelligence, and electronic warfare systems, primarily for sale to the United States government, but also for other purchasers including private companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In connection with its government contracts, Raytheon purchases two types of tangible personal property, direct cost items and indirect cost items. Direct cost items are goods such as semiconductor chips, sheets of metal, and testing equipment that are incorporated directly into the manufacturing of Raytheon\u2019s final products. See 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 9904.418-30(a)(2) (2001) (defining direct cost items as \u201cany cost which is identified specifically with a particular final cost objective\u201d). Direct cost items are not at issue in this appeal. Indirect cost or overhead items are costs \u201cnot directly identified with a single final cost objective, but identified with two or more final cost objectives or with an intermediate cost objective.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 9904.418-30(a)(3) (2001). Raytheon\u2019s indirect cost items include, but are not limited to: cellular telephones and accessories; food and catering services; toilet paper; trash bags; office furnishings; salt and sand for snow removal; a jukebox; latex gloves; paper; printer toner; and promotional items (for example, lapel pins, golf umbrellas, mugs, and key chains). Although not delivered to the Federal government as final products, the indirect cost items are necessary for the completion of Raytheon\u2019s contracts with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Raytheon\u2019s use of indirect cost items on government contracts is governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FARs), which set forth standards for Federal government contracts. See 48 C.F.R. c. 1 (2001). These contracts provide for Raytheon to be reimbursed for both direct costs and indirect costs. As for the latter, the FARs require government contractors to assign all of their indirect cost items to indirect cost pools. The cost pools are then allocated across contracts and billed to each government contractor in the appropriate percentage. With respect to Raytheon, government contracts account for approximately eighty-one per cent of its business, and therefore the Federal government is billed for and reimburses eighty-one per cent of Raytheon\u2019s indirect cost items.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Under the terms of the FARs, title to the indirect cost items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>passes to the Federal government.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, possession of the items remains with Raytheon.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cWe will not modify or reverse a decision of the board if the decision is based on both substantial evidence and a correct application of the law.\u201d <em>Boston Professional Hockey Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>443 Mass. 276, 285 (2005). Although the proper interpretation of a statute is for a court to determine, we recognize the board\u2019s expertise in the administration of tax statutes and give weight to the board\u2019s interpretations. <em>Bell Atl. Mobile of Mass. Corp., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>451 Mass. 280, 283 (2008). See <em>Northeast Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>395 Mass. 207, 213 (1985) (noting court\u2019s \u201ctraditional deference to the expertise of the board in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>tax matters involving interpretation of the laws of the Commonwealth\u201d). See also <em>CFM Buckley/North, LLC </em>v. <em>Assessors of Greenfield, </em>453 Mass. 404, 406 (2009). The board\u2019s expertise is also given weight when mixed questions of fact and law are considered. See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Cambridge, </em>422 Mass. 447, 452 (1996); <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>391 Mass. 630, 632 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In this case, the board was tasked with interpreting specific provisions of G. L. c. 64H and G. L. c. 64I, the Massachusetts sales and use tax statutes. General Laws c. 64H, \u00a7 2, imposes a sales tax \u201cupon sales at retail in the commonwealth, by any vendor, of tangible personal property or of services performed in the commonwealth.\u201d The complementary use tax provides that a tax is \u201cimposed upon the storage, use or other consumption in the commonwealth of tangible personal property or services purchased from any vendor or manufactured, fabricated or assembled from materials acquired either within or outside the commonwealth for storage, use or other consumption within the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 64I, \u00a7 2. Sales that have already been taxed under the sales tax statute, and sales that are exempt from the sales tax, are exempt from any use tax. G. L. c. 64I, \u00a7 7 <em>(a) &amp;(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">To be subject to the sales or use tax, a transaction must generally meet the statutory definitions of both \u201c[sjale\u201d and \u201c[sjale at retail.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The term \u201csale\u201d is defined to include \u201cany transfer of title or possession, or both ... of tangible personal property or the performance of services for a consideration, in any manner or by any means whatsoever.\u201d G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1.A \u201c[sjale at retail\u201d is defined in pertinent part as \u201ca sale of services or tangible personal property or both for any purpose other than resale in the regular course of business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, under the latter definition a sale for the \u201cpurpose\u201d of \u201cresale in the regular course of business\u201d qualifies as an exemption from sales and use taxes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The board concluded that Raytheon did not qualify for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>abatement of the sales and use taxes imposed because the sales of indirect cost items to it qualified as taxable \u201c[s]ale[s] at retail\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1, and G. L. c. 64I, \u00a7 1. In so holding, the board focused on the fact that Raytheon, which had the burden of proving its right to the abatement, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> did not establish that these sales were sales \u201cfor resale in the regular course of business.\u201d Rather, in the board\u2019s view, the indirect cost items purchased by Raytheon were incidental to the performance of its government contracts and \u201cmerely served to facilitate the completion of those contracts.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Raytheon contends that the board\u2019s conclusion is incorrect. Specifically, Raytheon argues that it purchased the indirect cost items at issue because they were necessary to perform Raytheon\u2019s contracts with the Federal government \u2014 a point agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>by the board<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; that pursuant to the contracts and the FARs incorporated into them, Raytheon was required to transfer, and the United States government accepted and reimbursed Raytheon for, title to eighty-one per cent of the indirect cost items allocated to indirect cost pools; and that the \u201cinherent nature\u201d of Raytheon\u2019s business required compliance with the contract terms and the FARs, including their title transfer provisions. Pointing to the statutory definition of \u201csale at retail,\u201d Raytheon argues that each of these transactions qualifies for an exemption because the resale occurred in the ordinary course of Raytheon\u2019s business of performing its contracts with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The argument fails. Raytheon relies entirely on the latter portion of the definition of \u201csale at retail,\u201d that is, whether the resale of the indirect cost items to the Federal government occurred \u201cin the regular course of [its] business.\u201d By doing so, Raytheon ignores the definition\u2019s language that requires assessing the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the original sale. See G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is not enough to ask whether title to the indirect cost items passed in the regular course of Raytheon\u2019s business with the government; the correct inquiry is whether Raytheon purchased the indirect cost items <em>for the purpose of resale </em>in the regular course of its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">As the board recognized, the answer to this question is supplied by previous decisions of this court. In considering whether a particular type of sale by a business qualifies as a sale for the \u201cpurpose [of] resale in the regular course of business\u201d and thus is exempt from sales tax, the court has held consistently that one must look to \u201cthe inherent nature of the business in question.\u201d <em>Clark Franklin Press Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>364 Mass. 598, 602 (1974).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Put slightly differently, it is necessary to consider whether the resale or resales were themselves directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>part of the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s business, or were \u201cincidental to the [taxpayer\u2019s] business, serving to facilitate the consummation of the principal transactions.\u201d <em>Jan Co. Cent., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>405 Mass. 686, 689 (1989).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Prince </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>366 Mass. 470, 473-474 (1974) (amusement park operators subject to sales or use taxes on prizes awarded to game contestants because prizes were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>incidental and merely served to entice contestants to play games). Cf. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Northampton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 726, 729-730 (1985) (plaintiff manufacturer of soft drinks had dominant purpose other than reselling returnable containers, mainly reuse of those containers; for these and other reasons, sale for resale exemption not available to plaintiff).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In this case, the board found that \u201cRaytheon was primarily engaged in the business of producing and selling defense systems.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Given this determination, the board could properly find that the indirect cost items were intended to facilitate Raytheon\u2019s completion of defense systems and were not purchased by Raytheon for the purpose of reselling them to the Federal government in the regular course of its business.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Other State courts have considered the question whether their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>respective sales or use tax statutes apply to a government contractor\u2019s purchases of indirect cost items where title to a portion of the purchases is transferred to the United States government under the terms of contracts and the FARs. See <em>Motorola, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>196 Ariz. 137 (Ct. App. 1999); <em>Aerospace Corp. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, </em>218 Cal. App. 3d 1300 (1990); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Director of Revenue, </em>945 S.W.2d 437 (Mo. 1997); <em>Strayhorn </em>v. <em>Raytheon E-Systems, Inc., </em>101 S.W.3d 558 (Tex. Ct. App. 2003) (Strayhorn). Raytheon argues that in almost all of these cases the court was considering sales and use tax provisions, including a sale for resale exemption, that were very similar if not almost identical to their Massachusetts statutory counterparts. In Raytheon\u2019s view, we should follow the lead of these courts and conclude, as most of them did, that no sales or use tax may be charged because the statutory sale for resale exemption applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We decline to travel down the path that Raytheon lays out for us. Although the statutory provisions discussed in the cited State court cases are indeed very similar to the relevant provisions of the Massachusetts sales and use tax statutes, those decisions do not provide a useful interpretive guide in this instance. See <em>Macy\u2019s East, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>441 Mass. 797, 807 (2004) (law in other jurisdictions could not serve as source for interpreting provision of Massachusetts corporate excise tax scheme and implementing regulation at issue). A review of these decisions reveals that none of the courts has taken the interpretive approach to its State\u2019s sale for resale exemption that this court consistently has taken. That is, none of them has considered \u201cthe inherent nature of the business in question,\u201d <em>Clark Franklin Press Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>364 Mass. at 602, in seeking to determine whether a particular sale or type of sale was for \u201cthe purpose [of] resale in the regular course of business,\u201d or whether a particular sale for resale is merely \u201cincidental\u201d to the taxpayer\u2019s business rather than its central focus. <em>Jan Co. Cent., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>405 Mass. at 690. Thus, in a number of the other States, the courts reached the conclusion that the statutory sale for resale exemption from tax applied based solely on the fact that title of the indirect cost items passed to the Federal government. See <em>Motorola, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>196 Ariz. at 141-145 (in both cost price and fixed price contracts, title to tangible personal property purchased by Motorola and used as overhead passed to government; as result, resale exception applied); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Director of Revenue, </em>945 S.W.2d at 440 (as long as title to property was transferred, plaintiff taxpayer entitled to sale for resale exemption). In this case, there is no question that title to the indirect cost items at issue passed to the United States, but, as the previous discussion reflects, that fact does not end the inquiry.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The case on which Raytheon most heavily relies is <em>Strayhom. </em>As described in the Texas court\u2019s decision, the taxing authority in that case (comptroller) argued in part that Raytheon did not sell or transfer the indirect cost items at issue in the \u201cnormal course of business,\u201d and therefore Raytheon\u2019s purchases were not exempt under the sale for resale exemption. In a brief discussion of the point, the court rejected the comptroller\u2019s position. In particular, the court reasoned that Raytheon\u2019s \u201cnormal course of business\u201d was the performance of its contracts with the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>government. Because Raytheon purchased the indirect cost items to perform those contracts, and title to the items passed to the government in the course of contract performance, Raytheon \u201csold the items to the federal government in the normal course of business.\u201d <em>Strayhorn, </em>101 S.W.3d at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The Texas court\u2019s analysis in <em>Strayhom </em>is essentially the same as that advanced by Raytheon in this case, and we accept it as far as it goes. That is, we accept that Raytheon, in the regular course of performing its contracts with the Federal government, purchases indirect cost items that it uses in its contract performance, and that, by virtue of the contract terms and the FARs, Raytheon transfers title to these items to the government \u2014 which qualifies as a \u201csale\u201d under G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1. But the fact that Raytheon thus \u201csells\u201d items to the Federal government in the regular course of its business does not mean that it purchased these items <em>for the purpose of </em>resale. For the reasons previously discussed, we agree with the board that in this case, the resale of indirect cost items to the United States was incidental to Raytheon\u2019s business, facilitative rather than central to it. <em>Jan Co. Cent., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>405 Mass. at 689-690.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Last, Raytheon argues that if its purchases of indirect cost items for government contracts are subject to Massachusetts sales and use taxes, it will be at a significant competitive disadvantage in comparison with government contractors located in States such as California and Texas, where the courts have held that the purchases are exempt from tax. The argument is speculative.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, if Raytheon believes that its competitive standing as a Federal contractor is being injured by the tax statutes in the Commonwealth, its remedy lies with the Legislature. See, e.g., <em>Joslyn </em>v. <em>Chang, </em>445 Mass. 344, 352 (2005), quoting <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>22 F. Cas. 978, 985 (C.C.D. Me. 1830) (\u201cif there are any inconveniences or hardships growing out of ... a [court\u2019s statutory] construction, it is for the legislature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed on behalf of Raytheon Company (Raytheon) by the Council on State Taxation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\">At all times relevant to this litigation, the applicable sales and use tax in the Commonwealth was five per cent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The total amount of abatement sought for the 2001 and 2002 taxable years was approximately $700,000 in tax, plus interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\">As a general matter, sales taxes are to be collected and paid by the vendor.

Each of these requests was also deemed denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b353-12\">On appeal to the Appellate Tax Board (board) and in this court, Raytheon has not argued that it purchased the indirect cost items at issue as an agent of the United States government, a status that would likely qualify it for the tax exemption available to the United States government. See G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Raytheon has both \u201ccost-plus\u201d and \u201cfixed price\u201d contracts with the Federal government. Cost-plus contracts require the government to reimburse Raytheon for certain costs associated with performance of the contract, plus an additional fee. Fixed price contracts are contracts in which the government pays a set price for the contract. Both types of contracts contain similar title-vesting clauses, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FARs). For example, the regulation relating to fixed price contracts, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201c(1) Title to the property described in this paragraph (d) shall vest in the Government. Vestiture shall be immediately upon the date of this contract, for property acquired or produced before that date.

See 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.245-5 (2001), recodified at 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.245-l(e) (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\">Raytheon explained that in rare circumstances it transfers possession of an indirect cost item, such as when a paper copy of a report or memorandum is sent to the government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Both of these terms are defined in the definitions section of the sales tax statute, G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1. The definitions section of the use tax statute, G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 1, provides that the definitions of these two terms shall have the same meaning as in G.

L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1. Conceptually, however, this exception is the equivalent of a tax exemption for any sale that is \u201cfor [the] purpose [of] resale in the regular course of business,\u201d and we generally refer to it as an exemption in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">See, e.g., <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>439 Mass. 629, 633 (2003) (\u201ctaxpayer has the burden of proving as matter of law its right to an abatement of the tax\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">In its decision, the board appeared to question whether there were any resales at all by Raytheon of the indirect cost items that were sold to it. Raytheon devotes considerable effort in its brief to establishing that resales did in fact occur. We are not convinced that the board reached a conclusion as to whether resales occurred; its decision is unclear on the point. Nevertheless, we agree with Raytheon, as does the commissioner, that there were both sales and resales involved here. The statutory definition of \u201c[s]ale\u201d is satisfied when there is a transfer of \u201ctitle <em>or </em>possession, or\u201d both for consideration (emphasis added). G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1. In this case, it is not disputed that each vendor of the indirect cost items at issue first transferred possession and title of such items to Raytheon for consideration. Each of these transactions between the vendor and Raytheon thus qualifies as the first or original sale. Raytheon then transferred title (but generally not possession) to the United States in accordance with provisions of the FARs and the terms of Raytheon\u2019s contracts with the Federal government. These transfers of title qualified as resales of the same indirect cost items that Raytheon had purchased from the vendors. See <em>In re Am. Pouch Foods, Inc., </em>769 F.2d 1190, 1193-1197 (7th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1082 (1986) (government contract containing title vesting clause is to be read literally, allowing for more than transfer of security interest to government); <em>Northrop Grumman Corp. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>134 Cal.

(AITS), which was in the business of arranging group travel tours for organizations. <em>Id. </em>at 600. Franklin Press printed and sent the travel brochures to AITS, which then distributed them to its customer organizations as a means of interesting the organizations\u2019 members in a particular trip. <em>Id. </em>AITS did not charge a separate fee to its customer organizations for the brochures, but the brochures\u2019 cost was included in the selling price of the entire \u201cservice package\u201d sold by AITS to the organizations. <em>Id. </em>at 600-601. Franklin Press argued that it was entitled to a tax abatement because its sale of the brochures to AITS were not sales at retail, since AITS acquired the brochures from Franklin Press to resell them, as part of its entire travel service package, to its customers. <em>Id. </em>at 601-602. Thus, Franklin Press argued, its sales of the brochures to AITS \u201cwere transfers for resale in the regular course of [AITS\u2019s] business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602. The court rejected the \u201crather simplistic approach\u201d of this argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201cThe mere fact that AITS eventually delivered these brochures to its customers does not establish that it resold the brochures in \u2018the regular course of business.\u2019 That language must find its meaning in the inherent nature of the business in question. AITS is in the business of selling travel services, not brochures. The transfer of brochures constituted only an insignificant part of AITS\u2019s transactions with its customers, and it is obvious that the services provided by AITS were the predominant factor in the charges made to its customers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\">At issue in <em>Jan Co.

Jan Co. argued that its purchases of these products were exempt from taxation because it bought the items for the purpose of reselling them to its customers. <em>Id. </em>at 688. In rejecting Jan Co.\u2019s argument, the court held that the inherent nature of Jan Co.\u2019s business was to provide food and drink to its customers, and the paper and plastic products provided were incidental; they merely facilitated the main goal of the business. <em>Id. </em>at 689-690. As the products were not acquired by Jan Co. for the purpose of resale in the regular course of its business, Jan Co. was subject to taxation under the \u201csale for retail\u201d language. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 692.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\">In <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Northampton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 726 (1985), we suggested that if the taxpayer acquires tangible personal property both for the purpose of resale and for some other purpose, the sale for resale exemption does not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 728-729 (\u201cthe sales here would be [taxable] sales at retail because there was a purpose to the purchase other than resale\u201d). See W.G. Van Dorn &amp; M.S. Allen, Taxation \u00a7 11:10, at 527 (5th ed. 2009). We do not need to consider whether Raytheon had more than one purpose in acquiring the indirect cost items; such an inquiry would be relevant only if we were to find that Raytheon acquired the items for the purpose of resale, which we do not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Raytheon disputes whether this finding by the board is a finding of fact, and, if it is, whether it is based on substantial evidence. Certainly, the determination is based on factual evidence contained in the record, including in particular Raytheon\u2019s 2001 and 2002 annual reports. At the very least, the board\u2019s determination regarding the inherent nature of Raytheon\u2019s business is a mixed question of fact and law that is owed \u201csome deference.\u201d See <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Cambridge, </em>422 Mass. 447, 452 (1996), quoting <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>416 Mass. 540, 555 (1993) (\u201cin reviewing mixed questions of fact and law, the board\u2019s expertise in tax matters must be recognized, and its decisions are due \u2018some deference\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Additional support for the board\u2019s conclusion that Raytheon is not in the business of buying indirect cost items for the purpose of resale to the Federal government can be found in the FARs. Title to overhead property not delivered to or incorporated into the end product vests in the contractor on completion of all obligations due under the contract. See 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.232-16(d)(6) (2001). Therefore, Raytheon retains possession of the indirect cost items and may, in some instances, reacquire title to them. Although title passing back to Raytheon pursuant to this regulation does not change the fact that a resale by Raytheon to the Federal government occurred at the time title vested in the government, it does tend to show that Raytheon\u2019s original purchase of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>indirect cost items was not made for the purpose of that resale. The same regulation on revesting title also supports the view that while the Federal government does acquire title to a contractor\u2019s indirect cost items during the life of a contract, the government\u2019s purpose in doing so is not to acquire permanent ownership of the items but to secure the government\u2019s financial investment in the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Raytheon also cites <em>United Techs. Corp. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>238 Conn. 761 (1996) <em>(Groppo). </em>The terms of the contracts between the plaintiff taxpayers and the Federal government in <em>Groppo </em>appear to be quite different from the terms of Raytheon\u2019s contracts \u2014 at least with respect to indirect cost items, see <em>id. </em>at 765-766 \u2014 which makes comparison of <em>Groppo </em>to this case difficult. It is also worth pointing out that the court\u2019s discussion in <em>Groppo </em>of the Connecticut sale for resale exemption in connection with contract services parallels this court\u2019s statutory interpretation. The Connecticut court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">\u201cThe law concerning sales for resale is clear. The court must look to the intention of the parties to the contract to determine whether the items in a contract are held for resale or were purchased for a different purpose. . . . Where the transaction is only incidental to a service performed for the purchaser, it is not considered a resale for tax purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 775. In applying this test, the court held the services purchased by the plaintiffs in connection with performing their government contracts, including testing, personnel, computer and data processing, stenographic, and engineering services, were incidental to the \u201cprimary purpose of the government contracts,\u201d the development of a fuel cell, and therefore did not qualify for the sale for resale exemption. <em>Id. </em>at 766, <em>777.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Raytheon concedes that under the terms of its government contracts, the government reimburses it for any sales or use taxes it pays for indirect cost items, suggesting that the government is certainly aware that some of its contractors will present it with reimbursable tax liabilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
