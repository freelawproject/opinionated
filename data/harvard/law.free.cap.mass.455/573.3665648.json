In July, 2002, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>commenced an action in the Superior Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, raising numerous challenges to the imposition of certain fees on them and other inmates by the defendant, the sheriff of Bristol County (sheriff), pursuant to an \u201cInmate Financial Responsibility Program\u201d (program).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fees include a five dollar per day \u201ccost of care\u201d fee, as well as fees for a number of services, including medical care, haircuts, and general education development (GED) testing. After various proceedings, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. A Superior Court judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and denied the sheriff\u2019s motion, concluding that the sheriff lacked authority to impose the cost of care fee, the medical care fee, the haircut fee in excess of $1.50, and the GED fee. He ordered the entry of a declaration stating that those fees \u201care invalid and unauthorized by law,\u201d and permanently enjoined the sheriff and his agents \u201cfrom imposing the aforesaid fees.\u201d Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), a separate and final judgment entered consistent with his order and from which the sheriff appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We transferred the case here on our own initiative. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\"><em>Background. </em>The material facts of the case are undisputed. The sheriff implemented the program, which is set forth in a written policy, in July, 2002. By its terms, the program serves \u201cto encourage inmates[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] to be financially responsible,\u201d which will \u201cassist [them] in preparing for their transition back [into the community on release],\u201d and helps to \u201cdefray[] the cost of incarceration, while still maintaining quality programs and services.\u201d As has been stated, under the program the sheriff established and imposed various fees on inmates for their cost of care, medical care, haircut services, and GED testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The cost-of-care component of the program imposes on inmates a charge of five dollars for each day of incarceration \u201cfor administrative services rendered and to assist in defraying the costs of incarceration.\u201d The fee is deducted directly from an inmate\u2019s \u201cInmate Money Account\u201d (IMA).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The fee is not assessed against \u201c[i]ndigent\u201d inmates<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and exempts certain inmates.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Inmates having \u201cinsufficient funds in their IMA to satisfy the [cost-of-care fee] shall have an automatic debit made to their IMA daily, creating a debt owed by the inmate.\u201d Where an outstanding balance exists on an inmate\u2019s IMA, and funds are sent to the inmate, the amount owed is deducted from the funds sent to the inmate. Inmates who are awaiting trial who are later found not guilty or have the charges against them dismissed \u201cshall have the collected fees reimbursed in full by the [sheriff] upon presentation of certified Docket Entries, or other acceptable court document, indicating these dispositions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Another component of the program imposes certain charges for medical care and services, including five dollars for medical appointments, three dollars for pharmaceutical prescriptions, and five dollars for eyeglass prescriptions. The fee for medical appointments applies to \u201c[a]ny medical visit initiated by an inmate/detainee through a written request or unscheduled walk-in performed by [the health services unit] not related to a known chronic disease list problem.\u201d Several exemptions apply, including medical services for admission health screening, emergency care, prenatal care, laboratory and diagnostic care, contagious disease care, and chronic disease care. Medical care fees are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>deducted from an inmate\u2019s IMA. No inmate is to be denied access to medical care due to an inability to pay the applicable fee. Indigent inmates receiving medical services \u201cshall be assessed the applicable co-payment fee, which shall be debited against the [inmate\u2019s IMA] and creating a debt which shall remain due and payable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">There is also a five dollar fee imposed on inmates who request a haircut or beard trim under the program. The fee is deducted from the inmate\u2019s IMA. Indigent inmates are allowed one haircut every month free of charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The last fee challenged under the program pertains to GED testing and provides that \u201c[i]nmates who participate in the [GED] testing program shall be charged $12.50 for registration and the battery of tests required.\u201d The fee is deducted from the inmate\u2019s IMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Pursuant to the \u201cgeneral operational procedures\u201d of the program, if an inmate is released with an outstanding debt balance in his IMA (such as debt incurred from cost of service or health care fees), \u201cthe Canteen Manager System shall freeze the Inmate\u2019s [IMA] and all such outstanding debts shall remain active for a period of two (2) years from the date of release. Should the inmate become incarcerated again within this two (2) year period, all outstanding debts shall become active and the inmate shall be required to pay off these existing debts prior to being allowed to purchase any items.\u201d Inmates have no earned funds while incarcerated, that is, they are not given paid jobs. Inmates without funds in their IMAs are unable to purchase items at the jail commissary, such as personal hygiene products, snacks, candy, and playing cards. Indigent inmates are given a hygiene kit free of charge. The kit contains some basic items such as toothpaste, a toothbmsh, soap, shampoo, and a disposable razor. Since the program\u2019s implementation, the number of indigent inmates has increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>The judge concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to summary judgment on the ground that the sheriff lacked authority to impose the cost of care, medical care, haircut, and GED fees. He did so after thoroughly examining the numerous statutes cited by the parties. We review the entry of summary judgment under well-established standards, to determine whether the successful party has demonstrated that there is no genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. See <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc., </em>441 Mass. 451, 454 (2004); <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">As an initial matter, we reject the sheriff\u2019s suggestion made during oral argument that, because a sheriff holds a constitutional office, a sheriff may carry out all the functions of his office (putting aside the question of what those functions include) without any statutory authority. While the sheriff correctly acknowledges that there is no enumeration of the duties or functions of the office of the sheriff in the Constitution of the Commonwealth, he overlooks that the office of the sheriff is not <em>created by </em>our Constitution. Rather, under our Constitution, as originally established, it was provided that sheriffs in each county were to be appointed by the Governor. Part 2, c. 2, \u00a7 1, art. 9, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. This provision was superseded in 1855 by art. 19 of the Amendments to the Constitution, which states that the Legislature \u201cshall prescribe, by general law, for the election of sheriffs [and other officials].\u201d The constitutional provisions concerning the office of the sheriff do no more than recognize the office and require (currently) an election of sheriffs. Consequently, the duties of the sheriff may be further defined or regulated by the Legislature. Cf. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>240 Mass. 264, 294 (1922); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>117 Mass. 603, 604 (1875). See 1 W.H. Anderson, Sheriffs, Coroners and Constables \u00a7 42 (1941) (Anderson) (\u201cThe powers and duties of a sheriff ... are still the same today as they were at common law, except, insofar as [the office] has been modified by constitutional and statutory provision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The sheriff asserts that his power to impose the challenged fees derives from his common-law duties \u201cto operate and administer\u201d the county correctional facilities. Because the Legislature may not \u201ceffectQ a material change in or a repeal of the common law unless the intent to do so is clearly expressed,\u201d <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Davison Constr. Co., </em>381 Mass. 432, 438 (1980), quoting <em>Pineo </em>v. <em>White, </em>320 Mass. 487, 491 (1946), the sheriff asserts that the judge\u2019s decision (and the resulting judgment) is \u201cderogatory of the common law\u201d and therefore erroneous. The argument lacks support and we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The office of the sheriff is one of considerable antiquity. The origin and earliest duties of the office is set forth in L.E. Hitchcock, Powers and Duties of Sheriffs, Constables, Tax Collectors, and Other Officers in the New England States \u00a7 4 (2d ed. 1904), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">\u201cThe office of Sheriff dates back to the early days of English history. Indeed it is sometimes claimed that it became a part of the government of England from the Roman law. As the people of England came gradually under one government the territory became divided, more or less arbitrarily, into counties; over each of which was placed an Earl, or Alderman; and this Earl, or Alderman, was supposed to be the ruler \u2014 subject of course to the King \u2014 over his county. But this Earl, from the privileges which he possessed and the duties which he was under in reference to his attendance upon the King, gradually ceased to exercise his powers himself, and they were in time delegated to an under-officer, called, in the Roman law, Vicecomes; in the Saxon tongue, Shire-reeve; or in the more modem terms, Sheriff. At first this under-officer, or Sheriff, was to administer the affairs of the county as the representative of the Earl; but in time his duties became more defined, and seem to have been fourfold, \u2014 as a Judge, as a Keeper of the Peace, as a Ministerial Officer, and as the King\u2019s Bailiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">\u201cFirst, as a Judge. He held court and determined causes between parties wherein the value in dispute was not more than forty shillings, and also heard certain other civil causes. He was also the Judge of certain elections, and of the qualifications of voters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201cSecond, as the Keeper of the Peace. Both by common consent and by special commission he became the first man in the county, and superior to all others while he continued in office. He had authority to apprehend persons for the commission of crimes or for breach of the peace, and it was his duty also to defend the county against all enemies of the King, and for this purpose he had power to summon all the people of the county to attend him. This summons every person over fifteen years old and not a peer was bound to obey upon warning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u201cThird, as a Ministerial Officer. He was bound to execute all processes issuing from the King\u2019s courts of justice. In the commencement of civil proceedings he had power to serve the writ, arrest and take bail, and, when the cause came to trial, to summon and return the Jury, and after the judgment to see that the same was carried into effect. In criminal matters, he had authority to arrest and imprison, to return the Jury, to have custody of the delinquent, and to execute the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201cFourth, as the King\u2019s Bailiff. He was required to see that the rights of the King were preserved in his county, or bailiwick.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">With respect to criminal matters, \u201cunder the common law the sheriff was ex officio jailer, and that by virtue of his position as such he was the official custodian and in charge of all prisoners confined therein.\u201d 1 Anderson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">While the sheriff provides support for the proposition that his authority to manage and control county jails derived from common law,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he does not cite to any authority providing that, <em>under common law, </em>sheriffs were permitted to <em>charge fees, </em>which we conclude is a distinct function not subsumed in his custodial duties. To the contrary, it has been recognized that, \u201c[a]s a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>role[,] the powers, duties, rights and responsibilities of a sheriff as jailer are prescribed by statute, and as his powers and duties, rights and liabilities, are thus circumscribed by the legislative enactments of the particular jurisdiction . . . .\u201d1 Anderson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 266. Indeed, in support of his position that, under the common law, he may impose the challenged fees, the sheriff cites only to statutes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, in the absence of any support that imposition of the challenged fees was part of a sheriff\u2019s common-law duty, the extensive collection of historical statutes submitted by the parties has no bearing on the issue before us. Rather, we must examine the <em>current </em>statutory scheme to determine whether the sheriff is authorized to impose the challenged fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Under the current statutory scheme, jails and houses of correction<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> are county correctional institutions; custody and control over jails and houses of correction lie with each county\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>elected sheriff. See G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 16<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>; G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 1; G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 159. Prisons are State correctional institutions; custody and control over State prisons and other State correctional institutions lie with a superintendent \u201c[s]ubject to rules and regulations\u201d established by the Commissioner of Correction (commissioner). G. L. c. 125, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 14. The commissioner is charged with the establishment, maintenance, and administration of all State correctional institutions, and must \u201cestablish and enforce standards for all [Sjtate correctional facilities.\u201d G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>(a), </em>(c). The commissioner is an appointed member of the Commonwealth\u2019s executive branch. Superintendents are appointed by the commissioner. G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In addition to the responsibilities concerning all State correctional institutions, the commissioner has various statutory obligations with respect to <em>county </em>correctional institutions. For instance, the commissioner is charged with preparing an annual report for the Legislature in which he must, among other obligations, state the \u201cactual condition\u201d of the county correctional institutions and provide the number of inmates in each institution. G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 6. The commissioner also must establish \u201cminimum standards for the care and custody of all persons committed to county correctional facilities.\u201d G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 1A. See G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>(d). </em>Before doing so, the commissioner \u201cshall visit, consult with and receive the recommendations of the sheriffs.\u201d G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 1A. The commissioner \u201cshall require from the sheriffs . . . periodic reports on the population, operation and conditions of all county correctional facilities.\u201d <em>Id </em>In addition, the commissioner is required, \u201c[a]t least once each six months [,] . . . [to] inspect each county correctional facility to determine compliance with minimum standards.\u201d G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 1B. Inspection results are to be summarized in the commissioner\u2019s annual report to the Legislature. <em>Id </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>With regard to violations of the minimum standards, the commissioner must give notice of said violations to the sheriff and county commissioners, and afford \u201ca reasonable period of time to remedy\u201d any violation. <em>Id. </em>If compliance is not met within a reasonable time, the commissioner may \u201cpetition the Superior Court in equity ... for an order to close the facility or for other appropriate relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The sheriff contends that, by auditing the program pursuant to the statutory authority under G. L. c. 127, \u00a7\u00a7 1A and 1B, and the regulatory authority concerning budget and fiscal management in county correctional facilities, 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 911.03 (2009),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and by finding the program to be in \u201ccompliance\u201d with the regulations, the commissioner \u201capproved\u201d and \u201cadopt[ed]\u201d the program and the challenged fees therein. This argument ignores the confines of the regulation and the purposes of the commissioner\u2019s inspections or audits. Pursuant to 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 911.03, sheriffs must establish written policies and procedures that comply with accepted accounting procedures \u201cfor the collection, safeguarding and disbursement of monies,\u201d including \u201cinmate funds.\u201d See note 12, <em>supra. </em>The commissioner\u2019s role in the audit of the program is to determine whether those fiscal controls are in place. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 901.02 (2009) (purpose of commissioner\u2019s inspections is to determine compliance with 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 900.00-979.00 [2009]). See also G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 1B (commissioner\u2019s inspections are to determine compliance with \u201cminimum standards\u201d). Neither the regulations nor the statutory provisions authorizing inspections provide an authorization to impose the challenged fees, nor do they address the challenged fees in particular or the sheriff\u2019s authority to impose the challenged fees. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Even if the commissioner were to authorize the challenged fees (in the absence of express regulation), the question implicated here \u2014 whether the sheriff was statutorily authorized to impose the fees \u2014 is a question for the court, not the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">There is no merit to the sheriff\u2019s argument that his imposition of the haircut fee is expressly authorized by statute. With respect to the haircut fee, G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>(r), </em>provides, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u201c[T]he commissioner . . . shall. . . adopt policies and procedures, in consultation with the county sheriffs, establishing reasonable fees for haircuts that are provided to inmates at any county or [Sjtate correctional facility. Except as otherwise provided, the commissioner or county sheriff may charge each inmate a reasonable fee for any haircut provided. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 1 (r), the commissioner established a haircut fee of $1.50 for inmates in State correctional facilities. The sheriff asserts that, where the commissioner had not established a specific haircut fee for county correctional inmates, \u00a7 1 <em>(r) </em>authorized the sheriff to charge a fee greater than the one established by the commissioner for State correctional inmates. In support of his argument, the sheriff relies on the \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided\u201d clause of \u00a7 1 <em>(r). </em>That clause, however, does not authorize the sheriff to establish a haircut fee; rather, it prevents him from charging the already established fee if doing so would conflict with some other statutory provision. Pursuant to the plain language of \u00a7 1 (r), only the commissioner may establish the haircut fees for inmates at both State and county correctional institutions. The commissioner may consult with county sheriffs in establishing the fee, but a sheriff\u2019s role in this regard is merely advisory.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Superior Court judge did not err in concluding that the sheriff lacked authority to impose a haircut fee in excess of $1.50 on county inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Turning to the remaining challenged fees (the cost of care, medical care, and GED fees), the sheriff contends that he is authorized to impose them because nothing in the statutory scheme proscribes them. He also asserts that he may charge these fees pursuant to his broad authority under G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 16, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>to operate and administer the county correctional institutions. We reject these arguments, noting that they ignore the necessary implications of the over-all statutory scheme concerning the fees that may be imposed by sheriffs and the use of inmate funds in county correctional institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">A government agency or officer does not have authority to issue regulations, promulgate rules, or, as in the instant case, create programs that conflict with or exceed the authority of the enabling statutes. <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Med. Sec., </em>412 Mass. 340, 342 (1992). Where the Legislature has fully regulated a subject by statute, a government agency or officer cannot further regulate that subject by establishing a policy inconsistent with the statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 347. By imposing the remaining challenged fees, the sheriff acted in excess of his authority and contrary to the intent of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The Legislature has expressly authorized sheriffs to charge certain fees in the performance of their duties. For example, a sheriff may charge certain enumerated fees relative to serving civil and criminal process. See G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 8. In connection with a sheriff\u2019s service of process function, the Legislature permits a sheriff to \u201ccharge for each copy at [a certain prescribed] rate.\u201d G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 11. In supplementary process proceedings, a sheriff may charge certain fees for copies, travel, and, \u201c[fjor each day\u2019s attendance at court on the examination of a defendant or debtor in his custody, ... [a fee of] five dollars.\u201d G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 14. In addition, the sheriff is allowed a mileage allowance at a specified rate for the costs associated with transporting inmates to or from court, see G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 21, and is allowed \u201chis actual traveling expenses incurred in the performance of his official duties.\u201d G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Concerning inmate funds, the Legislature has specifically authorized sheriffs to deduct victim and witness assessments from the noninterest portion of IMAs (and to spend the interest in such accounts for the general welfare of all inmates). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In connection with work-release programs for committed inmates of county correctional institutions, the Legislature has authorized sheriffs to make certain deductions from the inmate\u2019s earnings. G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 86F. Those earnings, \u201cminus tax and similar deductions,\u201d are first delivered to the sheriff. <em>Id. </em>Then, the sheriff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201cshall deduct from the earnings delivered to him the following: \u2014 First, an amount necessary to satisfy the victim and witness assessment ordered by a court . . . ; second, an amount determined by the sheriff for substantial reimbursement to the county for providing food, lodging and clothing for such inmate; third, the actual and necessary food, travel and other expenses of such inmate when released for employment under the program; fourth, the amount ordered by any court for support of such inmate\u2019s spouse or children; fifth, the amount arrived at with public welfare departments; sixth, sums voluntarily agreed to for family allotments and for personal necessities while confined. Any balance shall be credited to the account of the inmate and shall be paid by him upon his final release.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Where the Legislature expressly authorized the sheriff to charge certain fees and to use inmate funds in particular ways and only in circumscribed circumstances, as is the case here, we conclude that the broad authority to have control and custody of county correctional institutions under G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 16, does not confer authority to the sheriff to impose the challenged fees. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>See <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Hous. Auth., </em>368 Mass. 425, 432 (1975) (statutory expression of one thing is implied exclusion of other things omitted from statute). Had the Legislature intended to authorize the sheriff to impose the challenged fees, it would have said so expressly as it had done with other fees, such as fees for service of process, and as it had done by authorizing particular deductions from inmate funds. Our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donohue, </em>452 Mass. 256 (2008), does not require a contrary result.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, in the absence of specific legislative authority for the challenged fees, they are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">A contrary conclusion would frustrate the Legislature\u2019s intent, as reflected in the statutory scheme, to recoup or offset the costs associated with incarcerating inmates only in circumstances where an inmate is actually earning income in connection with a work-release program. See G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 86F (under work release program, after satisfying victim and witness assessments, sheriff shall deduct \u201can amount determined by the sheriff for substantial reimbursement to the county for providing food, lodging and clothing for such inmate\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It would also, in the case of the GED fee, contravene the clear import of G.

Last, with regard to the fees for medical care,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to adopt the sheriff\u2019s position would render G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>(t), </em>superfluous. See <em>Banushi </em>v. <em>Dorfman, </em>438 Mass. 242, 245 (2002) (\u201cWe do not read a statute so as to render any of its terms meaningless or superfluous\u201d). Under \u00a7 1 (r), the commissioner \u201cshall as part of the rules and regulations on payments for medical services, require the department of correction!] or the <em>county correctional facility </em>to ascertain whether any inmate seeking medical services has health insurance coverage and if said inmate does have health insurance coverage, said health insurance plan <em>shall be </em>billed for any services provided\u201d (emphasis added). In view of this provision and the statutory authorization under G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 (s), afforded only to the commissioner to establish medical care fees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>it is evident that the Legislature intended that billing insurers would be the exclusive manner of seeking reimbursement for medical care given to <em>county </em>inmates. See <em>Habeeb </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Quincy, </em>389 Mass. 634, 640 (1983) (individual statutory provisions related to same subject matter must be read as whole to effectuate consistent legislative program); <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975) (\u201cwhere two or more statutes relate to the same subject matter, they should be construed together so as to constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">We reject the sheriff\u2019s argument that our decision in <em>Ciampi </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>452 Mass. 162 (2008), requires a different result. The plaintiff in <em>Ciampi, </em>a prison inmate, challenged the Department of Correction\u2019s (department\u2019s) regulations and policy that allowed it to withdraw funds from his savings and personal account to satisfy a restitution sanction in a disciplinary action. <em>Id. </em>at 163. Although we concluded that \u201crestitution as a disciplinary sanction is a part of the [commissioner\u2019s] broad grant of statutory authority to maintain prison discipline,\u201d <em>id., </em>the commissioner acted pursuant to a <em>regulation </em>that expressly authorized her action, <em>id. </em>at 165. In determining that the commissioner did not exceed her authority in enacting the challenged regulations, we noted the well-settled principle that a \u201chighly deferential standard of review governs a facial challenge to regulations promulgated by a government agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, quoting <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 771 (2002). We were also guided by the familiar standard that, when the Legislature vests an agency with \u201cbroad authority to effectuate the purposes of an act, \u2018the validity of a regulation promulgated thereunder will be sustained so long as it is \u201creasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Ciampi </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra </em>at 168, quoting <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Med., </em>378 Mass. 519, 524 (1979). We concluded that the challenged regulations and policy were consistent with the commissioner\u2019s broad grant of authority and with the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Ciampi </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra. </em>This case, however, involves an action taken by the sheriff, not the commissioner, and does not involve an action that was expressly authorized by regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Finally, we note that there is no merit to the sheriff\u2019s contention that, concerning the medical care fee, the judge ignored precedent that this fee is authorized.

It appears, however, that his authority did not originally extend to houses of correction. The Colonial Legislature gave the sheriff authority over local jails under c. 9 of the Province Laws (1699-1700) (\u201cIt is enacted . . . [tjhat the sheriff of each several county within this province have the custody, rule, keeping and charge of every of the king\u2019s common goals, prisons and prisoners in the same . . .\u201d). See St. 1783, c. 44 (\u201cthe Sheriff of each county shall have the custody, rule, and charge of the goal or goals therein, and of all the prisoners within such goal or goals\u201d). See generally Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 748-749, 910-911 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \u201cgaol\u201d as term of English origin meaning jail and \u201cgaoler\u201d as jailer). (The parties do not dispute that the term \u201cgaol\u201d refers to \u201cjail.\u201d) In 1846, in circumstances when a jail and house of correction were \u201cunited in one and the same building or establishment,\u201d the sheriff (except in Suffolk County) was given \u201cthe custody, rule and charge\u201d over both facilities. St. 1846, c. 11, \u00a7 1. In 1859, the Legislature provided that, in all counties except Suffolk, \u201cthe jails and houses of correction . . . shall be considered one and the same institution, and the sheriff shall have the custody, rule and charge of the same.\u201d St. 1859, c. 249, \u00a7 1. Prior thereto, at various times, houses of correction had been run by appointed \u201cmasters.\u201d See St. 1836, c. 143, \u00a7 4; St. 1787, c. 54, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\">There is no dispute that, by <em>statutory authorization, </em>sheriffs, at various time, were authorized to charge certain fees. See, e.g., Province Laws 1692-1693, c. 37, \u00a7 1 (authorizing \u201cgaoler\u201d to charge fees \u201c[f]or turning of the key\u201d on commitment and discharge, and \u201c[f]or diet\u201d), \u00a7 2 (prohibiting charge of any fees additional to that prescribed). This statutory authorization, however, has not always been extended to sheriffs. For example, in 1663, the Colonial Legislature authorized the criminal court having jurisdiction over a prisoner, and not a sheriff, to decide whether and how much a prisoner might have to pay for the costs of his \u201cmaintenance.\u201d General Laws and Liberties of the Massachusetts Colony 128 (1672 ed.). Further, there is also no dispute that, by <em>statute, </em>measures were taken, at various times, to prohibit sheriffs from charging and collecting different fees. See, e.g., St. 1859, c. 249, \u00a7 2 (\u201ccounty commissioners . . . establish fixed salaries for all officers, assistants and employees of jails and houses of correction, which shall be the full compensation of said officers, assistants and employees, in lieu of all sums now received by them in their office, for board, turnkey fees, perquisites or otherwise\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Generally, criminal defendants who are charged with a crime are detained in a \u201cjail.\u201d G.
