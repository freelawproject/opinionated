L. c. 278, \u00a7 11A (in subsequent offender proceedings, if defendant pleads not guilty, \u201che shall be entitled to a trial by jury of the issue of conviction of a prior offense\u201d), and trial commenced (before the same judge who presided over the trial on the underlying substantive offenses).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth introduced evidence that, in 1997, the defendant had pleaded guilty to stalking (involving conduct that occurred in 1996). The judge found the defendant guilty of the subsequent offender portion of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The defendant appealed from his convictions, and we granted his application for direct appellate review. Represented by counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>on appeal, the defendant argues (1) that his convictions of violating the 209A order are duplicative of his conviction of criminal harassment; (2) error in the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury; and (3) that he was erroneously deprived of his right to counsel with respect to the trial on the subsequent offender portion of the criminal harassment indictment in violation of his State and Federal constitutional rights and in violation of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A. We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction of criminal harassment and convictions of violating the 209A order. We conclude, however, that the defendant should have been afforded counsel on the subsequent offender portion of the criminal harassment indictment. We therefore vacate that conviction and remand the case for retrial on that portion of the indictment. Because the subsequent offender portion of the criminal harassment indictment pertains only to sentencing enhancement for the substantive offense (criminal harassment), see note 3, supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Maloney, 447 Mass. 577, 591 (2006), and cases cited, we also vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence on that offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Resentencing is to occur following retrial on the subsequent offender portion of the criminal harassment indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts the jury could have found, leaving certain facts for development in the discussion of the issues. For approximately three months in 1989, the defendant dated the victim, Maureen Daly. On January 5, 2004, the defendant went to the school of the victim\u2019s daughter and caused a message, directed to the victim, to be passed to her daughter. Later that day, the victim went to the Tyngsborough police department and inquired about obtaining a 209A order. The next day, January 6, the victim, accompanied by her sister, went to the Lowell Division of the District Court Department and obtained an ex parte temporary 209A order against the defendant. The 209A order set January 20, at 8:30 a.m., for the next hearing and provided that, at the hearing, it would be determined whether the order would be continued or modified. During the afternoon of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>January 6, before service of the 209A order was made on the defendant, he left two telephone messages inquiring about the victim on the victim\u2019s sister\u2019s telephone answering machine. Service of the 209A order was made on the defendant on January 6, at 7:28 p.m., at a motel in Hudson, New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The following day, January 7, the defendant left another telephone message on the victim\u2019s sister\u2019s telephone answering machine concerning the victim. Later that month, on January 20, the victim, again accompanied by her sister, returned to court for an extension of the 209A order. They saw the defendant in front of them in the line to enter the court house, but he did not appear at the hearing and did not respond to being paged. The 209A order was extended for one year. Thereafter, on different dates from February, to July, 2004, the defendant sent five letters to the victim, left a note to the victim tucked inside a newspaper delivered to her, and contacted the victim in the parking lot of her office building. The defendant\u2019s indirect and direct contact with the victim caused her fear and frustration.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Duplicative convictions. </em>We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that his convictions of violating the 209A order are duplicative of his conviction of criminal harassment. As an initial matter, contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the Commonwealth did not predicate the criminal harassment charge on the \u201csame conduct\u201d on which the 209A order violations were predicated. \u201cThe question whether two offenses are \u2018so closely related in fact as to constitute in substance but a single crime\u2019 . . . becomes pertinent in a single criminal proceeding where one crime is a lesser included offense of the other, or where there are multiple counts of the same offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vick, </em>454 Mass. 418, 435 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass. 650, 662-663 (1979). \u201cIn those circumstances, multiple convictions and sentences are permissible only where each conviction is premised on a distinct criminal act, unless the Legislature has explicitly authorized cumulative punishments.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vick, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Here, although the criminal harassment indictment alleged conduct occurring on divers dates from January 5, 2004, through July 10, 2004, the conduct set forth at trial to form the basis of the criminal harassment charge was distinct from that forming the basis of the 209A order violations. The conduct underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>the criminal harassment charge predated service of the 209A order (January 6, at 7:28 p.m.) and violations thereof (and thus technically within the time frame specified in the indictment). Significantly, the criminal harassment conviction was based on the defendant\u2019s act of attempting to make contact with the victim through her daughter on January 5, at the victim\u2019s daughter\u2019s school, and the defendant\u2019s two telephone calls to the victim\u2019s sister on the afternoon of January 6, inquiring about the victim. In contrast to these particular acts, the 209A order violations involved separate incidents that took place after service of the 209A order was made on the defendant, namely a telephone message on January 7; five different letters sent on different dates between February and July, 2004; a note tucked into a delivered newspaper on June 26, 2004; and a visit to the victim in the parking lot at her place of employment in July, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The defendant argues that, because the criminal harassment statute is a lesser included offense of criminal stalking,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and a 209A order violation has been found to be duplicative of a charge of stalking, see <em>Edge </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>451 Mass. 74, 78-79 (2008), he cannot be convicted of both criminal harassment and violating a 209A order. The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Edge, </em>however, is misplaced. In the <em>Edge </em>case we concluded that a defendant could not be prosecuted for stalking in violation of a 209A order in circumstances where the violations of the 209A order that served as the basis of the stalking charge were violations for which the defendant had already been convicted and sentenced. <em>Edge </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 78. These circumstances are not present here. The factual basis of the multiple 209A order viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>tians, as shown above, is separate and distinct from the facts pertaining to and underlying the criminal harassment charge. The <em>Edge </em>case, thus, is inapposite, as the criminal harassment charge was not based on any of the 209A order violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We add that criminal harassment and violation of a 209A order are not the \u201csame offence,\u201d and satisfy the traditional rule in Massachusetts as set forth in <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871), and its progeny, that \u201ca defendant may properly be punished for two crimes arising out of the same course of conduct provided that each crime requires proof of an element that the other does not.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabrera, </em>449 Mass. 825, 827 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>437 Mass. 366, 371 (2002). To establish a violation of G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7, the Commonwealth must prove that \u201c(1) a valid G. L. c. 209A order was entered by a judge and was in effect on the date of the alleged violation; (2) the defendant violated the order; and (3) the defendant had knowledge of the order.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>431 Mass. 401, 403 (2000). Criminal harassment requires the Commonwealth to prove that (1) the defendant engaged in a knowing pattern of conduct or speech, or series of acts, on at least three separate occasions; (2) the defendant intended to target the victim with the harassing conduct or speech, or series of acts, on each occasion; (3) the conduct or speech, or series of acts, were of such a nature that they seriously alarmed the victim; (4) the conduct or speech, or series of acts, were of such a nature that they would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress; and (5) the defendant committed the conduct or speech, or series of acts, \u201cwillfully and maliciously.\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A <em>(a). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>444 Mass. 102, 108 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>444 Mass. 80, 85-90 (2005). Each offense contains elements that the other does not, and therefore the defendant\u2019s convictions pursuant to each statute were not duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">2. <em>Jury instructions. </em>During her instructions concerning the violation of an abuse prevention order, the judge remarked as follows on the element of knowledge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201cAnd the third element that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>knew that the pertinent terms of the order were in effect either by having received a copy of the order or by having learned [of] them in some other way. Service of the initial order places a defendant on constructive notice if not actual notice of the order\u2019s existence and its terms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The defendant objected to this instruction, arguing that the jury be further instructed that the Commonwealth prove that the defendant had knowledge that the 209A order had been extended and had knowledge of the terms of the extended order. The defendant advances this argument on appeal, contending that the judge\u2019s instruction amounted to prejudicial error and impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant. While we suggest that the term \u201cconstructive notice\u201d not be used because it may not be easily understood without further definition, we conclude in this case that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In a prosecution for violation of an abuse prevention order, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant had knowledge of the order. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra </em>at 403. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 591-592 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1058 (1998). Where, as here, there is actual service of an initial order that specifically informed the defendant of a hearing date for extension of that order, the defendant cannot escape being charged with knowledge that the initial order was extended (and the terms of the extended order) merely because he failed to attend the hearing on the extension of the order. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chartier, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 758, 765 (1997). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, supra </em>at 592, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, 369 </em>Mass. 62, 69 (1975) (\u201cThe ex parte order informed the defendant that an extended order might be entered against him if he did not appear at the hearing. This information was sufficient to put the defendant on notice, for \u2018[n]otice of facts which would incite a person of reasonable prudence to an inquiry under similar circumstances is notice of all the facts which a reasonably diligent inquiry would develop\u2019 \u201d). In these circumstances, the judge did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that the defendant \u201c[had] to be made aware of the extended order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">3. <em>Right to counsel on subsequent offender portion of the criminal harassment indictment. </em>The defendant, as has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>noted, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>proceeded pro se at the trial on the substantive offenses. Initially, during some pretrial proceedings, the defendant was represented by counsel. During a lobby conference held on June 19, 2007, the defendant\u2019s second counsel was permitted to withdraw, the defendant signed a written waiver of counsel, and a waiver of counsel colloquy appears to have been conducted. The written waiver of counsel did not reference a subsequent offender indictment or proceeding on the criminal harassment indictment, and the content of any waiver of counsel colloquy is unknown because no transcript appears to exist or has been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Following the guilty verdicts on the substantive offenses and before arraignment on the subsequent offender portion of the criminal harassment indictment, the judge asked the defendant if he wished to have counsel. The defendant first responded that he did not, but then expressed confusion about the proceedings. The judge attempted to return to the issue of counsel, and the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">The judge: \u201cDo you want a lawyer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APL\">The defendant: \u201cWho\u2019s the lawyer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxF\">The judge: \u201cI\u2019m asking you if you want a lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5P\">The defendant: \u201cWhere\u2019s the lawyer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL1\">The judge: \u201cThere\u2019s no one in the court room right at the moment, but do you want a lawyer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZQ\">The defendant: \u201cGo get one so I can come back and talk to him[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] about it, please.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The judge asked the prosecutor for his position, to which the prosecutor remarked, \u201cIf he wishes an attorney, I think we have to accept that.\u201d The judge replied, \u201cOh, I do too.\u201d The defendant then expressed concern about retaining the jury that had just convicted him, expressed confusion concerning how the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>could have found him guilty on the substantive charges, and expressed dissatisfaction with the court. The judge interjected, asking the defendant if he would be ready to proceed later in the afternoon \u201cif we have a lawyer for you?\u201d The defendant replied affirmatively, and a recess was called. When the judge returned, she stated that she had \u201cspoken too soon about counsel,\u201d and that, pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>449 Mass. 392 (2007), the defendant was not entitled to counsel because his waiver of counsel for trial on the substantive offenses amounted to a waiver of counsel for the subsequent offender proceeding as well. The defendant contends that he was erroneously deprived of his right to counsel. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s claim that the defendant clearly did not want appointed counsel is not supported by the record. Although the defendant did not expressly state, \u201cYes, I want a lawyer,\u201d he made it clear that he wanted counsel when he stated, \u201cGo get [a lawyer] so I can come back and talk to him about it, please,\u201d and when he stated that he would be ready to proceed if a lawyer were to be found for him. Our view is supported by the fact that, at the time, both the judge and the prosecutor indicated an understanding that the defendant sought and invoked a right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The Commonwealth contends that the judge correctly ruled that the defendant was not entitled to counsel because he had previously waived his right to counsel when he decided to proceed pro se on the jury trial of the substantive offenses, and that that waiver extends to the subsequent offender proceeding. The Commonwealth further asserts that the judge properly exercised her discretion in denying counsel at the subsequent offender proceeding because a waiver of counsel previously had been executed. We disagree. The record makes clear that the judge\u2019s decision was not an exercise of discretion, but rather was based on her interpretation of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelletier, supra. </em>That interpretation amounted to an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The <em>Pelletier </em>case concerned whether a separate, additional plea colloquy is required in a subsequent offender proceeding under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11A, where a defendant has pleaded guilty to the underlying substantive offense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelletier, supra </em>at 392, 397-398. We concluded that, \u201c[w]here a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>defendant is pleading guilty, we do not read the statute as requiring that a judge conduct an entirely new plea colloquy during the second step of the bifurcated proceeding. The preliminary questioning conducted at the outset of the plea hearing on the underlying offense need not be repeated, so long as the judge makes clear, and the defendant understands, that the preliminary questioning applies equally to the plea on the subsequent offense portion of the charge as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397-398.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Here, the <em>Pelletier </em>decision is not instructive because the defendant was not tendering a plea of guilty to the subsequent offender portion of the criminal harassment indictment but, rather, sought a trial on the merits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Concerning the procedures in these circumstances, the Legislature has set forth the following: \u201c[I]f there is a verdict or finding of guilty after trial, then before sentence is imposed, the defendant shall be further inquired of for a plea of guilty or not guilty to that portion of the complaint or indictment alleging that the crime charged is a second or subsequent offense. . . . [I]f he pleads not guilty thereto, he shall be entitled to a trial by jury of the issue of conviction of a prior offense, <em>subject to all the provisions of law governing criminal tri</em>als'\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A. The only discretion under the statute afforded to the judge in subsequent offender proceedings where a trial takes place is to choose to retain the jury \u201cwhich returned the verdict of guilty\u201d on the underlying substantive offense, rather than empanel \u201ca new jury to try the issue of conviction of one or more prior offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notably, there is no restriction of a right to counsel. See <em>id. </em>Such a right is fundamental, is grounded in the State and Federal Constitutions, and is afforded at every critical stage of the criminal process. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>448 Mass. 452, 465 (2007), quoting <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>339 Mass. 731, 734 (1959) (\u201cthe essential element of fairness in the administration of justice depends\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>on the right to counsel). See also <em>Lavallee </em>v. <em>Justices in the Hampden Superior Court, </em>442 Mass. 228, 234, 235 &amp; n.13 (2004). We conclude that the language of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, providing that a trial on a subsequent offender portion of an indictment be \u201csubject to all the provisions of law governing criminal trials,\u201d necessarily includes a right to counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the defendant requested, but was not afforded, the right to counsel in the subsequent offender proceeding, his conviction of the subsequent offender portion of the criminal harassment indictment cannot stand and must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">At retrial on this portion of the indictment, the defendant shall be afforded counsel if he invokes this statutory right to be represented by counsel. Our conclusion applies only to trials in subsequent offender proceedings. It does not preclude a judge, before the trial on the substantive offenses, from conducting a plea colloquy and obtaining a waiver of counsel from the defendant for both the trial on the substantive offenses and the trial on the subsequent offender portions of the substantive offenses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction of criminal harassment and convictions of violating the 209A order. We vacate the defendant\u2019s conviction on the subsequent offender portion of the criminal harassment indictment and remand the case for retrial on that portion of the indictment. As noted, because the subsequent offender portion of the indictment pertains only to sentencing enhancement on the substantive offense (criminal harassment), we also vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence on that offense. Resentencing is to occur following retrial on the subsequent offender portion of the criminal harassment indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The defendant waived Ms right to counsel and proceeded pro se during the jury trial on these indictments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, a defendant is \u201crequired to be tried . . . first, on the underlying substantive crime and, then, in a separate proceeding, on that component of the charge referring to the crime as a second or subsequent offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>441 Mass. 783, 787-788 (2004). Prior convictions are facts \u201cto be determined . . . beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>445 Mass. 161, 174 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b466-11\">General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 43A <em>(b), </em>provides, in relevant part: \u201cWhoever . . . commits the crime of criminal harassment having previously been convicted of [stalking], shall be pumshed by imprisonment in a house of correction for not more than two and one-half years or by imprisonment in the [S]tote prison for not more than ten years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b466-12\">The defendant again proceeded pro se, but argues on appeal that he was erroneously deprived of Ms right to counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-6\">On the criminal harassment, subsequent offender, conviction, the judge sentenced the defendant to a term of imprisonment from seven to nine years. With regard to the convictions of violating the 209A order, the judge sentenced the defendant to ten years\u2019 probation, running concurrently with each other and from and after his committed sentence. The defendant received 449 days of credit toward his committed sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The criminal harassment statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A (a), in relevant part, reads: <em>\u201c(a) </em>Whoever willfully and maliciously engages in a knowing pattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time directed at a specific person, which seriously alarms that person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress, shall be guilty of the crime of criminal harassment. . . .\u201d We have concluded that the statute criminalizes only three or more incidents of harassment \u201cdirected at a specific person.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>444 Mass. 80, 101 (2005). We have also noted that the statute is \u201cclosely related\u201d to the criminal stalking statute, employing nearly identical language but eliminating the threat requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 88. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 (criminal stalking statute) (containing additional element not present in criminal harassment statute: \u201cmak[ing] a threat with the intent to place the person in imminent fear of death or bodily injury\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Duiing oral argument, the Commonwealth suggested that the reference to \u201chim\u201d meant the prosecutor, and not appointed counsel. The distinction, if any, matters not to our conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Even if the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>449 Mass. 392 (2007), were to apply, without a transcript of the colloquy of the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel on the substantive offenses, it cannot be said that the defendant was informed, and understood, that his waiver of counsel would apply to the subsequent offender proceedings. Also, the defendant\u2019s written waiver of counsel makes no mention of the subsequent offender proceedings. As such, it cannot be said that the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel at the trial of the substantive offenses included a waiver of counsel at the trial of the subsequent offender proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\">We therefore need not decide whether the defendant had a right to counsel based on constitutional provisions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paasche, </em>391 Mass. 18, 21 (1984) (\u201cWe do not decide constitutional questions unless they must necessarily be reached\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\">If the defendant is voluntarily waiving counsel for proceedings on both the substantive offenses and subsequent offender portion of the substantive offenses, a judge must ensure, during the colloquy, that the defendant understands that (1) his waiver of counsel applies to both proceedings; (2) immediately following a guilty finding on the substantive proceedings, the defendant will be separately arraigned and tried on the subsequent offender portion of the indictment; and (3) the subsequent offender proceedings are significant because, if there is a guilty finding, the defendant\u2019s sentence will be enhanced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
