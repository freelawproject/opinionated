(2006), preempts this State law action brought by a retirement plan fiduciary to recover money mistakenly paid to a plan beneficiary. The plaintiff, Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc. (Hitachi), filed an action for unjust enrichment in the Superior Court against its former employee, the defendant Kevin Bowler, for his alleged failure to reimburse $29,315.75 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>retirement benefits that Hitachi had overpaid to Bowler due to an accounting error. Bowler moved to dismiss Hitachi\u2019s action on the ground that the State court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claim. The motion was allowed, and Hitachi appealed. We transferred the case here on our own motion. We conclude that Hitachi\u2019s action is preempted by ERISA, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The relevant facts, which we summarize from the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision, are few and largely undisputed. Bowler was an employee of Hitachi for approximately twenty years. Some years after his employment ended, Bowler contacted Hitachi regarding his accrued retirement benefits. In a letter dated January 9, 2003, Hitachi advised Bowler that his benefits totaled $170,160.40, and that a lump-sum payment for that amount could be \u201crolled over\u201d to an individual retirement account (IRA) of his choice. At Bowler\u2019s request, Hitachi disbursed the funds to an IRA account designated by Bowler.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Approximately four months later, Hitachi informed Bowler that his retirement benefits had been miscalculated and that the correct payment should have been $140,844.65, and asked Bowler to return $29,315.75 to Hitachi. Hitachi additionally informed Bowler that, as the plan fiduciary, it was obligated under ERISA to recover interest on the excess funds at the annual applicable statutory interest rate of 4.98 per cent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Discussions among Hitachi, Bowler, and their representatives, in an attempt to reach a resolution, extended through 2004.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bowler informed Hitachi that he was willing to return the overpaid sum provided that he would not suffer any financial consequences. For example, he offered to return the overpaid funds, with any interest placed in an escrow account to be used to offset any expenses incurred by Bowler arising from Hitachi\u2019s mistake.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hitachi declined to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Bowler whole from any liability that he might incur as a result of Hitachi\u2019s mistake.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In January, 2005, Hitachi commenced this action against Bowler, alleging one count of unjust enrichment and seeking an order that Bowler repay the full amount of the overpayment, together with interest. Bowler filed a counterclaim seeking indemnification for all taxes, penalties, interest, professional fees (accounting and legal), and other damages he had incurred or would incur as a result of Hitachi\u2019s mistake. On the day of trial, Bowler moved to dismiss Hitachi\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that Hitachi\u2019s claim was preempted by ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provisions and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge heard argument on Bowler\u2019s motion, took the motion under advisement, and then held a bench trial on the merits of Hitachi\u2019s claim. In his memorandum of decision and order for judgment, the judge allowed Bowler\u2019s motion to dismiss. He also concluded that, had there been jurisdiction, a remedy of unjust enrichment would not lie under State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We review de nova the judge\u2019s determination that Hitachi\u2019s claim is preempted by ERISA. <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Cas. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 214, 215 (2003), and cases cited. We approach the issue against a well-established backdrop of the breadth of ERISA preemption of State law claims. See <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1987), quoting <em>Alessi </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>451 U.S. 504, 523 (1981) (\u201cexpress pre-emption provisions of ERISA are deliberately expansive and designed to \u2018establish pension plan regulation as exclusively a federal concern\u2019 \u201d); <em>Chestnut-Adams Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bricklayers &amp; Masons Trust Funds of Boston, </em>415 Mass. 87, 91 (1993) (\u201cCongress intended ERISA to preempt State regulation of employee benefit plans as broadly as possible\u201d); <em>Andrews-Clarke </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>984 F. Supp. 49, 57 n.31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>(D. Mass. 1997), quoting Nwogugu vs. KPMG Peat Marwick, No. 97-10282 (D. Mass. June 19, 1997) (comparing ERISA to \u201ca \u2018Pac Man\u2019 that runs around the legal landscape, [somewhat indiscriminately] eating up other claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The ERISA preemption clause provides that, subject to exceptions not relevant here, the statute\u2019s provisions <em>\u201cshall supersede </em>any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter <em>relate to </em>any employee benefit plan\u201d (emphases added). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has said that a law \u201c \u2018relates to\u2019 an employee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 85, 96-97 (1983).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nevertheless, \u201c[s]ame state actions may affect employee benefit plans in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law \u2018relates to\u2019 the plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100 n.21. To determine whether a State law action \u201crelates to\u201d an ERISA plan or is \u201ctoo remote\u201d from it, the Supreme Court has instructed that we \u201cgo beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term, and look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>New York State Conference of Blue </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>514 U.S. 645, 656 (1995). Accordingly, to determine whether Hitachi\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment \u201crelates to\u201d its employee benefit plan and is thus preempted, we first examine Congress\u2019s intent. <em>Pace </em>v. <em>Signal Tech. Corp., </em>417 Mass. 154, 156 (1994). See <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. </em>v. <em>Lueck, </em>471 U.S. 202, 208 (1985) (\u201cthe question whether a certain state action is pre-empted by federal law is one of congressional intent\u201d). We conclude that the claim falls comfortably within the zone of ERISA preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The \u201cbasic thrust\u201d of the preemption clause is to \u201cavoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.\u201d <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., supra </em>at 657. Employers make a commitment to pay certain employee benefits under a regulatory scheme that is as detailed as it is complex. <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Coyne, </em>482 U.S. 1, 9 (1987). Congress recognized that the \u201cmost efficient way\u201d for employers to meet their responsibilities is to \u201cestablish a uniform administrative scheme, which provides a set of standard procedures to guide processing of claims and disbursement of benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A uniform system would be difficult to achieve if a benefit plan were subject to different requirements in each State. <em>Id. </em>An employer could be required, for example, \u201cto keep certain records in some States but not in others; ... to process claims in a certain way in some States but not others; or to comply with certain fiduciary standards in some States but not in others.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">At issue in this case is whether Hitachi, as the plan fiduciary, can or should demand interest from the beneficiary on the overpayment resulting from Hitachi\u2019s mistake; whether Hitachi can or should indemnify the beneficiary for some (or all) tax liability incurred because of the mistaken overpayment; and whether Hitachi can or should pay the costs of lawyers or accountants retained by the beneficiary because of the overpayment. If each State were to decide differently these issues of fiduciary rights and responsibilities, there would be a myriad of State laws resolving overpayment disputes. In short, allowing Hitachi\u2019s action would \u201cpresent the threat of conflicting and inconsistent regulation that would frustrate uniform national administration of ERISA plans.\u201d <em>Danca </em>v. <em>Private Health Care Sys., Inc., </em>185 F.3d 1, 7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>(1st Cir. 1999), citing <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., supra </em>at 656-658.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Hitachi argues that, because it is not necessary to interpret any particular provision of its retirement plan to adjudicate its claim, our resolution of its unjust enrichment action would not create inconsistent and confusing layers of regulation, and its claim is therefore not preempted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Neither we nor other courts have viewed ERISA preemption so narrowly. Rather, we must examine the State cause of action to determine if it \u201cdirectly affect[s] the administration of benefits under the plan\u201d or impacts \u201cwhether any benefits are paid.\u201d <em>Pace </em>v. <em>Signal Tech. Corp., supra </em>at 159, quoting <em>Cuoco </em>v. <em>NYNEX, Inc., </em>722 F. Supp. 884, 887 (D. Mass. 1989). See <em>Industrial Tech. Servs. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Home Life Mut. Ins. Co., </em>866 F. Supp. 48, 50 (D. Mass. 1994). Not all claims concerning retirement plans directly affect the administration of a plan. We have concluded, for example, that a State law action for misrepresentation was not preempted where a beneficiary was falsely told that he was covered by a long-term disability plan. <em>Pace </em>v. <em>Signal Tech. Corp., supra </em>at 158-159. We noted in that case that claims of misrepresentation do not derive from the rights and obligations created in a benefit plan but from promises or fabrications to a beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>at 158, citing <em>Cuoco </em>v. <em>NYNEX, Inc., supra </em>at 886. Hitachi\u2019s action, in contrast, arises from the actual administration of the plan \u2014 for example, whether Hitachi is correct that Bowler <em>must </em>pay interest on the plan\u2019s mistaken overpayment. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Cf. <em>Industrial Tech. Servs. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Home Life Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 51 (activities \u201cat the heart of the administration of the benefit plan\u201d include \u201cerrors in billing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">There is a separate reason to conclude that Hitachi\u2019s claim is preempted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In enacting ERISA, Congress clearly intended to provide a comprehensive remedial scheme that would serve as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the exclusive enforcement mechanism for ERISA disputes. <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 54 (1987). Detailed provisions in the statute \u201cset forth a comprehensive civil enforcement scheme that represents a careful balancing of the need for prompt and fair claims settlement procedures against the public interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54. These carefully integrated civil enforcement provisions \u201cprovide strong evidence that Congress did <em>not </em>intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate expressly\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>473 U.S. 134, 146 (1985). The remedial scheme would be \u201ccompletely undermined\u201d if parties to an ERISA plan were \u201cfree to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in ERISA.\u201d <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dedeaux, supra. </em>Thus, State laws are preempted by ERISA when they serve as \u201calternative enforcement mechanisms\u201d to ERISA\u2019s enforcement regime. See <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., supra </em>at 658, citing <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>498 U.S. 133, 142 (1990); <em>Danca </em>v. <em>Private Health Care Sys., Inc., supra. </em>\u201c[I]f a claim can be brought under ERISA, it must be brought under ERISA.\u201d <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Cas. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 214, 216 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Bowler argues that Hitachi\u2019s attempt to recover the funds it erroneously paid to Bowler could have been brought under ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provisions, specifically 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3)(B), and is therefore preempted as an \u201calternative enforcement mechanism.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That section authorizes civil actions by plan participants, beneficiaries, and fiduciaries \u201cto obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>other appropriate equitable relief.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has, in a trilogy of cases, clarified the scope of the remedial power conferred by \u00a7 1132(a)(3)(B). First, the Court explained that the term \u201cequitable relief\u201d referred only to those categories of relief that were <em>\u201ctypically </em>available in equity,\u201d including \u201cinjunction, mandamus, and restitution\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Mertens </em>v. <em>Hewitt Assocs., </em>508 U.S. 248, 256 (1993). In a subsequent case, the Court explained that not all relief falling under the rubric of \u201crestitution\u201d \u2014 the form of relief at issue here \u2014 was traditionally available in equity. <em>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Knudson, </em>534 U.S. 204, 212 (2002). Equitable restitution, in contrast to restitution at law, the Supreme Court later clarified, seeks \u201cto impose a constructive trust or equitable lien on \u2018particular funds or property in the defendant\u2019s possession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sereboff </em>v. <em>Mid Atl. Med. Servs., Inc., </em>547 U.S. 356, 362 (2006), quoting <em>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Knudson, supra </em>at 213.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Federal courts have recognized that equitable relief, in the form of a constructive trust or an equitable lien, is available under \u00a7 1132(a)(3)(B) to recover an erroneous overpayment. See, e.g., <em>North Am. Coal Corp. Retirement Sav. Plan </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>395 F.3d 916, 917 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 862 (2005) (finding it appropriate for court \u201cto impose a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>constructive trust over the overpaid benefits, permanently enjoin appellants from disposing of or transferring any of the funds still in their possession and control, and require the return of such funds\u201d); <em>Lumenite Control Tech., Inc. </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>252 F. Supp. 2d 700, 703 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (equitable restitution, by either constructive trust or equitable lien, appropriate to recover mistakenly overpaid benefits \u201cwhen money or property belonging to the plaintiff can clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant\u2019s possession\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Hitachi counters that it would be unable to bring a restitution action under \u00a7 1132(a)(3)(B) because Bowler did not obtain the money through any wrongdoing of his own. Relying in particular on <em>FMC Med. Plan </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>122 F.3d 1258, 1261 (9th Cir. 1997), and <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Socia, </em>16 F. Supp. 2d 66 (D. Mass. 1998), and their progeny, Hitachi contends that \u00a7 1132(a)(3)(B) is limited to restitution of \u201cill-gotten plan assets or profits.\u201d <em>Mertens </em>v. <em>Hewitt Assocs., supra </em>at 260.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, since those cases were decided, the law in this area has shifted. In <em>Sereboff </em>v. <em>Mid Atl. Med. Servs., Inc., </em>547 U.S. 356 (2006), the Supreme Court held that a plan fiduciary could bring an equitable restitution action under \u00a7 1132(a)(3)(B) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>enforce a specific provision of the plan where there was no reference to ill-gotten gains. <em>Id. </em>at 362-363.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court, making no mention of the necessity of any showing of actual fraud or wrongdoing, held that the insurance plan had appropriately brought an action for equitable restitution. <em>Id. </em>at 369. See <em>North Am. Coal Corp. Retirement Sav. Plan </em>v. <em>Roth, supra </em>at 917 (affirming imposition of constructive trust under \u00a7 1132[a][3][B] on funds overpaid by retirement plan due to accounting error); <em>Qualchoice, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rowland, </em>367 F.3d 638, 649 (6th Cir. 2003) (plaintiff \u201cnot necessarily required to prove wrongdoing by the defendant in order to obtain relief through imposition of a constructive trust or an equitable lien\u201d because constructive trust is based on property, not wrongs [quotation marks omitted]); <em>Bombardier Aerospace Employee Welfare Benefits Plan </em>v. <em>Ferrer, Poirot &amp; Wansbrough, </em>354 F.3d 348, 360 (5th Cir. 2003) (holding that plaintiff in \u00a7 1132[a][3] action not required \u201cto show that he was the victim of actual fraud or wrongdoing as a prerequisite to obtaining a constructive trust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">It appears likely that Hitachi has a remedy under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3) \u2014 a question for a Federal court to decide. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e). Even if Hitachi cannot bring an action for equitable restitution under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3)(B), Hitachi\u2019s action nevertheless falls within the \u201cscope\u201d of ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provision and is therefore preempted. <em>Danca </em>v. <em>Private Health Care Sys., Inc., </em>185 F.3d 1, 5 n.4 (1st Cir. 1999) (\u201cThe fact that ERISA does not provide the <em>remedy </em>plaintiffs seek is not relevant; all that matters is that the <em>claim </em>be within the scope\u201d of ERISA\u2019s enforcement provision [emphases in original]). See <em>Aetna Health Inc. </em>v. <em>Davila, </em>542 U.S. 200, 209 (2004) (\u201cany state-law cause of action that duplicates, supplements, or supplants the ERISA civil enforcement remedy conflicts with the clear congressional intent to make the ERISA remedy exclusive and is therefore pre-empted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that allowing Hitachi to go forward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>with its unjust enrichment action would present the threat of inconsistent regulation relating to the administration of ERISA plans and would constitute an \u201calternative enforcement mechanism.\u201d Therefore, Hitachi\u2019s action for unjust enrichment \u201crelates to\u201d an ERISA plan, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), and the judge did not err in dismissing this action based on ERISA preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The parties have stipulated that the $170,160.40 payment to Bowler represented an overpayment in the amount of $29,315.75, and that the overpayment was due to a mathematical error made by Hitachi\u2019s actuaries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In communications with Bowler, Hitachi emphasized that it was \u201crequired by law\u201d to ask Bowler to return the overpayment together with interest, explaining that \u201c[t]he Employee Retirement Income Security Act requires us to safeguard the Plan\u2019s assets and protect the interests of <em>all </em>Plan Participants, which may include filing a lawsuit against you in federal court if you do not return the overpayment to the Plan.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Bowler had particular concerns about the tax consequences to him of Hitachi\u2019s mistake, having been informed by his accountant that, because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>overpayment, he had incurred an additional $10,559 in Federal income tax, $1,554 in Massachusetts income tax, and a six per cent yearly excise tax of $1,759.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Counsel for Hitachi proposed that Bowler be indemnified for one year of any excise taxes that would become due, but not for any income tax liability or other expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Prior to trial, the parties had filed cross motions for summary judgment, which a different judge in the Superior Court had denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u201cState law\u201d is defined to include \u201call laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law, of any State.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(c) (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The United States Supreme Court explained that Congress had rejected less expansive preemption language directed at \u201cstate laws relating to the <em>specific subjects </em>covered by ERISA\u201d (emphasis added), <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 85, 98 (1983), and had instead chosen to supplant all State laws that \u201crelate to\u201d ERISA regulated plans.

Not all ERISA actions must be heard in Federal court, and a conclusion that a State law action is preempted does not necessarily equate with exclusive Federal jurisdiction. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e). In this case, Hitachi\u2019s claim, which (as discussed <em>infra) </em>could likely be brought as a claim for equitable restitution under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3)(B), is subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction.

A court of equity could then order a defendant to transfer title (in the case of the constructive trust) or to give a security interest (in the case of the equitable lien) to a plaintiff who was, in the eyes of equity, the true owner. . . .

After the defendant recovered a settlement for the accident from a third party, the plan fiduciary sought to enforce the terms of the plan, which provided that it be reimbursed from the defendant\u2019s third-party recovery for benefits previously paid by the plan. <em>Id. </em>at 1259. The court reasoned that a restitution under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3)(B) was not appropriate relief in part because the defendant did not obtain the plan\u2019s funds by any fraud or wrongdoing. <em>Id. </em>at 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Citing <em>FMC Med.

In that case, the defendant collected long-term disability benefits from her insurance plan. <em>Id. </em>at 67. After obtaining more information about the defendant\u2019s Social Security insurance benefits, the plan determined that it had overpaid her and brought an action for the refund of the overpayment. <em>Id. </em>at 68. Because there was evidence that the defendant had concealed the fact of her Social Security award from the plan, recovery was warranted, but the amount of recovery was limited to the amount of the payments made from the time such wrongdoing began until the plan began to reduce the payments. <em>Id. </em>at 73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">In that case, the insurance plan had covered the cost of the beneficiaries\u2019 medical expenses stemming from an automobile accident. <em>Sereboff </em>v. <em>Mid Atl.
