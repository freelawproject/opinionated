L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, or whether it must first obtain judicial approval, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 17 (a) (2), 378 Mass. 885 (1979), as construed by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jjimpron, </em>441 Mass. 265, 268-271 (2004) <em>(Lampron). </em>We conclude that it must first obtain judicial approval.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>Background. </em>On January 19, 2007, the defendant, then sixteen years of age, was arraigned in the District Court on charges of murder in the first degree and related offenses in the stabbing death of a fellow student at Lincoln-Sudbury High School. He was ordered held without bail in the Department of Youth Services secure unit at the Plymouth County correctional facility (facility). A probable cause hearing was scheduled for March 5, 2007. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 3 (f), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1503 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">On February 9, 2007, the district attorney for the northern district (district attorney or Commonwealth) issued a subpoena duces tecum to the facility\u2019s keeper of records, seeking \u201cany books, papers, visitor log, taped phone calls, and pin list\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the period from January 19 to February 12, 2007.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The subpoena directed the keeper of records to produce the requested materials in person at the March 5 probable cause hearing, or, \u201c[i]n lieu of a court appearance,\u201d to \u201cprovide the requested records prior to\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>March 5. A handwritten note accompanying the subpoena requested the records be mailed to the district attorney\u2019s office. Within a couple of days of receiving the subpoena, the facility\u2019s telephone administrator copied the recordings from the telephone system\u2019s computer hard drive onto a compact disc and mailed it to the district attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">On various dates between February 13 and March 1, 2007, the Commonwealth presented evidence of the stabbing to a grand jury, which indicted the defendant for murder in the first degree on March 1, 2007. Accordingly, the scheduled probable cause hearing in the District Court never took place; on March 14, the Commonwealth entered a nolle prosequi on the charges in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Thereafter, the Commonwealth issued to the keeper of records three more subpoenas \u2014 on April 2, May 14, and July 26, 2007 \u2014 collectively requesting recordings of the defendant\u2019s telephone calls for the period from February 13 to July 31, 2007.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The return dates for two of the three subpoenas coincided, respectively, with a case status conference in the Superior Court (April 30) and a pretrial conference in that court (May 30); the return date for the third subpoena (July 31) was not connected to any court hearing. Each of the three subpoenas (like the February subpoena) stated that the requested materials could be provided before the return date. Within one or two days of receiving each subpoena, the keeper of records mailed compact disc recordings of the requested telephone calls to the district attorney\u2019s office.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to the defendant, the subpoenaed recordings include over 2,000 minutes (33.3 hours) of conversations over a period of 191 days, the \u201cvast majority of which\u201d were between him and his parents and brother; some involved friends. On June 12, 2007, the Commonwealth provided the defendant copies of the recordings obtained through the February, April, and May subpoenas, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (a) (1) (A), as appearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>in 442 Mass. 1518 (2004). As for the recordings obtained through the July subpoena, the Commonwealth provided them to the defendant some time between January and April, 2008. Trial was scheduled for September 15, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In January, 2008, the defendant notified the Commonwealth of his intent to rely on a defense of lack of criminal responsibility because of mental disease or defect. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (b) (2) (A), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1518 (2004). In April, 2008, the defendant, asserting that the Commonwealth had informed him of its intent to search the subpoenaed recordings for evidence of criminal responsibility, moved to suppress the recordings. The defendant claimed that the Commonwealth lacked authority to issue the subpoenas without first obtaining judicial approval pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 17 (a) (2),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as construed by <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. at 268-271 (only judge can issue subpoena for records before trial pursuant to motion by requesting party, supported by affidavit, showing relevance, admissibility, necessity, and specificity).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commonwealth countered that it was empowered to issue the subpoenas on its own, pursuant to G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>c. 277, \u00a7 68,* ***<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that, even were judicial approval required, it would be entitled to such approval.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">At the outset of the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion, the judge (with the parties\u2019 agreement) decided to focus on whether the Commonwealth had erred in failing to comply with the requirements of rule 17 (a) (2) and <em>Lampron </em>because if so, the judge reasoned, the subpoenas would have issued improperly, and thus the judge would not need to address the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims. The judge added that, were he to conclude that the Commonwealth had erred in failing to comply with the requirements of rule 17 and Lampron, it would still be entitled, in a future motion, to seek to satisfy those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">On May 14,2008, following the hearing (at which the facility\u2019s telephone system administrator was the sole witness), the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. He concluded that the Commonwealth had erred in failing to seek prior judicial approval before issuing the subpoenas, and ordered the parties to turn over all copies of the recordings and associated documents to the clerk of the Superior Court, where they would be impounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Subsequently, the Commonwealth moved under rule 17 and <em>Lampron </em>for judicial approval to subpoena a portion of the recordings it had originally sought, namely, recordings of the defendant\u2019s telephone calls from January 19 to March 6, 2007. On May 23, 2008, the judge found the Commonwealth had failed to satisfy the requirements of <em>Lampron </em>and denied the motion. He said, however, that closer to trial he would be willing to revisit the Commonwealth\u2019s attempt to subpoena the telephone calls, further noting that any future attempt by the Commonwealth to subpoena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the recordings would be subject to a possible motion to quash as well as to the defendant\u2019s constitutional challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Thereafter, the Commonwealth filed a petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, in the county court, seeking review by a single justice of the denial of its <em>Lampron </em>motion. Alternatively, it requested leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal from the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). The single justice denied the Commonwealth\u2019s petition (from which the Commonwealth did not appeal),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but granted it leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal from the suppression ruling. We agree with the Superior Court judge that the Commonwealth was required to comply with rule 17 and to obtain prior judicial approval in seeking the defendant\u2019s telephone records from the jail, but we do not agree that suppression of the records is required because of the Commonwealth\u2019s error. The defendant, however, may still pursue the constitutional challenges that the judge deferred.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\"><em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Defendant\u2019s standing. </em>The Commonwealth claims the defendant lacks standing to challenge the issuance of the subpoenas because the subpoenas concern telephone records of a third party, the facility, and because in any event the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his telephone calls. We disagree. Although the recordings are, in a proprietary sense, those of the facility rather than the defendant, the defendant has a direct interest in them because they consist of his own conversations with family and friends.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, the defendant, as a party to this criminal case, has a special concern with ensuring that the Commonwealth abide by the rules of criminal procedure, and the facility cannot reasonably be relied on in these circumstances to vindicate that concern. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>Lam, </em>444 Mass. 224, 228-229 (2005) (Commonwealth had standing to object to defendant\u2019s motion to issue subpoenas to third parties where Commonwealth had interest in ensuring compliance with rule 17 [a] [2]\u2019s prohibition against using rule as discovery device or for fishing expedition, and had interest in protecting its witnesses from harassment by improper discovery requests); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Noriega, </em>764 F.

L. c. 233, \u00a7 1<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>; G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68 (see note 8, <em>supra); </em>and Mass. R. Crim. P. 17, 378 Mass. 885 (1979) (see note 6, <em>supra). See Application of a Grand Jury of N.Y., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 760, 764 (1979). We consider the evolution of those authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The earliest statutory authority for issuing criminal subpoenas \u2014 a precursor to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 1 \u2014 granted such power to justices of the peace. See St. 1783, c. 51, \u00a7 2 (justices of peace \u201cauthorized and impowered to grant subpoenas for witnesses in all criminal causes pending before\u201d various courts). A subsequent version of that statute provided that, unless in connection with a \u201ccomplaint brought before himself,\u201d a justice of the peace could issue a subpoena in a criminal case only at the \u201crequest\u201d of a prosecutor or defendant for \u201cwitnesses to appear at any court ... to give evidence.\u201d St. 1791, c. 53.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Neither prosecutors nor defendants were statutorily required, however, to obtain leave from a justice of the peace, but merely had to \u201crequest\u201d the issuance of a subpoena. The same is true today, under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 1. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>444 Mass. 786, 791-792 n.12 (2005). But neither G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 1, nor its predecessors expressly authorize the issuance of subpoenas <em>in advance of </em>trial or an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Through a recodification of the Massachusetts statutes in 1836, justices of the peace retained their authority to issue subpoenas at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the request of prosecutors and defendants, see R.S. (1836), c. 85, \u00a7 39, but for the first time prosecutors were given independent statutory authority to issue subpoenas under their own signatures. See R.S. (1836), c. 136, \u00a7 25. That statute, substantively identical to its modem incarnation, G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, meant not only that a prosecutor was no longer required to \u201crequest\u201d that a justice of the peace issue a subpoena for a witness or records, but also that, in the context of a grand jury investigation, a prosecutor was not required to obtain prior approval from the grand jury to issue a subpoena. See 1 S.S. Beale, W.C. Bryson, J.E. Felman &amp; M.J. Elston, Grand Jury Law and Practice \u00a7 6:2, at 6-13 (2d ed. 2008) (G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, \u201callow[s] the prosecutor to exercise the subpoena power without the grand jury\u2019s prior approval\u201d). See also Massachusetts Superior Court Criminal Practice Manual \u00a7 1.6.8 (a) (Mass. Continuing Legal Educ. 1999 &amp; Supps. 2003, 2006) (witnesses may be summoned to testify before grand jury by members of grand jury or prosecutor).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As with G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 1, however, G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, which speaks of subpoenas for witnesses \u201cto appear and testify\u201d (see note 8, <em>supra), </em>makes no reference to issuing subpoenas <em>in advance of </em>trial or an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Following the 1836 recodification of our statutes, the next major development in our law of criminal subpoenas came in 1979, with the promulgation of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, 378 Mass. 842 (1979). The Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 17 explain that the mie \u201cis for the most part in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>accord with prior Massachusetts law,\u201d and refer specifically to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 1. Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 17, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1521-1522 (LexisNexis 2008). The \u201cprototype\u201d for our rule 17 was Fed. R.

Rule 17 cannot be used to conduct discovery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Where role 17 (a) (2) departs from earlier Massachusetts law is in authorizing the production of subpoenaed records \u201cwithin a reasonable time <em>prior to </em>the trial or . . . when they are to be offered in evidence\u201d (emphasis added), when the court so directs. The change was \u201cnot intended to permit the use of summonses to subvert the discovery role, Mass. R. Crim. P. 14,\u201d as amended, 444 Mass. 1501 (2005), but \u201cto permit the court to avoid delay where the production of many books, papers, documents, or other objects would delay the proceedings if not ordered until the . . . commencement\u201d of the trial or evidentiary hearing.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. 122, 140 n.22 (2006); <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. at 268. That access is potentially available to both prosecutors and defendants.

See <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. at 270 (only judge has authority, on filing of motion, to issue subpoena for records prior to trial).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Once a subpoena has issued, it may be challenged by a motion to quash or for modification.

Moreover, the requirement that a party seek prior judicial approval \u201cmust be followed whenever <em>any </em>documents, <em>including </em>documents likely to be privileged, are sought prior to trial\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 270, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169, 185-186 (1993) (discussing defendant\u2019s request for unprivileged school attendance records). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. at 140. With these legal principles in mind, we now address the Commonwealth\u2019s claims regarding its subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">c. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s subpoena. </em>The Commonwealth raises several claims regarding the use of its subpoena power in this case. First, it contends that it was authorized, under G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, to issue the February subpoena without seeking prior judicial approval under <em>Lampron </em>because G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, authorizes it to subpoena any third-party records as long as the return date coincides with an evidentiary hearing, as the return date for the February subpoena did: it coincided with the scheduled (although not held) probable cause hearing.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We disagree. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>subpoena was invalid because it allowed the keeper of records to provide the recordings <em>in advance of </em>the probable cause hearing, contrary to the language and historical development of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, discussed <em>supra, </em>which indicate the records should be produced only at an evidentiary hearing or at trial. Moreover, it is unclear whether the records were relevant to the probable cause hearing. Neither the language nor the history of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, suggests that a prosecutor may use an evidentiary hearing intended for one purpose to subpoena records for another, unrelated purpose. We conclude that such use of a subpoena would be improper.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Second, the Commonwealth suggests that a reference we made in <em>Lampron </em>to G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, shows that the Commonwealth may use G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, instead of mie 17 (a) (2), to obtain third-party records before trial. The Commonwealth is not correct. In <em>Lampron, </em>the Commonwealth argued that defense counsel\u2019s affidavit filed in support of a motion to subpoena documentary evidence was flawed because it included facts not within counsel\u2019s personal knowledge. <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. at 270. In explaining that we were \u201cdisinclined to give a hypertechnical reading\u201d to the requirement that such an affidavit be made on personal knowledge, see Mass. R. Crim. P. 13 (a) (2), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1516 (2004), we referred to a prosecutor\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, to issue a subpoena under his or her own signature, with no required showing of personal or any other knowledge on the prosecutor\u2019s part. See <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 270-271. The reference was intended only to illustrate the point that, in view of a prosecutor\u2019s ability to issue a records subpoena (for trial or an evidentiary hearing) with <em>no </em>showing of personal knowledge, it would be inappropriate to require a far more onerous showing from the defendant under rule 17; we did not mean to suggest that a prosecutor may obtain third-party records before trial under G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68. In fact, in other cases we have said it would be improper for a prosecutor to do so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>444 Mass. at 798 n.17 (\u201cit would be unethical for the Commonwealth to use [its] statutory authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>[G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68,] for any purpose other than to present a witness or evidence to a court or grand jury\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>407 Mass. 827, 832 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 887 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Liebman, </em>379 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1980). As we have explained above, rule 17 (a) (2), and <em>Lampron, </em>not G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, provide the proper mechanism to subpoena third-party records before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Third, the Commonwealth argues that, were it required to comply with <em>Lampron, </em>it should only have to do so where the records sought are privileged or confidential, and the defendant\u2019s telephone calls in this case were neither. Again, we disagree. Although <em>Lampron </em>involved a defendant\u2019s attempt to subpoena statutorily privileged records, we have applied the <em>Lampron </em>standard to requests for other types of records, not all of which were privileged or necessarily confidential. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matis, </em>446 Mass. 632, 633, 635 (2006) (standard applied to request to inspect, measure, and photograph interior of complainant\u2019s home); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>444 Mass. 803, 807-808 (2005) (standard applied to request for medical records concerning complainant\u2019s pelvic examination); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam, </em>444 Mass. at 231 (standard applied to request for elementary and middle school attendance records). Moreover, the <em>Nixon </em>standard has been applied in Federal courts to both prosecutors\u2019 and defendants\u2019 efforts to seek a wide array of records, not all of which were necessarily confidential. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>135 F.3d 963, 972-973 (5th Cir. 1998) (government sought from television station nonconfidential videotape recording of interview of defendant); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beckford, </em>964 F. Supp. 1010, 1031 (E.D. Va. 1997) (defendants sought, among other things, records from State and Federal correctional facilities concerning defendants themselves); <em>United States </em>v. <em>King, </em>164 F.R.D. 542, 545-546 (D. Kan. 1996) (defendant sought patrol logs of security company hired to patrol bank where defendant accused of robbing automatic teller machine, as well as personnel records of bank employees); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walters, </em>558 F. Supp. 726, 727-728 (D. Md. 1980) (government sought from telephone companies records of telephone calls defendant made to his mother and former employer).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>In arguing that it should not have to comply with <em>Lampron </em>when seeking nonprivileged and nonconfidential records before trial, the Commonwealth mentions as examples <em>of </em>such records \u201cmedical records of persons treated after a motor vehicle collision; school attendance records of a child rape victim; or bank or credit records of a larceny victim.\u201d But, as shown above, when comparable sorts of records are sought by defendants, courts have required the defendants to comply with <em>Lampron. </em>We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that its duty to investigate crimes absolves it of having to comply with the same procedures as defendants, particularly given the Commonwealth\u2019s formidable investigatory tools, including its grand jury subpoena power. See note 25, <em>supra</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The procedures required by rule 17 seem especially appropriate in a case like this one, where the information sought \u2014 recordings of the defendant\u2019s telephone conversations \u2014 are at least arguably confidential in some sense, whether entitled to constitutional protection or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">This result is consistent with Federal decisions upholding claims that prosecutors, without first obtaining judicial approval under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Fed. R. Crim. P. 17 (c) and <em>Nixon, </em>had improperly issued pretrial subpoenas to correctional facilities seeking recorded telephone conversations of detainees. See United States vs. Eye, U.S. Dist.

These cases support our conclusion that the Commonwealth should have sought prior judicial approval under rule 17 (a) (2) and <em>Lampron </em>to issue the subpoena here.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We therefore agree with the motion judge that the subpoena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>in this case issued improperly. We do not agree, however, that the circumstances warrant suppression. In allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the judge, finding that the Commonwealth acted in good faith, ruled only that the manner in which the Commonwealth issued the subpoena was defective; he made no ruling on whether the Commonwealth\u2019s obtaining the recordings violated any constitutional right of the defendant\u2019s for which evidentiary exclusion of the recordings might be appropriate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lora, 451 Mass. 425, 438-439 (2008) (exclusionary rule typically reserved for cases involving constitutional violations). Nor did the defendant voice any objection to the motion judge\u2019s deferment of the constitutional issues to a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The defendant has not claimed prejudice from the Commonwealth\u2019s procedural misstep in failing to comply with rule 17 (a) (2) and <em>Lampron. </em>He was provided copies of the subpoenaed recordings early in the proceedings, and the Commonwealth has narrowed its interest in the defendant\u2019s calls to a circumscribed period, from January 19 to March 6, 2007. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Smallwood, 379 Mass. at 888, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanger, </em>377 Mass. 503, 509 (1979) (no prejudice where, despite prosecutor\u2019s interview of witness through misuse of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, subpoena, existence of interview and statements of witness revealed to defendant \u201csufficiently in advance of trial to permit investigation\u201d). See also United States vs. Eye, <em>supra </em>(no prejudice where defendant claimed no prejudice; was given copies of recordings shortly after government received them; and was in no worse position than if government had obtained recordings properly under rule 17 [c]); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Noriega, </em>764 F.

L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, and rule 17 (a) (2), does not itself warrant suppression of the defendant\u2019s recorded telephone conversations. As we noted at the outset, however, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress raised a claim that suppression of this evidence was required because turning the records over to the prosecution without any showing of probable cause violated various of his constitutional rights.

Fed. R. Crim. P. 17 (c) (3) (effective Dec. 1, 2008). The Commonwealth argues that this amendment shows that, before its enactment, judicial approval was unnecessary for the issuance of subpoenas for any sort of records. We disagree. Although the 2008 amendment represents the first explicit reference in the rule to the need for a party to obtain judicial approval, the amendment does more than that: it allows the victim to be heard when records concerning him or her are sought from another party. Moreover, even before the 2008 amendment\u2019s enactment, Federal courts \u201cfrequently followed\u201d the \u201corderly and desirable\u201d practice of requiring judicial approval to effectuate the purpose of rule 17 (c).

P. 17 (c), treating attorney-issued pretrial subpoenas as court orders, because of the attorneys\u2019 status as officers of the court, and considering the rule satisfied so long as the issuing party provided the other side notice and copies of the materials delivered to the court. The court, however, admonished the government not to use a mie 17 (c) subpoena without a court order because of the possibility of subpoenaed records not being timely shared with the defense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The result we reach in this case \u2014 that, apart from grand jury proceedings, the Commonwealth must obtain judicial approval before seeking the production of records from a third party in advance of an evidentiary hearing or trial \u2014 is compelled by the authorities we have discussed above, including Mass. R. Crim. P. 17 (a). Under our current law, the only way for a prosecutor, postindictment, or a defendant to subpoena third-party records without first obtaining judicial approval is to subpoena the records for production on the first day of trial, on the theory that the party subpoenaing the records wishes to use them at trial. We are aware of the logistical problems and delay that such a procedure can pose for the parties and the court. To that end, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Commonwealth has suggested, in substance, that there may be value in allowing parties to subpoena third-party records to court before trial (and without prior judicial approval) in some limited circumstances, e.g., where nonprivileged and nonconfidential records are concerned. We take no position on this or any other possible change to rule 17, or on whether rule 17 should be amended at all. We invite the standing advisory committee on the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure to study the issue by obtaining necessary comment from affected and interested parties and to recommend to us whether rule 17 should be amended, and if so, in what respect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
