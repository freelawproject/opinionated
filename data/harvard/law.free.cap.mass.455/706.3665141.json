We conclude that the motion to suppress was properly denied. Based on our review of the entire case, we decline to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to grant the defendant a new trial or other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>The trial. </em>From the evidence the jury could have found the following. In the early morning hours of March, 10, 2004, the defendant was in the company of Gilbert Wilding and three others at Wilding\u2019s home in Berkley. The group was drinking beer and consuming cocaine after having been drinking in Taunton. Around 7:30 a.m. the defendant dialed the cellular telephone of the victim, Scott Michael Kelly, who was a person known to deal drugs. At the conclusion of the call, and in apparent reference to obtaining cocaine from the victim, the defendant informed Wilding that if the latter could procure a ride, \u201chis boy would hook him up.\u201d Wilding then telephoned his brother, David Lawson, who arrived at the Wilding residence shortly thereafter in his car \u2014 a black Ford Taurus automobile with American flags attached to each of the rear passenger windows. The defendant sat in the front passenger seat, Wilding in the back seat, and Lawson drove. The trio proceeded to Taunton, with the defendant directing Lawson to 60 Broadway Street in Taunton, the address of the apartment building where the victim lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">When the group arrived at their destination, the defendant got out of Lawson\u2019s car, walked along the driveway to the side of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the building, and was out of sight for only two to three minutes. He then returned to the car, spoke briefly with Wilding, and went back to the apartment building for an additional two to three minutes. The tenant in the second-floor apartment, who was herself leaving the building, saw the defendant leave the building by the side porch and go around to the building\u2019s front. He was a heavy-set black male who had on a flannel \u201covershirt that construction workers wear.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant returned to Lawson\u2019s car, got into the front passenger seat, and said, \u201cWe\u2019re all set. Let\u2019s go.\u201d The car then drove away. The defendant was at 60 Broadway Street for no more than ten minutes; he, and the Lawson vehicle, departed shortly before 9:20 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The victim was stabbed while in the basement of the apartment building at 60 Broadway Street. He climbed up the stairs to the first floor where he kicked the door of the first-floor apartment in an attempt to get help. The tenant living in that apartment, Tonya Ferguson, and Paul Barros, a friend of the victim who had been in the victim\u2019s apartment on the third floor until he heard the door banging and Ferguson\u2019s scream from the first floor, ultimately located a cellular telephone and dialed 911. However, the victim died on the stairs between the first and second floors. The telephone call to 911 was placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>between 9:18 a.m. and 9:20 a.m., shortly before police officers arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">On the same day as the killing, March 10, the police obtained the records of the victim\u2019s cellular telephone, which led them to the Wilding residence in Berkley. They were allowed in by Donna Wilding and after looking around the house, found the door to a cellar; they called down for anyone there to come up, but no one responded. They proceeded down to the cellar where they found the defendant. When found, he had in his possession a piece of paper with the victim\u2019s telephone number on it. He was also holding a checkered flannel shirt or jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The victim died of a single stab wound to his chest, and there was considerable blood at the scene of the killing. During the ensuing investigation of the case, State police forensic chemists collected a number of blood samples, eight of which were the subject of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Two of these eight came from the checkered jacket or shirt that the defendant was holding when he was arrested, one came from the defendant\u2019s left hand, two from his right hand, and three from the passenger area of Lawson\u2019s automobile (one each from the exterior door handle, interior door panel, and interior door pull). All of the blood samples were sent to the State police crime laboratory (crime laboratory) for DNA testing and analysis in the weeks after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The results of the DNA analysis were mixed. The blood sample from the defendant\u2019s left hand contained a mixture of DNA of at least three individuals, at least one of whom was an unknown male; the victim, however, was excluded as a possible contributor to the sample. The blood sample from the defendant\u2019s right hand webbing contained a DNA mixture of two individuals, at least one of whom was an unknown male, but again the victim was excluded as a possible contributor. The other sample from the defendant\u2019s right hand contained an insufficient amount of DNA to produce any conclusive results, as did one of the samples from the defendant\u2019s checkered jacket or shirt. The second sample taken from this garment originated from at least one male, and the victim could not be excluded as a possible source of that sample. In two of the samples from Lawson\u2019s automobile \u2014 one from the exterior door handle and one from the interior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>door panel \u2014 the victim was identified as the primary DNA source. The final sample, taken from the interior door pull, originated from at least one male, but no conclusions could be drawn as to whether the victim was the source.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">b. <em>DNA testing. </em>At some point after the defendant was indicted in this case, the crime laboratory reported to the prosecutor that each of the blood samples just described was of such limited size that a single DNA analysis would consume it in its entirety. On learning this fact, the prosecutor notified the defendant\u2019s counsel, who indicated that he would secure his own expert to observe the testing at the State crime laboratory. Arrangements to this effect were completed in October, 2004, and the defendant\u2019s counsel signed an \u201cexhaustive DNA testing authorization\u201d form on which he checked the box notifying the prosecutor that the defendant requested to have his expert present at the testing. In November, 2004, the crime laboratory notified the prosecutor that there was a backlog of six to eight months before the case would be assigned to a chemist for DNA testing, and that, once assigned, it would take an additional six to eight weeks to complete the tests. Based on this timetable, the parties anticipated being able to select a trial date by the following spring. By April, 2005, however, because of the backlog, the samples still had not been assigned to a chemist for analysis. In order to schedule a trial date, the parties agreed that the Commonwealth would send the samples to a private laboratory with instructions for expedited testing. The samples were sent to Orchid Cell-mark (Cellmark) in Germantown, Maryland, in June, 2005. A rush order request as well as a request to have the defendant\u2019s expert present during the DNA testing were contained in the transmittal letter from the Massachusetts State police to Cell-mark\u2019s Germantown laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">At some point, the parties chose July 25, 2005, as the trial date. During June and July, 2005, the prosecutor monitored the progress of the Cellmark testing, but was informed on July 6 that the defense expert, John Abbott, could not be present to observe the analysis until July 19. As a result, Cellmark could not complete the testing in time for the previously selected July 25 trial date. The parties then jointly moved to continue the trial from July 25 to August 29, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Unknown to either the prosecution or defense at the time, Orchid Cellmark was in the process of closing the Germantown laboratory and transferring all cases to its laboratory in Dallas, Texas. These events caused further postponements of the trial date. The blood samples were received in Cellmark\u2019s Dallas facility on August 31, 2005. At the same time, Cellmark was in the process of implementing new processing procedures at that laboratory which, when combined with the \u201ctremendous increase in casework\u201d resulting in part from the closure of the German-town laboratory, created a breakdown of communication between and among Cellmark analyst teams. As a result of such breakdowns, the rush order that had originally accompanied the blood samples to Cellmark\u2019s Germantown laboratory was honored, but the request to have the defendant\u2019s expert present was not. Abbott contacted the Dallas laboratory on September 26, 2005, after the DNA analysis was already in progress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cellmark completed the entire DNA analysis without Abbott\u2019s being present. Cellmark issued its report on the DNA analysis results on September 30, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">After receiving a copy of the Cellmark test results, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the DNA evidence, based on the loss or destruction of potentially exculpatory evidence by the Commonwealth \u201cand/or its agent Orchid Cellmark.\u201d The motion was heard on October 24, 2005, and May 12, 2006.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the October 24 hearing, the Commonwealth submitted the entire DNA case file from Cellmark, including all the test records and results. Defense counsel acknowledged that only a single test could be performed on the samples, but argued that the purpose of having his expert present at Cellmark was \u201c[t]o determine whether or not they do perform valid tests . . . according to national [sic] recognized procedure and protocols.\u201d The motion judge stated his view that the reliability of the DNA test results, and the details of the protocols and procedures that produced them, were the province of expert opinion. To that end, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>judge requested the Commonwealth to provide, in an affidavit from a Cellmark official, the details of the testing protocol and any variations therefrom during the tests of the specific samples in question. Defense counsel was then to provide these affidavits and the Cellmark file materials to his expert, who would be afforded an opportunity to respond with counter affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Before the May 12,2006, hearing, the Commonwealth obtained three affidavits from Judith Floyd, the manager of the Cellmark forensic laboratory in Dallas. These affidavits set out the credentials of Floyd herself as well as the accreditation process and regulatory oversight to which Cellmark\u2019s DNA laboratory and testing protocols are subject. Floyd stated in two of the affidavits that the test methods used in this case were standard for the industry and have been subject to repeated scrutiny by these accrediting and oversight bodies. In regard to this specific case, Floyd stated that there was no departure from standard testing protocols and that this fact had been verified by Cellmark\u2019s reviewing analysts. Floyd\u2019s second and third affidavits also discussed internal organizational problems and breakdown of communications that Cellmark\u2019s Dallas laboratory was experiencing during September, 2005, the month that the blood samples in this case were tested. The affidavits further described the circumstances that purportedly led to Cellmark\u2019s failure to secure the defense expert\u2019s presence for the DNA testing. These affidavits did not state that the organizational and communications problems led to any irregularities in the DNA testing procedures or analysis themselves. While the defense received the Floyd affidavits and appears to have provided them to Abbott for review, Abbott did not submit any responding affidavit at the May 12 hearing date, nor did he testify. Defense counsel\u2019s position was that Cellmark\u2019s experts \u201ccould say anything\u201d as to the validity of their procedures in this specific case, and any analysis by Abbott would be mere after-the-fact speculation as to what may have happened and how it could have affected the results.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In denying the motion to suppress, the judge concluded that the defendant had failed to meet what the judge described as the defendant\u2019s initial burden of showing a reasonable and concrete possibility that access to the exhaustive analysis of the blood samples would have produced evidence favorable to his cause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>The judge rested this ruling on the fact that the defendant had presented \u201cno evidence . . . that the protocol followed by Cell-mark in connection with the DNA analysis was in any way faulty.\u201d He further stated that, in all likelihood, the presence of the defendant\u2019s expert would have actually bolstered the reliability of Cellmark\u2019s test results and that the Floyd affidavits provided ample opportunity for cross-examination concerning the confusion at Cellmark around the time the analysis was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant argues that the judge applied an incorrect legal standard in denying his motion to suppress. Specifically, he claims that the judge erred by reviewing the question whether the allegedly \u201clost\u201d evidence \u2014 the opportunity of defense counsel to witness the DNA testing<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 was exculpatory according to a standard that did not take into account the fact that he had made a specific request to be present at the DNA testing. In his view, the proper standard in the case of a specific request for the lost or destroyed evidence is for the judge to determine whether the defendant has shown a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the lost evidence was exculpatory, which means, the defendant contends, whether the lost evidence might have affected the verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 430, 433 (1999), on which the defendant relies. The defendant asserts he clearly showed that the lost opportunity to view the DNA testing was exculpatory under this standard, because the evidence suggesting chaotic confusion at Cellmark\u2019s Dallas laboratory created a reasonable possibility that had the defense expert been present at the DNA testing as requested, he would have witnessed evidence revealing that the Cellmark DNA \u201canalyst, in the midst of this rush and confusion, was inattentive in other aspects (beyond the careless reviewing of instructions provided with the file) relating to the testing as well.\u201d Accordingly, the argument goes, the judge should have proceeded to weigh or balance the Commonwealth\u2019s culpability, the materiality of the lost evidence, and the prejudice to the defendant \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>result of which should have led to the conclusion that the defendant was entitled to the remedy sought, namely, suppression of all DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument seems to conflate what must be shown to demonstrate that lost or destroyed evidence is \u201cexculpatory,\u201d and what is necessary to show the \u201cmateriality\u201d of that evidence to the case. These are two separate issues. We begin with consideration of the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">As a requirement of due process, the Commonwealth has a duty to disclose to a defendant material, exculpatory evidence in its possession or control. See <em>United States </em>v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 106 (1976) <em>(Agurs); Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963) <em>(Brady); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 404-405 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>376 Mass. 1, 21 (1978) (\u201csuppression by the prosecution of requested material evidence which is favorable to the accused is a denial of due process\u201d). Where the defendant claims that the Commonwealth has withheld or not disclosed still-existing exculpatory evidence, \u201cthe defendant must first prove that the evidence was, in fact, exculpatory.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>438 Mass. 672, 679 (2003). As the court has recognized, however, where the Commonwealth loses or destroys \u2014 as opposed to withholds \u2014 evidence claimed to be exculpatory, the situation presents particular concerns. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>392 Mass. 1, 12 (1984) <em>(Neal), </em>we noted the difficulty facing a defendant in these circumstances, because \u201cit is no longer possible to determine whether the defendant would have obtained any evidence of an exculpatory nature had [the evidence being sought] been made available to him for inspection or examination.\u201d We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">\u201cTo require the defendant at this stage to prove that the [lost or destroyed evidence at issue] [was] in fact exculpa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>tory would . . . convert the disclosure duty established by <em>Brady </em>and its progeny into \u2018an empty promise, easily circumvented by suppression of evidence by means of destruction rather than mere failure to reveal.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>[439 F.2d 642,] 648 [D.C. Cir. 1971], <em>The defendant is therefore entitled to relief for the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to preserve the [lost evidence] if he establishes a \u2018reasonable possibility, based on concrete evidence rather than a fertile imagination, \u2019 that access to the [evidence] would have produced evidence favorable to his cause. State </em>v. <em>Michener, </em>25 Or. App. 523, 532 (1976).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Two years later, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>397 Mass. 1 (1986) <em>(Charles), </em>the court returned to the difficulties presented by lost or destroyed evidence, stating: \u201cThe loss [or destruction] of evidence presents special problems. . . . When potentially exculpatory evidence is lost or destroyed, the culpability of the government will be weighed along with the materiality of the evidence and the potential prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The following year, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willie, </em>400 Mass. 427 (1987) <em>(Willie), </em>we fleshed out more fully the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>balancing test that <em>Charles </em>had used. <em>Willie </em>was a case in which the court was reviewing reported questions concerning a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment due to the loss or destruction of extracts of material with blood stains that the defendant sought to test to determine blood type. We explained in <em>Willie </em>that \u201cwhen potentially exculpatory evidence is lost or destroyed, a balancing test is employed to determine the appropriateness and extent of remedial action. The courts must weigh [1] the culpability of the Commonwealth, [2] the materiality of the evidence and [3] the potential prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432. With respect to the third factor of potential prejudice, we indicated that this factor of necessity must focus in part on the exculpatory nature of the evidence, and incorporated the <em>Neal </em>standard for making such a determination. In particular, we stated: \u201cAn analysis of the prejudice to the defendant necessarily involves an inquiry into the exculpatory nature of the evidence. Where evidence is lost or destroyed, it may be difficult to determine the precise nature of the evidence. While the defendant need not prove that the evidence would have been exculpatory, he must establish \u2018a reasonable possibility, based on concrete evidence rather than a fertile imagination, that access to the [material] would have produced evidence favorable to his cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, quoting <em>Neal, </em>392 Mass. at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">In the years since <em>Charles </em>and <em>Willie, </em>the court has sometimes, but not always, taken a somewhat different approach in reviewing a defendant\u2019s claim for relief based on potentially exculpatory evidence that has been lost or destroyed. In particular, the court has required that, before the balancing test established in <em>Charles </em>and <em>Willie </em>will be performed, the defendant must satisfy an \u201cinitial burden\u201d of demonstrating the exculpatory value of the lost or destroyed evidence as set out in <em>Neal. </em>See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>438 Mass. 779, 784 (2003), where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">\u201cA defendant who seeks relief from the loss or destruction of potentially exculpatory evidence has <em>the initial burden, Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>416 Mass. 707, 714 (1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 835 (1994), to establish \u2018a \u201creasonable possibility, based on concrete evidence rather than a fertile imagination,\u201d that access to the [lost or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>destroyed evidence] would have produced evidence favorable to his cause\u2019 (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>392 Mass. 1, 12 (1984). <em>If he meets his initial burden, </em>\u2018a balancing test is employed to determine the appropriateness and extent of remedial action. The courts must weigh the culpability of the Commonwealth, the materiality of the evidence, and the potential prejudice to the defendant.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willie, </em>400 Mass. 427, 432 (1987).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Accord, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>452 Mass. 295, 309 (2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1329 (2009)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kee, </em>449 Mass. 550, 554 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dinkins, </em>440 Mass. 715, 717 (2004). But see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. 296, 305 (2003) (in reviewing denial of motion to dismiss based on destruction of evidence, court applied <em>Charles </em>[and Willie] balancing test directly; no mention of \u201cinitial burden\u201d on defendant to establish exculpatory nature of destroyed evidence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harwood, </em>432 Mass. 290, 295 (2000) (\u201cWhen a defendant claims he is prejudiced by missing evidence, a judge must weigh the materiality of the evidence and the potential prejudice to the defendant, as well as the culpability of the Commonwealth and its agents\u201d; no mention of defendant\u2019s \u201cinitial burden\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">As this review reflects, there appears to be some inconsistency in our cases with respect to our consideration of lost or destroyed evidence that a defendant claims was exculpatory. Both the balancing test cases exemplified by <em>Charles </em>and <em>Willie </em>and their progeny, as well as the cases imposing an \u201cinitial burden\u201d on the defendant, use the exact same test for assessing whether the defendant has sufficiently demonstrated the potentially exculpatory nature of the evidence at issue: has the defendant shown that there is a \u201creasonable possibility, based on concrete evidence\u201d <em>(Neal, </em>392 Mass. at 12), rather than speculation or surmise, that access to what was lost would have produced evidence favorable to his case. Compare, e.g., <em>Willie, </em>400 Mass. at 433, with, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>438 Mass. at 784. The difference in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>the two lines of cases is that under the <em>Charles </em>and <em>Willie </em>line of cases, a consideration of the Commonwealth\u2019s culpability, if any, in that loss or destruction, as well as an evaluation of materiality, are also part of the initial calculus; under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, supra </em>and similar cases, the analysis is in two phases, and no consideration of government culpability or materiality need occur unless the exculpatory nature of the evidence is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">We seek to clarify and resolve the somewhat different approaches taken in our cases. When a defendant makes a claim that the government has lost or destroyed potentially exculpatory evidence, it makes sense that he or she should bear the initial burden of demonstrating the exculpatory nature of that evidence, using the <em>Neal </em>\u201creasonable possibility, based on concrete evidence\u201d formulation. <em>Neal, </em>392 Mass. at 12. We therefore hold that the defendant will be required to meet this threshold burden in order to advance a claim for relief. If the defendant does meet the burden, then, as indicated in, for example, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>438 Mass. at 784, and the other cases that have followed the lead of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>416 Mass. at 714 <em>(Olszewski II), </em>the judge, or the court on appeal, must proceed to balance the Commonwealth\u2019s culpability, the materiality of the evidence, and the prejudice to the defendant in order to determine whether the defendant is entitled to relief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the defendant does <em>not </em>establish as a threshold matter that the evidence at issue is possibly exculpatory according to the <em>Neal </em>standard, there is no need to engage in this balancing test. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>452 Mass. at 309. That does not necessarily mean, however, that the defendant must forgo pursuit of a remedy for culpable conduct by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Our cases indicate that where the Commonwealth has acted in bad faith or recklessly, resulting in the loss or destruction of evidence, the defendant may be independently entitled to a remedy even without meeting the <em>Neal </em>test. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gliniewicz, </em>398 Mass. 744, 747-749 (1986) (mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>tians to suppress evidence of serological test results performed on defendants\u2019 boots should have been allowed where Commonwealth, in violation of pretrial conference agreement, effectively destroyed boots by testing, destruction was intentional or at least condoned by Commonwealth, evidence was material, and prejudice to defendants resulted; new trials ordered). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>401 Mass. 749, 754 n.2 (1988) <em>(Olszewski I) </em>(\u201cIt would seem that culpability, in the sense of bad faith destruction or falsification of evidence, could present an independent ground for remedial action\u201d). Moreover, even where the government\u2019s level of culpability is no greater than negligence, the defendant may still be entitled at trial to make an argument that focuses on such negligence \u2014 such as, for example, that the negligence reflects an inadequate or incompetent investigation by the government that may give rise to a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485-486 (1980).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Returning to the instant case, as just indicated, the initial question to answer is whether the defendant established a reasonable and evidence-based possibility that the opportunity to observe Cellmark conduct the DNA testing in this case was exculpatory \u2014 i.e., that it \u201cwould have produced evidence favorable to his cause.\u201d <em>Neal, </em>392 Mass. at 12. Our review of the record before the motion judge indicates that the defendant did not do so. The affidavits of Judith Floyd state that while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>there was a breakdown of case tracking and communication systems at Cellmark\u2019s Dallas laboratory that affected communications among different levels of Cellmark staff and also between Cellmark and its clients, the actual DNA analysis conducted in this case followed established Cellmark protocols that themselves had been specifically reviewed and approved by a number of public and private accrediting bodies. The judge invited the defendant to present an affidavit or testimony from his expert to explain the nature of what was lost by the expert\u2019s inability to be present for the testing, but neither an affidavit nor testimony was offered \u2014 the result of what appears to have been a conscious strategic decision by defense counsel. What remains is the defendant\u2019s claim that because there was an obvious degree of chaos in the over-all operation of Cellmark\u2019s Texas laboratory in the month the DNA testing occurred, it can and should be assumed that the chaos spilled over to affect the actual conduct of the DNA analysis. We agree with the general proposition that evidence tending to call into question the validity and quality of the DNA analysis in this case \u2014 and the credibility of Cellmark\u2019s laboratory director testified to both \u2014 would qualify as favorable to the defense, and exculpatory. See Neal, <em>supra </em>at 11-12. But on the record before us, which includes specific and extensive documentation of the DNA testing conducted, the defendant\u2019s assertion that had his expert been present at the testing, the expert could have witnessed and then testified about confusion and sloppiness in the actual conduct of the DNA analysis, is based on surmise and speculation. See <em>id. </em>at 12. It is difficult to disagree with the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that the presence of the defense expert as an observer of the testing might well have served to bolster the jury\u2019s view of the validity of the test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Because the defendant was unable to demonstrate a reasonable possibility that the lost opportunity to observe the testing was exculpatory, there was no need for the motion judge to undertake the task of balancing the Commonwealth\u2019s culpability, materiality of the evidence, and prejudice to the defendant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of the DNA analysis was properly denied.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">3. <em>Review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the entire record pursuant to our obligation under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and conclude that neither a reduction in the murder verdict nor an order for a new trial is warranted. The full trial record indicates that the defendant was not prejudiced by his expert\u2019s inability to witness Cellmark\u2019s testing. Defense counsel ably cross-examined Judith Floyd, Cellmark\u2019s representative, concerning the chaos in the Dallas laboratory and its effect on sample processing, and brought Cellmark\u2019s past processing errors to the attention of the jury. This opportunity to \u201cplant . . . seeds of doubt,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dinkins, </em>440 Mass. at 719, was very likely more than counsel would have been able to accomplish had Abbott actually been present for the tests. Supporting the view that defendant was not, in a broad sense, prejudiced by the inability to monitor Cellmark\u2019s testing was the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury concerning inferences that they could draw from the Commonwealth\u2019s handling of the matter. See note 10, <em>supra. </em>This instruction helped to remedy any possible disadvantage to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-10\">The underlying felony found by the jury was armed robbery. The defendant was also convicted of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The second-floor tenant, Donna Hutchings, identified the defendant at trial as the one who left the building. On two occasions shortly after the murder, Hutchings identified two different people from two different photographic arrays. In the first array, which did not include a photograph of the defendant, she selected another man and said she was \u201cninety percent\u201d sure that he was the man she had seen; in the second array, which had the defendant\u2019s photograph included, she chose a different man and said he looked more like the man she had seen than the first man she had selected. She described to the police the man she saw as wearing a flannel checked jacket and having \u201ctwo really large rolls at the back of his neck and that\u2019s how she could identify him, more prominently than a front view.\u201d At trial, she identified the defendant as the man who had left the building. Kevin Ashley, who was standing less than two blocks away from the victim\u2019s apartment building, witnessed a dark car with two American flags sticking out the windows pull up to the victim\u2019s building and a large black male wearing a black and white checkered \u201ccoat\u201d get out and go into the building. Shortly after the murder, Ashley identified the defendant from one of the same photographic arrays shown to Hutchings as \u201cmaybe\u201d the man who had gotten out of the car. At trial, Ashley testified that the defendant resembled the man he saw get out of the car, and that the jacket the man was wearing looked like the checkered jacket or shirt the defendant was holding when arrested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-6\">There is evidence that Abbott failed to leave his own contact information when he telephoned Cellmark\u2019s Dallas laboratory on September 26, 2005.

In the latter situation, as <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963) <em>(Brady), </em>and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97 (1976) <em>(Agurs), </em>make clear, because the evidence in question still exists, what matters is whether that evidence was in fact exculpatory; the good or bad faith of the government is irrelevant. See <em>Brady, supra </em>at 87 (\u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith or the prosecution\u201d). See also <em>Agurs, supra </em>at 110 (\u201cIf the suppression of evidence results in constitutional error, it is because of the character of the evidence, not the character of the prosecutor\u201d). But where the government has lost or destroyed the evidence claimed to be exculpatory, there is no evidence to weigh or examine. The inherently difficult position in which the government\u2019s action places the defendant makes it appropriate to consider \u201cnot solely . . . the potential prejudice to the defendant from the evidence\u2019s nonproduction as in <em>Brady </em>and <em>Agurs, </em>but also upon the government\u2019s culpability.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arra, supra </em>at 849.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Although it is implicit in the concept of an \u201cinitial burden,\u201d the <em>Clemente </em>case states explicitly that where the defendant does not meet that initial burden, \u201cwe do not reach the balancing test.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>452 Mass. 295, 309 (2008), cert. denied, 129 S.

The defendant here made no claim under a theory of spoliation, and there was no request for any of the \u201cspectrum of remedies\u201d available to redress spoliation. See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Garfield, </em>454 Mass. 790, 799 (2009), quoting <em>Gath </em>v. <em>M/A-Com, Inc., </em>440 Mass. 482, 488 (2003). We note, however, that the trial judge, at the request of the defendant\u2019s counsel, gave an instruction to the jury that focused (among other alleged failures) on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to conduct tests with the defense expert present. The judge also explained that if the jury found such a failure to be significant, they could consider whether it (adversely) affected the reliability or quality of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, and \u201cthat had there been no [failure], it would have resulted in evidence favorable to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The defendant makes no claim that the Commonwealth acted intentionally or in bad faith in this case \u2014 conduct that if found to exist, might provide an independent ground to seek relief. See note 10, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text. As previously noted, however, at trial the defendant sought and the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>gave a somewhat different version of a so-called <em>Bowden </em>instruction, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485-486 (1980), to highlight the Commonwealth\u2019s loss of his opportunity to have an expert observe and evaluate the DNA testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Because we have concluded that the defendant failed to meet the <em>Neal </em>standard for showing the exculpatory nature of his lost opportunity to observe the DNA testing, we do not need to reach the second issue the defendant raises, namely, what is the appropriate standard to review the \u201cmateriality\u201d of the claimed exculpatory evidence \u2014 an inquiry that focuses on the prejudice to the defendant derived from its loss or destruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 405-408, 412 (1992). However, we have no reason to disagree with the defendant\u2019s argument that where a defendant has specifically requested a particular item or type of evidence that qualifies as exculpatory, and that evidence is thereafter lost or destroyed by the government, his claim for relief should be governed by the same standard of review that we apply to a defendant who has made a specific request for still-existing exculpatory evidence that the government improperly withheld or failed to disclose. In the latter instance, the standard is that \u201ca defendant need only demonstrate that a substantial basis exists for claiming prejudice from the nondisclosure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
