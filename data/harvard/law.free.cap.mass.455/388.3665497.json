Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant argues that the trial judge erred in (1) admitting in evidence statements, some of which were electronically recorded, made by the defendant more than six hours after his arrest in California on unrelated charges and after he had purportedly invoked his constitutional right to silence; (2) permitting the defendant to be excluded from a jury view; (3) preventing a witness from consulting with his attorney as to his right against self-incrimination; and (4) failing to instruct the jury, in explaining the element of extreme atrocity or cruelty, that they must be unanimous in finding at least one of the factors set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 227 (1983). The defendant also contends that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper in several respects and not supported by the evidence at trial. We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction and see no basis to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\"><em>The evidence at trial. </em>The Commonwealth alleged that, late on the evening of May 10, 1988, the defendant, angry at having been \u201cripped off\u201d in a drug deal, shot Anthony LoConte (victim) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>in the head at close range, killing him. The jury could have found the following facts from the evidence at trial. In the spring of 1988, the defendant was a mid-level distributor of cocaine in Brockton. Jeffrey Tessier worked as a \u201crunner\u201d for the defendant, helping him to break up large amounts of cocaine into smaller quantities and then distributing the repackaged drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">On May 10, 1988, the defendant told Tessier he was \u201cdry\u201d and knew of no source from which he could purchase cocaine. Tessier unsuccessfully tried to connect the defendant with a cocaine supplier, and then devised a scheme in which he would trick the defendant into paying him for what the defendant would mistakenly believe was one-quarter kilogram of cocaine. In the course of carrying out the ruse, Tessier traveled with the defendant in a vehicle (a Monte Carlo) driven by Brian Madden to the victim\u2019s home. Tessier entered the victim\u2019s home alone, spoke with the victim, gathered various items, including \u201can Old Spice\u201d container, and placed the hastily assembled package in a brown paper bag. Tessier then returned to the Monte Carlo with the paper bag; the defendant gave Tessier $10,500 in cash, and Tessier handed the defendant the package, which supposedly contained the cocaine. The defendant drove off, and Tessier returned to the victim\u2019s home and gave the victim $2,000. The defendant was not fooled for long by Tessier\u2019s primitive ruse. Five minutes later, the defendant and Madden returned to the victim\u2019s home. Banging loudly on the back door, the defendant angrily demanded the return of his money. The victim raced out the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">At approximately 11 p.m. that night, Michael Geiler, a resident of Howard Street in Brockton, saw a vehicle with its interior lights on slow down in front of his home and come to a complete stop. After the vehicle left, he observed what looked like a trash bag on the side of the road. When Geiler heard a motorist scream for help, he saw that what he had initially thought was a trash bag was in fact the victim lying on the ground, still breathing and moaning. Emergency medical technicians were summoned; when they arrived, the victim was unconscious, with a pulse, but he did not survive. The autopsy conducted on May 11, 1988, revealed that the cause of the victim\u2019s death was a gunshot wound to his head. The medical examiner determined that a single bullet had entered the victim\u2019s skull behind his left ear, traveled through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the right frontal lobe of his brain, and exited over his right eye. At its point of entry, the bullet hole was three-eighths inch in diameter, consistent with a bullet fired from a .380 caliber firearm. The medical examiner who conducted the autopsy opined that the firearm had been fired less than six inches from the victim\u2019s head, because the wound was round and there were bums around the edges of the wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Sometime around midnight, while sirens could still be heard in the background, the defendant telephoned his friend, Travis Merritt, and told him that he had gotten ripped off, that something had gone wrong, and that he had shot somebody. The defendant later arrived at Merritt\u2019s apartment with blood on his chin and clothing. He repeated that he had shot somebody, but said he did not know whom he had shot. He said he had thrown his gun out of a vehicle while driving on or near Harrison Boulevard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant also told Merritt that he wanted to look for Tessier because Tessier had taken his money.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">On the morning of May 11, 1988, the defendant went with Merritt to Gary Camel\u2019s home and told him, \u201cI just want my money. I killed the wrong person.\u201d While the defendant was inside Camel\u2019s home, Tessier arrived outside. The defendant wanted to go outside and get his money back, but Camel said that he would take care of it. Moments later, Camel returned with about $7,500. The defendant counted the money and said he was short. The defendant then handed each person present a one hundred dollar bill, including Camel. Merritt, another person, and the defendant then took a taxicab, which dropped the defendant off near the residence of Joseph Valente, a former business associate of the defendant. The defendant told Valente that he had gotten ripped off and that he needed to get in touch with an individual who had recently arrived from California.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Merritt did not see the defendant again until trial. A few weeks after the murder, the defendant called Merritt and said \u201cthat he couldn\u2019t believe he could never come back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">After midnight on the night of the killing, Brian Madden (the driver of the Monte Carlo) telephoned his brother Mark, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>shortly thereafter, Mark went to Brian\u2019s house. When Mark arrived, he saw blood inside Brian\u2019s Monte Carlo. After receiving a telephone report of an emergency, the police were dispatched to Brian\u2019s house; officers arrived at 12:39 a.m. Police discovered a great deal of blood on the front passenger seat of the Monte Carlo, as well as a compact disc and Old Spice container. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profile of the blood found on the floor mats in the Monte Carlo was later shown to match the DNA profile of the victim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Inside the kitchen of Brian Madden\u2019s home, the officer saw compact discs with blood on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Kenneth F. Martin, a State police detective lieutenant and an expert on blood stain pattern analysis, after having examined the blood evidence and conferring with the medical examiner as to the autopsy results, opined that the shooter had been sitting in the rear seat of the Monte Carlo, behind the driver, when he shot the victim in the front passenger seat in the head. Lieutenant Martin concluded that it would be difficult to have fired a shot from the driver\u2019s seat at the angle indicated by the entrance and exit wounds, and he ruled out the possibility that the shooter fired from directly behind the victim in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">A homicide warrant issued against the defendant on May 11, 1988, but for the next twelve years he remained a fugitive. On March 16, 2000, the defendant was arrested in California for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. At the time of the arrest, he was carrying a driver\u2019s license in the name of Roderick Grinage. Later that day, after the defendant had been released on bond, Lieutenant Bryan Markum of the Stanislaus County, California, sheriff\u2019s department visited \u201cGrinage\u201d at his home and inspected the residence. He found identifications in three names, and \u201cGrinage\u201d admitted to two other aliases. Lieutenant Markum did a warrant check using the aliases and learned of the Massachusetts fugitive warrant against the defendant. He advised the Massachusetts authorities, who sent him a facsimile of the defendant\u2019s fingerprint card; the defendant\u2019s fingerprints were positively identified as the fingerprints of \u201cGrinage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Sergeant Leonard G. Coppenrath of the Massachusetts State police learned on March 17, 2000, that the defendant had been apprehended, and he departed the next day for California. When he arrived, he met with the defendant, who was then in custody, and advised him of his Miranda rights from a Miranda form. During this initial interview, the defendant continued to call himself Grinage and insisted he was from New York. Sergeant Coppenrath finally wrote the defendant\u2019s true name in the blank space left for the name on the Miranda form. Recognizing that his true identity had been discovered, the defendant asked, \u201cNow what?\u201d and inquired whether his girl friend in California had \u201crat[ted] [him] out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The defendant then asked whether he and Sergeant Coppenrath could speak where the air conditioning was not so strong and where he could get something to eat. They drove a few miles to a local sheriff\u2019s office and continued the interview in a room that contained videotape recording equipment. At one point, Sergeant Coppenrath interrupted the interview to allow the defendant to telephone the mother of his son; the conversation was recorded on videotape. During this telephone call, the defendant told his son\u2019s mother that she should explain to their son that \u201cDaddy did a bad thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\"><em>The factual findings from the motion to suppress hearing. </em>The defendant claims that the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress the statements he made to Sergeant Coppenrath.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIn reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \u2018but conduct an independent review of [her] ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002). With one exception, which we will discuss, we find no clear error in any of the judge\u2019s relevant findings of fact. We summarize those findings, based on the evidence presented at the motion hearing, supplemented when needed by undisputed facts in the motion record.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">On March 18,2000, Sergeant Coppenrath met with the defendant alone in an interview room of the Stanislaus County jail in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Modesto, California. At the time of the interview, the defendant was in custody on unrelated charges in California, and did not yet have an attorney. Sergeant Coppenrath, using a-preprinted form, advised the defendant of his Miranda rights. The defendant said that he understood his rights but he would not sign the form. Sergeant Coppenrath revealed to the defendant that he knew his true identity, and that the defendant would be returning to Massachusetts to stand trial for the victim\u2019s murder. The defendant did not initially respond when Sergeant Coppenrath asked whether he wanted to speak about the murder, and did not refer specifically to the incident, characterizing the time period only as \u201cwhen I left.\u201d The defendant told Sergeant Coppenrath that he had not seen or spoken to his family since leaving Brockton. He admitted to knowing several of the people associated with the case, including Gamel and Tessier.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">When Sergeant Coppenrath proposed that the defendant\u2019s part in the murder might best be told by him, the defendant stated that he had not admitted to killing anyone yet. Sergeant Coppenrath suggested various scenarios that may have explained the defendant\u2019s involvement in the murder, but the suggested scenarios did not elicit any confirmation or denial from the defendant. After Sergeant Coppenrath showed him a photograph of the Monte Carlo in which the victim had been killed, the defendant said simply, \u201cIt looks like a green Monte Carlo.\u201d The defendant then stated that he was \u201cthinking I might need a lawyer and want to talk with him before talking to you.\u201d He immediately then stated that it would be easier to discuss the charges if he were in a more comfortable room (because the air conditioning made the interview room uncomfortably cold), and if he could have something to eat.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">As a result of the defendant\u2019s request, Sergeant Coppenrath and the defendant, accompanied by Lieutenant Markum and another sheriff\u2019s detective, traveled to the Stanislaus County sheriff\u2019s department, which was four to five miles from the jail, and entered a room that contained videotape recording equipment and two sofas. The defendant and Sergeant Coppenrath remained in the room; the two sheriff\u2019s detectives left. The judge found that the defendant was told that the videotape equipment would be recording during the course of the interview. This was the lone error in the judge\u2019s findings of fact; the motion record does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>support a finding that the defendant was told that the videotape equipment was recording at the onset of the interview. Rather, the record supports a finding that the defendant was informed before any substantive questioning that the police <em>intended </em>to videotape the interview; however, the defendant did not learn until later in the interview that the videotape equipment was actually recording.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">During the videotaped interview, Sergeant Coppenrath learned from the defendant that it was his son\u2019s birthday. The sergeant then invited the defendant to telephone his son to wish him a happy birthday. The defendant provided the sergeant with the telephone number of his son\u2019s mother, and the sergeant dialed the telephone number, handed the telephone to the defendant, and left the interview room. The videotape equipment continued to run and recorded what the defendant said to his son\u2019s mother, but not what she said to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In this conversation, the defendant told her that \u201cthey\u201d had found that his true name was Robert Morganti, and that he had a murder charge against him from \u201cback East.\u201d He instructed her that if anyone should come knocking at her door, not to speak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>with them; instead, she was to tell them that she wished to speak to an attorney. The defendant told her to tell their son that he \u201cdid a bad thing a long time ago.\u201d After Sergeant Coppenrath returned to the room, the defendant continued the conversation with his son\u2019s mother. In Sergeant Coppenrath\u2019s presence, he told her, \u201c[I]f you want to tell him something, just say, \u2018Hey, daddy did a bad thing\u2019 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">After the two had eaten the meal that had been delivered to them, Sergeant Coppenrath asked the defendant if he wanted to tell him about \u201cMay 11th,\u201d referring to the victim\u2019s murder. The sergeant added that, if the defendant did not want to talk about it, he did not have to talk about it, but that he (the sergeant) was obligated to ask him. The defendant responded, \u201cTo tell you the truth \u2014 I think I would rather take my chances on a lawyer . . . .\u201d Although the interview continued, the Commonwealth agreed that none of the defendant\u2019s statements after this point in the interview would be offered in evidence at trial. The judge ruled that, until this point, the defendant had voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his Miranda rights, including his right to silence and to confer with counsel. The judge further ordered that the defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to silence and to counsel be redacted from the tape recording heard by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We address each of the defendant\u2019s claims of error in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">1. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred for three separate reasons in denying the motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">a. First, the defendant contends that Sergeant Coppenrath was required to terminate his interrogation of the defendant after the defendant, while still at the jail, said that he was \u201cthinking I might need a lawyer and want to talk with him before talking to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">When an accused has invoked his right to counsel during a custodial interrogation, the police must stop the interrogation until counsel has been made available to the defendant, unless the accused himself initiates further conversation with the police. See <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-485 (1981). To invoke the right to counsel, \u201cthe suspect must unambiguously request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>counsel.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 459 (1994). \u201c|T]f a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel,\u201d the police questioning need not cease. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 450 (1995). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Obershaw, </em>435 Mass. 794, 800 (2002), and cases cited (\u201cWe have repeatedly held that equivocal statements and musings concerning the need for an attorney do not constitute such an affirmative request\u201d). Rather, to invoke his right to counsel, the suspect \u201cmust articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, supra. </em>We conclude that the evidence supports the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s statement at the jail, quoted above, was ambiguous and equivocal, and would not reasonably be understood in the circumstances to constitute an invocation of the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The defendant contends that his statement to the police was comparable to the statement in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Contos, </em>435 Mass. 19 (2001), which we found to be an unambiguous invocation of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel. See <em>id. </em>at 29. There, the defendant, after one and one-half hours of interrogation, said to the police, \u201cI think at this point we need to stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. When the officer asked why, the defendant replied, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to stop, and I think I\u2019m going to get a lawyer. If this is the way this is going, you\u2019re either accusing me or charging me.\u201d Here, by contrast, the defendant did not declare that the interrogation needed to stop, or that he and Sergeant Coppenrath were \u201cgoing to stop.\u201d He did not declare his intent to \u201cget a lawyer.\u201d Nor did the defendant suddenly recognize, from the \u201cway [the questioning] was going,\u201d that the police were going to accuse him of a crime or charge him with a crime; Sergeant Coppenrath had told the defendant early in the interview that he had been charged with the victim\u2019s murder and would be brought to Massachusetts for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Instead, the defendant said only that he was \u201cthinking I might need a lawyer and want to talk with him before talking to you,\u201d which a police officer reasonably would understand as the defendant\u2019s thinking out loud that he <em>might </em>need a lawyer and <em>might </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>want to stop the questioning until he spoke to the lawyer. When a suspect\u2019s statement, as here, simply reflects his musing about the possibility of stopping the questioning until he has spoken with an attorney, we have consistently found the statement to be too ambiguous to constitute an unequivocal invocation of the right to counsel. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dubois, </em>451 Mass. 20, 25 (2008) (\u201cThis sounds serious. Maybe I better get a lawyer\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>439 Mass. 249, 258 (2003) (defendant stated that he was \u201cgoing to need a lawyer sometime\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peixoto, </em>430 Mass. 654, 657-658 (2000) (defendant expressed uncertainty as to whether he wanted to speak to police without attorney); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>408 Mass. 724, 726 (1990) (defendant \u201cwondered aloud about the advisability of having a lawyer\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corriveau, </em>396 Mass. 319, 331 (1985) (\u201cIt\u2019s beginning to sound like I need a lawyer\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hussey (No. 1), </em>410 Mass. 664, 671, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 988 (1991) (defendant\u2019s statement that \u201che had nothing else he could say,\u201d coupled with his \u201cthinking out loud\u201d about whether he should talk or \u201cshut . . . up,\u201d did not amount to invocation of right to cut off questioning).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Likewise, the defendant did not do or say anything immediately after he made this ambiguous statement that reasonably should have caused a police officer to understand that the defendant was unequivocally invoking his right to counsel. To the contrary, the defendant said that it would be easier to speak of the charges if he were in a more comfortable room and was provided something to eat. Neither of these requests would suggest that the defendant had just expressed his refusal to speak further before conferring with counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">b. Second, the defendant claims that his statements must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>suppressed because they were made more than six hours after his arrest, in violation of the safe harbor rule we established in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>422 Mass. 48, 56-57 (1996). This rule provides that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, a statement made by a defendant more than six hours after his arrest shall not be admitted in evidence unless the defendant waives his right to a prompt arraignment.* ****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In establishing this safe harbor rule, we recognized that the police have a duty to bring an arrested person before a court for arraignment as soon as reasonably possible to prevent unlawful detention \u201cand to eliminate the opportunity and incentive for application of improper police pressure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 7 (a) (1), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1506 (2004) (\u201cA defendant who has been arrested shall be brought before a court if then in session, and if not, at its next session\u201d). We also have recognized that police officers know that, when arraigned, the defendant would have a right to counsel, so police officers may seek to delay an uncounselled defendant\u2019s arraignment in order to continue an interrogation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, supra </em>at 53. Cognizant that different trial judges had differing views as to what constituted unreasonable delay in arraignment, we have determined that, to avoid uncertainty and the uneven application of the reasonableness standard, we would establish \u201cas clear a rule as possible concerning both the right of the police to question an arrested person and the standard for suppressing statements made by a defendant after arrest and before arraignment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The safe harbor rule established in the <em>Rosario </em>decision applies by its terms only to persons arrested in Massachusetts who could be arraigned in Massachusetts; it was not intended to apply to persons arrested in other States on warrants issued in Massachusetts, whose arraignment would need to await their rendition to Massachusetts. The danger that triggered the need for the rule \u2014 that police officers would delay a defendant\u2019s arraignment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>order to procure a confession from an unrepresented defendant \u2014 does not arise when the defendant must await a rendition hearing before being transported to Massachusetts for arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">While the letter of the safe harbor rule does not apply to defendants arrested outside Massachusetts, we consider whether the circumstances of this interrogation violated the spirit of the rule. It did not. Here, the Massachusetts State police could not interrogate the defendant during the six-hour period following his arrest, because a State trooper needed to fly from Massachusetts to Modesto, California, to conduct the interrogation. The motion hearing record reflects that Sergeant Coppenrath learned of the defendant\u2019s true identity on March 17, 2000, left the next day for California, and interviewed the defendant later that day. The interrogation of the defendant by Sergeant Coppenrath did not exceed six hours, even when one includes travel time from the jail to the sheriff\u2019s department office. Therefore, we conclude that neither the letter nor the spirit of the <em>Rosario </em>safe harbor rule was violated by this interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">c. Third, the defendant argues that the recorded statements that the defendant made to his son\u2019s mother on the telephone while Sergeant Coppenrath was not in the room must be suppressed because the defendant did not consent to the recording of this conversation. We earlier concluded, <em>supra </em>at 395, that the record supports the judge\u2019s finding that the defendant was informed before he made this telephone call that the police <em>intended </em>to videotape the interview, even if it does not support her finding that the defendant knew before he made this call that the videotape recording equipment was actually running. Therefore, when the defendant telephoned his son\u2019s mother, the defendant had been placed on notice that the police intended to record what was said in the interview room; he simply did not know whether they actually were recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Under Federal law, California law, and Massachusetts law, the oral interception of the defendant\u2019s statements during this telephone call was not illegal if he knew of, or consented to, the interception. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(d) (2006) (Federal wiretap statute does not prohibit recording of oral communications \u201cwhere one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Novak, </em>531 F.3d 99, 101-102 (1st Cir. 2008); Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 632(c) (West <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>1999) (California wiretap statute does not prohibit recording of oral communications where \u201cparties to the communication may reasonably expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded\u201d); G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4 &amp; C 1 (Massachusetts wiretap statute prohibits wilful interception of oral communication, but \u201cinterception\u201d means to \u201csecretly record\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>370 Mass. 502, 505 &amp; n.4 (1976) (only \u201csecret\u201d interceptions without prior authority are illegal under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99). See also <em>Griggs-Ryan </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>904 F.2d 112, 116 (1st Cir. 1990) (\u201cwe \u2014 and other courts \u2014 have held that [Federal law] affords safe harbor not only for persons who intercept calls with the explicit consent of a conversant but also for those who do so after receiving implied consent\u201d). Because the defendant knew that his words in the interview room were subject to being recorded, the actual interception of his words was not unlawful.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, where the intercepted party is in custody and is informed that his oral communications are subject to electronic monitoring, the recording of those communications is not an \u201cinterception\u201d under the Massachusetts wiretap statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyarsky, </em>452 Mass. 700, 706 (2008). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 507 (recording not secret where intercepted party has actual knowledge of recording).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Moreover, even if it were error to have allowed in evidence the recording of the defendant\u2019s statements to his son\u2019s mother on the telephone when Sergeant Coppenrath was not in the room, the error would be harmless. The only materially incriminating statement the defendant made to his son\u2019s mother while Sergeant Coppenrath was not in the room was that she should tell their son that his father \u201cdid a bad thing a long time ago.\u201d The defendant gave her essentially the same advice moments later, when Sergeant Coppenrath had returned to the room and was listening to the defendant\u2019s side of the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The judge committed no error in allowing the defendant\u2019s statements in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s exclusion from the view. </em>The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>contends that the judge erred in preventing him from being present at the jury view. We conclude that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Through a motion in limine, the Commonwealth sought a pretrial ruling as to whether the jury could view a Monte Carlo automobile that was the same model, make, and year as the one in which the victim was killed, with a mannequin seated in the front passenger seat which had a yellow rod through the mannequin\u2019s head to mark the path of travel of the bullet that killed the victim. The Commonwealth contended that the view would assist the jury in understanding the expert testimony of Lieutenant Martin, who offered the opinion, based on the blood stain pattern analysis and the autopsy results, that the victim was sitting in the front passenger seat when he was shot by a person sitting in the rear seat behind the driver. The judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion after obtaining the Commonwealth\u2019s representation that no testimony would be taken during the view. The view was conducted prior to the opening statements, after the jury were instructed by the judge that the purpose of the view was to help them understand the evidence at trial. Each attorney was permitted at the view to draw the jury\u2019s attention to aspects of the view, but no evidence was taken and no demonstration performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The judge ruled that the defendant had no right to be present for the view and would not be permitted to attend. The defendant timely objected. In making her ruling, the judge found that the defendant posed a risk of flight, as he had been a fugitive from the pending charges for twelve years; the judge stated that she was \u201cvery concerned about security issues.\u201d She offered to allow the defendant to observe the view from a court house window, as the Monte Carlo was in a parking lot within sight of the court house, but the defendant declined her offer. She also offered the defendant the opportunity to conduct his own private viewing before the jury view in the presence of the judge, counsel, and the court reporter, but the defendant declined this offer as well. The defendant reviewed photographs of the view, however, including at least one photograph of the vehicle with the mannequin placed within and the rod protruding through its head, which was admitted in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u201cWe have held repeatedly that a defendant does not have a right to be present during a jury view\u201d under either the Sixth or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>422 Mass. 816, 849 (1996), and cases cited. We do so once more today.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The defendant contends that this view was a demonstrative aid and therefore was so different from an ordinary view as to require his presence at what the defendant contends was a critical stage of the trial. We agree that this was not a typical view, but we conclude that it was still a view for all intents and purposes, in that no testimony was taken or demonstration performed, and the jury were instructed that the purpose of the view was to assist them in understanding the evidence at trial. If the automobile could have fit into the court room, the Commonwealth would have been permitted to use the automobile as a visual aid to help the jury understand the subsequent expert testimony of Lieutenant Martin. Because it would not fit, the jury could see it only through a view. As with a more typical view, the purpose was to allow the jury visually to understand the trial testimony regarding the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We also note that the evidence supported the judge\u2019s findings regarding the security risk posed by allowing the defendant to be present during the jury view. We consider as well the judge\u2019s willingness to make alternative arrangements to accommodate the defendant: she offered to allow the defendant to be escorted to the parking lot to see the vehicle without the jury present and to monitor the jury view through a court house window. In these circumstances, the judge acted well within her broad discretion in imposing reasonable conditions and restrictions regarding the defendant\u2019s observation of the visual aid. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>438 Mass. 142, 151 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>423 Mass. 288, 291 (1996).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">3. <em>Witness\u2019s compelled testimony. </em>During voir dire testimony, Joseph Valente invoked his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12. In order to determine whether Valente had a valid privilege, the judge ordered Valente, who no longer resided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Massachusetts at the time of the trial, to testify as to when he had established domicil in Florida.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Based on Valente\u2019s testimony, the judge determined that Valente had no valid privilege because the statute of limitations as to any criminal liability he may have had as an accessory after the fact to the murder had expired before he moved to Florida. At a subsequent voir dire, Valente\u2019s attorney informed the judge that Valente had moved to Florida three years earlier than he had previously testified, which would have meant that the statute of limitations had not run by the date of trial. The judge rejected the attorney\u2019s proffer, reminded Valente that he was still under oath, and invited the prosecutor to ask voir dire questions. Valente asked to speak with his attorney, and the judge refused, declaring that he had already had \u201cample opportunity to consult with his attorney.\u201d When Valente invoked his privilege against self-incrimination, the judge ordered him to answer the prosecutor\u2019s question and informed him that, if he did not, he would be held in contempt. After Valente agreed to answer questions, defense counsel objected to what he characterized as \u201cthe coerced nature\u201d of Valente\u2019s testimony. Valente later testified at trial before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We need not consider whether the judge erred in compelling Valente to testify or in refusing to permit his attorney to confer with him after he had taken the witness stand during the second voir dire, because the defendant has no standing to challenge these rulings of the judge. Valente\u2019s privilege, to the degree that it may have survived, belonged only to Valente himself, not to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>451 Mass. 566, 578 (2008); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>386 Mass. 345, 349 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 244, 251 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">4. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>Following the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument, the defendant objected to various assertions made by the prosecutor, contending that they were not supported by the evidence. We address each alleged unsupported assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">a. The prosecutor told the jury that Valente had \u201c[pjrobably\u201d said to the police that the defendant told him after the murder that \u201c$5,000 doesn\u2019t go very far.\u201d On direct examination at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>trial, Valente was asked about the police report that described what Valente had told the police about his conversation with the defendant on the night of the murder. The prosecutor asked, \u201cDid you say that [the defendant] said he was scared, alluding to the fact that $5,000 doesn\u2019t go far?\u201d Valente replied, \u201c[Standing here in front of you now, I don\u2019t recall saying that, but if it\u2019s in there, I probably said it.\u201d The evidence at trial shows that the prosecutor did not err in his closing argument by saying that Valente \u201c[p]robably\u201d made that statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">b. In the course of his closing argument, the prosecutor described Valente\u2019s state of mind during his testimony as follows: \u201c[T]ry as he might to not provide any information for his friend \u2014 to this day, I might add \u2014 I would suggest he was evasive. You saw it. He didn\u2019t want to answer any questions. He wasn\u2019t going to give up anything.\u201d The defendant argues that Valente never testified that he was still a friend of the defendant. The prosecutor, however, did not state that Valente remained a friend \u201cto this day,\u201d but that Valente, \u201cto this day,\u201d tried not to provide information that may hurt his \u201cfriend.\u201d Valente testified at trial that he and the defendant became friends before the murder and remained friends even after their business relationship had ended. While Valente denied feeling any loyalty or friendship at the time he spoke to the police, the evidence permitted the prosecutor reasonably to argue that Valente was being evasive when he spoke with the police, and in his testimony at trial, because the defendant had been Valente\u2019s friend and he did not want to help in convicting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">c. The prosecutor told the jury that the victim\u2019s mother testified that \u201cshe saw two people running, chasing [the victim] . . . as they chased him out. . . towards the car.\u201d The defendant claims that the victim\u2019s mother never testified that she saw her son being chased toward the vehicle and that the prosecutor therefore misrepresented her testimony to the jury for the purpose of magnifying its emotional impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The victim\u2019s mother testified that, just before midnight on the night her son was killed, a person she did not know (whom the evidence suggested was Tessier) came to her home and asked her son to help him because \u201cthey\u201d were after him. She then heard a number of persons running around her house and banging on the back door. The victim said he was \u201cgoing out\u201d and left through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the front door. She looked out the window and saw her son and two \u201ckids\u201d running in the same direction \u2014 to the right of her house, in the direction of the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In short, the evidence supported the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the victim\u2019s mother saw her son being chased by two people. The defendant is correct that she did not say that she saw the victim being chased \u201ctowards the car.\u201d The prosecutor, however, did not state that the victim\u2019s mother saw her son being chased toward the vehicle; he simply argued that the jury could infer that this was the direction they were running because the victim ultimately ended up in the vehicle. Indeed, the jury could not reasonably have understood the prosecutor to have said that the victim\u2019s mother saw her son being chased \u201ctowards the car,\u201d because she would not have known at that time that the \u201ckids\u201d she described had come to her house in a particular vehicle. The prosecutor did not misrepresent the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">d. Finally, the prosecutor told the jury that Brian Madden telephoned his brother, Mark, at approximately 12:30 a.m. just after the shooting, and then telephoned the police from his house minutes later. The defendant argues that there was no evidence that the emergency call placed to the police was made by Brian Madden. At trial, the police civilian telephone operator who answered the call testified that it was made by an unidentified male, who said in an excited voice that there had been a shooting, that he wanted a detective sent to a particular address (which was that of Brian Madden\u2019s home), and that the caller \u201cwas going to be there.\u201d Mark Madden testified that Brian telephoned him shortly after midnight from his home, that he told Brian to \u201cstay there,\u201d and that he then went immediately to Brian\u2019s house.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When Mark arrived at Brian\u2019s home about two minutes later, Brian and his wife were there, and police officers had arrived. From this evidence, the jury reasonably could have inferred that either Brian or Mark telephoned the police. Because Mark Madden did not testify that he telephoned the police, the more reasonable inference was that Brian did. Consequently, the prosecutor\u2019s argument that Brian made the telephone call rested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>on reasonable inferences from the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>432 Mass. 623, 628 (2000) (inference drawn by prosecutor from evidence \u201cneed not be necessary and inescapable, only reasonable and possible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that there is no basis on which to find that the assertions the defendant challenged in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument were improper. All were reasonably supported by the evidence and by reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">5. <em>The </em>Cunneen <em>factors. </em>The defendant claims that the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that, to find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree on a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty, they must unanimously find one of the factors set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 227 (1989). The jury need not unanimously agree on which of the <em>Cunneen </em>factors they have found in order to convict a defendant of murder in the first degree on a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty, because \u201cthese factors are \u2018evidentiary considerations,\u2019 not elements of the crime or separate theories of culpability.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Obershaw, </em>435 Mass. 794, 809 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunter, 427 </em>Mass. 651, 656-658 (1998). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the judgment of conviction and, based on our review of the record, find no reason to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to grant the defendant any other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Merritt had seen the defendant in possession of a .380 caliber handgun one or two days before the shooting. Tessier had seen the defendant with a .380 caliber firearm on the day of the shooting. The police did not locate the firearm used in the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Two latent fingerprints were found on the Monte Carlo, one on the passenger door and another on the passenger door window. The fingerprint on the passenger door matched the victim\u2019s fingerprints; the other fingerprint did not match either the victim\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s fingerprints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The judge orally ruled on the motion to suppress on the first day of trial before jury selection commenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Lieutenant Markum testified that the videotape camera was clearly visible on the wall directly in front of the couch on which the defendant was sitting, between ten and fifteen feet away, and was pointed out toward the defendant, but he recalled no conversation in the presence of the defendant about recording or videotaping the interview. Nor did he turn on the videotape recording equipment in the interview room; he started the videotape from the nearby videotape recording room once he figured out how it functioned, which took him between two and five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">In his report, which was admitted in evidence at the motion hearing, Sergeant Coppenrath wrote that the defendant \u201cwas told that there was audio and video which would be available to record his statement,\u201d but that he and the defendant did not learn that the interview was being recorded until several minutes after its start. While the interview was being recorded, Sergeant Coppenrath told the defendant: \u201cHere\u2019s what will happen if you want to talk. You\u2019re on tape \u2014 audio or video. Go through your rights; you\u2019ll explain in your words. I\u2019ll ask some questions.\u201d Sergeant Coppenrath, however, did not initially know whether the sheriff\u2019s detectives had actually recorded the interview. Midway through the interview, he told the defendant, \u201cI don\u2019t know if those tapes are on or not,\u201d and asked the defendant if it mattered to him. The defendant shook his head \u201cno.\u201d Only later, toward the end of the interview, after the defendant had spoken with his son\u2019s mother, did Sergeant Coppenrath and the defendant learn that the videotape equipment had indeed been recording the interview when the sergeant asked the detectives in the defendant\u2019s presence if the recorder was \u201con,\u201d and was told that it was.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\">The defendant does not challenge on appeal the voluntariness of the statements he made to Sergeant Coppenrath.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Sergeant Coppenrath testified at the motion hearing that, after the defendant said he was thinking that he might need a lawyer, \u201cHe would be asked, . . . \u2018Do you want one?\u2019 \u201d On cross-examination, however, the sergeant admitted that he did not actually ask the defendant any questions as to whether he wanted to speak to an attorney that would have resolved the ambiguity, but instead went on to discuss how cold it was in the room. The judge made no findings as to whether the sergeant sought clarification from the defendant as to whether he wanted to confer with counsel. The United States Supreme Court has declared that, when there is ambiguity as to whether the defendant has invoked his right to counsel, it is generally \u201cgood police practice\u201d for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>interviewing officer to seek clarification from the suspect as to whether he wishes to speak to an attorney, but it has declined to adopt a rule requiring such clarifying questions. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 461 (1994). We, too, agree that it is good police practice to ask clarifying questions.

The defendant did not object at trial to these statements, and we need not address them because, even if they were error, they posed no risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
