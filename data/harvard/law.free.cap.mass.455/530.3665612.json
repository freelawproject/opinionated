L. c. 265, \u00a7 16 (count one); armed home invasion, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C (count two); and five related crimes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 6, 2009, he pleaded guilty to all charges. On count one, the attempted murder charge, the judge imposed a sentence of from five years to five years and one day in State prison. On count two, the armed home invasion charge, she sentenced the defendant to five years\u2019 probation with conditions, to follow the sentence imposed on the attempted murder charge. On the remaining counts, she imposed five-year terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>probation, each to run concurrently with the probationary term imposed on count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The Commonwealth petitioned for relief in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, arguing that the sentence imposed on the armed home invasion conviction contravened the provisions of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, as amended through St. 2004, c. 150, \u00a7 17 (\u00a7 18C), which the Commonwealth contends does not permit a probationary sentence in lieu of a mandatory minimum twenty-year term of incarceration. A single justice of this court reserved and reported the case without decision to the full court. In light of the successive changes the Legislature has made to \u00a7 18C since 1998, we find the statute ambiguous with respect to whether it currently permits a sentence of probation. The rule of lenity, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Crosscup, 369 Mass. 228, 234 (1975), therefore comes into play, and we are constrained to conclude that \u00a7 18C in its present form does allow a judge to impose a probationary sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The unusual history of the armed home invasion statute directs our decision. The original version of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, inserted by St. 1993, c. 333, consisted of two sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">\u201c[1] Whoever knowingly enters the dwelling place of another knowing or having reason to know that one or more persons are present within or knowingly enters the dwelling place of another and remains in such dwelling place knowing or having reason to know that one or more persons are present within while armed with a dangerous weapon, uses force or threatens the imminent use of force upon any person within such dwelling place whether or not injury occurs, or intentionally causes any injury to any person within such dwelling place shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of not less than twenty years. [2] The sentence imposed upon a person who, after having been convicted of violating any provision of this section, commits a second or subsequent offense under the provisions of this section shall not be suspended or placed on probation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">In 1998, the Legislature amended \u00a7 18C by inserting, between the statute\u2019s first and second sentence, three sentences concerning the commission of the crime with specified types of firearms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u2014 thereby converting the original second sentence into the fifth sentence of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Following this court\u2019s decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>431 Mass. 772 (2000),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Appeals Court\u2019s decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. Berte, 57 Mass. App. Ct. 29 (2003),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Legislature amended the statute again in 2004. See St. 2004, c. 150, \u00a7 17. The 2004 amendment deleted the second, third, fourth, and fifth sentences of the 1998 version of the section. As a result, \u00a7 18C, which has not been amended since 2004, now consists of a single sentence and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">\u201cWhoever knowingly enters the dwelling place of another knowing or having reason to know that one or more persons are present within or knowingly enters the dwelling place of another and remains in such dwelling place knowing or having reason to know that one or more persons are present within while armed with a dangerous weapon, uses force or threatens the imminent use of force upon any person within such dwelling place whether or not injury occurs, or intentionally causes any injury to any person within such dwelling place shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for Ufe or for any term of not less than twenty years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, as amended through St. 2004, c. 150, \u00a7 17. Notably, the 2004 amendment removed all references to proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>tian in the section, even the one that was in \u00a7 18C as originally enacted in 1993. See St. 1993, c. 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>449 Mass. 183 (2007), the court considered a provision concerning probation ineligibility in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18B, as amended through St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 56, that is similar to one of the provisions inserted into \u00a7 18C in 1998, but deleted in 2004.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We held that the provision prohibited probation as a disposition for any person convicted under \u00a7 18B. <em>Id. </em>at 190-191. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 721 (1984) (interpreting almost identical language about probation ineligibility in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, as amended by St. 1980, c. 409, as precluding defendant from receiving sentence of probation). As the statutes reviewed in these two cases illustrate, when the Legislature intends to bar probation, it knows how to say so explicitly. In this context, the Legislature\u2019s decision in 2004 to remove <em>all </em>language from \u00a7 18C that expressly prohibited probation leaves a question in our minds regarding its intent with respect to the availability of a probationary sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the fact that the current version of \u00a7 18C does not contain specific language prohibiting a probationary sentence is not dispositive. It goes on to argue that even if \u00a7 18C as originally enacted in 1993 implicitly permitted probation for first-time offenders in the first sentence of the statute by expressly barring probation for subsequent offenders in the second and final sentence, because the Legislature removed that express bar in 2004, the statute should now be read to prohibit a probationary sentence for all offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The Commonwealth is correct that the Legislature \u201cis not restricted to one means of expression\u201d in establishing a sentencing scheme, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>431 Mass. at 776, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201cneed not, at its peril, use the exact same formula for each statutory provision in order to achieve a particular result.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>449 Mass. 227, 232-233 (2007). However, while it is possible to read the Legislature\u2019s removal of the final sentence of \u00a7 18C to signify, as the Commonwealth suggests, that a disposition of probation is not available to <em>any </em>offender, we cannot say with certainty that the Legislature intended this result. It seems reasonable to assume that the 2004 amendment was in some respects a response to the invitations in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 780-781, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berte, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. at 34, to clarify the 1998 amendment. (See notes 3 &amp; 4, <em>supra.) </em>As the defendant suggests, the removal of three explicit prohibitions against probationary sentences for specific categories of offenders may indicate a legislative intent to give a sentencing judge the power, in appropriate situations, to impose a term of probation in lieu of incarceration. \u201c[A]mbiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosscup, </em>369 Mass. 228, 234 (1975), quoting <em>Rewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 808, 812 (1971). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>395 Mass. 20, 29 (1985). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>450 Mass. 55, 59-60 (2007). Therefore, we hold that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, as amended through St. 2004, c. 150, \u00a7 17, does not prohibit a judge from sentencing the defendant to probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">We recognize that this result, which has the effect of offering a sentencing judge a choice between probation and a mandatory minimum prison term of twenty years,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> may seem contrary to common sense. Standing alone, the statutory language in the first sentence of \u00a7 18C, \u201cshall be punished by imprisonment . . . for life or for any term of not less than twenty years,\u201d would suggest a legislative intent that a defendant convicted under the statute could be sentenced to only a term of incarceration, not probation. However, we must read this language in the context of the 1998 and 2004 amendments, and for the reasons we have discussed, they render ambiguous what might otherwise be clear.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652-653 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Section 18C has caused confusion in the past with respect to the penalty portion of the statute, and this is not the first time that such confusion has yielded what may appear to be an anomalous result. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>450 Mass. at 60 (reducing conviction of felony-murder in first degree to felony-murder in second degree because armed home invasion not punishable by life imprisonment under 1998 version of \u00a7 18C).* **<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We again invite the Legislature to clarify G.

We did not address whether the statute permitted in the alternative a sentence of probation because the issue was not raised. As for the 1998 amendment to \u00a7 18C (St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 57), we pointed out that it was \u201clacking in coherence\u201d and \u201cproblematic for several reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780.

App. Ct. 29, 30-33 (2003), the Appeals Court did construe the language inserted into \u00a7 18C by the 1998 amendment, holding that \u00a7 18C, as amended by St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 57, was not unconstitutionally vague but that it did not authorize a judge to sentence a defendant convicted of armed home invasion with a firearm to a maximum prison term of twenty years and one day, because under the terms of the 1998 amendment, the permissible maximum term for an armed home invasion with a firearm was twenty years. <em>Id. </em>at 32. In dicta, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that \u00a7 18C as amended contained inconsistent probation provisions, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">\u201cThe statute begins by prohibiting probation, goes on to prohibit probation for anyone over the age of seventeen, and concludes by prohibiting probation for repeat offenders. At first glance, nothing more seems to be happening than a prohibition of probation, but the defendant claims that the additional provisos seem to allow probation in certain circumstances. We encourage the Legislature to examine this part of the statute and amend it if our interpretation does not comport with its intention, but we determine that the only rule to be gleaned from the statute as written is that probation is prohibited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 34. The Appeals Court decided <em>Berte </em>prior to the 2004 amendment that removed all language in \u00a7 18C prohibiting probation, and we need not decide whether we agree with the court\u2019s analysis of those provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The pertinent language in G.
