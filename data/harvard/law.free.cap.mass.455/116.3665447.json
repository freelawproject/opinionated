Bildman liable to his former employer, Astra USA, Inc. (Astra),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for fraud, conversion, waste of corporate assets, breach of fiduciary duty, and sexual harassment of Astra employees, and awarded Astra damages in the aggregate amount of $1,040,812. The same jury found Astra not liable to Bildman for breach of a 1993 employment agreement between the parties (employment agreement), but awarded Bildman $203,691 in damages related to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>March, 1996, supplemental stock grant. The jury returned verdicts against Bildman on his claims of intentional interference with contract against Hakan Mogren and Carl-Gustaf Johansson, two officials of Astra\u2019s Swedish parent corporation, Astra AB. Prior to trial, the judge dismissed on summary judgment Bildman\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees and costs (attorney\u2019s fees) under the employment agreement and his libel action against Astra, Mogren, and Johansson; she also ruled that Astra could not rescind the employment agreement. Following a posttrial evidentiary hearing, the judge ruled that Astra could not recover by forfeiture the compensation it paid to Bildman from 1990 through his termination in June, 1996, the period in which he committed the breach of his fiduciary obligations to Astra.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Final judgment on all claims of all parties in the consolidated actions entered on January 30, 2006. Following the denial of Bildman\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or alternatively for a new trial, and his motion to alter or amend the final judgment, the parties cross-appealed. We transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Five questions emerge on appeal from this lengthy and complex trial. Three are presented by Astra: (1) Did the Superior Court judge err in ruling that Astra was <em>not </em>entitled to rescind the employment agreement? (2) Did the judge err in the manner in which she applied New York law to the forfeiture issue? (3) Did the judge err in not allowing Astra to recover damages from Bildman for its costs of investigating charges of sexual harassment at Astra by Bildman and others? Bildman presses two issues on appeal: (4) Did the judge err in ruling that Astra had no obligation to pay Bildman\u2019s legal fees and costs in the consolidated actions? (5) Was summary judgment properly entered against Bildman on his libel claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">On review of the voluminous record and the judge\u2019s orders and well-reasoned memoranda of decision, we affirm the judgments against Astra on the issues of rescission and recovery of its sexual harassment investigation costs. We also affirm the judgments against Bildman on the issues of his attorney\u2019s fees and his libel claims. We reverse the judgment denying Astra recovery of compensation it paid to Bildman during the period of his disloyalty \u2014 $5,599,097 in salary and $1,180,000 in bonuses. We affirm the jury\u2019s verdict awarding Bildman $203,691 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>in damages related to the supplemental stock grant, because on appeal Astra has waived any claim of forfeiture of that award. As we explain more fully below, the judge\u2019s forfeiture rulings are incompatible with the law of New York, the State where Astra is incorporated,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which in the circumstances of this case requires forfeiture of the salary and bonuses Bildman earned during the period of his disloyalty. We remand the case to the Superior Court for entry of judgments consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We now summarize the salient facts, necessarily in some detail because of the scope of the legal issues. Our factual summary draws on the evidence presented to the jury and the judge\u2019s findings on the remainder, which we supplement with uncontroverted material of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>Astra is a pharmaceutical company incorporated in New York, with its principal place of business in Westborough. During the relevant times, it was one of many worldwide subsidiaries of Astra AB, which is a Swedish pharmaceutical manufacturing corporation publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1981, Bildman, a Swedish national, became president and chief executive officer of Astra (then called Astra Pharmaceuticals), and served as a member of the boards of directors of Astra and Astra Germany. In 1993, he and Astra entered into an employment agreement, which was in effect from July 1, 1993, until his employment was terminated on June 25, 1996.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In 1988, Hakan Mogren became the president and chief executive officer of Astra AB. Among other things, he established a strategic goal to increase Astra\u2019s presence in the United States pharmaceutical market. Bildman successfully implemented this strategy by, among other things, effecting what the judge termed \u201csignificant management changes\u201d and creating a new \u201cRx <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Division,\u201d which targeted the so-called \u201cgeneral practitioner market,\u201d the sector of the pharmaceutical industry focused on outpatients and physicians\u2019 offices.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By 1995, the Rx Division employed a sales force of approximately 500. Although the Rx Division was not profitable during Bildman\u2019s tenure, Astra and Astra AB had expected that result. From 1991 to 1996, Astra\u2019s over-all profit met or exceeded the goals established for it by the parent company, and Bildman\u2019s salary and bonuses rose steadily.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1995, Mogren promoted Carl-Gustaf Johansson to the position of Astra AB Regional Director for North America. The newly created position gave Johansson direct supervisory authority over Astra and Bildman. Johansson and Bildman soon were in dispute over the strategic direction of Astra, the details of which we need not recite.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In December, 1995, Bildman learned that Business Week was investigating allegations of sexual harassment at Astra committed by him and other members of Astra\u2019s senior management. At the time, neither Astra\u2019s nor Astra AB\u2019s board of directors was aware of sexual harassment \u201cproblems\u201d at Astra. There was in fact a problem, and it centered on Bildman. As early as 1985, Bildman had authorized and personally signed a \u201cconsulting agreement\u201d for his former secretary, with compensation of $3,164 per month. The former secretary testified at trial that she left the company after she had been forced to have sexual relations with Bildman. In 1993, Bildman authorized a settlement payment of approximately $25,000 to another female employee who had filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination alleging that he had sexually harassed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>her. In 1994, Bildman ordered Astra\u2019s general counsel to pay $50,000 to settle a sexual harassment claim against him by another female employee, as well as a payment of $95,000 to an employee who claimed that she had been fired in retaliation for reporting a complaint of sexual assault by another member of Astra\u2019s senior management. In early 1996, Bildman authorized a payment by Astra of $100,000 to settle sexual harassment claims against him by yet another former Astra employee (also female). Each of these settlement agreements was confidential and, among other things, prohibited the complainant from cooperating with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in any investigation of sexual harassment at Astra. At all relevant times, Astra had a written sexual harassment policy that forbade the acts alleged to have been committed by Bildman and other male executives with his knowledge or condonation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In a December 19, 1995, telephone conference, Bildman; Charles Yon, Astra\u2019s corporate counsel; and Astra\u2019s outside employment counsel informed Johansson and other Astra AB officials of the Business Week investigation of allegations of sexual harassment at Astra. Bildman then assembled a task force, comprised of Yon and outside attorneys and consultants, to monitor and investigate the Business Week probe. The task force was not set up to investigate the merits of the sexual harassment claims but rather to determine Business Week\u2019s sources of information and to control the flow of information to Business Week and Astra AB. In a January 15, 1996, letter, Bildman informed Mogren that Business Week was investigating \u201calleged incidents of sexual harassment at Astra,\u201d that Astra was conducting an \u201cextensive investigation\u201d of the development, and that Astra was \u201cpositive there is no basis for such a story and believe[s] that it is very unlikely that an article will be written.\u201d The letter did not mention that Bildman himself was a target of the Business Week inquiry, although Bildman knew this was the case. Bildman subsequently forwarded to Mogren and Johansson a task force report prepared on or about January 16, 1996, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>copy of which was entered in evidence, which concluded that Astra had a good record concerning sexual harassment, and that the Business Week investigation likely was instigated by an Astra competitor, a position Bildman continued to maintain throughout the early spring to Astra AB executives and to Astra\u2019s board of directors.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">At a meeting of Astra\u2019s board in March, 1996, Bildman, at the suggestion of Mogren and Johansson, made a presentation about the Business Week matter. With him was Yon and another Astra employee, who assured the board that Astra had \u201cvery good records\u201d concerning sexual harassment claims and that its statistics on sexual harassment over the previous eight to ten years compared favorably with those of comparably sized companies. At one point during the board meeting Mogren asked all three employees whether Astra had anything \u201cto be ashamed of\u201d in relation to sexual harassment charges. Yon answered that it did not. At a meeting in Stresa, Italy, in mid-April, Bildman again assured Astra AB officials of Astra\u2019s allegedly good record on sexual harassment, even though he also stated that he feared that Business Week was about to publish an article about widespread sexual harassment at Astra.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">From that point, events unfolded quickly. On April 16, Mark Maremont of Business Week wrote a two-page letter asking to speak with Bildman and Astra AB about \u201cserious allegations of sexual harassment\u201d at Astra, including allegations concerning Bildman. That same day, Maremont also sent a letter to Mogren in Sweden that enclosed his letter to Bildman and offered an opportunity for Astra AB to respond to the allegations. The next day, April 17, Yon sent a letter to Maremont denying the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tians and offering to meet with Maremont if Maremont provided more details about the charges. Maremont responded on April 18 with a seven-page letter to Yon offering additional substantiation, and on April 19 Yon forwarded a copy of the letter to Mogren, Johansson, and other Astra AB officials.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On receiving the letter, Johansson; Astra AB general counsel, Goran Lerenius; and Thomas Clauss, Jr., a partner in the law firm of Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &amp; Roberts (Winthrop Stimson), went to Astra\u2019s headquarters in Westborough to conduct their own investigation. On April 22 and April 23, they interviewed Astra employees, including Bildman, about the Business Week allegations. As a result of its investigation, on April 28, 1996, the board of directors of Astra voted unanimously to suspend Bildman with pay, to appoint an interim president-chief executive officer of Astra, to create a special committee chaired by Johansson to investigate \u201callegations of sexual harassment and other improprieties or failures to abide by policies and procedures\u201d of Astra, and to report its findings to the full board. The special committee subsequently retained Winthrop Stimson to conduct the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Johansson informed Bildman by letter of the board\u2019s decisions and asked Bildman that he both cooperate fully in the investigation and refrain from contacting any current or former Astra employees about it. Bildman did neither. He refused repeated requests from the Winthrop Stimson investigators to be interviewed. In addition, he and Lars Magnusson, a consultant at Astra whom Bildman had hired in January, 1996, contacted former and current Astra employees, asking them to deny that Bildman ever acted improperly toward female employees, and threatened others with termination or adverse publicity if they cooperated with Winthrop Stimson. The jury also heard evidence that, at Bildman\u2019s direction and without the knowledge of Astra\u2019s board, Magnusson set up a five-employee satellite office from which he shredded corporate documents; that he and Bildman removed Astra documents, including financial documents, from Bildman\u2019s office; and that after receiving a telephone call from Bildman, Magnusson had company computers \u201cerased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In addition to uncovering evidence of pervasive sexual harass<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ment of female Astra employees by Bildman and others in senior management, and evidence of the threats to employees and destruction of company documents mentioned above, the Winthrop Stimson investigation found, and the jury heard evidence of, serious financial and other improprieties.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In early May, 1996, Maremont\u2019s article appeared as the cover story in Business Week, under the title \u201cAbuse of power: The astonishing tale of sexual harassment at Astra USA.\u201d Business Week reported that it had interviewed \u201cmore than 70 former and current employees\u201d and found \u201ca disturbing pattern of complaints during much of Bildman\u2019s 15-year tenure,\u201d including \u201ca dozen cases of women who claimed they were either fondled or solicited for sexual favors by Bildman or other [Astra] executives.\u201d Not surprisingly, the Business Week article drew national and international attention. Reports about sexual harassment at Astra and by Bildman appeared in the Boston Globe, the Providence Journal-Bulletin, the Wall Street Journal, and in over 150 articles in various publications worldwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">On June 25, 1996, Astra\u2019s board of directors voted to rescind the employment agreement and terminate Bildman\u2019s employment for cause,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and he was so notified by letter. In February, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>1998, the EEOC filed a complaint against Astra alleging a pattern and practice of sexual harassment of Astra female employees since \u201cat least January 1, 1993 and continuing.\u201d The complaint resulted in a consent decree in which Astra, although not admitting liability, established a $9,850,000 fund to compensate victims of sexual harassment at the company.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">2. <em>Procedural background. </em>On February 4, 1998, Astra filed suit in the Superior Court against Bildman for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and the duties of good faith and loyalty, waste of corporate assets, rescission of the 1993 employment agreement, and conversion. It sought a declaratory judgment that it had properly rescinded the employment agreement, and damages on the remaining counts. Bildman counterclaimed against Astra and third-party defendant Astra AB for, as amended, breach of contract, violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148 (fair wage practices act), and indemnification of attorney\u2019s costs and expenses for the civil action and for \u201csuccessfully defending\u201d the criminal action. Bildman also filed an action against Astra, Mogren, and Johansson for malicious libel, negligent libel, and libel per se. The two actions were consolidated, and were specifically assigned to one judge in the Superior Court. Of relevance to this appeal are the following proceedings in the consolidated cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In December, 2000, the judge granted Bildman summary judgment on Astra\u2019s claim for a judgment declaring that it properly rescinded the employment agreement. In October, 2001, the judge granted Astra\u2019s summary judgment motion on all of Bildman\u2019s libel claims on the ground that Bildman was a \u201climited public figure\u201d and could not maintain a claim for negligent libel, citing <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 345 (1974). The judge also denied Bildman\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, concluding that the issue turned on whether Astra had terminated Bildman\u2019s employment for cause, a matter to be determined by a jury. The parties\u2019 remaining claims were tried before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The trial commenced in January, 2002, and took more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>seven weeks. On February 21, 2002, the jury found Bildman liable to Astra for fraud, conversion, waste, and breach of fiduciary duty by, in the words of the verdict form, \u201cmaking affirmative misrepresentation or failing to disclose to Astra material information which he had a duty to disclose,\u201d and for \u201cimproper use of Astra funds.\u201d As noted, the jury awarded Astra damages in the aggregate amount of $1,040,812. Further, the jury found that Bildman engaged in sexual harassment of Astra employees and that he retaliated against Astra employees who had exercised their rights to make complaints under Astra\u2019s sexual harassment policy. (The verdict form did not provide for additional damages for these acts.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">As to Bildman\u2019s claims, the jury found that Astra did not commit a breach of the employment agreement in terminating Bildman or with regard to Astra\u2019s profit sharing plan. The jury also found against Bildman on his claims that Mogren and Johansson intentionally interfered with his employment contract with Astra. Finally, the jury found that Bildman did not fraudulently induce Astra to enter into a March, 1996, supplemental stock grant, and awarded him $203,691 under the agreement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Both parties filed postjudgment motions for relief. Astra renewed its request for rescission of the employment agreement, and requested rescission of the 1996 stock agreement, forfeiture of all of Bildman\u2019s compensation from 1991 to 1996,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> setoff, and punitive damages. On May 5, 2005, the judge issued a memorandum of decision and order permitting setoff of Bildman\u2019s $203,691 jury award against Astra\u2019s damages, refused to revisit her pretrial rulings on rescission, held that Astra was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of forfeiture limited to the issue whether Bildman\u2019s compensation exceeded the value of his services for the period 1991-1996, and declined Astra\u2019s further requests for postjudgment relief. The judge held an evidentiary hearing on the forfeiture claim and ruled that Astra was not entitled to recover any amount by way of forfeiture because the value of Bildman\u2019s services was commensurate with his value to the company through 1996. Bildman renewed his motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>indemnification and for attorney\u2019s fees, which the judge denied on May 5, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We now proceed to consider the five issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">3. <em>Rescission. </em>Astra claims that it properly rescinded the 1993 employment agreement because during contract negotiations Bildman failed to disclose material information about his own breaches of fiduciary duty, which (Astra claims) he had an affirmative duty to do as a company officer and director. The judge granted Bildman\u2019s summary judgment motion on Astra\u2019s rescission claim. The judge reasoned, in essence, that Astra had failed to establish that Bildman affirmatively misrepresented any material fact during the negotiations of the employment agreement, and that it would be inequitable to permit rescission three years after the inception of the employment agreement where Astra never inquired about the conduct in question. She declined to revisit her ruling after the verdict when Astra again sought rescission of the employment agreement and the supplemental stock grant based on the jury\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">On appeal Astra maintains that Bildman, as president and chief executive officer of Astra, had fiduciary obligations to Astra that required him to disclose his disloyal acts in the course of negotiating his 1993 employment agreement with Astra, and that his silence concerning them was an affirmative misrepresentation. See, e.g., <em>Geller </em>v. <em>Allied-Lyons PLC, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 120, 125-126, 127 (1997) (agreement void and unenforceable where corporate fiduciary gave, at best, only \u201csotto voce indications\u201d of his self-interested dealings to his principal; \u201cfull and fair disclosure\u201d of self-dealing was required). Bildman counters that, while he was negotiating the employment agreement with Astra, he was a \u201cprivate individual\u201d engaged in an arm\u2019s-length transaction, whose fiduciary obligations to the company were effectively held in abeyance.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The employment agreement states that it shall be construed and enforced \u201cin accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>of Massachusetts,\u201d and neither party contends otherwise. Under our law, rescission is an equitable remedy, within the judge\u2019s sound discretion. See <em>Coggins </em>v. <em>New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 525, 536 (1986); <em>Augustine </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902 (1999) (\u201crescission is an equitable remedy awarded at the discretion of the court\u201d). Both because we discern no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s rulings on rescission and because our conclusions below on the issue of forfeiture make the remedy of rescission duplicative, at least with respect to Bildman\u2019s salary and bonuses,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we will not disturb the judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Bildman on Astra\u2019s rescission claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">4. <em>Forfeiture, </em>a. <em>Introduction. </em>As noted earlier, the judge reserved the issue of forfeiture for judicial determination, if necessary, following the jury\u2019s verdict. Cf. <em>Ulico Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman &amp; Dicker, </em>56 A.D.3d 1, 13 (N.Y. 2008) (forfeiture of attorney\u2019s compensation during period of alleged disloyalty is factual issue to be decided posttrial on full record, if necessary). After the jury found Bildman liable to Astra for breach of fiduciary duty, Astra moved for postjudgment equitable relief on its forfeiture claim. The judge correctly determined that New York law governed that claim. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>NetCentric Corp., </em>433 Mass. 465, 470-471 (2001). See note 4, <em>supra. </em>She ordered an evidentiary hearing on forfeiture limited to the question whether Bildman\u2019s compensation during the period of his disloyalty, 1991 through 1996, exceeded the value of his services. Based on her determination that Astra failed to prove that Bildman\u2019s compensation exceeded the value of his benefit to Astra, and that forfeiture of all of Bildman\u2019s compensation would impose a \u201cdisproportionately harsh\u201d penalty on Bildman, the judge declined to exercise her discretion to order repayment of his salary and bonuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Astra continues to maintain that, under New York\u2019s strict application of the forfeiture doctrine, Bildman must forfeit all of his salary and bonuses from 1991 through 1996, an amount in excess of $5 million.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It argues that the judge erred as a matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>and abused her equitable powers by limiting the remedy of forfeiture under New York law to Bildman\u2019s compensation in excess of the value of Bildman\u2019s services during the period of disloyalty, 1991 through 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">We review the judge\u2019s forfeiture order de nova, taking into consideration New York\u2019s forfeiture law. See <em>Phansalkar </em>v. <em>Andersen Weinroth &amp; Co., </em>344 F.3d 184, 199 (2d Cir. 2003) (reviewing de nova trial court\u2019s application of New York forfeiture law). The judge appropriately and commendably sought to exercise her equitable powers fairly within what she perceived to be the latitude afforded her by New York law. We reverse because we conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, application of New York\u2019s \u201cfaithless servant\u201d doctrine requires that Bildman forfeit all of his salary and bonuses from Astra for the period of disloyalty and that the judge was without authority to rule otherwise.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">We begin with a brief overview of New York forfeiture law.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">b. <em>Equitable forfeiture under New York law. </em>The remedy of equitable forfeiture in New York is grounded on that State\u2019s law of agency, in particular on its \u201cfaithless servant\u201d doctrine. See generally R.L. Haig, Commercial Litigation in New York State Courts \u00a7 75.51 (2d ed. 2005). Under that doctrine, \u201c[a]n agent is held to uberrima fides [utmost fidelity] in his dealings with his principal, and if he acts adversely to his employer in any part of the transaction, or omits to disclose any interest which would naturally influence his conduct in dealing with the subject of the employment, it amounts to such a fraud upon the principal, as to forfeit <em>any </em>right to compensation for services\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>102 N.Y. 505, 508 (1886). See <em>Lamdin </em>v. <em>Broadway Surface Advertising Corp., </em>272 N.Y. 133, 138 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>(1936) (employee or agent \u201cforfeits his right to compensation for services rendered by him if he proves disloyal\u201d). See also <em>Royal Carbo Corp. </em>v. <em>Flameguard, Inc., </em>229 A.D.2d 430, 430 (N.Y. 1996) (\u201cwell settled that one who owes a duty of fidelity to a principal and who is faithless in the performance of his or her services is generally not entitled to recover compensation, whether commissions or salary\u201d); <em>Soam Corp. </em>v. <em>Trane Co., </em>202 A.D.2d 162, 163 (N.Y. 1994) (\u201cagent is held to the utmost good faith in his dealings with his principal, and forfeits any right to compensation for his services if he acts adversely to his employer\u201d); <em>Bon Temps Agency Ltd. </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>184 A.D.2d 280, 281 (N.Y. 1992) (\u201cdisloyal employee is not entitled to receive compensation, whether commissions or salary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The law of New York requires the disloyal employee to forfeit his compensation even if he otherwise performed valuable services for the principal. As the Court of Appeals of New York stated in its often-cited modem case on forfeiture: \u201cOne who owes a duty of fidelity to a principal and who is faithless in the performance of his services is generally disentitled to recover his compensation, whether commissions or salary .... Nor does it make any difference that the services were beneficial to the principal, or that the principal suffered no provable damage as a result of the breach of fidelity by the agent.\u201d <em>Feiger </em>v. <em>Iral Jewelry, Ltd., </em>41 N.Y.2d 928, 928-929 (1977). This principle was recently reaffirmed in <em>William Floyd Union Free Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>61 A.D.3d 856 (N.Y. 2009), in which the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court reversed a trial court decision limiting forfeiture of retired disloyal employees\u2019 retirement insurance benefits to ten years. The court held that where \u201cdefendants engaged in repeated acts of disloyalty, complete and permanent forfeiture of compensation, deferred or otherwise, is warranted under the faithless servant doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 859.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The mie enunciated in <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Beard, supra; Feiger </em>v. <em>Iral Jewelry, Ltd., supra; </em>and the other cases cited above might seem to imply that disloyal employees and agents must forfeit all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>compensation ever received from the employer. See <em>Phansalkar </em>v. <em>Andersen Weinroth &amp; Co., supra </em>at 204 (noting traditional rule). New York\u2019s intermediate courts, however, have, although not always uniformly or consistently, carved out limitations to absolute forfeiture. For example, Appellate Division decisions generally have limited the period of forfeiture to the period of the employee\u2019s disloyalty. See, e.g., <em>Soam Corp. </em>v. <em>Trane Co., supra </em>at 163 (defrauded principal not liable to disloyal agent for commission fees earned during period of disloyalty); <em>Maritime Fish Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>World-Wide Fish Prods., Inc., </em>100 A.D.2d 81, 91 (N.Y. 1984) (employee who worked for company for approximately seven years must forfeit compensation received during fourteen-month period of disloyalty). Others have required the disloyalty to be substantial and pervasive for forfeiture to apply. See, e.g., <em>Matter of Blumenthal, </em>32 A.D.3d 767, 768 (N.Y. 2006) (\u201cIn light of respondent\u2019s repeated disloyalty throughout his tenure, there is no merit to his assertion that there should have been an apportionment of his salary or . . . commissions as to which disloyalty was not found\u201d). See also <em>Phansalkar </em>v. <em>Andersen, Weinroth &amp; Co., supra </em>at 202 n.13. These limitations are narrow, however, and do not destroy the vitality of the faithless servant doctrine under New York law.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>William Floyd Union Free Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>61 A.D.3d 856, 859 (N.Y. 2009) (where \u201cdefendants engaged in repeated acts of disloyalty, complete and permanent forfeiture of compensation, deferred or otherwise, is warranted under the faithless servant doctrine\u201d).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">c. <em>Application of equitable forfeiture. </em>While acknowledging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>in her posttrial memorandum that New York law governed forfeiture, and that a faithless servant is \u201cgenerally disentitled to recover his compensation\u201d under New York law, the judge offered three reasons why she was \u201cnot persuaded\u201d that Astra was entitled to the \u201cextreme\u201d remedy of forfeiture of all compensation from the commencement of the period of disloyalty. We conclude that the rationales are not supported in New York forfeiture law.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">First, the judge stated that New York forfeiture law requires only that compensation allegedly <em>due </em>to the disloyal employee must be forfeited, and not that compensation already paid must be disgorged. We conclude that applicable New York precedent is to the contrary. See, e.g., <em>Luskin </em>v. <em>Seoane, </em>226 A.D.2d 1144, 1145 (N.Y. 1996) (disgorgement of \u201call compensation and expenses that plaintiff paid\u201d to disloyal employee during period of disloyalty); <em>Maritime Fish Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>World-Wide Fish Prods., Inc., </em>100 A.D.2d 81, 91 (N.Y. 1984) (company \u201centitled to the <em>return </em>of any compensation paid [its employee] during the period of disloyalty\u201d). See also <em>Aramony </em>v. <em>United Way Replacement Benefit Plan, </em>191 F.3d 140, 153-154 &amp; n.6 (2d Cir. 1999) (affirming judge\u2019s order for disgorgement of all salary during period of disloyalty, limited to seven-year statute of limitations period).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In a more recent definitive statement, the Appellate Division found \u201cno merit to [the disloyal employee\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>argument that disgorgement of compensation received by a faithless employee should be disallowed as tantamount to the imposition of punitive damages.\u201d <em>Matter of Blumenthal, </em>32 A.D.2d 767, 768 (N.Y. 2006). In sum, New York law entitles Astra to sums already paid in compensation to Bildman during the period of his disloyalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Second, the judge sought to distinguish Astra\u2019s claim for forfeiture on the ground that New York \u201cgenerally\u201d applies forfeiture only to what she termed \u201clow-level\u201d employees who had diverted corporate opportunities. Again, this is a distinction not supported by New York law. The defendant in <em>Aramony </em>v. <em>United Way Replacement Benefit Plan, supra </em>at 143, 145, was the former president and chief executive officer of a major national charitable corporation who, among other things, improperly used the charity\u2019s funds and filed false expense accounts in order to sustain his extravagant lifestyle. The employee in <em>Matter of Blumenthal, supra, </em>was a former executor who diverted monies from the estate to \u201chimself and his wife and entities with which his wife was affiliated,\u201d falsely claiming that they were incentive payments. See also <em>Maritime Fish Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>World-Wide Fish Prods., Inc., supra </em>(company vice-president diverted corporate opportunities and set up rival business while in company\u2019s employ); <em>Harry R. Defler Corp. </em>v. <em>Kleeman, </em>19 A.D.2d 396, 399-401 (N.Y. 1963), aff'd, 19 N.Y.2d 694 (1967) (general manager vice-president misused company\u2019s confidential information to set up competing company). Like Bildman, see note 13, <em>supra, </em>these defendants were senior executives who used their position for substantial improper personal gain; they were required to forfeit their compensation as a consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Third, and perhaps most significantly, the judge opined that \u201c[rjules of reason and fairness and the lack of New York Court of Appeals decisions mandating forfeiture in all cases of breach of fiduciary duty suggest that this Court should follow a less strict approach in determining how to impose forfeiture.\u201d In other words, the judge reasoned that forfeiture of the entirety of Bildman\u2019s compensation for the period of disloyalty was unfair in light of Bildman\u2019s substantial services to Astra.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judge looked to Massachusetts equitable principles to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>fashion the requirement that Astra was entitled to forfeiture of only the amount of compensation determined after an evidentiary hearing to be in excess of the value of Bildman\u2019s services to the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Reliance on Massachusetts equity law was misplaced.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Massachusetts permits a task-by-task apportionment of forfeiture; New York, the State whose law controls here, does not. Compare <em>Chelsea Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gaffney, </em>389 Mass. 1, 14 (1983), with <em>Maritime Fish Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>World-Wide Fish Prods., Inc., </em>100 A.D.2d 81, 91 (N.Y. 1984) (company \u201centitled to the return of <em>any </em>compensation paid [its employee] during the period of disloyalty\u201d [emphasis added]). Under Massachusetts law, the value of the disloyal employee\u2019s faithful services is determinative; under New York law, it is irrelevant. Compare <em>Meehan </em>v. <em>Shaughnessy, </em>404 Mass. 419, 440 (1989), with <em>Feiger </em>v. <em>Iral Jewelry, Ltd., </em>41 N.Y.2d 928, 928-929 (1977) (makes no difference \u201cthat the services were beneficial to the principal, or that the principal suffered no provable damage as a result of the breach of fidelity by the agent\u201d).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In short, invocation of Massachusetts doctrines of equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>forfeiture to remediate what the judge considered a result contrary to \u201creason and fairness\u201d was not appropriate where settled precedent of New York law requires forfeiture in the circumstances of this case. Bildman argues that the judge\u2019s actions were permissible because, although New York law governs the issue whether an employee committed a breach of his fiduciary duties, Massachusetts remedies may apply if the case is heard in the Commonwealth. To the contrary, to separate the breach and the remedy in this fashion would interfere with New York State\u2019s legitimate interest in regulating the affairs of its corporations. See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>NetCentric Corp., </em>433 Mass. 465, 470-471 (2001), quoting <em>Atherton </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>519 U.S. 213, 224 (1997) (\u201cTo avoid the imposition of \u2018conflicting demands,\u2019 \u2018only one State should have the authority to regulate a corporation\u2019s internal affairs \u2014 matters pecuHar to the relationships among or between the corporation and its current officers, directors, and shareholders\u2019 \u201d). Such regulation extends to imposing the specific penalties the State deems most likely to deter the corporate misconduct it seeks to discourage. The rule urged by Bildman would permit identical employee breaches of disloyalty to New York corporations to be treated differently based on accidents of geography, an unacceptable result.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>NetCentric Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Once it was determined that from 1991 to his termination on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>June 25, 1996, Bildman, a senior employee, officer, and director, had committed numerous and substantial breaches of his fiduciary duties to Astra, forfeiture was warranted of all of Bildman\u2019s compensation for the period of disloyalty, to the extent sought by Astra. See note 20, supra; <em>William Floyd Union Free Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>61 A.D. 3d 856, 859 (N.Y. 2009).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">New York\u2019s forfeiture law has been described as harsh, as the judge determined it to be. Cf. <em>Soam Corp. </em>v. <em>Trane Co., </em>202 A.D.2d 162, 163 (N.Y. 1994) (plaintiff argued that forfeiture is \u201cunconscionable penalty,\u201d but court concluded that this contention was negated by \u201cNew York\u2019s strict application of the forfeiture doctrine\u201d). For New York, however, the harshness of the remedy is precisely the point. See, e.g., <em>Matter of Blumenthal, </em>32 A.D.2d 767, 768 (N.Y. 2006) (\u201cno merit\u201d to respondent\u2019s argument that \u201cdisgorgement of compensation received by a faithless employee should be disallowed as tantamount to the imposition of punitive damages,\u201d and declining invitation to abolish faithless servant doctrine, \u201cwhich has long been the law of this State\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">5. <em>Costs of investigation. </em>The judge refused to permit Astra to argue to the jury that Bildman was liable to the company for the entire $905,080 cost of Winthrop Stimson\u2019s investigation of the sexual harassment claims. She then denied Astra\u2019s motion for postverdict damages for investigative costs in the same amount. She declined to make the award because, among other things, she viewed it as \u201cexcessive\u201d in the circumstances. Astra maintains on appeal that it is entitled to the full $905,080 as the compensatory damage it suffered as a result of Bildman\u2019s misconduct, an issue, it argues, that should have gone to the jury.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The judge did not abuse her discretion in keeping this issue from the jury. The judge noted that the matter of damages for investigative costs \u201chas never squarely been an issue in this case.\u201d She reasoned that, given the number of witnesses that would be required to explore the propriety of each item of services rendered by Winthrop Stimson in its sixty-nine page bill, and its costs, the issue would be too confusing and time-consuming for the jury, which had already been sitting for seven weeks.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durning, </em>406 Mass. 485, 497 (1990) (within judge\u2019s discretion to exclude evidence that, while relevant, presents danger of \u201cconfusion, unfair prejudice, or undue consumption of time\u201d that outweighs probative worth of evidence offered).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We are also unpersuaded that Astra has met its burden of proving to the judge its entitlement to $905,080 in investigation costs.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> See <em>Hawthorne\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Warrenton Realty, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 200, 210 n.7 (1993). Astra correctly asserts that an employer may be entitled to recover for compensatory costs incurred as a result of a breach of fiduciary duty, including the costs of investigation. See <em>Aramony </em>v. <em>United Way Replacement Benefit Plan, </em>191 F.3d 140, 154 (2d Cir. 1999). But the award of damages for investigative costs itself is not an entitlement; the employer must still meet its settled burden of proving that the damages sought were caused by the employee.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> See <em>Chelsea Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gaffney, </em>389 Mass. 1, 18 (1983) (affirming award of specific costs where master found such costs to be \u201cdirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>consequence of the breaches of fiduciary duty by the defendants\u201d). Here the jury found that Bildman\u2019s affirmative and material misrepresentations and improper use of Astra funds was \u201ca substantial factor in causing harm to Astra.\u201d However, merely pointing to these findings, as Astra does, does not satisfy the causation requirement for damages related to investigative costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Nor does the record permit a finding of the necessary causation. At trial, Bildman established decisively, as the judge subsequently noted, that many of the investigative costs that Astra alleged resulted from Bildman\u2019s acts had no direct relationship to Bildman, other than the fact that his own wrongdoing spurred revelations of the wrongdoings of others.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Even accepting Astra\u2019s argument that Bildman\u2019s conduct was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in its choice to conduct a detailed investigation of circumstances at the company, it is established that the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d standard is insufficient to satisfy causation. See, e.g., <em>L.N.C. Invs., Inc. </em>v. <em>First Fid. Bank, </em>173 F.3d 454, 465 (2d Cir. 1999), <em>S.C., </em>308 F.3d 169 (2d Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1033 (2003) (rejecting further use of \u201csubstantial factor\u201d analysis, in favor of causation analysis, where \u201cdamages are sought for breach of fiduciary duty under New York law\u201d). Indeed, the authority cited by Astra to establish in effect its automatic entitlement to the totality of the investigation costs demonstrates the opposite.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In the absence of sufficient evidence on causation regarding the full cost of the investigation, we discern no error in the judge\u2019s characterization of the request as \u201cexcessive.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Even if Bildman\u2019s misconduct was a substantial factor in causing Astra to pay for a wide variety of services, that does not entitle it to recover for services that the judge found to be unrelated to Bildman\u2019s misconduct, simply because the same providers rendered the services and they bore some tangential relationship to Bildman\u2019s behavior. We affirm the denial of Astra\u2019s claim for the totality of its sexual harassment investigative costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">6. <em>Bildman\u2019s legal fees. </em>The judge denied Bildman\u2019s motion for judgment on his counterclaim for legal fees and costs under the employment agreement, and entered judgment for Astra on the counterclaim. Bildman argues, in essence, that the employment agreement, read as a whole, compels a different result and obligates Astra to pay the legal fees and costs of his defense and counterclaims. Alternatively, he claims that, at a minimum, the employment agreement requires Astra to pay the legal fees and costs he incurred in successfully pressing his claim for compensation under the 1996 supplemental stock grant. The Superior Court judge\u2019s ruling on the issue of legal fees and costs is sound, and we will not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">As noted earlier, the employment agreement is expressly governed by Massachusetts law, and our review is plenary. See <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Thermo Elemental Inc., </em>451 Mass. 638, 648 (2008). We construe the employment agreement, whenever possible, as a workable and harmonious whole, in which each provision has meaning and furthers the parties\u2019 intent. See <em>J.A. Sullivan Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>397 Mass. 789, 795 (1986), quoting <em>Charles </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number><em>I. Hosmer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>302 Mass. 495, 501 (1939) (contract must be construed so as to yield \u201ca workable and harmonious means for carrying out and effectuating the intent of the parties\u201d). Our starting point is the language of the employment agreement itself. Here, we are particularly concerned with par. 9 and par. 4 (f), both individually and in concert.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Paragraph 9 of the employment agreement provides, in relevant part, that Astra shall pay to Bildman \u201call reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by him in contesting or disputing <em>any </em>termination of this Agreement or in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement\u201d (emphasis added). Termination is defined by par. 4 (f) to encompass termination by Astra for cause.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> \u201cCause\u201d is therein defined as (i) \u201cthe willful commission ... of theft, embezzlement, fraud or other serious and substantial crimes\u201d against Astra; (ii) \u201cother acts or omissions materially evidencing bad faith toward\u201d Astra; (in) \u201cconviction of. . . any criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust or any felony\u201d; or (iv) \u201cthe willful and egregious refusal or failure of [Bildman] to perform his duties at a level of performance reasonably satisfactory to the Board of Directors\u201d continuing for more than sixty days after written notice by the board of such failure. Paragraph 4 (f) further provides that if Bildman\u2019s employment is terminated for cause, so defined, Astra \u201cshall have <em>no further obligation </em>to [Bildman] hereunder, except any obligation under any compensation or benefit plan in which [Bildman] is then a participant\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Bildman\u2019s interpretation of the employment agreement places foremost emphasis on the word \u201cany\u201d in par. 9. He argues that the parties must have intended to include payment of his legal fees and costs for \u201cany\u201d termination action, including termination for cause, because the only scenario under which Bildman and Astra would likely litigate against each other would be his termination for cause. Fairly read, he argues, the limiting language of par. 4 (f) applies only to Astra\u2019s obligations to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>termination benefits to Bildman beyond those he had earned. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Paragraph 4 (f), which limits Astra\u2019s \u201cobligation[s]\u201d to Bildman where he has been discharged for cause, is unambiguous, as Bildman concedes. The payment of Bildman\u2019s legal fees and costs is a contractual obligation, and the employment agreement does not specify otherwise. The language of par. 4 (f), limiting Astra\u2019s obligation to Bildman where he has defrauded or otherwise wronged the company, is conspicuously absent from the other provisions addressing termination of Bildman\u2019s employment with Astra. We may reasonably assume, as did the judge, that the parties did not intend to establish as a benefit of Bildman\u2019s employment his entitlement to defraud Astra at its own expense. Moreover, in construing the employment agreement to deny Bildman his legal fees and costs, the judge relied on a cardinal principle of contract interpretation under which a more specific contract provision controls a more general provision on the same issue. See <em>Lembo </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 227, 233 (1973), quoting A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 547, at 176 (\u201cIf the apparent inconsistency is between a clause that is general and broadly inclusive in character and one that is more limited and specific in its coverage, the latter should generally be held to operate as a modification and pro tanto nullification of the former\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">We are also unmoved by Bildman\u2019s argument that the judge destroyed the benefit of his bargain by erroneously reading a good faith requirement into par. 9, thus making it duplicative of the indemnification provisions of par. 8, which are predicated on good-faith actions.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We agree that par. 9, read in conjunction with the termination provisions of par. 4, gives Bildman a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>broader entitlement to payment of his legal fees and costs than does par. 8, but there is no evidence to suggest that that greater coverage extends to acts undertaken in bad faith against Astra itself. Rather, the wording of the employment agreement makes clear that, in certain adversary actions between Bildman and Astra that are not covered by the indemnification provisions of par. 8, Astra would be required to pay Bildman\u2019s costs of litigation. These adversary actions would include, for example, an action under par. 4 (g) disputing whether a change of corporate control triggering Bildman\u2019s termination had occurred, or a dispute arising under par. 4 (a) concerning a continuation of benefits to Bildman\u2019s spouse and children on his death. There is no merit to Bildman\u2019s claim that the judge\u2019s construction of par. 9 renders it hollow.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Nor do we find merit in Bildman\u2019s secondary argument that he is entitled to reimbursement from Astra for legal fees and costs related to his \u201csuccessful\u201d action on the 1996 stock options.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> See note 20, <em>supra. </em>As we have seen, par. 4 (f) of the employment agreement provides that the company shall have \u201cno further obligation\u201d to Bildman if he is terminated for cause except \u201cany obligation under a compensation or benefit plan\u201d in which Bildman participated. Astra issued a \u201clong term management stock plan letter agreement\u201d (letter agreement) in March, 1996, granting Bildman certain shares of stock pursuant to the company\u2019s 1993 long-term management stock plan (stock plan). Bildman acknowledged in writing receiving both documents. Neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>letter agreement nor the stock plan provides for the payment of Bildman\u2019s legal fees and costs in a contested action with the company. Thus, neither the employment agreement nor the stock option agreements entitle Bildman to attorney\u2019s fees for his dispute with Astra concerning the 1996 supplemental stock grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">7. <em>Negligent libel. </em>Before trial, the judge allowed Astra\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Bildman\u2019s claims for negligent libel, malicious libel, and libel per se based on various statements published by Astra, Johansson, and Mogren from April 29, 1996, through June 26, 1996.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Bildman ascribes error only to the judge\u2019s ruling that he was a \u201climited purpose public figure\u201d and thus unable to sustain a libel claim absent clear and convincing proof of \u201cactual malice,\u201d that is, that the statement was made with knowledge of its falsehood or with reckless disregard for whether it was false.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> See <em>New York Times </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 279-280 (1964) (actual malice standard). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>See also <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 351 (1974) (describing limited purpose public figure); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Taibbi, </em>400 Mass. 786, 797-798 (1987) (same). Bildman claims, in essence, that he was a private figure thrust unwittingly into the public spotlight over a \u201cprivate dispute\u201d in which statements were negligently made that ruined his reputation. See <em>id. </em>at 797 (for private persons liability may be imposed \u201cupon proof of negligent publication of a defamatory falsehood\u201d). The judge did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Where facts are undisputed, the status of a libel plaintiff is a question of law for the judge. <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>420 Mass. 517, 522, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1032 (1995). Here, the judge applied the two-part test of <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., supra, </em>to determine whether Bildman was a limited purpose public figure. See <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Heller, supra </em>at 524 n.7 (\u201cpublic controversy\u201d must exist, and \u201cthe nature and extent of the individual\u2019s participation in the particular controversy\u201d must be determined). The judge first considered whether the allegedly defamatory statements involved a matter of public controversy. See <em>id. </em>The judge had little difficulty, as do we, concluding that the issue of widespread sexual harassment at a publicly traded company employing 1,000 people is a matter of general concern. Although Bildman argues that the serious allegations against him \u201cwere unlikely to be felt by persons not involved in the controversy,\u201d the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace is a focus of a considerable body of State and Federal law and regulation and a matter of frequent and often heated public debate.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The topic of Bildman\u2019s actions echoed far beyond Astra, its employees, and their families. For many months, it wove its way into the national and international discourse about permissible conduct in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>workplace and the place and treatment of women in the private sector. See, e.g., Sexual-Harassment Cases Trip Up Foreign Companies: Astra and Mitsubishi Handle Complaints Differently, But Both Hit Pitfalls, Wall St. J., May 9, 1996, at B4.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Second, the judge considered the nature and extent of Bildman\u2019s participation in the controversy. See <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Heller, supra </em>at 523 n.7. Here she found, on the undisputed record, that Bildman was neither a victim nor an unwitting participant in the broad media coverage of his dispute with Astra.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In each instance, Bildman or his counsel denounced Astra in unequivocal terms. \u201cSince the beginning of this case, I and my family have been outraged at the irresponsible allegations that have been made against me,\u201d Bildman is quoted as saying in a press release issued by his counsel on June 4, 1996. In a press release of June 26, 1996, Bildman\u2019s counsel denounces \u201cthe company\u2019s allegations of financial wrongdoing by Lars Bildman,\u201d \u201cscurrilous and untrue allegations brought by disgruntled former employees,\u201d and a \u201c \u2018star chamber\u2019 investigation\u201d by Astra of Bildman.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> These remarks are fairly typical of Bildman\u2019s thrust and parry. His is not a case in which the libel plaintiff is a \u201cbit player\u201d in a media drama created by forces over which he had no control. Bildman played a central role, with \u201caccess to the channels of effective communication\u201d that most private individuals do not enjoy. See <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., supra </em>at 344 (noting that private individuals generally do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>not have same access to media as public figures). It is \u201creadily apparent\u201d to us, as it was to the judge, that Bildman \u201cpalpably engineered efforts to project himself into the public limelight.\u201d <em>Tripoli </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>359 Mass. 150, 156 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Because the judge correctly concluded that Bildman was a limited purpose public figure in relation to the allegedly defamatory statements, she correctly awarded summary judgment to Astra on his negligent libel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">8. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgments against Astra on the issues of rescission and costs of investigation, and against Bildman on the issues of attorney\u2019s fees and libel. We reverse the judgment denying Astra recovery of compensation it paid to Bildman during the period of his disloyalty \u2014 $5,599,097 in salary and $1,180,000 in bonuses. We affirm the jury\u2019s verdict awarding Bildman $203,691 in damages related to the supplemental stock grant, because on appeal Astra has waived any claim of forfeiture of that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We remand the case to the Superior Court for entry of judgments consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b135-13\">At all relevant times, Astra USA, Inc.

See, e.g., <em>Design Strategy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>469 F.3d 284 (2d Cir. 2006) (disloyal employee who earned both base salary and sales commissions forfeits all salary paid during period of disloyalty but not his commissions earned, because employee\u2019s disloyalty did not arise in connection with any commissions to which he was entitled under terms of his employment agreement); <em>Phansalkar </em>v. <em>Andersen, Weinroth &amp; Co., </em>344 F.3d 184, 205 (2d Cir. 2003) (expressing concern that earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Federal forfeiture holdings were in \u201ctenuous posture\u201d in relation to New York law).

Thus, for example, in the <em>Phansalkar </em>case, <em>supra </em>at 187, the disloyal employee was required to forfeit all compensation earned after the first act of disloyalty, including $4.4 million in stock awarded for services faithfully rendered. In <em>Sequa Corp. </em>v. <em>GBJ Corp., </em>156 F.3d 136, 146-147 (2d Cir. 1998), the disloyal employee was ordered to forfeit $900,000 in compensation for disloyal acts that cost the company approximately $26,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\">To the extent that the statute of limitations may be implicated in a claim of forfeiture, the judge held, and we agree, that Bildman failed to assert this defense and it is waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Astra does not challenge the judge\u2019s posttrial findings on Bildman\u2019s substantial contributions to Astra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Astra makes no claim of breach of fiduciary duty under the employment agreement, which is governed by Massachusetts law.

Finally, it is established that the specific remedy of forfeiture of compensation is a consequence of application of the \u201cfaithless servant\u201d doctrine, which is rooted in fiduciary principles. See Annot., Application of \u201cFaithless Servant Doctrine,\u201d 24 A.L.R.6th 399, 399 (2007) (\u201cThe faithless servant doctrine provides that an employee who violates his or her duty or loyalty of fidelity in the performance of his or her employment duties forfeits the right to compensation therefor\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The judge\u2019s rationale for refashioning the forfeiture requirements of New York law relied on <em>Meehan </em>v. <em>Shaughnessy, </em>404 Mass. 419, 440 (1989); <em>Chelsea Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gaffney, </em>389 Mass. 1, 14 (1983), and similar decisions applying Massachusetts law.

The evidence heard by the jury was overwhelming that from 1991 through 1996, Bildman used Astra as his personal checkbook and his sexual fiefdom, in the process driving away employees, creating a corrosive corporate atmosphere, causing Astra actual loss, and leading to months of bad publicity about the company. We agree with Astra that, as a matter of law, even under the more lenient substantial and pervasive standards of forfeiture, see text accompanying note 23, <em>supra, </em>Bildman\u2019s breaches of fiduciary duty mandate equitable forfeiture of his compensation during the period of his disloyalty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\">On appeal, Bildman counters that the investigative costs are \u201cexpressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>barred\u201d by the employment agreement, which provides in relevant part: \u201cIn no event shall the Employee be required to reimburse the Company for any legal fees or expenses incurred by it in connection with this Agreement.\u201d We agree with Astra that this theory was not presented before the trial court and is waived.

The pervasive sexual harassment resulted in a settlement with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Another substantial portion of Winthrop Stimson\u2019s bill centered on the EEOC action noted above, which resulted in the entry of a consent decree against Astra. The judge properly characterized the consent decree as focusing on Astra\u2019s \u201cown sexual harassment policies and practices, and the underlying case related to the hostile work environment created by several individuals connected with Astra, not Bildman alone.\u201d Another portion of the Winthrop Stimson bill was for the settlement of individual actions brought by current or former Astra employees.

Group, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rothenberg, </em>136 F.3d 897, 907-908 n.7 (2d Cir. 1998) (less stringent \u201csubstantial factor\u201d standard inappropriate where \u201cthe remedy sought is damages to compensate for a claimant\u2019s loss\u201d because in that context \u201cthe usual damages-causation rule for tort and contract breach cases is appropriate\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The other circumstances of termination under par. 4 of the employment agreement are death, disability, termination by Bildman without cause, termination by Astra without cause, termination by Bildman for cause, and termination on change of control of Astra. Paragraph 1 of the employment agreement declares that it shall \u201cremain in full force and effect until terminated in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Paragraph 4.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Paragraph 8 provides: Astra \u201cagrees to indemnify [Bildman] in his capacity as an officer and member of the Board of Directors of the Company, all to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, from and against any and all claims, damages, suits, costs, or liabilities, arising out of or relating to the performance of his duties and responsibilities as President and Chief Executive officer. The provisions of this Paragraph 8 shall survive expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The judge held that the indemnification provision of par. 8 was unavailable to Bildman because the jury found that he acted in bad faith, a point that Bildman does not, nor could, contest. See G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 67 (providing, in part, that corporate officers and directors may not be indemnified with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>any matter in which they have been adjudicated not to have acted in good faith toward corporation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The judge held that, even if the award of litigation costs under par. 9 could be construed as unaffected by the limiting provision of par. 4 (f), Bildman\u2019s adjudicated acts of bad faith against Astra operated as a material breach of the employment agreement that as a matter of law excused any further obligation of performance by Astra. See <em>Quintin Vespa Co. </em>v. <em>Construction Serv. Co., </em>343 Mass. 547, 554 (1962) (material breach of contract by one party excuses other party from further performance as matter of law). In light of our holding above, we need not address this rationale, other than to note that we find nothing in the language of the employment agreement to support Bildman\u2019s claim that it operated to limit Astra\u2019s common-law rights under the laws of the Commonwealth. Cf. <em>Sahli </em>v. <em>Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc., </em>437 Mass. 696, 697 n.3 (2002) (release of common-law claims).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The judge\u2019s ruling denying Bildman\u2019s contractual claim for legal costs and fees does not separately address the stock option controversy, although Bildman did press that separate argument below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We reject Astra\u2019s claim that Bildman waived the argument that he was a private person and not a limited purpose public figure because Bildman never asserted on summary judgment that he was a private individual. We agree with Bildman that his argument that he was a private figure was central to his counterclaim for negligent libel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">On summary judgment the judge reviewed several allegedly defamatory statements disseminated to Astra employees, in press releases, via news conferences, and by other means. The judge determined as to most of these statements that they were either true or nondefamatory as a matter of law. As to statements that might lend themselves to negligent libel claims, the judge ruled that Astra was entitled to summary judgment because Bildman, as a limited purpose public figure, would be unable to meet his burden at trial of proving the statements to have been made with actual malice. Bildman does not appeal from the judge\u2019s rulings as to malicious libel or libel per se, nor does he argue, as he did below, that summary judgment was improper by reasons of \u201cdefamation by conduct,\u201d see, e.g., <em>Alaska Statebank </em>v. <em>Fairco, </em>674 P.2d 288, 294 (Alaska 1983) (plaintiff\u2019s conduct \u201cwas clearly defamatory despite the fact that the statement communicated by the repossession [of property] was not actually verbalized\u201d), a theory that, as the judge noted, we have not recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">On appeal, Bildman\u2019s negligent libel claim focuses on the following statements: (a) a May 3, 1996, article in the Wall Street Journal in which an Astra spokesperson described Bildman as \u201cnot forthcoming\u201d to Astra AB about the Business Week investigation; (b) a speech Mogren gave to Astra employees on May 13, 1996, in which he stated, among other things: \u201c[S]ome people have tried to put themselves above the rules, at the same time that they have made great efforts to cover up what has happened\u201d; (c) a June 26, 1996, Astra news release and press release that made identical statements that, as Bildman summarizes on appeal, he \u201chad engaged in inappropriate behavior at company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>functions, that he had disregarded company rules and procedures, that he had failed to keep the company apprised, that he had rented outside office space for the purpose of keeping information from the parent company, that he had used company funds for family vacations and that he had used approximately $2 million for personal expenses\u201d; and (d) an Astra statement appearing in the February 5, 1998, Boston Globe that Bildman\u2019s \u201cactions \u2014 asking people to destroy records and the like \u2014 are in our estimation an attempt to cover up and keep things from his superiors in the company.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Although the judge did not identify the dispute between Astra and Bildman as evidencing matters of public concern other than sexual harassment, the parties\u2019 dispute might be said to reflect other issues of general interest, such as corporate integrity, corporate governance, and corporate financial controls, among others, all of which have attracted much recent media attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The judge found that Bildman, through counsel, repeatedly contacted and used the media, including Business Week, the Boston Globe, and the Boston Herald, to comment on the investigation, deny and rebut Astra\u2019s allegations, and influence the resolution of the investigation in the public eye. In addition, Bildman sent press releases to various media outlets, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Reuters, United Press, New England Cable News, CBS News, WCVB-TV, WLVI-TV, and WHDH-TV in Boston. Bildman also entered into unsuccessful negotiations with CBS News to be interviewed on its evening news program in New York and appeared in an interview on a Swedish television program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">To the extent that Bildman claims that he acted as a private person because he struck back at Astra only after the company had begun to defame him, it does not pass notice that Bildman began assembling a public relations team in mid-December to influence information disseminated by and to both Business Week and Astra AB, months before Astra AB learned of, much less spoke publicly about, his wrongdoing at the company. We add that the media storm that swept over Bildman originated in his own wrongful conduct as a corporate officer and director beginning years before Business Week began its investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
