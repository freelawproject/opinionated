L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (\u00a7 59H), the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming that the conduct for which she was sued \u2014 writing five newspaper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>articles that contained allegedly defamatory statements about the plaintiff, Steven Fustolo, and his properties located in the North End section of Boston \u2014 constitutes petitioning activity protected by the statute. We agree with the motion judge that the defendant did not exercise her \u201cright of petition\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 59H, and affirm the denial of the special motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\"><em>Background.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Hollander, a longtime resident of the North End, has actively participated in community activities there since the early 1990\u2019s. In 1996, she cofounded the North End Waterfront Residents\u2019 Association, Inc. (NEWRA), a nonprofit organization that takes positions on local zoning and development issues.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a NEWRA member, Hollander submitted several articles and photographs to the Regional Review, a community newspaper, seeking to use local press coverage to communicate NEWRA\u2019s activities, meetings, and recommendations to community members and elected officials.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>Phillip Orlandella was the publisher of the Regional Review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In 1997, Orlandella hired Hollander to work for the Regional Review as a paid reporter. Orlandella instructed her to write, and she did write, objective, factual news accounts of neighborhood meetings, including NEWRA meetings. Hollander remained a NEWRA member, but did not disclose this in her articles, or write her articles as expressions of her personal opinion or the opinion of NEWRA. At the same time, in choosing to write about development and licensing issues, Hollander sought to bring issues that she considered important to the attention of residents, politicians, and government officials, to encour<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>age public participation on such issues, and to cause government officials to take note of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Fustolo is an accountant and a real estate developer who, in 2006, owned or held beneficial ownership interests in several properties in the North End, including three properties located respectively at 101 Prince Street, 3 Snow Hill Street, and 11 Sheafe Street. In May and June of 2006, Hollander wrote five articles for the Regional Review that mentioned Fustolo and these properties. The first of the articles, entitled, \u201cCity condemns 11 Sheafe St. building and orders tenants to vacate immediately,\u201d appeared on May 9, 2006. The article addressed renovations undertaken by a limited liability corporation of which Fustolo served as president to convert the building at 11 Sheafe Street into condominium units. According to Hollander, the renovations forced long-time tenants out of the building, three of whom were still living there on May 2 when the city of Boston inspectional services department (ISD) condemned the building and ordered them to vacate. In the second article, published May 23, 2006, and entitled, \u201cCity ducks NEWRA\u2019s question on 11 Sheafe Street,\u201d Hollander reported that NEWRA discussed the Sheafe Street project at its May meeting and that ISD, while invited to speak, did not send a representative. The third article also appeared on May 23, reporting on a meeting held by another community organization, the North End/Waterfront Neighborhood Council (NEWNC), at which NEWNC voted to support a development project of Fustolo\u2019s relating to the property at 101 Prince Street. The fourth article at issue, dated on June 20, 2006, was entitled, \u201cISD applies for criminal complaints against owner,\u201d and concerned the 11 Sheafe Street property. In the fifth article, also published on June 20, Hollander reported that at NEWRA\u2019s June meeting, members voted to oppose Fustolo\u2019s 101 Prince Street project.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In August, 2006, Fustolo filed this action against Hollander in the Superior Court, alleging that in the five articles, Hollander falsely reported certain facts and statements by city officials and others, sought to paint him in an adverse light, and thereby defamed him. Fustolo further alleged that the articles caused \u201c[widespread opposition ... in connection with the 101 Prince Street and Snow Hill Street development plans and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>variance petition\u201d and \u201c[a]s a direct and proximate result, [he] was compelled to withdraw the application for variances prior to a hearing scheduled to take place before the Boston Board of Appeal on July 25, 2006.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Hollander responded with a special motion to dismiss under \u00a7 59H, contending that Fustolo\u2019s claims had no substantial basis other than petitioning activity protected by the statute. Hollander argued that writing the articles implicated and gave expression to her personal interests as a \u201cmember of the community keenly interested in its development and protection.\u201d She also contended that her reporting \u201cplayed an essential role in facilitating the petitioning activity of NEWRA and other members of the community . . . who had an interest in the relevant agencies\u2019 scrutiny of Fustolo\u2019s project applications and enforcement of the laws relevant to those activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">After hearing, a judge in the Superior Court denied Hollander\u2019s special motion to dismiss, concluding that Hollander did not engage in petitioning activities \u201con her own behalf as a citizen\u201d because she wrote the articles in her capacity as a reporter, and also because she received compensation for doing so. The judge rejected Hollander\u2019s claim that she facilitated the petitioning activities of others, determining that Hollander did not represent or speak on behalf of NEWRA or NEWNC in writing the challenged articles. Hollander brought an interlocutory appeal from the denial. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 521-522 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 9 (2004). We granted Hollander\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The Legislature enacted the anti-SLAPP statute \u201cto provide a quick remedy for those citizens targeted by frivolous lawsuits based on their government petitioning activities.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number><em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. 327, 331 (2005) <em>(Kobrin), </em>citing preamble to 1994 House Doc. No. 1520. Section 59H allows a party to file a special motion to dismiss if \u201cthe civil claims, counterclaims, or cross claims against said party are based on said party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition under the constitution of the United States or of the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. To prevail, the special movant must make a threshold showing through pleadings and affidavits that the claims against it \u201care \u2018based on\u2019the petitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 167-168 (1998). If she satisfies that burden, the opposing party must then show by a preponderance of evidence that the special movant\u2019s petitioning activities \u201clacked any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543, 553-554 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">We are concerned in this case with the threshold question whether Hollander established that Fustolo\u2019s claims were based solely on the exercise of her \u201cright of petition\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 59H.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute defines \u201ca party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition\u201d to encompass the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-6\">\u201c[1] any written or oral statement made before or submitted to a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding; [2] any written or oral statement made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding; [3] <em>any statement reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an issue by a legislative, executive, or judicial body or any other governmental proceeding', </em>[4] <em>any statement reasonably likely to enlist public participation in an effort to effect such consideration', </em>[5] or any other statement falling within constitutional protection of the right to petition government\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Hollander claims that the third and fourth definitions apply. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>In view of Fustolo\u2019s allegation in his complaint that he was injured because Hollander\u2019s articles stirred up so much community opposition to his projects that he had to withdrew his application for zoning variances, we assume without deciding that the contents of the articles fit at least within the fourth definition \u2014 that is, the articles were \u201creasonably likely to enlist public participation in an effort to effect. . . consideration [by a legislative, executive or judicial body].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But this does not end the inquiry. Section 59H begins by stating that it applies to \u201cany case in which a party asserts that the civil claims . . . against said party are <em>based on said party\u2019s </em>exercise of <em>its </em>right of petition under the constitution of the United States or of the commonwealth\u201d (emphasis added). As stated in <em>Kobrin, </em>443 Mass. at 332-333:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-5\">\u201cWe [have read] the phrase ... as restricting the statute\u2019s coverage to defendants who petition the government on their <em>own behalf </em>[emphasis added]. In other words, the statute is designed to protect overtures to the government by parties petitioning in their status as citizens. . . . The right of petition contemplated by the Legislature is thus one in which <em>a party seeks some redress from the government </em>[emphasis added]. See Webster\u2019s Third New Int'l Dictionary 1690 (1993) (defining \u2018petition\u2019 as \u2018a formal written <em>request </em>addressed to an official person or organized body\u2019 and as \u2018a formal written request addressed to a magistrate or court <em>praying for. . . relief\u2019 </em>\u201d [emphasis in <em>Kobrin]).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">In the <em>Kobrin </em>case, we concluded that where an expert witness, hired by the Board of Registration in Medicine (board) to assist with its investigation of a psychiatrist, provided testimony at a board hearing for which he was subsequently sued, the expert \u201cwas not exercising <em>his </em>right to petition or to seek any redress from the board (a government body), but rather was acting solely on behalf of the board\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 333. See <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Lint, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 365 (2007) <em>(Fisher)</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As Hollander argues, there are differences between her and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>defendant expert witness in <em>Kobrin, </em>as well as the defendant investigating State police officer in <em>Fisher. </em>Among other things, Hollander was not retained or employed by the government agency or entity that was claimed to be the target of the alleged petitioning. But the salient and dispositive point is that, as was true of the defendants\u2019 testimony in both <em>Kobrin </em>and <em>Fisher, </em>Hollander\u2019s articles did not contain statements seeking to redress a grievance or to petition for relief <em>of her own. </em>See <em>Kobrin, supra; Fisher, supra </em>at 364 (\u201cAs in <em>Kobrin, </em>[the defendant\u2019s] conduct was not an attempt to redress a wrong he suffered, nor was he petitioning on his own behalf\u201d). Indeed, she expressly stated in her affidavit that in writing all her articles, she was \u201calways careful to present an objective description of the subject matter, including the positions of both sides where applicable,\u201d and that while she had personal views on the issues she covered, \u201cthey were not reflected in the articles I wrote.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Hollander attempts to distinguish <em>Kobrin, </em>arguing that unlike the defendant expert witness there, as a North End resident and NEWRA member she had a personal interest in the development issues that she wrote about in the articles, and thereby had much more \u201cthan a mere contractual connection to the . . . petitioning activity.\u201d <em>Kobrin, </em>443 Mass. at 338. However, the outcome in <em>Kobrin </em>ultimately did not turn on whether the expert had or lacked a subjective and sincere personal interest in the investigation for which he was hired to assist; the fundamental reason that he was disqualified from obtaining protection under \u00a7 59H was that he was not \u201cpetitioning\u201d in the sense of personally seeking redress of a grievance of his own. See <em>id. </em>at 338 n.14 (\u201cWe care not whether a defendant... is \u2018sincere\u2019 in his or her statements; rather, our only concern, as required by the statute, is that the person be truly \u2018petitioning\u2019 the government in the constitutional sense\u201d). See also <em>Fisher, supra </em>at 365, quoting <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 122 (2002) (\u201c[the defendant] is not assisted by his claim that his conduct was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>motivated in part by a personal interest because at this initial stage \u2018the motive behind the petitioning activity is irrelevant\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The same holds true of Hollander.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Relying in particular on two decisions of the Appeals Court, <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 151 (2005), and <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Paton, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 290 (2003), Hollander argues that regardless of whether she personally was petitioning for relief, as a journalist reporting on meetings of community groups, she was in effect a messenger, giving voice to and providing space for the petitioning activity of those groups and their members. This claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">In <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, supra, </em>the Appeals Court held that \u00a7 59H protected an attorney sued for voicing the positions of his client in circumstances that, if the client had spoken directly, would have qualified as petitioning activity. <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 156-161. We agree with the judge that, unlike the attorney in <em>Plante, </em>Hollander \u201cmay not take refuge under the anti-SLAPP statute by portraying herself as a messenger of NEWRA in her capacity as a reporter.\u201d A reporter occupies a different position with respect to a petitioning party than does that party\u2019s attorney. By its nature, the attorney-client relationship is one in which the attorney expressly represents his or her client and serves as the client\u2019s agent. In situations (as in the <em>Plante </em>case) where a client is an organization rather than an individual, the client may only be able to speak, and petition, through its attorney. See <em>Keegan </em>v. <em>Pellerin, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 186, 192 (2010) (security officer employed by condominium trust who reported \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d to police \u201cwas petitioning either on his own behalf, and entitled to the statute\u2019s shelter for his individual activity, or ... on behalf of his employer, the trust. If the latter, then the trust, which can act only through its agents, paid or other . . . was the petitioner and was exercising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>a petitioning right it undoubtedly possessed\u201d [citation omitted]). There is nothing about the role or function of a staff reporter of an independent newspaper that by its nature renders the reporter a representative or agent of every, or indeed any, community organization that the reporter may cover, particularly where, as here, the reporter affirmatively denies representing a particular viewpoint. Contrast <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. at 545-547 &amp; n.5, 551 (comments made, opinions expressed, and positions urged directly by scientist on staff of environmental research organization who was solicited for comments by official involved in government permit application process represented petitioning activity within protection of \u00a7 59H).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Nor does <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Paton, supra, </em>help Hollander. In that case, the Appeals Court held that statements the defendant posted on her Web site \u2014 a site described as a \u201ctechnological version of a meeting of citizens on the Town Green, a space where concerned individuals could come together to share information, express political opinions, and rally on town issues of concern to the community\u201d \u2014 constituted petitioning activity protected by \u00a7 59H. <em>Id. </em>at 295. The court noted that the defendant wrote some of the Web site\u2019s content, although according to the defendant, \u201cmuch of the content\u201d was contributed by others, including the entry that led to the litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 295. <em>MacDonald </em>was decided before our decision in <em>Kobrin, </em>and it does not appear that the issue whether the defendant engaged in <em>her own </em>petitioning activity was raised; at any rate, the court does not discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">In sum, we conclude that Hollander has failed to satisfy her threshold burden to show that the articles on which Fustolo\u2019s suit is based constitute an \u201cexercise of [her] right of petition under the constitution\u201d as the phrase is defined in \u00a7 59H. Accordingly, the judge correctly denied Hollander\u2019s special motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">We make two additional observations. First, the motion judge based her denial of Hollander\u2019s special motion to dismiss in part on the fact that Hollander was compensated for her work as a Regional Review reporter. The judge stated that \u201cthe financial benefit [Hollander] received from the Regional Review\u2019s publication of her articles constitutes a private reason for her reporting on North End neighborhood committee meetings [and] Fustolo\u2019s complaint would thereby not be based on her petitioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>activities alone . . . .\u201d We disagree that the compensation Hollander received disqualifies her articles as protected petitioning activity. The record offers little support for a finding that Hollander wrote the articles because she was paid to do so, and in any case, speech may constitute protected petitioning activity even if it \u201cinvolves a commercial motive.\u201d <em>North Am. Expositions Co. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Corcoran, </em>452 Mass. 852, 863 (2009).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Our analysis would not change if Hollander had written the same articles, pursuant to the same instructions from the publisher, as a volunteer reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Finally, Hollander points to the important role that reporters and the press historically have played in our democracy in exposing issues of public concern and encouraging or sparking necessary governmental scrutiny. A determination that she is not entitled to the protection of \u00a7 59H for her acts of encouraging community participation in this case, Hollander argues, \u201cruns the risk of undercutting or stripping the anti-SLAPP statute of a significant portion of its value.\u201d We disagree. To the extent that Hollander fears a chilling effect on reporters and the press if they are not entitled to claim the protection of the anti-SLAPP statute in cases where they write about contentious issues of public concern, we note that the common law of defamation, with its constitutional overlay, see, e.g., <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254 (1964), provides reporters with protection for both opinions and, of probable greater relevance to this case, for fair reports of public meetings of both government bodies and organizations such as NEWRA. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 611 (1977) (\u201cThe publication of defamatory matter concerning another in a report of an official action or proceeding or of a meeting open to the public that deals with a matter of public concern is privileged if the report is accurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>and complete or a fair abridgement of the occurrence reported\u201d). See also <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Taibbi, </em>400 Mass. 786, 794 (1987) (members of press have \u201cvarious recognized privileges permitting the publication of fair reports of certain proceedings even when the accounts contain defamatory statements\u201d). See generally <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Enterprise Publ. Co., ante </em>641 (2010). While \u201cthe Legislature intended to enact very broad protection for petitioning activities,\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. at 162, \u201cthe scope of the statute has its limits.\u201d <em>Kobrin, </em>443 Mass. at 336. There is no reason to stretch the anti-SLAPP statute beyond its appropriate boundaries in order to create a level of protection for reporters beyond that to which they are currently entitled under the existing defamation law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order denying Hollander\u2019s special motion to dismiss is affirmed.
