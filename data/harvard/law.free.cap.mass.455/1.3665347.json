Her boy friend, Yoderny Pena, was indicted for her murder. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>After a five-day jury trial, during which Pena claimed mental impairment, Pena was found guilty of murder in the first degree on the theories of deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty. Represented by new counsel, Pena filed a motion for a new trial alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, which was denied. He appealed from the denial of the motion for a new trial, which was consolidated with his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">Pena argues on appeal that he is entitled to a new trial because (1) seated jurors were permitted to mingle with the rest of the venire during a short break from the empanelment proceedings; (2) the inflammatory quality of two particular autopsy photographs outweighed their probative value; (3) the testimony of a medical examiner who neither performed nor attended the victim\u2019s autopsy violated Pena\u2019s right to confrontation and Massachusetts evidence law; (4) the judge improperly struck a portion of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument; (5) the prosecutor improperly commented on Pena\u2019s failure to testify during closing argument; and (6) trial counsel was ineffective for failing adequately to make a record and object to the judge\u2019s striking of a portion of Pena\u2019s psychiatric expert\u2019s testimony. We affirm the conviction and decline to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-9\">1. <em>Trial. </em>The jury could have found the following facts. In March, 2004, the victim was living with her younger brothers and her three children in the second-floor apartment at 43 Wilcock Street in the Mattapan section of Boston. Her boy friend, Pena, had also been living there for the previous month or two. At approximately 11:45 a.m. on March 8, 2004, the victim and her friend Maria Mercedes arrived at Mercedes\u2019s home in the Roslindale section of Boston after working out together at a gym. The victim stayed very briefly at Mercedes\u2019s residence, and then left to go home and shower to prepare for an appointment that she had at approximately 1:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-10\">Amika Williams, the victim\u2019s downstairs neighbor, returned home from her job at approximately 11:30 a.m. that morning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Williams parked her vehicle at 43 Wilcock Street behind Pena\u2019s green Ford Taurus automobile. Some time after Williams entered her first-floor apartment, she heard arguing from the second-floor apartment. She heard voices, followed by crying, and then silence. Williams dozed off in her bedroom for a while, and when she arose at approximately 1:30 p.m. to check her mailbox she saw the victim\u2019s brother, Stephen, returning home from school.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">As Stephen approached 43 Wilcock Street, he observed the victim\u2019s and Pena\u2019s cars parked on the street. Pena was standing on the porch of 43 Wilcock Street. When Pena noticed Stephen, he covered his face with the collar of his jacket, slouched down, ran to his car, and drove off. Stephen then entered the second-floor apartment and found the victim, unresponsive, lying naked and pale in the bathroom. There was blood on the bathroom walls and floor. Stephen dialed 911.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">Lieutenant Gilbert Quinchia of the Boston fire department responded to the scene shortly after 1:30 p.m. He observed the victim\u2019s naked body laying face-up in a pool of blood in the bathtub. She had several stab wounds about her neck and chest. Lieutenant Quinchia further observed blood spatter about the walls and neatly folded clothes on the seat of the toilet.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">Dr. Marie Cannon from the medical examiner\u2019s office conducted an autopsy on the body on March 12, 2004, and prepared an autopsy report shortly thereafter. Dr. Cannon was on leave from the medical examiner\u2019s office at the time of trial, so the chief medical examiner, Dr. Mark Flomenbaum, testified. Dr. Flomenbaum reviewed the file maintained by the medical examiner\u2019s office regarding the victim\u2019s death. The file contained the autopsy report, laboratory reports, photographs, and additional information. Based on his review of the file, Dr. Flomenbaum opined that the victim died as a result of multiple cut and stab wounds,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> fifty-one in all, causing her to \u201cbleed[] out.\u201d Seven or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>eight of the stab wounds also could have been independently fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Dr. Flomenbaum testified that most of the fatal injuries were located in the chest area, penetrating the lungs. Two stab wounds entered through the chest and through the diaphragm, one further entering the victim\u2019s stomach. The injuries to her lungs would have caused bleeding and would have compromised her ability to breathe. The victim also received two injuries to her neck: a superficial one and one cut through her trachea, which exposed the airway to the outside. Dr. Flomenbaum opined that the cut through the victim\u2019s airway itself would have only minimally affected her ability to breathe, but blood could have flowed into her lungs because the cut extended into the blood vessels. More importantly, the cut extended into the nerves that control the mechanism that switches from the air to the food tube, thereby significantly compromising the victim\u2019s ability to breathe, and her ability to speak or scream would have been reduced to what might have been a deep gurgling sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Looking at autopsy photographs, Dr. Flomenbaum testified that many of the stab wounds showed great variability in direction, depth of penetration, and orientation of the knife, indicating that the knife was pointed and held in different directions while the injuries were inflicted. Dr. Flomenbaum opined that .the variability of the victim\u2019s injuries implied that there was a lot of relative movement between the victim and the knife, and that a large amount of time passed between the injuries. On cross-examination, Dr. Flomenbaum estimated that it would have taken somewhere between two and ten minutes to inflict all of the injuries. Some injuries suggested that the victim tried to deflect the knife, thus indicating that she was conscious through a large portion of the injuries, possibly all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Police officers found red stains consistent with human palm prints on the bathroom door and the windowsill above the bathtub, and several (bare) footprints on the floor tiles. John Black of the South Carolina State law enforcement division crime laboratory<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> compared the two latent palm prints and two latent footprints with known prints from Pena and concluded that the latent prints matched Pena\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Several of the victim\u2019s family members and her neighbor Williams testified that they never saw Pena intoxicated or using drugs while he was living with the victim. The police observed no signs of cocaine use or empty alcohol containers during the search of the apartment, and did not find any evidence of cocaine in Pena\u2019s green Ford Taurus or in Pena\u2019s other car that the police searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Pena did not testify at trial. Pena\u2019s defense counsel acknowledged that Pena had killed the victim, and the defense proceeded under the theory that Pena had done so while mentally impaired and unable to form the mental state required for murder in the first degree. The only witness called by the defense was Dr. Rebecca Brendel, a psychiatrist from Massachusetts General Hospital, who testified to her opinion of Pena\u2019s mental status on the day of the victim\u2019s death. Dr. Brendel reviewed Pena\u2019s medical records reaching back to 1996, when Pena first sought psychiatric treatment in the Dominican Republic, as well as records from the Boston Medical Center, Holy Family Hospital, and Bridgewater State Hospital, dating after 2002 when Pena moved to the United States. Dr. Brendel also reviewed reports prepared by a Dr. Presskreischer, a psychologist retained in this case to gather Pena\u2019s mental health history, and by the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, a Dr. Fife.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, Dr. Brendel spoke to Pena\u2019s sister and interviewed Pena while he was incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">According to Dr. Brendel, Pena\u2019s history of mental illness began when he was eighteen years old, and included changes in his mood; periods of severe and profound depression and agitation; a clearly documented history of psychotic symptoms, affecting his ability to think clearly and appreciate reality; paranoia, suicidal thoughts, and fears that others might harm him; and a documented history of long-term substance abuse. The onset of Pena\u2019s psychiatric symptoms coincided with the beginning of his drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">Beginning in 1996 Pena sought psychiatric help in the Dominican Republic, where he was treated for symptoms of severe depression and psychosis, and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic features. One of Pena\u2019s doctors in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Dominican Republic noted that at certain times Pena\u2019s course was characterized by alcohol and drug use. Dr. Presskreischer\u2019s report, prepared after the murder, also reflected that Pena\u2019s doctors in the Dominican Republic indicated that Pena was psychotic, experienced hallucinations, and thought he was being watched, pursued, and persecuted. Pena himself told Dr. Brendel that he attempted suicide three times in the Dominican Republic. Further, a note from the Suffolk County sheriff\u2019s department indicated that Pena had attempted suicide while incarcerated in October, 2004. In June, 1999, Pena was hospitalized in the Dominican Republic and treated with electroconvulsive therapy and antipsychotic medications. A second doctor who treated Pena in the Dominican Republic believed that Pena was severely mentally ill. This doctor continued to prescribe medications to treat Pena\u2019s mental illness until December, 2003, after Pena had moved to the United States in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Dr. Brendel testified that Pena told her that he continued to use drugs after he came to the United States. She explained that alcohol is a potent depressant and that individuals suffering from depression commonly become more depressed when they are abusing alcohol. Likewise, Dr. Brendel explained, cocaine can cause people with symptoms like Pena\u2019s to become sad and more paranoid and may affect memory and sleep.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Dr. Brendel testified further that in the spring of 2003 (one year before the murder), Pena was evaluated by a psychiatrist at Boston Medical Center, who diagnosed him with recurrent major depression and prescribed several medications to treat depression and acute symptoms of anxiety. At his sister\u2019s urging, Pena also saw a social worker at Boston Medical Center on March 3, 2004, only five days before the murder. The social worker was unable to evaluate Pena fully because no interpreter was available, but noted that Pena was suffering from depressive symptoms and had poor memory and concentration, and that his symptoms required further evaluation. Pena\u2019s sister told Dr. Brendel that Pena went into a depressive state several months before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>nulrder, and that he had been acting strangely in the weeks before the murder. She specifically recalled one incident when Pena told her that he thought people were following him and later seemed disoriented. Dr. Brendel explained to the jury that people suffering from mental illness, like Pena, will typically experience mood swings and will vary between periods of acute mental illness and periods without any symptoms .at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Pena told Dr. Brendel that on the day of the murder he was severely depressed, extremely agitated; and acutely suicidal; that he had not slept for three nights; and that he had been using cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the morning of the murder he went to the second-floor apartment of 43 Wilcock Street with the intention of jumping from the apartment to kill himself, and that he had gone to the kitchen to get a knife to kill himself. Pena could not explain to Dr. Brendel why he had not followed through with that plan, but he showed her scars that he reportedly inflicted on himself with a knife. Photographs of Pena\u2019s wounds were introduced in evidence and they depicted scars from several injuries to his neck, abdomen, and arm. Pena told Dr. Brendel that he had also hurt the victim that day, but he was unable to explain why he had done so. Pena claimed that his mind had gone blank, causing him to have very little memory of what had occurred, that he had a brief recollection of cutting himself and the victim, but that he never had any plans to hurt her, and only wanted to hurt himself. Pena said that he loved the victim very much and that if he had been thinking clearly that this day never could have happened. Pena reported still hoping that,she was alive after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">On the basis of all of this information, Dr. Brendel.concluded that Pena suffered from a chronic and severe mental illness on the day of the killing; that Pena was suffering from depression and was preoccupied with suicidal thoughts; and that he had difficulty remembering what happened because of a combination of his mental illness and substance abuse. She further opined that the information she obtained from Pena cast doubt on whether he was capable of deliberating in a cool and reflective manner, and whether he was able to form a coherent plan to kill himself or his girl friend. Dr. Brendel expressed serious doubt whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Pena could form the intent required for murder in the first degree on the day of the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Dr. Brendel also testified that Pena\u2019s treatment for symptoms of mental illness continued after the killing. Five months after the murder, between August 3 and August 10, 2004, Pena was hospitalized at Holy Family Hospital. In addition, after he surrendered to the police on August 27, 2004, Pena was evaluated at Bridgewater State Hospital, where he remained until September 24, 2004. There Pena was found competent to stand trial, but was not evaluated as to his criminal responsibility. On cross-examination, Dr. Brendel admitted that the report from Bridge-water State Hospital also indicated a high suspicion that Pena was feigning memory problems.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She further admitted that there was no indication in the record that Pena experienced any symptoms of alcohol or drug abuse withdrawal while at Bridge-water State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Jury empanelment. </em>During the jury empanelment process, after nine jurors had been seated,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the judge ordered a fifteen-minute mid-morning break. After the break, defense counsel moved for a mistrial because the seated jurors had been permitted to take their break together with the rest of the venire. The judge denied defense counsel\u2019s motion. Before the lunch break later that day, the judge instructed the seated jurors not to discuss the case among themselves or with others. After the lunch recess, defense counsel asked the judge to conduct a voir dire of the sitting jurors who were exposed to the rest of the venire to determine what they heard and from whom. The judge denied this request because there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence before [him] that they were exposed to extraneous information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Pena argues that the judge\u2019s refusal to conduct a voir dire of the jurors after the motion for a mistrial requires reversal of his conviction because absent the voir dire there was no way to ascertain whether the seated jurors were exposed to extraneous influences. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">First, G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 74, precludes Pena\u2019s claim. That statute provides in part: \u201cAny irregularity in . . . impanelling . . . jurors . . . shall not be sufficient to cause a mistrial or to set aside a verdict unless objection to such irregularity or defect has been made as soon as possible after its discovery or after it should have been discovered <em>and </em>unless the objecting party has been <em>specially injured or prejudiced </em>thereby\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 74. Although Pena made a timely objection, he failed to show (beyond speculation) how he was specially injured or prejudiced by the judge\u2019s failure to sequester the seated jurors from the venire. It was the very absence of evidence that the jurors were exposed to extraneous information that caused the judge to deny Pena\u2019s request to individually voir dire the seated jurors. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>412 Mass. 172, 180 (1992) (\u201cburden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the [unsequestered] jurors were exposed to extraneous information and, in the absence of such evidence, the defendant\u2019s claim must fail\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>395 Mass. 149, 151 (1985) (\u201cNo duty to investigate arises unless the court finds some suggestion or showing that extraneous matters were brought into the jury\u2019s deliberations\u201d). The judge\u2019s ruling was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Pena\u2019s reliance on G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, is unavailing. That statutory provision requires a judge to examine prospective jurors individually when \u201cit appears that, as a result of the impact of considerations which may cause a decision or decisions to be made in whole or in part upon issues extraneous to the case ... the juror may not stand indifferent.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. \u201cIf it appears that a juror might act in whole or in part on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>issues extraneous to the case, the judge must conduct individual voir dire. . . . A judge has considerable discretion as to whether the circumstances present a substantial risk that an extraneous influence might affect jurors. . . . The defendant must show that there is some basis for finding that a substantial risk of extraneous influences on the jury exists . . . and that there is a substantial risk that jurors would be influenced by such considerations.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashman, </em>430 Mass. 736, 739 (2000). Here, the jurors whom Pena now challenges had already been seated after being subject to individual voir dire examinations. Pena does not claim any irregularity with this process. The judge was not required by G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, to conduct a second individual voir dire of the seated jurors in the absence of a showing of a substantial risk of extraneous influences, and did not abuse his discretion in denying Pena\u2019s request to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The seated jurors had not yet heard any evidence in the case and had, just a short time before the morning break, acknowledged their ability to be impartial, to \u201clisten to the evidence presented inside the courtroom,\u201d and to follow the judge\u2019s instructions. Immediately before the afternoon lunch recess the judge instructed the seated jurors not to discuss the case with anyone and admonished the jurors that they would ultimately be called on to \u201cdecide this case based upon the evidence that\u2019s presented inside this courtroom, not on any outside influences.\u201d The judge repeated similar instructions after the entire jury were empanelled and at the end of each day of trial. The judge also gave a similar instruction during his final jury charge. \u201cThe judge was entitled to assume that the jurors would heed his instructions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>432 Mass. 1, 10 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">In sum, the judge did not abuse his discretion or commit any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>other error of law in denying Pena\u2019s motion for a mistrial or his request to conduct a further voir dire of the seated jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">b. <em>Autopsy photographs. </em>At a sidebar conference, the prosecutor identified six autopsy photographs that he intended to offer in evidence during Dr. Flomenbaum\u2019s testimony. Defense counsel objected to two of these photographs. One depicted the wounds to the left side of the victim\u2019s chest. The other showed the injuries to her neck and included a small ruler used to show the size of the wounds. Noting that the Commonwealth had already pared down its proposed photographic presentation by not offering other \u201ccloser-up photographs,\u201d the judge overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection because the photographs fairly depicted the nature and extent of the victim\u2019s injuries to her chest and neck. Pena argues that the admission of the photographs over his objection constitutes reversible error because the cause and manner of death were not contested and the photographs had no value to the Commonwealth other than to evoke unnecessary prejudice toward Pena.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u201cThe question whether the inflammatory quality of a photograph outweighs its probative value and precludes its admission is determined in the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeSouza, </em>428 Mass. 667, 670 (1999), and cases cited. \u201cThe fact that a photograph is cumulative of other evidence has not required the exclusion of the photograph.\u201d <em>Id., </em>and cases cited. \u201cEven if a defendant agrees to stipulate to the facts that an offered photograph tends to prove, it is generally not error to admit it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA judge may appropriately attempt to mitigate the potentially prejudicial nature of a photograph by instructing the jury that the photograph is to be used in analyzing the evidence and is not designed to elicit sympathy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The admission of the challenged photographs was well within the judge\u2019s discretion. The two challenged autopsy photographs showed wounds that were not depicted in any of the other autopsy photographs. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Urrea, </em>443 Mass. 530, 545 (2005) (no error in admitting eleven autopsy photographs where each photograph \u201cdepicted at least one wound that did not appear in any of the others\u201d). These photographs were plainly relevant to the issue of extreme atrocity or cruelty and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>assisted the jury in understanding Dr. Flomenbaum\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boateng, </em>438 Mass. 498, 507 (2003), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Obershaw, </em>435 Mass. 794, 803 (2002) (autopsy photographs relevant to show extreme atrocity or cruelty); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>394 Mass. 791, 796 (1985) (\u201calthough the medical examiner testified as to the mechanisms of death, oral testimony describing the victim\u2019s injuries may be supplemented with photographs\u201d). Moreover, the judge instructed the jury during Dr. Flomenbaum\u2019s testimony and again during the final jury charge that the purpose of the photographs was to determine the nature and extent of the victim\u2019s injuries and not to arouse sympathy, passion, or prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>434 Mass. 670, 684-685 n.11 (2001) (judge should instruct jury that photograph not designed to elicit sympathy but to be used in analyzing evidence).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">c. <em>Dr. Flomenbaum\u2019s testimony. </em>Near the beginning of Dr. Flomenbaum\u2019s testimony, defense counsel objected to the testimony on the ground that Dr. Flomenbaum was not the medical examiner who had performed the autopsy. The judge overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection, indicating that he would allow Dr. Flomenbaum to testify to his opinion of the manner and cause of the victim\u2019s death based on the information in Dr. Cannon\u2019s autopsy report.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defense counsel objected again when the prosecutor asked Dr. Flomenbaum for his opinion as to the cause of death and when Dr. Flomenbaum began describing the victim\u2019s wounds as depicted in the autopsy photographs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>report. The judge overruled both objections. The judge later sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection to Dr. Flomenbaum\u2019s reading directly from Dr. Cannon\u2019s autopsy report, but indicated that the prosecutor could refresh Dr. Flomenbaum\u2019s recollection, if necessary, using the autopsy report.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Pena argues that the judge committed reversible error by permitting Dr. Flomenbaum to testify and offer his opinions because his testimony was based solely on inadmissible evidence. Pena also argues that this testimony violated his right to confrontation, see <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54 (2004) <em>(Crawford) </em>(confrontation clause prohibits admission of testimonial out-of-court statements unless declarant unavailable and defendant had prior opportunity to cross-examine declarant about statements), and the Massachusetts law of evidence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331, 338 (2002) (\u201cexpert\u2019s direct examination may not be used to put before the jury facts that are not [and will not be] properly in evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Pena relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goudreau, </em>422 Mass. 731 (1996), to argue that Dr. Flomenbaum\u2019s testimony in reliance on a report prepared by someone else was improper under Massachusetts law. In that case, the court upheld a ruling of the trial judge excluding the testimony of two expert witnesses about the contents of specific records, in the absence of any showing that the records were themselves admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 734-735. This holding does not preclude an expert from basing his opinion on facts or data not in evidence that are independently admissible and are a permissible basis for an expert to consider in formulating such an opinion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, supra </em>at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">We have recently held that a testifying medical examiner may rely on an autopsy report prepared by another medical examiner for this very reason. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 389 (2008). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>514 F.3d 121, 134 &amp; n.5 (1st Cir. 2008), quoting <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Marchand, </em>506 F.3d 13, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2007) (expert reliance on reports prepared by another medical examiner \u201cplainly justified in light of the custom and practice of the medical profession\u201d). Thus, contrary to Pena\u2019s contention, Dr. Flomenbaum was not foreclosed from forming and testifying to an opinion based on Dr. Cannon\u2019s autopsy report.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>As it relates to Dr. Flomenbaum\u2019s own expert opinions, Pena\u2019s argument that his right to confrontation was violated is also foreclosed by our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, supra </em>at 388-391 (right of confrontation not violated where medical examiner who did not perform autopsy testified to his own opinion as to cause of death). To the extent that Pena\u2019s objection is to Dr. Flomenbaum\u2019s direct testimony about some of the specific findings in the autopsy report (made by Dr. Cannon), and such testimony may not have been admissible at that point in the trial, see <em>id., </em>any such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in the circumstances of this case. The manner and cause of death were not contested issues in the trial. Any erroneously admitted findings were either irrelevant to the only contested issue, Pena\u2019s mental impairment, or were affirmatively used by defense counsel to illustrate that impairment. For example, during his opening statement, defense counsel told the jury: \u201cWe don\u2019t contest that Mr. Pena is responsible for this terrible, terrible incident, where this woman was stabbed some fifty-one times. No one but a crazy man would do this. He was suffering from a severe mental illness.\u201d Then, during closing, defense counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">\u201cIn my opening ... I told you you\u2019d see evidence, that only a crazy person could stab his girlfriend, whom he loved, fifty-three times, seven stabs that could have independently caused death. Any one of them could have caused death. Why the seven unless someone was out of control, not rational, didn\u2019t know what he was doing? And what about the other cuts, in all different fashions on different parts of the body, all irrational.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">d. <em>Judge\u2019s sua sponte striking of portion of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument. </em>During his closing, defense counsel commented on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to call an expert witness to rebut Dr. Brendel\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">\u201c[The prosecutor] didn\u2019t even bring in his expert. You heard that he had an expert.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] Where is that expert? We\u2019re only left with our expert. We can only conclude that if that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>expert had come in he couldn\u2019t have rebutted our expert\u2019s testimony. So, think about that. No expert. All [of the prosecutor\u2019s] evidence dealing with irrelevant issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">After defense counsel\u2019s closing the judge instructed the jury, sua sponte:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">\u201cMembers of the jury, [defense counsel] argued that the Commonwealth\u2019s expert couldn\u2019t rebut the defense expert, that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t hear from the Commonwealth\u2019s expert. As I told you, you can only consider the evidence that\u2019s properly introduced during the course of the trial. You are not allowed to speculate as to evidence you did not hear during the course of the trial. For that reason I ask you to strike that portion of the defense\u2019s closing arguments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Defense counsel then argued at sidebar that he had the right to discuss the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to call Dr. Fife because she was available to be called and the Commonwealth offered no explanation for its failure to call her. The judge disagreed and concluded that the argument was improper because defense counsel had asked the jury to speculate. Pena now argues that the judge\u2019s sua sponte instruction and striking of a portion of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument were inappropriate. He analogizes the situation to cases in which a defendant offers an alibi and the Commonwealth is permitted to comment on his failure to call witnesses to corroborate the defense. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>416 Mass. 707, 722-725 (1993). Pena argues that defense counsel\u2019s comment was warranted and the judge\u2019s response communicated to the jury his approval of the Commonwealth\u2019s decision not to call Dr. Fife. In arguing for reversal, Pena emphasizes the fact that the judge\u2019s response \u201cwent to the heart\u201d of Pena\u2019s case: the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to overcome his mental impairment defense with proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The judge\u2019s instruction and subsequent ruling at sidebar were proper. Defense counsel essentially made a missing witness argument without first seeking the judge\u2019s permission or requesting a missing witness instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saletino, </em>449 Mass. 657, 670 (2007) (\u201cbefore giving [a missing wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>ness] instruction, and before permitting counsel to argue the point, the judge must be satisfied that the foundational requirements for the instruction and argument are in fact met and that the adverse inference is warranted in the circumstances\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> While a defendant may \u201clegitimately point out that a specific witness or specific evidence has not been produced,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 672, and argue that the Commonwealth has thus not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, a defendant may not argue in a case where there is no missing witness instruction that the jury should infer from the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to call a witness that the witness would have been unable to rebut a defense witness. See <em>id. </em>at 672 n.23 (argument in which defense counsel \u201cimplie[s] that [missing witness\u2019s] testimony would have been unfavorable to the Commonwealth\u201d is a \u201cclassic missing witness argument\u201d). \u201cIt is a powerful accusation \u2014 that a party is withholding evidence that would be unfavorable \u2014 and that is why we regulate it closely and require judges to assess very carefully whether to give the instruction and to permit the argument in a given case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673. Because defense counsel did not request or secure the judge\u2019s permission to make a missing witness argument after establishing its foundational requirements, defense counsel\u2019s comment called for the jury to speculate impermissibly as to the content of potential testimony not in evidence. See <em>id. </em>at 672 n.22 (generally, jury \u201cnot to draw any conclusion about the content of evidence that was not produced\u201d). The judge\u2019s instruction and subsequent ruling were entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">e. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s comment during closing argument. </em>In his closing, defense counsel argued that, in order for someone to act rationally, there must be a motive. He then pointed out that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the Commonwealth had produced no evidence of a motive: No evidence of why Pena stabbed to death someone he loved. Consequently, there was \u201cno evidence of any rationality\u201d on Pena\u2019s part, and the Commonwealth had thus failed to disprove mental impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In apparent response to this argument, the prosecutor made the following statement in his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">\u201c[W]hat have we learned that says mental illness or mental impairment had anything to do with this? \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know why. We don\u2019t [know] why he did it ... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">\u201cTwo people are close to each other, they have an argument and one of them ends up dead. Well, one of them will never be able to tell us why it happened, will she? [The victim], obviously, can never tell us. The defendant is the only one who knows why he did it. He\u2019s the only one who knows why he got so enraged that he had to kill</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">At this point, defense counsel\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s argument was sustained. Immediately after the prosecutor\u2019s closing, the judge informed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">\u201c[C]ounsel stated that the defendant is the only one who knows; he made a reference in that regard. The defendant, as I will instruct you later, has an absolute right not to testify in this case, and it is improper to comment on that right to remain silent. You are to disregard that portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">A sidebar conference followed, during which defense counsel moved for a mistrial as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s comment on Pena\u2019s failure to testify. Defense counsel argued that this was the type of error that could not be corrected by a curative instruction. The judge denied defense counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial. The judge further instructed the jury in detail during the final jury charge about Pena\u2019s absolute right not to testify, explained that the jury must not draw any adverse inference from his failure to testify, and admonished the jury not to discuss or consider it in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">Pena argues on appeal that the judge\u2019s refusal to grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>mistrial is reversible error. In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, the prosecutor did not comment on Pena\u2019s failure to testify, but was properly commenting on the evidence adduced at trial. That evidence included testimony elicited by defense counsel from Dr. Brendel, with respect to Pena\u2019s mental state, that Pena did not explain to her why he stabbed his girl friend, except to say that he did not intend to and that his mind went blank and he had very little memory of what occurred other than cutting her and himself. The Commonwealth argues further that the judge\u2019s striking of the prosecutor\u2019s comment and immediate jury instruction, though unnecessary, cured any potential prejudice resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Whatever the prosecutor\u2019s intent, if his remarks were reasonably susceptible of being interpreted as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand, they would be improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 571 (1976). The question whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were susceptible of being so interpreted is a close one in this case. Reviewing the prosecutor\u2019s argument as a whole, and its relationship to the evidence admitted at trial and the arguments made by defense counsel, we are persuaded that the prosecutor did not intend his comment to be understood as a comment on Pena\u2019s failure to testify, and that it is not likely that the jury would have considered it as such.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">However, even if we were to conclude that the remarks were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>reasonably susceptible of being interpreted as a comment on Pena\u2019s failure to take the stand, \u201cit does not necessarily follow that there was error in a denial of a mistrial by the judge.\u201d K.B. Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 35.28, at 839 (3d ed. 2007). The \u201c[djenial of a mistrial and reliance on curative instructions may be proper, in the judge\u2019s discretion, even in a case of clearly improper argument by a prosecutor.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, supra </em>at 572. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 891-893 (1980) (no abuse of discretion in judge\u2019s denying mistrial and relying on instructions to preclude potential prejudice where \u201cthe improper implication was not even particularly clear\u201d). The judge\u2019s prompt and thorough instructions here \u201cwere sufficiently clear and complete to negate any possible prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phoenix, </em>409 Mass. 408, 427 (1991), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>381 Mass. 306, 316 (1980). There was no error.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">f. <em>Denial of new trial motion based on ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>Near the end of Dr. Brendel\u2019s direct examination, she testified that she had reviewed records from Pena\u2019s hospitalization at Holy Family Hospital between August 3 and August 10, 2004. Dr. Brendel explained that those records were relevant to her because they indicated an evaluation of Pena that occurred outside the criminal context close in time to the Bridge-water State Hospital evaluation. Defense counsel asked whether those records contained anything relevant to Dr. Brendel\u2019s opinion and she answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u201cWell, in those records there was some concern about Mr. Pena\u2019s difficulty with memory and being able to give an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>accurate history. The discharge diagnosis included a diagnosis of psychosis not otherwise specified. So, the physicians in the hospital did observe him at some time during the hospitalization to be suffering from psychotic symptoms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The prosecutor then objected and argued at sidebar that the Holy Family Hospital records had not been provided to the Commonwealth\u2019s expert or the court. The prosecutor asked either to see the records or have the answer struck. Defense counsel responded that she believed she had produced all the records in her possession, and if not, this was done inadvertently. Defense counsel then added, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have any more questions about these records.\u201d The judge then excluded and struck Dr. Brendel\u2019s answer excerpted above. Defense counsel did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Represented by new counsel, Pena filed a motion for a new trial in November, 2007, contending he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed adequately to make a record and object to the judge\u2019s striking of Dr. Brendel\u2019s testimony. In support of his motion, Pena submitted the medical records from his hospitalization at Holy Family Hospital. On July 14, 2008, the same judge who presided over the trial denied the motion, reasoning that given Dr. Brendel\u2019s \u201cextensive testimony,\u201d \u201ctrial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the exclusion of a small portion of the defendant\u2019s mental health records did no real harm to the overall defense of the case,\u201d and was therefore not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">On appeal Pena essentially argues that the records should have been offered (and admitted) in evidence because they contradicted the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that Pena was feigning memory problems.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Had they been admitted, Pena further argues, it is likely that the jury would have appreciated and believed that Pena\u2019s mental illness was a \u201ctrue defense\u201d to his case. Therefore, the judge\u2019s denial of his new trial motion constitutes reversible error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Because Pena was convicted of murder in the first degree, we consider his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel to determine whether there exists a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, which is more favorable to the defendant than the constitutional standard for ineffective assistance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>453 Mass. 203, 204 (2009). \u201cThus, we consider whether there was error during the course of the trial, and, if so, whether the error was \u2018likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). \u201cUnder this more favorable standard of review, we consider a defendant\u2019s claim even if the action by trial counsel does not \u2018constitute conduct falling \u201cmeasurably below\u201d that of an \u201cordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>413 Mass. 498, 517 (1992). \u201cA strategic decision by an attorney, however, amounts to ineffective assistance \u2018only if it was manifestly unreasonable when made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coonan, </em>428 Mass. 823, 827 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">We agree with the motion judge that trial counsel was not ineffective because even had the Holy Family Hospital records been offered and admitted in evidence, they merely would have been cumulative of other testimony offered by Dr. Brendel, a highly qualified psychiatrist.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>449 Mass. 207, 219 (2007) (\u201cno substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice where the testimony was cumulative\u201d). That testimony included an extensive detailing of all of Pena\u2019s hospitalizations and diagnoses, including testimony about his associated memory problem. Moreover, although Dr. Brendel was not permitted to answer a question about the specific contents of the Holy Family Hospital records, she clearly relied on those records in forming her opinion as to Pena\u2019s mental state on the date of the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In addition, counsel\u2019s failure to offer the records in evidence (or to make an offer of proof with them when a single answer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Dr. Brendel\u2019s was struck) was plainly a strategic decision that was not manifestly unreasonable. Although the records include a diagnosis of \u201c[p]sychotic disorder, not otherwise specified,\u201d and \u201c[r]ule out malingering,\u201d they also included potentially damaging information that could have bolstered the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that Pena was feigning memory problems. While the records indicate that Pena had difficulty remembering information from his past, they also conclude that \u201cthere are reasons for [Pena] to be vague and avoidant\u201d because he admitted entering the United States illegally. Consequently, there was a \u201csuspicion of being purposely avoidant and vague on account of his illegal status.\u201d The report also states that due to a language barrier, \u201cit is difficult to determine whether [Pena\u2019s] responses are due to cognitive impairment or planned evasiveness and avoidance, or one posing as a mental patient.\u201d The report further states that Pena \u201cmaintains vagueness, and perhaps evasiveness, on questions of where he is staying and whether he has a job somewhere.\u201d Finally, the records indicated that the \u201chesitancy in [Pena\u2019s] speech did not appear to be thought blocking but rather a result of calculated efforts to avoid self-revelation and to remain vague and superficial.\u201d Given this potentially damaging content, defense counsel was not unreasonable in failing to offer the Holy Family Hospital records in evidence, or declining to pursue the matter further when the judge struck Dr. Brendel\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In sum, defense counsel\u2019s handling of the records of the Holy Family Hospital was not likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion and did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We have examined the record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to determine whether there is any basis to set aside or reduce the verdict of murder in the first degree, regardless of whether such grounds were raised on appeal. We conclude that the evidence supported Pena\u2019s conviction of murder in the first degree and that there is no basis on which to reduce that verdict or order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b22-8\">When Stephen first attempted to dial 911, he noticed the telephone had been unplugged.

The prosecutor essentially argued that the absence of evidence of Pena\u2019s motive should not lead the jury to conclude that Pena must have been mentally ill to have killed the victim. The thrust of his argument was not so much that Pena did not testify, but that the Commonwealth\u2019s inability to prove Pena\u2019s motive should not cause the jury to conclude that Pena must have been mentally ill. After defense counsel\u2019s objection was sustained, the prosecutor continued his argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">\u201cThere are some things, ladies and gentlemen, that aren\u2019t knowable. Why this happened is one of those things. We know certain things happen that are horrible, they\u2019re horrible crimes, and we never know why they happened.
