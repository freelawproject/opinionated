S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), a state drug-trafficking conviction qualifies as \u201ca serious drug offense\u201d if \u201ca maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law\u201d for the \u201coffense.\u201d The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law\u201d must be determined without taking recidivist enhancements into account. 464 F. 3d 1072,1082 (2006). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">At issue in this case is respondent\u2019s sentence on his 2004 conviction in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Respondent had two prior state convictions in California for residential burglary and three state convictions in Washington for delivery of a controlled substance, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a769.50.401(a)(l)(ii)-(iv) (1994). <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondent\u2019s three Washington drug convictions occurred on the same day but were based on deliveries that took place on three separate dates. Sentencing Order in No. CR-03-142<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>RHW (ED Wash., Sept. 3, 2004), p. 5, App. 245, 250 (hereinafter Sentencing Order). At the time of respondent\u2019s drug offenses, the Washington statute that respondent was convicted of violating stated that, upon conviction, a defendant could be \u201cimprisoned for not more than five years,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(l)(ii)-(iv), but another provision specified that \u201c[a]ny person convicted of a second or subsequent offense\u201d could \u201cbe imprisoned for a term up to twice the term otherwise authorized,\u201d \u00a7 69.50.408(a). Thus, by virtue of this latter, recidivist, provision respondent faced a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. The judgment of conviction for each of the drug-delivery charges listed the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense as \u201cten years,\u201d App. 16, 42, 93, but the state court sentenced respondent to concurrent sentences of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, <em>id., </em>at 21, 47, 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In the federal felon-in-possession case, the Government asked the District Court to sentence respondent under ACC A, which sets a 15-year minimum sentence \u201c[i]n the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of [Title 18] and has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another . . . .\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The Government argued that respondent\u2019s two prior California burglary convictions were for \u201c Violent felonies.\u2019\u201d Pet. for Cert. 4. See \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2000 ed.) (listing \u201cburglary\u201d as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d). The District Court agreed, and that ruling is not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The Government also argued that at least two of respondent\u2019s Washington drug convictions were for \u201cserious drug offense[s].\u201d Under ACC A, a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to distribute, a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U. S. C. 802)), <em>for which </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Because the maximum term that respondent faced on at least two of the Washington charges was 10 years, the Government contended that these convictions had to be counted under ACCA. The District Court disagreed, holding that respondent\u2019s drug-trafficking convictions were not convictions for \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d under ACCA because the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) is determined without reference to recidivist enhancements. Sentencing Order, at 9, App. 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, applying its prior precedent in <em>United States </em>v. Corona-Sanchez, 291 F. 3d 1201 (2002) (en banc), affirmed. 464 F. 3d 1072. The court recognized that its decision conflicted with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henton, </em>374 F. 3d 467, 469-470, cert. denied, 543 U. S. 967 (2004), and was \u201cin tension\u201d with decisions of the Fourth and Fifth Circuits. 464 F. 3d, at 1082, n. 6; see <em>Mutascu </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>444 F. 3d 710, 712 (CA5 2006) <em>(per curiam); United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>326 F. 3d 535, 539 (CA4 2003). We granted the Government\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, 551 U. S. 1191 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The question that we must decide is whether the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\u201d in this case is, as respondent maintains and the Ninth Circuit held, the 5-year ceiling for first offenses or, as the Government contends, the 10-year ceiling for second or subsequent offenses. See Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(1)(ii)-(iv), 69.50.408(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The Government\u2019s reading is compelled by the language of ACCA. For present purposes, there are three key statutory terms: \u201coffense,\u201d \u201claw,\u201d and \u201cmaximum term.\u201d The \u201coffense\u201d in each of the drug-delivery cases was a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(l)(ii)-(iv). The relevant \u201claw\u201d is set out in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>both that provision, which prescribes a \u201cmaximum term\u201d of 5 years for a first \u201coffense,\u201d and \u00a7 69.50.408(a), which prescribes a \u201cmaximum term\u201d of 10 years for a second or subsequent \u201coffense.\u201d Thus, in this case, the maximum term prescribed by Washington law for at least two of respondent\u2019s state drug offenses was 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the maximum term was five years contorts ACCA\u2019s plain terms. Although the Washington state court sentenced respondent to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment, there is no dispute that \u00a7 69.50.408(a) permitted a sentence of up to 10 years. On the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading of ACCA, even if respondent had been sentenced to, say, six years\u2019 imprisonment, \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment\u201d prescribed by law still would have been five years. It is hard to accept the proposition that a defendant may lawfully be sentenced to a term of imprisonment that exceeds the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law,\u201d but that is where the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading of the statute leads.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation is also inconsistent with the way in which the concept of the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d is customarily understood by participants in the criminal justice process. Suppose that a defendant who indisputably had more than three prior convictions for \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d or \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d was charged in federal court with violating the felon-in-possession statute. Under ACCA, this defendant would face a sentence of \u201cnot less than 15 years.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Suppose that the defendant asked his or her attorney, \u201cWhat\u2019s the maximum term I face for the new offense?\u201d An attorney aware of ACCA would surely not respond, \u201c10 years,\u201d even though 10 years is the maximum sentence without the ACCA enhancement. See \u00a7 924(a)(2) (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Suppose that the defendant then pleaded guilty to the felon-in-possession charge. Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(H), the trial judge would be required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>advise the defendant of the \u201cmaximum possible penalty.\u201d If the judge told the defendant that the maximum possible sentence was 10 years and then imposed a sentence of 15 years based on ACCA, the defendant would have been sorely misled and would have a ground for moving to withdraw the plea. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>420 F. 3d 111, 132 (CA2 2005); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>354 F. 3d 178, 185-186 (CA2 2004). In sum, a straightforward application of the language of ACCA leads to the conclusion that the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\u201d in this case was 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In an effort to defend the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, respondent offers both a textual argument and a related argument based on the \u201cmanifest purpose\u201d of ACCA. Brief for Respondent 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Respondent\u2019s textual argument is as follows. The term \u201coffense\u201d \u201cgenerally is understood to describe the elements constituting the crime.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 10. Because prior convictions required for recidivist enhancements are not typically offense elements, they should not be considered part of the \u201coffense\u201d under ACCA. Thus, the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\u201d for the drug convictions at issue was the maximum term prescribed for simply committing the elements of the drug offense and was therefore five years. <em>Id., </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Respondent\u2019s argument is not faithful to the statutory text. Respondent reads ACCA as referring to \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\u201d for a defendant <em>with no prior convictions that trigger a recidivist enhancement, </em>but that is not what ACCA says. ACCA instead refers to \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law\u201d for \u201can offense,\u201d and, as previously explained, in this case, the maximum term prescribed by Washington law for each of respondent\u2019s two relevant offenses was 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Respondent\u2019s argument based on ACCA\u2019s \u201cmanifest purpose\u201d must also be rejected. Respondent argues that ACCA uses \u201cthe maximum penalty specified for the offense by state law as a short-hand means of identifying conduct deemed sufficiently \u2018serious\u2019 to trigger [the] mandatory penalty.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 9. According to respondent, \u201c[t]he nature of [a defendant\u2019s] conduct, the elements of the offense, and the impact of the crime ... are the characteristics that typically are used to gauge the \u2018seriousness\u2019 of an offense,\u201d and a defendant\u2019s \u201cstatus as a recidivist has no connection to whether the offense committed by the defendant was a \u2018serious\u2019 one.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">This argument rests on the erroneous proposition that a defendant\u2019s prior record of convictions has no bearing on the seriousness of an offense. On the contrary, however, an offense committed by a repeat offender is often thought to reflect greater culpability and thus to merit greater punishment. Similarly, a second or subsequent offense is often regarded as more serious because it portends greater future danger and therefore warrants an increased sentence for purposes of deterrence and incapacitation. See <em>Witte </em>v. <em>United States, </em>515 U. S. 389, 403 (1995); <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>385 U. S. 554, 570 (1967) (Warren, C. J., dissenting in two judgments and concurring in one).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">If respondent were correct that a defendant\u2019s record of prior convictions has no bearing on the seriousness of an offense, then it would follow that any increased punishment imposed under a recidivist provision would not be based on the offense of conviction but on something else \u2014 presumably the defendant\u2019s prior crimes or the defendant\u2019s \u201cstatus as a recidivist,\u201d Brief for Respondent 11. But we have squarely rejected this understanding of recidivism statutes. In <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>United States, </em>511 U. S. 738 (1994), we explained that \u201c \u2018[t]his Court consistently has sustained repeat-offender laws as penalizing only the last offense committed by the defendant.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 747 (quoting <em>Baldasar </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>446 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>U. S. 222, 232 (1980) (Powell, J., dissenting)). When a defendant is given a higher sentence under a recidivism statute \u2014 or for that matter, when a sentencing judge, under a guidelines regime or a discretionary sentencing system, increases a sentence based on the defendant\u2019s criminal history \u2014 100% of the punishment is for the offense of conviction. None is for the prior convictions or the defendant\u2019s \u201cstatus as a recidivist.\u201d The sentence \u201cis a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because [it is] a repetitive one.\u201d <em>Gryger </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Respondent argues that our interpretation of ACCA produces \u201ca sort of perverse bootstrapping\u201d under which a defendant is \u201cpunished under federal law for being treated as a recidivist under state law,\u201d Brief for Respondent 20 (emphasis deleted), but the fact that ACCA is itself a recidivist statute bolsters our reading. Since ACCA is a recidivist statute, Congress must have had such provisions in mind and must have understood that the \u201cmaximum penalty prescribed by [state] law\u201d in some cases would be increased by state recidivism provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Contrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion, <em>United States </em>v. <em>LaBonte, </em>520 U. S. 751 (1997), supports our interpretation of ACCA. The statute at issue in <em>LaBonte, </em>a provision of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, as amended, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(h), directed the United States Sentencing Commission to \u201cassure\u201d that the Sentencing Guidelines specify a prison sentence \u201cat or near the maximum term authorized for categories of\u201d adult offenders who commit their third felony drug offense or violent crime. We held that the phrase \u201cmaximum term authorized\u201d \u201crefers to all applicable statutes,\u201d including recidivist enhancements. 520 U. S., at 758, n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Respondent claims that <em>LaBonte </em>supports his position because ACCA, unlike 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(h), does not refer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>\u201ccategories of\u201d offenders. Respondent suggests that Congress\u2019 failure to include such language in ACCA means that Congress intended to refer to a \u201cmaximum term\u201d that does not depend on whether a defendant falls into the first-time-offender or recidivist \u201ccategory.\u201d Respondent does not explain how 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A) could have easily been reworded to mirror 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(h). But in any event, the language used in ACCA, for the reasons explained above, is more than clear enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Respondent argues that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision is supported by the so-called \u201ccategorical\u201d approach that we used in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>495 U. S. 575 (1990), in determining which offenses qualify as \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) provides that four enumerated crimes \u2014 burglary, arson, extortion, and offenses involving the use of explosives \u2014 are \u201cviolent felonies]\u201d for ACCA purposes. In <em>Taylor, </em>we held that Congress intended for these crimes to have a \u201cuniform definition\u201d that was \u201cindependent of the labels employed by the various States\u2019 criminal codes.\u201d 495 U. S., at 592. According to respondent, \u201c[t]he categorical approach rests on the congressional intent \u2014 reflected in the statutory language\u2014 to focus the ACCA inquiry on the offense of conviction, rather than on collateral matters unrelated to the definition of the crime.\u201d Brief for Respondent 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We see no connection, however, between the issue in <em>Taylor </em>(the meaning of the term \u201cburglary\u201d in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)) and the issue here (the meaning of the phrase \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii)). <em>Taylor </em>held that the meaning of \u201cburglary\u201d for purposes of ACCA does not depend on the label attached by the law of a particular State, 495 U. S., at 600-601, but the \u201cmaximum penalty prescribed by law\u201d for a state offense necessarily depends on state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">For a similar reason, we reject respondent\u2019s argument that, under our interpretation, offenses that are not really <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>serious will be included as \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d because of recidivist enhancements. In \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), Congress chose to rely on the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed\u201d by state law as the measure of the seriousness of state offenses involving the manufacture, distribution, or possession of illegal drugs. Congress presumably thought \u2014 not without reason \u2014 that if state lawmakers provide that a crime is punishable by 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, the lawmakers must regard the crime as \u201cserious,\u201d and Congress chose to defer to the state lawmakers\u2019 judgment. Therefore, our interpretation poses no risk that a drug-trafficking offense will be treated as \u201cserious\u201d without satisfying the standard that Congress prescribed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Respondent argues that it will often be difficult to determine whether a defendant faced the possibility of a recidivist enhancement in connection with a past state drug conviction and that therefore our interpretation of ACCA will require the federal courts to \u201cengage in difficult inquiries regarding novel questions of state law and complex factual determinations about long-past proceedings in state courts.\u201d Brief for Respondent 21. Respondent greatly exaggerates the problems to which he refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>First, in some cases, a defendant will have received a recidivist enhancement, and this will necessarily be evident from the length of the sentence imposed. Second, as the present case illustrates, see App. 16, 42, 93, the judgment of conviction will sometimes list the maximum possible sentence even where the sentence that was imposed did not exceed the top sentence allowed without any recidivist enhancement. Third, as respondent himself notes, some jurisdictions require that the prosecution submit a formal charging document in order to obtain a recidivist enhancement. See Brief for Respondent 33. Such documents fall within the limited list of generally available documents that courts already consult for the purpose of determining if a past conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate. See <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U. S. 13, 20 (2005). Fourth, in those cases in which the defendant pleaded guilty to the state drug charges, the plea colloquy will very often include a statement by the trial judge regarding the maximum penalty. This is mandated by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(H), and many States have similar requirements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, in those cases in which the records that may properly be consulted do not show that the defendant faced the possibility of a recidivist enhancement, it may well be that the Government will be precluded from establishing that a conviction was for a qualifying offense. The mere possibility that some future cases might present difficulties cannot justify a reading of ACCA that disregards the clear meaning of the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"AIn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Respondent\u2019s last argument is that if recidivist enhancements can increase the \u201cmaximum term\u201d of imprisonment under ACCA, it must follow that mandatory guidelines systems that cap sentences can decrease the \u201cmaximum term\u201d of imprisonment. Brief for Respondent 38. In each situation, respondent argues, the \u201cmaximum term\u201d of imprisonment is the term to which the state court could actually have sentenced the defendant. Respondent concedes that he has waived this argument with respect to his own specific state-court convictions. See Brief in Opposition 15, n. 7. He argues, however, that Congress cannot have wanted to make the \u201cmaximum term\u201d of imprisonment for ACCA purposes dependent on the complexities of state sentencing guidelines. We conclude, however, that the phrase \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law\u201d for the \u201coffense\u201d was not meant to apply to the top sentence in a guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">First, the top sentence in a guidelines range is generally not really the \u201cmaximum term . . . prescribed by law\u201d for the \u201coffense\u201d because guidelines systems typically allow a sentencing judge to impose a sentence that exceeds the top of the guidelines range under appropriate circumstances. The United States Sentencing Guidelines, for example, permit \u201cupward departures,\u201d see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K2.0 (Nov. 2007), and essentially the same characteristic was shared by all of the mandatory guidelines systems in existence at the time of the enactment of the ACCA provision at issue in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>(Following this pattern, Washington law likewise provided at the time of respondent\u2019s state convictions that a sentencing judge could \u201cimpose a sentence outside the standard sentence range\u201d upon a finding \u201cthat there [were] substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence.\u201d Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9.94A.120(2) (1994).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Second, the concept of the \u201cmaximum\u201d term of imprisonment or sentence prescribed by law was used in many statutes that predated the enactment of ACCA and the federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-473, \u00a7211, 98 Stat. 1987, and in all those statutes the concept necessarily referred to the maximum term prescribed by the relevant criminal statute, not the top of a sentencing guidelines range. See, <em>e. g., </em>18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3 (1982 ed.) (\u201c[A]n accessory after the fact shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment ... for the punishment of the principal\u201d); \u00a7 3575(b) (allowing for an increased sentence for dangerous special offenders \u201cnot disproportionate in severity to the maximum term otherwise authorized by law for\u201d the underlying felony); see also \u00a7371 (the punishment for conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor \u201cshall not exceed the maximum punishment provided for such misdemeanor\u201d); \u00a73651 (allowing for confinement and suspension of sentence upon conviction of an offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment \u201cif the maximum sentence for such offense is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>more than six months\u201d); \u00a7 3653 (referring to the \u201cmaximum probation period\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">It is instructive that, even in the Sentencing Reform Act, the concept of the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d prescribed for an offense was used in this sense. See \u00a7 212, 98 Stat. 1991-1992 (new 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3559 classifying offenses based on \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment authorized... by the statute describing the offense\u201d); \u00a7 235(b)(1)(F), 98 Stat. 2032 (\u201cThe maximum term of imprisonment in effect on the effective date [of the Sentencing Reform Act]\u201d remains in effect for five years after the effective date \u201cfor an offense committed before the effective date\u201d); \u00a7 1003(a), <em>id., </em>at 2138 (solicitation to commit a crime of violence punishable by \u201cone-half the maximum term of imprisonment... prescribed for the punishment of the crime solicited\u201d). In light of this established pattern and the relative newness of sentencing guidelines systems when the ACCA provision at issue here was added, we conclude that Congress meant for the concept of the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d prescribed by law for an \u201coffense\u201d to have the same meaning in ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Our decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>R. L. C., </em>503 U. S. 291 (1992), is not to the contrary. The statutory provision there, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 5037(c) (2000 ed.), set out the term of official detention for a juvenile found to be a delinquent. This provision was amended by the Sentencing Reform Act, see \u00a7 214, 98 Stat. 2013, and then amended again two years later, see \u00a7\u00a721(a)(2)-(4), 100 Stat. 3596. As thus amended, the provision did not refer to the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d prescribed for an \u201coffense.\u201d Rather, the provision focused on the particular juvenile being sentenced. It provided that, \u201cfin the case of a juvenile who is less than eighteen years old,\u2019\u201d official detention could not extend beyond the earlier of two dates: the juvenile\u2019s 21st birthday or \u201c\u2018the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult.\u2019\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>R. L. C., supra, </em>at 295-296, n. 1 (quoting 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>U. S. C. \u00a7 5037(c)). Because this provision clearly focuses on the circumstances of the particular juvenile and not on the offense, 503 U. S., at 299, it is not analogous to the ACCA provision that is before us in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">For these reasons, we hold that the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment... prescribed by law\u201d for the state drug convictions at issue in this case was the 10-year maximum set by the applicable recidivist provision. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The Court chooses one reading of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), over another that would make at least as much sense of the statute\u2019s ambiguous text and would follow the counsel of a tradition of lenity in construing perplexing criminal laws. The Court\u2019s choice, moreover, promises hard times for the trial courts that will have to make the complex sentencing calculations this decision demands. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">The ACCA mandates a 15-year minimum sentence for anyone convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g) (2000 ed.) who \u201chas three previous convictions [for] a serious drug offense\u201d among his prior crimes. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Section 924(e)(2)(A) (2000 ed.) defines \u201cserious drug offense\u201d as an offense under state or federal drug laws, \u201cfor which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d This limitation leaves open the question whether a given conviction qualifies as \u201cserious\u201d by refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ence to the penalty for the acts making up the basic offense, regardless of who commits it, or whether account must also be taken of further facts (such as an offender\u2019s criminal record that qualified him for an enhanced penalty at the time of that earlier conviction). If the first alternative is the reading Congress intended, a sentencing judge needs to look only to the penalty specified for the basic offense committed by a first-time offender. But if the second is the intended one, a judge may have to consider sentencing variations (for using a gun, say, or for repeating the offense) set out in other provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">It all turns on the meaning of the word \u201coffense,\u201d to which the \u201cmaximum term\u201d is tied. One can naturally read \u201can offense\u201d at a general level as synonymous with \u201ca crime,\u201d which would tend to rule out reference to m\u00e1ximums adjusted for other facts; we do not usually speak of a crime of \u201cburglary while having a criminal record and while out on bail.\u201d Those details would come up only if we were speaking about a specific instance, described as a burglary \u201ccommitted by someone with a record while out on bail,\u201d in which case the other facts may \u201cenhance\u201d his sentence beyond what would have been the maximum term for burglary. The trouble is that \u201coffense\u201d could easily refer to a specific occurrence, too; looking at it that way would make it less jarring to suggest that the circumstances around an event that authorize higher penalty ranges (such as the use of a gun) or the defendant\u2019s history (like a prior conviction) ought to count in identifying the maximum penalty for the offense committed on the given day, at the given place, by the particular offender, in a given way. Either reading seems to offer a plausible take on the \u201coffense\u201d for which the ACCA court will have to identify or calculate \u201cmaximum\u201d penalties, under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We get no help from imagining the circumstances in which a sentencing court would ask which reading to adopt. The choice of answer would be easy if the question arose in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>mind of a lawyer whose client is thinking about a guilty plea and asks what maximum term he faces. See <em>ante, </em>at 383. His lawyer knows that he means the maximum term for him in his case. When a repeat offender wants to know, counsel understands that the penalty prescribed for the basic crime without the recidivist add-on is not the baseline for comparison that may make or break the potential plea agreement. And if the repeat offender faces a further statutory enhancement for carrying a gun during the offense, or for being out on bail, his lawyer would not tell him the maximum term for repeat offenders without guns or bail restrictions. By the same token, if the offender faced (as Rodriquez did) a lower sentence ceiling than what the statute says, by grace of mandatory sentencing guidelines, his lawyer would know enough to tell him that his maximum was capped in this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">When the issue comes up not in a particular client\u2019s questions about his own prospects, however, but in a trial judge\u2019s mind wondering about the meaning of the general statute, context gives no ready answer. Nor does it break the tie to say, as the Court does, that taking \u201cmaximum\u201d to refer to the basic offense would mean that a recidivist with add-ons could be sentenced above the ACCA \u201cmaximum,\u201d see <em>ante, </em>at 383 (\u201c[E]ven if respondent had been sentenced to, say, six years\u2019 imprisonment, \u2018the maximum term of imprisonment\u2019 prescribed by law still would have been five years\u201d). That description, after all, might be just a verbal quirk showing the statutory design in proper working order: if Congress meant an offense to be viewed generically and apart from offender characteristics, a gap between the maximum for ACCA purposes, and a heavier, actual sentence accounting for a defendant\u2019s history is to be expected.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The text does not point to any likelier interpretive choices, and as between these alternatives, it is simply ambiguous. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because I do not believe its ambiguity is fairly resolved in the Government\u2019s favor, I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">None of the Court\u2019s three principal points or ripostes solves the puzzle. To begin with, there is something arbitrary about trying to resolve the ambiguity by rejecting the maximum-for-basic-offense option while declining to consider an entire class of offender-based sentencing adjustments. If offender characteristics are going to count in identifying the relevant maximum penalty, it would seem to follow that in jurisdictions with mandatory sentencing guidelines, the maximum \u201cprescribed by law\u201d would be what the guidelines de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>termine. The original Federal Guidelines, and the mandatory state guidelines I am aware of, were established under statutory authority that invests a guideline with the same legal status as a customary penalty provision. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>R. L. C., </em>503 U. S. 291, 297 (1992) (\u201cThe answer to any suggestion that the statutory character of a specific penalty provision gives it primacy over administrative sentencing guidelines is that the mandate to apply the Guidelines is itself statutory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The Court tries to deflect the implication of its position by denying that state sentencing guidelines really do set maximum penalties, since typically they allow a judge to depart from them, up or down, when specified conditions are met. See <em>ante, </em>at 390-391. But while this is true, the objection stands. However a particular mandatory guideline scheme works, it sets a maximum somewhere; if it includes conditions affecting what would otherwise be a guideline maximum, the top of the range as affected should be the relevant maximum on the Court\u2019s reading of the statute. Indeed, the factual conditions involved are usually offender characteristics, and if the ACCA is going to count them under offense-defining statutes or freestanding recidivism laws, those same facts ought to count under a guideline rule (whether setting, or authorizing a departure from, a particular limit). There is no practical difference whether m\u00e1ximums are adjusted by a statute, a statutorily mandated guideline, or a guideline-specified departure; wherever a \u201cprescription] by law\u201d resides, it ought to be honored by the ACCA court.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">If we were to follow the Court\u2019s lights, then, I think we would have to accept the complication that guidelines schemes present, and face the difficulty of calculating enhanced m\u00e1ximums in guidelines jurisdictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> What we cannot do is resolve statutory ambiguity by looking to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>sentencing range for an imaginary offender who meets statutory conditions for altering the basic sentence, but is artificially stripped of any characteristic that triggers a guideline rule also \u201cprescribed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The more fundamental objection, though, goes to the Court\u2019s basic conclusion that it makes the better sense to read the ACCA as resting the federal treatment of recidivists on the maximum sentence authorized by state recidivist schemes, in cases where state law must be considered. The Court says it would have been natural for Congress to think in terms of state judgments about repeat criminals when thinking about what to do at the national level, and the Court is quite possibly right about this; the fact that the federal penalty may turn on a state felony classification at all shows that Congress was thinking about state law. But the chances are at least equally good that the Court is wrong; it is odd to think that Congress would have piggybacked the federal system on state repeat-offender schemes, given the extraordinary and irreconcilable variations among state policies on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">For one thing, the States\u2019 recidivism schemes vary in their methods for augmenting sentences. Iowa\u2019s law, for example, subjects repeat drug offenders to triple penalties, Iowa Code \u00a7 124.411(1) (2005); but in Wisconsin a repeat drug distributor will see his maximum term increased by a fixed number of years, whatever the starting point, see, <em>e. g., </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 961.48(l)(b) (2003-2004) (4-year increase for Class H felony such as selling one kilogram of marijuana).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">More striking than differing structures, though, are the vast disparities in severity from State to State: under Massachusetts drug laws, a third conviction for selling a small amount of marijuana carries a maximum of 2.5 years. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 94C, \u00a732C(b) (West 2006). In Delaware, a third conviction means a mandatory sentence of life in prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>without parole. See Del. Code Aun., Tit. 11, \u00a7 4214(b) (2007) (third-felony penalty of life without parole for violations of nonnarcotic controlled substances law, Tit. 16, \u00a7 4752 (2003)). That Congress might have chosen to defer to state-law judgments about \u201cseriousness\u201d that vary so widely for the same conduct is at least open to doubt. And that doubt only gets worse when we notice that even where two States have similar maximum penalties for a base-level offense, their recidivist enhancements may lead the same conduct to trigger the ACCA sanction in one State but not the other: on the Court\u2019s view, an offender\u2019s second conviction for selling, say, just over two pounds of marijuana will qualify as an ACCA predicate crime if the conviction occurred in Arizona (maximum of 13 years), Iowa (15 years), Utah (15 years), and the District of Columbia (10 years), for example;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but it will fall short of the mark in California (8 years), Michigan (8 years), and New York (8 years).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Yet in each of these States, the base-level offense has a maximum term falling within a much narrower range (between 3.5 and 5.5 years).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With this backdrop of state law, the Government can hardly be heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>to say that there would be something \u201cincongruous\u201d about a federal law targeting offenses flagged by the penalties assigned only to bare conduct, without regard to recidivism or other offender facts. Brief for United States 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Nor does it show what the ACCA means by \u201cmaximum\u201d or \u201coffense\u201d when the Court points to language from our prior cases saying that enhanced recidivist penalties are not to be viewed as retroactive punishment for past crimes, for purposes of double-jeopardy and right-to-counsel enquiries. See <em>ante, </em>at 385-386 (citing <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>United States, </em>511 U. S. 738, 747 (1994), and <em>Gryger </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948)). The quotations show that a separate offense is identified by an enhanced penalty, the Court says, because from them we can draw the conclusion that \u201c[w]hen a defendant is given a higher sentence under a recidivism statute,\u201d nonetheless \u201c100% of the punishment is for the offense of conviction,\u201d leaving nothing to be attributed to \u201cprior convictions or the defendant\u2019s \u2018status as a recidivist,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Still, the fact is that state-law m\u00e1ximums for repeat offenders sometimes bear hardly any relation to the gravity of the triggering offense, as \u201cthree-strikes\u201d laws (not to mention the Delaware example, above) often show. See, <em>e. g., </em>Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, \u00a75/33B-l (2004) (mandatory life sentence for third \u201cClass X\u201d felony, such as dealing heroin, without regard to the specific penalty gradation for the latest Class X felony or to any similarity with prior offenses); W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 61-ll-18(c) (2005) (if offender was \u201ctwice before convicted in the United States of a crime punishable by confinement in a penitentiary,\u201d third such conviction incurs a mandatory life sentence). Cf. <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>California, </em>538 U. S. 11,30, n. 2 (2003) (plurality opinion) (the \u201cCalifornia Legislature therefore made a deliberate policy decision . . . that the gravity of the new felony should not be a determinative factor in triggering the application of the Three Strikes Law\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). And there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>denying that the fact of prior convictions (or a defendant\u2019s recidivist status) is necessary for the \u201c \u2018stiffened penalty\u2019 \u201d to be imposed for \u201c \u2018the latest crime,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 386, the necessary fact being specific to the offender, and falling outside the definition of the offense. This is, after all, what it means to apply an \u201cenhancement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The upshot is that it may have been natural for Congress to think of state recidivism schemes, but it may well not have been. If there is anything strange about ignoring enhanced penalties, there is something at least as strange about a federal recidivist statute that piles enhancement on enhancement, magnifying the severity of state laws severe to begin with.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Whatever may be the plausibility of the offender-based reading of the statute as the Court describes it, the Court\u2019s description avoids a source of serious doubt by glossing over the practical problems its take on the statute portends. The Court is unmoved by the argument that Congress probably did not expect federal courts applying the ACCA to master the countless complications of state sentencing schemes; because all jurisdictions provide for enhanced sentencing some way or another, the Court thinks there is nothing threatening in the subject, which it tries to simplify by offering a few practical pointers. It notes that there will be cases with a qualifying enhancement \u201cevident from the length of the sentence imposed\u201d by the state court; sometimes, it says, a court\u2019s \u201cjudgment of conviction will . . . list the maximum possible sentence\u201d; or the state prosecutor will have \u201csubmit[ted] a formal charging document in order to obtain a recidivist enhancement.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 389. And in cases involving pleas, the Court notes, \u201cthe plea colloquy will very often include a statement by the trial judge regarding the maximum penalty.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Even when there are no pointers to help, says the Court, and \u201cthe records that may properly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>consulted\u201d yield no clear answer, the worst that can happen will be the Government\u2019s inability to show that a prior conviction qualifies. <em>Ante, </em>at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">But it is not that easy, and the Court\u2019s pointers are not much comfort. To start with, even where a \u201cmaximum\u201d sentence is mentioned in state records, how will the ACCA court be supposed to know that the \u201cmaximum\u201d written down there is what the Court today holds that \u201cmaximum\u201d means? A State\u2019s number below 10 years may refer to the base-level offense, or it may be the reduced maximum required by mandatory guidelines; and a number over 10 years may be the product of other enhancements (as for weapons use or being out on bail at the time of commission). Having to enquire into just what imposed sentences or what trial documents really mean would seem to leave plenty of sorting out for the federal courts to do (or at least, for federal prosecutors, if they end up with the job).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Another example: state laws are not written to coordinate with the ACCA, and if a State\u2019s specific repeat drug-offender provisions, say, are supposed to be read together with its general habitual-offender statutes, the resulting \u201cmaximum\u201d may not be the Court\u2019s \u201cmaximum.\u201d Indeed, a federal court may have to figure out just how those state statutes may be read together to avoid conflict between them, when the way to avoid conflict is not clear cut even for the state courts, see, <em>e. g., Goldberg </em>v. <em>State, </em>282 Ga. 542, 651 S. E. 2d 667 (2007) (general recidivist statute trumps more specific one; overruling same court\u2019s decision in <em>Mikell </em>v. <em>State, </em>270 Ga. 467,510 S. E. 2d 523 (1999)); <em>State </em>v. <em>Keith, </em>102 N. M. 462,697 P. 2d 145 (App. 1985) (specific trumps general). Cf. <em>Clines </em>v. <em>State, </em>912 So. 2d 550 (Fla. 2005) (relying on rule of lenity to resolve whether multiple recidivist categories in same habitual-offender law could apply to a single sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">And there is more: as Rodriquez reminds us, just deciding what counts as a \u201cprior\u201d offense under state law is not always an easy thing. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>9 Cal. 4th 580, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>583, 889 P. 2d 541, 542 (1995). (noting difficulty of applying requirement that \u201cprior\u201d charges have been \u201cbrought and tried separately,\u201d where defendant had been convicted in trials occurring one day apart and sentenced at the same court session; in the end, drawing the needed inference from docket numbers revealed on documents requested from the municipal trial court); <em>id., </em>at 595,889 P. 2d, at 550 (Werdegar, J., dissenting) (protesting the court\u2019s solicitation and use of extrarecord documents). Nor would that sort of enquiry get any easier, or be more likely to benefit from well-settled state law, when a given State\u2019s law takes account of prior offenses in other States, see <em>Timothy </em>v. <em>State, </em>90 P. 3d 177 (Alaska App. 2004) (holding Oklahoma burglary not to be analogous to one in Alaska, for purposes of Alaska\u2019s recidivism enhancements, thus overruling its own 2-year-old decision, <em>Butts </em>v. <em>State, </em>53 P. 3d 609 (2002)); or, to take a specific example, when what qualifies a prior offense under one State\u2019s recidivism scheme is the length of the sentence authorized by another State\u2019s law (raising the question whether that first State would see recidivist enhancements the same way the Court does today). See, <em>e.g., </em>N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:44-4(c) (West 2005) (\u201cA conviction in another jurisdiction shall constitute a prior conviction of a crime if a sentence of imprisonment in excess of 6 months was authorized under the law of the other jurisdiction\u201d); N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a731-18-17(D)(2)(b) (2007 Supp.) (defining \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>a felony \u201cpunishable [by] a maximum term of imprisonment of more than one year\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">A still thornier problem is how federal courts are supposed to treat a State\u2019s procedural safeguards for using prior convictions at sentencing. Saying that congressional deference to the States\u2019 judgments about the severity of crimes also extends to their judgments about recidivism raises, but does not answer, the question whether such deference goes only as far as the state courts themselves could go in raising penalties. (The Court\u2019s disregard of mandatory sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>guidelines would seem to suggest that the answer is no.) In those States that require notice before the prosecutor can seek a recidivism enhancement, for example, how will a federal court decide whether the ACCA counts a prior conviction that would have qualified for recidivism enhancement if the state prosecutor had not failed to give timely notice? See, <em>e. g., Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>430 Mass. 517, 522, 722 N. E. 2d 406, 409 (1999) (noting longstanding rule that the indictment must give notice of prior convictions \u201cthat may subject the defendant to enhanced punishment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">I could go on, but this is enough to show that the Court\u2019s interpretation promises that ACCA courts will face highly complicated enquiries into every State\u2019s or Territory\u2019s collection of ancillary sentencing laws. That is an unconvincing answer to the ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">At the end of the day, a plainly superior reading may well be elusive; one favoring the Government certainly is. It does not defy common English or common sense, after all, to look at a statute with one penalty range for the basic crime and a higher one for a repeat offender and say that the former sets the maximum penalty for the \u201coffense\u201d; but neither is it foolish to see the \u201coffense\u201d as defined by its penalty, however that is computed. What I have said so far suggests that I think the basic-crime view of \u201coffense\u201d is the better one, but I will concede that the competing positions are pretty close to evenly matched. And on that assumption, there is a ready tiebreaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The interpretation adopted by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals is the one counseled by the rule of lenity, which applies where (as here) we have \u201c \u2018seiz[ed] every thing from which aid can be derived,\u2019\u201d but are \u201cleft with an ambiguous statute,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>404 U. S. 336, 347 (1971) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fisher, 2 </em>Cranch 358, 386 (1805) (opinion for the Court by Marshall, C. J.)). The rule is grounded in \u201c \u2018the instinctive distaste against men languish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>ing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly said they should/\u201d <em>Bass, supra, </em>at 348 (quoting H. Friendly, Benchmarks 209 (1967)), and we have used it to resolve questions both about metes and bounds of criminal conduct and about the severity of sentencing, see <em>Bifulco </em>v. <em>United States, </em>447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980) (collecting cases). \u201cThis policy of lenity means that the Court will not interpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d <em>Ladner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">This is why lenity should control here. Even recognizing the best that can be said for the Government\u2019s side, its position rests on debatable guesswork to send a man to prison for 180 months, as against 92 months on the basic-crime view. And the District Courts will be imposing higher sentences more than doubling the length of the alternative in a good many other cases, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The \u201cfair warning\u201d that motivates the lenity rule, <em>McBoyle </em>v. <em>United States, </em>283 U. S. 25,27 (1931) (opinion for the Court by Holmes, J.), may sometimes be a benign fiction, see <em>R. L. C., </em>503 U. S., at 309 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), but there is only one reading of this statute with any realistic chance of giving fair notice of how the ACCA will apply, and that is the reading the District Court and the Court of Appeals each chose. Their choice should be ours, too.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-11\"> \u201cExcept as authorized by this chapter, it is unlawful for any person to manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance.\u201d Wash.

Given that Schedule III substances include anabolic steroids and painkillers with specified amounts of certain narcotics like opium, see 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 812, one might debate respondent\u2019s assertion that distribution of these narcotics is not \u201cserious\u201d in the generic sense of the word. However, Congress chose to defer to the Michigan Legislature\u2019s judgment that the offense was \u201cserious\u201d enough to warrant punishment of first offenses by up to seven years\u2019 imprisonment, and certain repeat offenses by a maximum term of life imprisonment.

At the other extreme, it might mean the maximum for a, purely hypothetical \u201cworst\u201d offender who incurs all possible add-ons. Or perhaps it means a fictional version of the actual offender, say, one qualifying for some statutory add-ons but not for any guidelines rules (as the Court would have it); or maybe one who qualifies for both the statutory and the guidelines departures for which the actual offender was eligible, even though not all of those departures were applied by the state court.
