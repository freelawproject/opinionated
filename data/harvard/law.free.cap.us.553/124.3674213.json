S. C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). That minimum doubles to 20 years for defendants previously convicted of a \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The question in this case is whether a state drug offense classified as a misdemeanor, but punishable by more than one year\u2019s imprisonment, is a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Two statutory definitions figure in our decision. Section 802(13) defines the unadorned term \u201cfelony\u201d to mean any \u201coffense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\u201d Section 802(44) defines the compound term \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d to mean an offense involving specified drugs that is \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The term \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d contained in \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)\u2019s provision for a 20-year minimum sentence, we hold, is defined exclusively by \u00a7 802(44) and does not incorporate \u00a7 802(13)\u2019s definition of \u201cfelony.\u201d A state drug offense punishable by more than one year therefore qualifies as a \u201cfelony drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>offense,\u201d even if state law classifies the offense as a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Petitioner Keith Lavon Burgess pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A violation of \u00a7 841(a) involving that quantity of cocaine base ordinarily carries a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The minimum sentence increases to 20 years, however, if the crime follows a prior conviction for a \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Burgess had previously been convicted of possessing cocaine in violation of S. C. Code Ann. \u00a7 44-53-370(c) and (d)(1) (2002 and Supp. 2007). Although that offense carried a maximum sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment, South Carolina classified it as a misdemeanor. \u00a7 44-53-370(d)(l). Burgess\u2019 prior South Carolina conviction, the Government urged, raised the minimum sentence for his federal conviction to 20 years. The enhancement was mandatory, the Government maintained, because Congress defined \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d to include state cocaine offenses \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\u201d 21 U. S. C. \u00a7802(44).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Burgess contested the enhancement of his federal sentence. The term \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d he argued, incorporates the term \u201cfelony,\u201d a word separately defined in \u00a7 802(13) to mean \u201cany Federal or State offense classified by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\u201d A prior drug offense does not rank as a \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d he contended, unless it is (1) classified as a felony under the law of the punishing jurisdiction, per \u00a7 802(13); and (2) punishable by more than one year\u2019s imprisonment, per \u00a7 802(44).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Rejecting Burgess\u2019 argument, the District Court ruled that \u00a7 802(44) alone controls the meaning of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Although the District Court\u2019s ruling subjected Burgess to a 20-year minimum sentence, the Government moved for a downward departure based on Burgess\u2019 substantial assistance in another prosecution. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The court granted the motion and sentenced Burgess to 156 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by ten years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. The \u201c\u2018commonsense way to interpret \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d \u2019 \u201d that court said, \u201c \u2018is by reference to the definition in \u00a7802(44).\u2019\u201d 478 F. 3d 658, 662 (2007) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>459 F. 3d 39, 52 (CAI 2006)). The Fourth Circuit found nothing in the \u201cplain language or statutory scheme ... to indicate that Congress intended \u2018felony drug offense\u2019 also to incorporate the definition [of \u2018felony\u2019] in \u00a7 802(13).\u201d 478 F. 3d, at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Burgess, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>petitioned for a writ of certiorari. We granted the writ, 552 U. S. 1074 (2007), to resolve a split among the Circuits on the question Burgess presents: Does a drug crime classified as a misdemeanor by state law, but punishable by more than one year\u2019s imprisonment, rank as a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d under 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)? Compare 478 F. 3d 658 (case below) and <em>Roberson, </em>459 F. 3d 39 (\u00a7 802(44) provides exclusive definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>West, </em>393 F. 3d 1302 (CADC 2005) (both \u00a7 802(13) and \u00a7 802(44) limit meaning of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U. S. C. \u00a7801 <em>et seq., </em>contains two definitions central to the dispute before us; they bear repetition in full. Section 802(13) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018felony\u2019 means any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Section 802(44) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201cThe term \u2018felony drug offense\u2019 means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, anabolic steroids, or depressant or stimulant substances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Burgess argues here, as he did below, that \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d as used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), should be construed to incorporate both the definition of \u201cfelony\u201d in \u00a7 802(13) and the definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d in \u00a7802(44). Under his reading, the \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) enhancement is triggered only when the prior conviction is both \u201cclassified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony,\u201d \u00a7 802(13), and \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for more than one year,\u201d \u00a7802(44).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">The Government, in contrast, reads \u00a7802(44) to provide the exclusive definition of \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d Under the Government\u2019s reading, all defendants whose prior drug crimes were punishable by more than one year in prison would be subject to the \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) enhancement, regardless of the punishing jurisdiction\u2019s classification of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">The Government\u2019s reading, we are convinced, correctly interprets the statutory text and context. Section 802(44) defines the precise phrase used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) \u2014 \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d \u201cStatutory definitions control the meaning of statutory words ... in the usual case.\u201d <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Suwannee </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>Fruit &amp; S. S. Co., </em>386 U. S. 198, 201 (1949). See also <em>Stenberg </em>v. <em>Carhart, </em>530 U. S. 914, 942 (2000) (\u201cWhen a statute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that definition . . . .\u201d); 2A N. Singer &amp; J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a747:7, pp. 298-299, and nn. 2-3 (7th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Singer).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The CSA, to be sure, also defines the term \u201cfelony.\u201d The language and structure of the statute, however, indicate that Congress used the phrase \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as a term of art defined by \u00a7802(44) without reference to \u00a7802(13). First, Congress stated that \u201c[t]he term \u2018felony drug offense\u2019 <em>means </em>an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\u201d \u00a7802(44) (emphasis added). \u201cAs a rule, [a] definition which declares what a term \u2018means\u2019 . . . excludes any meaning that is not stated.\u201d <em>Colautti </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>439 U. S. 379, 392-393, n. 10 (1979) (some internal quotation marks omitted). See also <em>Groman </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>302 U. S. 82, 86 (1937); 2A Singer \u00a747:7, p. 306, and n. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Second, the term \u201cfelony\u201d is commonly defined to mean a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. See, <em>e. g., </em>18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3559(a) (classifying crimes with a maximum term of more than one year as felonies); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 651 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201cfelony\u201d as \u201c[a] serious crime usu[ally] punishable by imprisonment for more than one year or by death\u201d). Section 802(44)\u2019s definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as \u201can offense ... punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,\u201d in short, leaves no blank to be filled by \u00a7802(13) or any other definition of \u201cfelony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Third, if Congress wanted \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d to incorporate the definition of \u201cfelony\u201d in \u00a7 802(13), it easily could have written \u00a7802(44) to state: \u201cThe term \u2018felony drug offense\u2019 means a <em>felony </em>that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year . . . .\u201d See <em>Roberson, </em>459 F. 3d, at 52. Congress has often used that drafting <em>technique </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>peating a discretely defined word \u2014 when it intends to incorporate the definition of a particular word into the definition of a compound expression. See, <em>e. g., </em>15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1672(a)-(b) (defining \u201cearnings\u201d and then defining \u201cdisposable earnings\u201d as \u201cthat part of the earnings\u201d meeting certain criteria); 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1956(c)(3)-(4) (defining \u201ctransaction\u201d and then defining \u201cfinancial transaction\u201d as \u201ca transaction which\u201d meets other criteria); \u00a7 1961(1), (5) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (defining \u201cracketeering activity\u201d and then defining \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d to require \u201cat least two acts of racketeering activity\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Fourth, our reading avoids anomalies that would arise if both 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 802(13) and \u00a7 802(44) governed application of the sentencing enhancement in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Notably, \u00a7802(44) includes foreign offenses punishable by more than one year, while \u00a7 802(13) includes only federal and state offenses. Incorporation of \u00a7802(13) into \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) would exclude enhancement based on a foreign offense, notwithstanding the express inclusion of foreign offenses in \u00a7 802(44)\u2019s definition of \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d Furthermore, some States and many foreign jurisdictions do not label offenses as felonies or misdemeanors. See N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:l-4 (West 2005); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17-A, \u00a71252 (Supp. 2007); Brief for United States 35. Burgess\u2019 compound definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d leaves unanswered the appropriate classification of drug convictions in those jurisdictions. See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>937 F. 2d 68, 70 (CA2 1991) (relying on New Jersey common law to determine that the State classifies offenses punishable by more than one year as felonies). No such uncertainty arises under the precise definition Congress provided in \u00a7802(44).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Finally, reading \u00a7 802(44) as the exclusive definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d hardly renders \u00a7 802(13) extraneous. Section 802(13) serves to define \u201cfelony\u201d for many CSA provisions using that unadorned term. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 824(a)(2) (revocation of license to manufacture controlled substances upon conviction of a felony), 843(b) (use of a communication facility to commit a felony), 843(d)(l)-(2) (sentencing enhancements), 843(e) (prohibition on engaging in transactions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>involving listed chemicals upon conviction of a felony involving those chemicals), 848(c)(1) (definition of \u201ccontinuing criminal enterprise\u201d), 848(e)(1)(B) (mandatory minimum term for killing a law enforcement officer to avoid prosecution for a felony), 853(d) (rebuttable presumption that property acquired during commission of certain felonies is subject to criminal forfeiture), 878(a)(3) (authority to make warrantless arrest where there is probable cause to believe a felony has been committed).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The drafting history of the CSA reinforces our reading of \u00a7802(44) as the exclusive definition of \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d In 1988, Congress first used the term \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d to describe the type of prior conviction that would trigger a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). See National Narcotics Leadership Act, Pub. L. 100-690, \u00a7 6452(a), 102 Stat. 4371. The 1988 definition of the term was placed within \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) itself; the definition covered \u201can offense that is a felony under any . . . Federal law . . . or . . . any law of a State or a foreign country\u201d prohibiting or restricting conduct relating to certain types of drugs. \u00a7 6452(a)(2), <em>ibid </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But in 1994, Congress amended the definition, replacing \u201can offense that is a <em>felony </em>under . . . any law of a State,\u201d <em>ibid, </em>(emphasis added), with \u201can offense that is <em>punishable by imprisonment for more than one year </em>under any law ... of a State,\u201d Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Pub. L. 103-322, \u00a7 90105(c)-(d), 108 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Stat. 1988 (emphasis added). In lieu of incorporation within \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), the new definition was placed in a discrete \u00a7802 definition section. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">This alteration lends considerable support to our reading of the statute. Before 1994, the definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d depended on the vagaries of state-law classifications of offenses as felonies or misdemeanors. The 1994 amendments replaced that definition with a uniform federal standard based on the authorized length of imprisonment. By recognizing \u00a7802(44) as the exclusive definition of \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d our reading serves an evident purpose of the 1994 revision: to bring a measure of uniformity to the application of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) by eliminating disparities based on divergent state classifications of offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">By contrast, Burgess reads the 1994 alteration as merely adding a length-of-imprisonment requirement to a definition that already required \u2014 and, he contends, continues to require \u2014 designation of an offense as a felony by the punishing jurisdiction. That view, however, is difficult to square with Congress\u2019 deletion of the word \u201cfelony\u201d and substitution of the phrase \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">If Burgess were correct, moreover, the sole effect of the 1994 change would have been to exclude from the compass of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) the few drug offenses classified as felonies under the law of the punishing jurisdiction but subject to a sentence of one year or less. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-8.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also Brief for Petitioner 15 (purpose of 1994 alteration was to eliminate enhancement for \u201ctruly minor offenses\u201d nonetheless classified as felonies). Burgess concedes that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>his reading of the statute \u201cthe language that Congress added [in 1994] has very little practical effect,\u201d but defends his interpretation on the ground that Congress labeled the changes \u201cconforming amendments.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. See also 108 Stat. 1987; Brief for Petitioner 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Burgess places more weight on the \u201cConforming Amendments\u201d caption than it can bear. Congress did not disavow any intent to make substantive changes; rather, the amendments were \u201cconforming\u201d because they harmonized sentencing provisions in the CSA and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, 84 Stat. 1285, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 951 <em>et seq. </em>Treating the amendments as nonsubstantive would be inconsistent with their text, not to mention Burgess\u2019 own view that \u00a7802(44) added a new length-of-imprisonment requirement to the definition of \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In sum, the 1994 alteration replaced a patchwork of state and foreign classifications with a uniform federal standard based on the authorized term of imprisonment. Burgess\u2019 argument that Congress added something \u2014 the definition now in \u00a7802(44) \u2014 but subtracted nothing encounters formidable impediments: the text and history of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Burgess urges us to apply the rule of lenity in determining whether the term \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d incorporates \u00a7802(13)\u2019s definition of \u201cfelony.\u201d \u201c[T]he touchstone of the rule of lenity is statutory ambiguity.\u201d <em>Bifulco </em>v. <em>United States, </em>447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe rule comes into operation at the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed,\u201d <em>Callanan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U. S. 587,596 (1961), and \u201capplies only when, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an ambiguous statute,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shabani, </em>513 U. S. 10, 17 (1994). Here, Congress expressly defined the term \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d The definition is coherent, complete, and by all signs exclusive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Accordingly, there is no ambiguity for the rule of lenity to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\"> Although Title 21 of the United States Code has not been enacted as positive law, we refer to it rather than the underlying provisions of the Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, as amended, 21 U.

Thus \u201c[a] term whose statutory definition declares what it \u2018includes\u2019 is more susceptible to extension of meaning . . . than where\u201d \u2014 as in \u00a7802(44) \u2014 \u201cthe definition declares what a term \u2018means.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>Groman </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>302 U. S. 82, 86 (1937) (\u201c[W]hen an exclusive definition is intended the word \u2018means\u2019 is employed,... whereas here the word used is \u2018includes.\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Burgess\u2019 fourth example is also inapposite. The definition of \u201cdebtor\u2019s principal residence\u201d in the Bankruptcy Code, he notes, does not repeat the word \u201cdebtor,\u201d itself a discretely defined term. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 101(13), (13A) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Section 101(13A) states: \u201cThe term \u2018debtor\u2019s principal residence\u2019 \u2014 (A) means a residential structure, including incidental property, without regard to whether that structure is attached to real property; and (B) includes an individual condominium or cooperative unit, a mobile or manufactured home, or trailer.\u201d That definition, unlike 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 802(44), is incomplete on its face because nothing in the definition of \u201cdebtor\u2019s principal residence\u201d elucidates the word \u201cdebtor\u2019s.\u201d Given that void and 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 101(13A)\u2019s placement in the Bankruptcy Code, it is reasonable to assume that Congress wanted courts to read the phrase \u201cdebtor\u2019s principal residence\u201d in light of the separate definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201cdebtor.\u201d Indeed, a contrary reading would yield the absurd result that <em>every </em>residential structure is a \u201cdebtor\u2019s principal residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">At most, therefore, Burgess\u2019 fourth example illustrates the importance of considering context in applying canons of statutory construction. There may well be other examples lurking in the United States Code of nested terms that draw their meaning from two different statutory provisions without repeating one term in the definition of the other. But \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d is not among them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\"> The fall definition stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">\u201cFor purposes of this subparagraph, the term 'felony drug offense\u2019 means an offense that is a felony under any provision of this title or any other Federal law that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances or a felony under any law of a State or a foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances.\u201d National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988, Pub.
