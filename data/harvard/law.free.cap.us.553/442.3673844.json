Stat. \u00a7 1977, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1981(a). The basic question before us is whether the provision encompasses a complaint of retaliation against a person who has complained about a violation of another person\u2019s contract-related \u201cright.\u201d We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The case before us arises out of a claim by respondent, Hedrick G. Humphries, a former assistant manager of a Cracker Barrel restaurant, that CBOCS West, Inc. (Cracker Barrel\u2019s owner), dismissed him (1) because of racial bias (Humphries is a black man) and (2) because he had complained to managers that a fellow assistant manager had dismissed another black employee, Venus Green, for race-based reasons. Humphries timely filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), pursuant to 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-5, and received a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter. He then filed a complaint in Federal District Court charging that CBOCS\u2019 actions violated both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and the older \u201cequal contract rights\u201d provision here at issue, \u00a71981. The District Court dismissed Humphries\u2019 Title VII claims for failure to pay necessary filing fees on a timely basis. It then granted CBOCS\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Humphries\u2019 two \u00a7 1981 claims. Humphries appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled against Humphries and upheld the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in respect to his direct discrimination claim. But it ruled in Humphries\u2019 favor and remanded for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>trial in respect to his \u00a7 1981 retaliation claim. In doing so, the Court of Appeals rejected CBOCS\u2019 argument that \u00a7 1981 did not encompass a claim of retaliation. 474 F. 3d 387 (2007). CBOCS sought certiorari, asking us to consider this last-mentioned legal question. And we agreed to do so. See 551 U. S. 1189 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The question before us is whether \u00a7 1981 encompasses retaliation claims. We conclude that it does. And because our conclusion rests in significant part upon principles of <em>stare decisis, </em>we begin by examining the pertinent interpretive history.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The Court first considered a comparable question in 1969, in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc., </em>396 U. S. 229. The case arose under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1978,42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1982, a statutory provision that Congress enacted just after the Civil War, along with \u00a7 1981, to protect the rights of black citizens. The provision was similar to \u00a7 1981 except that it focused, not upon rights to make and to enforce contracts, but rights related to the ownership of property. The statute provides that \u201c[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\u201d \u00a7 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">Paul E. Sullivan, a white man, had rented his house to T. R. Freeman, Jr., a black man. He had also assigned Freeman a membership share in a corporation, which permitted the owner to use a private park that the corporation controlled. Because of Freeman\u2019s race, the corporation, Little Hunting Park, Inc., refused to approve the share assignment. And, when Sullivan protested, the association expelled Sullivan and took away his membership shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Sullivan sued Little Hunting Park, claiming that its actions violated \u00a71982. The Court upheld Sullivan\u2019s claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>It found that the corporation\u2019s refusal \u201cto approve the assignment of the membership share ... was clearly an interference with Freeman\u2019s [the black lessee\u2019s] right to \u2018lease.\u2019\u201d 396 U. S., at 237. It added that Sullivan, the white lessor, \u201chas standing to maintain this action,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>because, as the Court had previously said, \u201cthe white owner is at times \u2018the only effective adversary\u2019 of the unlawful restrictive covenant.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Barrows </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>346 U. S. 249 (1953)). The Court noted that to permit the corporation to punish Sullivan \u201cfor trying to vindicate the rights of minorities protected by \u00a7 1982\u201d would give \u201cimpetus to the perpetuation of racial restrictions on property.\u201d 396 U. S., at 237. And this Court has made clear that <em>Sullivan </em>stands for the proposition that \u00a7 1982 encompasses retaliation claims. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed., </em>544 U. S. 167,176 (2005) (\u201c[I]n <em>Sullivan </em>we interpreted a general prohibition on racial discrimination [in \u00a71982] to cover retaliation against those who advocate the rights of groups protected by that prohibition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">While the <em>Sullivan </em>decision interpreted \u00a7 1982, our precedents have long construed \u00a7\u00a71981 and 1982 similarly. In <em>Runyon </em>v. <em>McCrary, </em>427 U. S. 160,173 (1976), the Court considered whether \u00a7 1981 prohibits private acts of discrimination. Citing <em>Sullivan, </em>along with <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Alfred H. Mayer Co., </em>392 U. S. 409 (1968), and <em>Tillman </em>v. <em>Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., Inc., </em>410 U. S. 431 (1973), the Court reasoned that this case law \u201cnecessarily requires the conclusion that \u00a7 1981, like \u00a7 1982, reaches private conduct.\u201d 427 U. S., at 173. See also <em>id., </em>at 187 (Powell, J., concurring) (\u201cAlthough <em>[Sullivan </em>and <em>Jones] </em>involved \u00a71982, rather than \u00a7 1981,1 agree that their considered holdings with respect to the purpose and meaning of \u00a7 1982 necessarily apply to both statutes in view of their common derivation\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 190 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\u201c[I]t would be most incongruous to give those two sections [1981 and 1982] a fundamentally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>different construction\u201d). See also <em>Shaare Tefila Congregation </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>481 U. S. 615, 617-618 (1987) (applying to \u00a7 1982 the discussion and holding of <em>Saint Francis College </em>v. <em>AlKhazraji, </em>481 U. S. 604, 609-613 (1987), a case interpreting \u00a71981).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">As indicated in <em>Runyon, </em>the Court has construed \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982 alike because it has recognized the sister statutes\u2019 common language, origin, and purposes. Like \u00a7 1981, \u00a7 1982 traces its origin to \u00a71 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27. See <em>General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>458 U. S. 375, 383-384 (1982) (noting shared historical roots of the two provisions); <em>Tillman, supra, </em>at 439-440 (same). Like \u00a7 1981, \u00a7 1982 represents an immediately post-Civil War legislative effort to guarantee the then newly freed slaves the same legal rights that other citizens enjoy. See <em>General Building Contractors Assn., supra, </em>at 388 (noting strong purposive connection between the two provisions). Like \u00a71981, \u00a71982 uses broad language that says \u201c[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . .\u201d Compare \u00a7 1981\u2019s language set forth above, <em>supra, </em>at 445. See <em>Jones, supra, </em>at 441, n. 78 (noting the close parallel language of the two provisions). Indeed, \u00a7 1982 differs from \u00a7 1981 only in that it refers, not to the \u201cright ... to make and enforce contracts,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1981(a), but to the \u201cright... to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property,\u201d \u00a7 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In light of these precedents, it is not surprising that following <em>Sullivan, </em>federal appeals courts concluded, on the basis of <em>Sullivan </em>or its reasoning, that \u00a7 1981 encompassed retaliation claims. See, <em>e. g., Choudhury </em>v. <em>Polytechnic Inst, of N. Y, </em>735 F. 2d 38, 42-43 (CA2 1984); <em>Goff v. Continental Oil Co., </em>678 F. 2d 593, 598-599 (CA5 1982), overruled, <em>Carter </em>v. <em>South Central Bell, </em>912 F. 2d 832 (1990); <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Lear-Siegler, Inc., </em>558 F. 2d 1266, 1270 (CA6 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>In 1989, 20 years after <em>Sullivan, </em>this Court in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>McLean Credit Union, </em>491 U. S. 164, significantly limited the scope of \u00a7 1981. The Court focused upon \u00a7 1981\u2019s words \u201cto make and enforce contracts\u201d and interpreted the phrase narrowly. It wrote that the statutory phrase did not apply to \u201cconduct by the employer <em>after the contract relation has been established, </em>including breach of the terms of the contract or imposition of discriminatory working conditions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 177 (emphasis added). The Court added that the word \u201cenforce\u201d does not apply to post-contract-formation conduct unless the discrimination at issue <em>\u201cinfects the legal process </em>in ways that prevent one from enforcing contract rights.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). Thus \u00a71981 did not encompass the claim of a black employee who charged that her employer had violated her employment contract by harassing her and failing to promote her, all because of her race. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Since victims of an employer\u2019s retaliation will often have opposed discriminatory conduct taking place <em>after </em>the formation of the employment contract, <em>Patterson\u2019s </em>holding, for a brief time, seems in practice to have foreclosed retaliation claims. With one exception, we have found no federal court of appeals decision between the time we decided <em>Patterson </em>and 1991 that permitted a \u00a7 1981 retaliation claim to proceed. See, <em>e. g., Walker </em>v. <em>South Central Bell Tel. Co., </em>904 F. 2d 275, 276 (CA5 1990) <em>(per curiam); Overby </em>v. <em>Chevron USA, Inc., </em>884 F. 2d 470, 473 (CA9 1989); <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Burke Contracting, Inc., </em>891 F. 2d 1527, 1534-1535 (CA11 1990) <em>(per curiam). </em>See also <em>Malhotra </em>v. <em>Cotter &amp; Co., </em>885 F. 2d 1305, 1312-1314 (CA7 1989) (questioning without deciding the viability of retaliation claims under \u00a71981 after <em>Patterson). </em>But see <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Brown Group, Inc., </em>902 F. 2d 630, 635-638 (CA8 1990) (allowing a claim for discriminatory discharge to proceed under \u00a7 1981), vacated and remanded, 499 U. S. 914 (1991) (ordering reconsideration in light of what became the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Eighth Circuit\u2019s en banc opinion in <em>Taggart </em>v. <em>Jefferson Cty. Child Support Enforcement Unit, </em>935 F. 2d 947 (1991), which held that racially discriminatory discharge claims under \u00a7 1981 are barred).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In 1991, however, Congress weighed in on the matter. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991,105 Stat. 1071, with the design to supersede <em>Patterson. Jones </em>v. <em>R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., </em>541 U. S. 369, 383 (2004). Insofar as is relevant here, the new law changed 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1981 by reenacting the former provision, designating it as \u00a7 1981(a), and adding a new subsection, (b), which, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201c \u2018Make and enforce contracts\u2019 defined</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATq\">\u201cFor purposes of this section, the term \u2018make and enforce contracts\u2019 includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">An accompanying Senate Report pointed out that the amendment superseded <em>Patterson </em>by adding a new subsection (b) that would \u201creaffirm that the right \u2018to make and enforce contracts\u2019 includes the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms and conditions of the contractual relationship.\u201d S. Rep. No. 101-315, p. 6 (1990). Among other things, it would \u201censure that Americans may not be harassed, <em>fired </em>or otherwise discriminated against in contracts because of their race.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). An accompanying House Report said that in \u201ccutting back the scope of the rights to \u2018make\u2019 and \u2018enforce\u2019 contracts[,] <em>Patterson . .. </em>has been interpreted to eliminate retaliation claims that the courts had previously recognized under section 1981.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 1, pp. 92-93, n. 92 (1991). It added that the protections that subsection (b) provided, in \u201cthe context of employment discrimination ... would include, but not be limited to, claims of harassment, discharge, demotion, promotion, transfer, <em>retaliation, </em>and hiring.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>(emphasis added). It also said that the new law \u201cwould restore rights to sue for such retaliatory conduct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 93, n. 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">After enactment <em>of </em>the new law, the Federal Courts of Appeals again reached a broad consensus that \u00a71981, as amended, encompasses retaliation claims. See, <em>e.g., Hawkins </em>v. <em>1115 Legal Serv. Care, </em>163 F. 3d 684, 693 (CA2 1998); <em>Aleman </em>v. <em>Chugach Support Servs., Inc., </em>485 F. 3d 206, 213-214 (CA4 2007); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>University of Houston System, </em>355 F. 3d 333, 338-339 (CA5 2003); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>University of Cincinnati, </em>215 F. 3d 561, 575-576 (CA6 2000); 474 F. 3d, at 403 (case below); <em>Manatt </em>v. <em>Bank of America, NA, </em>339 F. 3d 792, 800-801, and n. 11 (CA9 2003); <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Lakeshore Rehabilitation Hospital, </em>140 F. 3d 1405, 1411-1413 (CA11 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The upshot is this: (1) In 1969, <em>Sullivan, </em>as interpreted by <em>Jackson, </em>recognized that \u00a7 1982 encompasses a retaliation action; (2) this Court has long interpreted \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982 alike; (3) in 1989, <em>Patterson, </em>without mention of retaliation, narrowed \u00a7 1981 by excluding from its scope conduct, namely, post-contract-formation conduct, where retaliation would most likely be found; but in 1991, Congress enacted legislation that superseded <em>Patterson </em>and explicitly defined the scope of \u00a71981 to include post-contract-formation conduct; and (4) since 1991, the lower courts have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 1981 as encompassing retaliation actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\"><em>Sullivan, </em>as interpreted and relied upon by <em>Jackson, </em>as well as the long line of related cases where we construe \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982 similarly, lead us to conclude that the view that \u00a7 1981 encompasses retaliation claims is indeed well embedded in the law. That being so, considerations of <em>stare decisis </em>strongly support our adherence to that view. And those considerations impose a considerable burden upon those who would seek a different interpretation that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>necessarily unsettle many Court precedents. See, <em>e. g., Welch </em>v. <em>Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., </em>483 U. S. 468, 494-495 (1987) (plurality opinion) (describing importance of <em>stare decisis)-, Patterson, </em>491 U. S., at 172 (considerations of <em>stare decisis </em>\u201chave special force in the area of statutory interpretation\u201d); <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U. S. 130, 139 (2008) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In our view, CBOCS\u2019 several arguments, taken separately or together, cannot justify a departure from what we have just described as the well-embedded interpretation of \u00a7 1981. First, CBOCS points to the plain text of \u00a7 1981 \u2014 a text that says that <em>\u201c[a]ll persons ... </em>shall have the same right... to make and enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by <em>white citizens.\u201d </em>42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1981(a) (emphasis added). CBOCS adds that, insofar as Humphries complains of retaliation, he is complaining of a retaliatory action that the employer would have taken against him whether he was black or white, and there is no way to construe this text to cover that kind of deprivation. Thus the text\u2019s language, CBOCS concludes, simply \u201cdoes not provide for a cause of action based on retaliation.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">We agree with CBOCS that the statute\u2019s language does not expressly refer to the claim of an individual (black or white) who suffers retaliation because he has tried to help a different individual, suffering direct racial discrimination, secure his \u00a7 1981 rights. But that fact alone is not sufficient to carry the day. After all, this Court has long held that the statutory text of \u00a7 1981\u2019s sister statute, \u00a7 1982, provides protection from retaliation for reasons related to the <em>enforcement </em>of the express statutory right. See <em>supra, </em>at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Moreover, the Court has recently read another broadly worded civil rights statute, namely, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, as amended, 20 U. S. C. \u00a71681 <em>et seq., </em>as including an antiretaliation remedy. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>2005 in <em>Jackson, </em>the Court considered whether statutory language prohibiting \u201cdiscrimination [on the basis of sex] under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\u201d \u00a7 1681(a), encompassed claims of retaliation for complaints about sex discrimination. 544 U. S., at 173-174. Despite the fact that Title IX does not use the word \u201cretaliation,\u201d the Court held in <em>Jackson </em>that the statute\u2019s language encompassed such a claim, in part because: (1) \u201cCongress enacted Title IX just three years after <em>Sullivan </em>was decided\u201d; (2) it is \u201c \u2018realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar\u2019 \u201d with <em>Sullivan; </em>and (3) Congress consequently \u201c \u2018expected its enactment\u2019 \u201d of Title IX \u201c \u2018to be interpreted in conformity with\u2019 \u201d <em>Sullivan. </em>544 U. S., at 176. The Court in <em>Jackson </em>explicitly rejected the arguments the dissent advances here \u2014 that <em>Sullivan </em>was merely a standing case, see <em>post, </em>at 464-467 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Compare <em>Jackson, </em>544 U. S., at 176, n. 1 <em>(\u201cSullivan\u2019s </em>holding was not so limited. It plainly held that the white owner could maintain his <em>own </em>private cause of action under \u00a7 1982 if he could show that he was \u2018punished for trying to vindicate the rights of minorities\u2019\u201d (emphasis in original)), with <em>id., </em>at 194 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Regardless, the linguistic argument that CBOCS makes was apparent at the time the Court decided <em>Sullivan. </em>See 396 U. S., at 241 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (noting the construction of \u00a7 1982 in <em>Jones, </em>392 U. S. 409, was \u201cin no way required by [the statute\u2019s] language\u201d \u2014 one of the bases of Justice Harlan\u2019s dissent in <em>Jones </em>\u2014 and further contending that the Court in <em>Sullivan </em>had gone \u201cyet beyond\u201d <em>Jones). </em>And we believe it is too late in the day in effect to overturn the holding in that case (nor does CBOCS ask us to do so) on the basis of a linguistic argument that was apparent, and which the Court did not embrace at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Second, CBOCS argues that Congress, in 1991 when it reenacted \u00a71981 with amendments, intended the reenacted statute <em>not </em>to cover retaliation. CBOCS rests this conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>sion primarily upon the fact that Congress <em>did not </em>include an <em>explicit </em>antiretaliation provision or the word \u201cretaliation\u201d in the new statutory language \u2014 although Congress has included explicit antiretaliation language in other civil rights statutes. See, <em>e. g., </em>National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 158(a)(4); Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 215(a)(3); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a); Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 623(d); Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 12203(a)-(b); Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U. S. C. \u00a72615.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We believe, however, that the circumstances to which CBOCS points find a far more plausible explanation in the fact that, given <em>Sullivan </em>and the new statutory language nullifying <em>Patterson, </em>there was no need for Congress to include explicit language about retaliation. After all, the 1991 amendments themselves make clear that Congress intended to supersede the result in <em>Patterson </em>and embrace pre-<em>Patterson </em>law. And <em>pre-Patterson </em>law included <em>Sullivan. </em>See Part II, <em>supra. </em>Nothing in the statute\u2019s text or in the surrounding circumstances suggests any congressional effort to supersede <em>Sullivan </em>or the interpretation that courts have subsequently given that case. To the contrary, the amendments\u2019 history indicates that Congress intended to restore that interpretation. See, <em>e. g., </em>H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, at 92 (noting that \u00a7 1981(b) in the \u201ccontext of employment discrimination ... would include ... claims of... retaliation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Third, CBOCS points out that \u00a71981, if applied to employment-related retaliation actions, would overlap with Title VII. It adds that Title VII requires that those who invoke its remedial powers satisfy certain procedural and administrative requirements that \u00a71981 does not contain. See, <em>e. g., </em>42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l) (charge of discrimination must be brought before EEOC within 180 days of the discriminatory act); \u00a72000e-5(f)(l) (suit must be filed within 90 days of obtaining an EEOC right-to-sue letter). And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>CBOCS says that permitting a \u00a71981 retaliation action would allow a retaliation plaintiff to circumvent Title VII\u2019s \u201cspecific administrative and procedural mechanisms,\u201d thereby undermining their effectiveness. Brief for Petitioner 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">This argument, however, proves too much. Precisely the same kind of Title VII/\u00a7 1981 \u201coverlap\u201d and potential circumvention exists in respect to employment-related direct discrimination. Yet Congress explicitly created the overlap in respect to direct employment discrimination. Nor is it obvious how we can interpret \u00a71981 to avoid <em>employment-related </em>overlap without eviscerating \u00a71981 in respect to %o%-employment contracts where no such overlap exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Regardless, we have previously acknowledged a \u201cnecessary overlap\u201d between Title VII and \u00a7 1981. <em>Patterson, </em>491 U. S., at 181. We have added that the \u201cremedies available under Title VII and under \u00a71981, although related, and although directed to most of the same ends, are separate, distinct, and independent.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U. S. 454,461 (1975). We have pointed out that Title VII provides important administrative remedies and other benefits that \u00a7 1981 lacks. See <em>id., </em>at 457-458 (detailing the benefits of Title VII to those aggrieved by race-based employment discrimination). And we have concluded that \u201cTitle VII was designed to supplement, rather than supplant, existing laws and institutions relating to employment discrimination.\u201d <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U. S. 36, 48-49 (1974). In a word, we have previously held that the \u201coverlap\u201d reflects congressional design. See <em>ibid. </em>We have no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Fourth, CBOCS says it finds support for its position in two of our recent cases, <em>Burlington N. &amp; S. F. R. Co. </em>v. <em>White, 548 </em>U. S. 53 (2006), and <em>Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc. </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>546 U. S. 470 (2006). In <em>Burlington, </em>a Title VII case, we distinguished between discrimination that harms individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>because of \u201cwho they are, <em>i. e., </em>their status,\u201d for example, as women or as black persons, and discrimination that harms \u201cindividuals based on what they do, <em>i. e., </em>their conduct,\u201d for example, whistle-blowing that leads to retaliation. 548 U. S., at 63. CBOCS says that we should draw a similar distinction here and conclude that \u00a7 1981 only encompasses status-based discrimination. In <em>Burlington, </em>however, we used the status/conduct distinction to help explain why Congress might have wanted its explicit Title VII antiretaliation provision to sweep more broadly <em>(i. e., </em>to include conduct <em>outside </em>the workplace) than its substantive Title VII (status-based) antidiscrimination provision. <em>Burlington </em>did not suggest that Congress must separate the two in all events.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The dissent argues that the distinction made in <em>Burlington </em>is meaningful here because it purportedly \u201cunderscores the fact that status-based discrimination and conduct-based retaliation are distinct harms that call for tailored legislative treatment. \u201d <em>Post, </em>at 462. The Court\u2019s construction of a general ban on discrimination such as that contained in \u00a7 1981 to cover retaliation claims, the dissent continues, would somehow render the separate antiretaliation provisions in other statutes \u201csuperfluous.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But the Court in <em>Burlington </em>did not find that Title VII\u2019s antiretaliation provision was redundant; it found that the provision had a broader reach than the statute\u2019s substantive provision. And in any case, we have held that \u201clegislative enactments in this area have long evinced a general intent to accord parallel or overlapping remedies against discrimination.\u201d <em>Alexander, supra, </em>at 47. See <em>Great American Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Novotny, </em>442 U. S. 366, 377 (1979) (\u201c[S]ubstantive rights conferred in the 19th century [civil rights Acts] were not withdrawn, <em>sub silentio, </em>by the subsequent passage of the modern statutes\u201d). Accordingly, the Court has accepted overlap between a number of civil rights statutes. See <em>ibid, </em>(discussing interrelation of fair housing provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and \u00a7 1982; between \u00a7 1981 and Title VII). See also <em>supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>at 455 (any overlap in reach between \u00a7 1981 and Title VII, the statute at issue in <em>Burlington, </em>is by congressional design).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">CBOCS highlights the second case, <em>Domino\u2019s Pizza, </em>along with <em>Patterson, </em>and cites <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>422 U. S. 66 (1975), and <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>480 U. S. 522 (1987) <em>(per curiam), </em>to show that this Court now follows an approach to statutory interpretation that emphasizes text. And that newer approach, CBOCS claims, should lead us to revisit the holding in <em>Sullivan, </em>an older case, where the Court placed less weight upon the textual language itself. But even were we to posit for argument\u2019s sake that changes in interpretive approach take place from time to time, we could not agree that the existence of such a change would justify reexamination of well-established prior law. Principles of <em>stare decisis, </em>after all, demand respect for precedent whether judicial methods of interpretation change or stay the same. Were that not so, those principles would fail to achieve the legal stability that they seek and upon which the rule of law depends. See, <em>e. g., John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>552 U. S., at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">We conclude that considerations of <em>stare decisis </em>strongly support our adherence to <em>Sullivan </em>and the long line of related cases where we interpret \u00a7\u00a71981 and 1982 similarly. CBOCS\u2019 arguments do not convince us to the contrary. We consequently hold that 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1981 encompasses claims of retaliation. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">The Court holds that the private right of action it has implied under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1977, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1981, encompasses claims of retaliation. Because the Court\u2019s holding has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>basis in the text of \u00a7 1981 and is not justified by principles of <em>stare decisis, </em>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">It is unexceptional in our case law that \u201c \u2018[statutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.\u2019\u201d <em>Engine Mfrs. Assn. </em>v. <em>South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., </em>541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004) (quoting <em>Park \u2019N Fly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dollar Park &amp; Fly, Inc., </em>469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985)). Today, that rule is honored in the breach: The Court\u2019s analysis of the statutory text does not appear until Part III of its opinion, and then only as a potential reason to depart from the interpretation the Court has already concluded, on other grounds, must \u201ccarry the day.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 452. Unlike the Court, I think it best to begin, as we usually do, with the text of the statute. Section 1981(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">\u201cAll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Section 1981(a) thus guarantees \u201c[a]ll persons ... the same right... to make and enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d It is difficult to see where one finds a cause of action for retaliation in this language. On its face, \u00a7 1981(a) is a straightforward ban on racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts. Not surprisingly, that is how the Court has always construed it. See, <em>e. g., Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc. </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>546 U. S. 470, 476 (2006) (\u201cSection 1981 offers relief when racial discrimination blocks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the creation of a contractual relationship, as well as when racial discrimination impairs an existing contractual relationship\u201d); <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>McLean Credit Union, </em>491 U. S. 164, 171 (1989) (\u201c[Section] 1981 'prohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Runyon </em>v. <em>McCrary, </em>427 U. S. 160, 168 (1976))); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 </em>U. S. 454,459 (1975) (Section 1981 \u201con its face relates primarily to racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Respondent nonetheless contends that \u201c[t]he terms of section 1981 are significantly different, and broader, than a simple prohibition against discrimination.\u201d Brief for Respondent 15. It is true that \u00a7 1981(a), which was enacted shortly after the Civil War, does not use the modern statutory formulation prohibiting \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of race.\u201d But that is the clear import of its terms. Contrary to respondent\u2019s contention, nothing in \u00a7 1981 evinces a \u201cconcer[n] with protecting individuals 'based on what they do,\u2019 \u201d as opposed to \u201c \u2018preventing] injury to individuals based on who they are.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Burlington N. &amp; S. F. R. Co. </em>v. <em>White, </em>548 U. S. 53, 63 (2006)). Nor does \u00a7 1981 \u201caffirmatively guarante[e]\u201d freestanding \u201crights to engage in particular conduct.\u201d Brief for Respondent 16. Rather, \u00a7 1981 is an <em>equal-rights </em>provision. See <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Rachel, </em>384 U. S. 780, 791 (1966) (\u201cCongress intended to protect a limited category of rights, specifically defined in terms of racial equality\u201d). The statute assumes that \u201cwhite citizens\u201d enjoy certain rights and requires that those rights be extended equally to \u201c[a]ll persons,\u201d regardless of their race. That is to say, it prohibits discrimination based on race.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Retaliation is not discrimination based on race. When an individual is subjected to reprisal because he has complained about racial discrimination, the injury he suffers is not on account of his <em>race; </em>rather, it is the result of his <em>conduct. </em>The Court recognized this commonsense distinction just two years ago in <em>Burlington </em>when it explained that Title VII\u2019s antidiscrimination provision \u201cseeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are, <em>i. e., </em>their status,\u201d whereas its \u201cantiretaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do, <em>i. e., </em>their conduct.\u201d 548 U. S., at 63. This distinction is sound, and it reflects the fact that a claim of retaliation is both logically and factually distinct from a claim of discrimination \u2014 logically because retaliation based on conduct and discrimination based on status are mutually exclusive categories, and factually because a claim of retaliation does not depend on proof that any status-based discrimination actually occurred. Consider, for example, an employer who fires any employee who complains of race discrimination, regardless of the employee\u2019s race. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Such an employer is undoubtedly guilty of retaliation, but he has not discriminated on the basis of anyone\u2019s race. Because the employer treats all employees \u2014 black and white \u2014 the same, he does not deny any employee \u201cthe same right . . . to make and enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The Court apparently believes that the status/conduct distinction is not relevant here because this case, unlike <em>Burlington, </em>does not require us to determine whether \u00a7 1981\u2019s supposed prohibition on retaliation \u201csweep[s] more broadly\u201d than its antidiscrimination prohibition. <em>Ante, </em>at 456. That is nonsense. Although, as the Court notes, we used the status/conduct distinction in <em>Burlington </em>to explain why Title VII\u2019s antiretaliation provision must sweep more broadly than its antidiscrimination provision in order to achieve its purpose, 548 U. S., at 63-64, it does not follow that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>tinction between status and conduct is irrelevant here. To the contrary, <em>Burlington </em>underscores the fact that status-based discrimination and conduct-based retaliation are distinct harms that call for tailored legislative treatment. That is why Congress, in Title VII and a host of other statutes, has enacted separate provisions prohibiting discrimination and retaliation. See Brief for Petitioner 17-18 (citing statutes); see also <em>ante, </em>at 453-454 (same). Construing a general ban on discrimination such as that contained in \u00a7 1981 to cover retaliation would render these separate antiretaliation provisions superfluous, contrary to the normal rules of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Of course, this is not the first time I have made these points. Three Terms ago in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed., </em>544 U. S. 167 (2005), the Court held that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1681 <em>et seq., </em>which prohibits recipients of federal education funding from discriminating \u201con the basis of sex,\u201d \u00a7 1681(a), affords an implied cause of action for retaliation against those who complain of sex discrimination. In so doing, the Court disregarded the fundamental distinction between status-based discrimination and conduct-based retaliation, asserting that retaliation against those who complain of sex discrimination \u201cis discrimination \u2018on the basis of sex\u2019 because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.\u201d 544 U. S., at 174. But as I explained in my dissenting opinion in <em>Jackson, </em>\u201cthe sex-based topic of the complaint cannot overcome the fact that the retaliation is not based on anyone\u2019s sex, much less the complainer\u2019s sex.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Likewise here, the race-based topic of the complaint cannot overcome the fact that the retaliation is not based on anyone\u2019s race. To hold otherwise would be to ignore the fact that \u201cprotection from retaliation is separate from direct protection of the primary right [against discrimination] and serves as a prophylactic measure to guard the primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>right.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 189; see also <em>Burlington, swpra, </em>at 63 (explaining that Title VII\u2019s \u201cantidiscrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status,\u201d whereas its \u201cantiretaliation provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee\u2019s efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act\u2019s basic guarantees\u201d). In other words, \u201c[t]o describe retaliation as discrimination on the basis of [race] is to conflate the enforcement mechanism with the right itself, something for which the statute\u2019s text provides no warrant.\u201d <em>Jackson, supra, </em>at 189 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Notably, the Court does not repeat <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>textual analysis in this case, perhaps because no amount of repetition could make it any more plausible today than it was three years ago. Instead, the Court acknowledges that \u201cthe statute\u2019s language does not expressly refer to the claim of an individual (black or white) who suffers retaliation.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 452. The Court concludes, however, that the statute\u2019s failure expressly to provide a cause of action for retaliation \u201cis not sufficient to carry the day,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>despite our usual rule that \u201caffirmative evidence of congressional intent must be provided for an implied remedy,... for without such intent the essential predicate for implication of a private remedy simply does not exist,\u201d <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>532 U. S. 275, 293, n. 8 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted); see also <em>id., </em>at 286-287 (emphasizing that, absent evidence of Congress\u2019 intent to create a cause of action, the \u201ccause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Section 1981\u2019s silence regarding retaliation is not dispositive, the Court says, because \u201cit is too late in the day\u201d to resort to \u201ca linguistic argument\u201d that was supposedly rejected in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc., </em>396 U. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>229 (1969). <em>Ante, </em>at 453. As I explain below, the Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Sullivan </em>is entirely misplaced. But it also bears emphasis that the Court does not even purport to identify any basis in the statutory text for the \u201cwell-embedded interpretation of \u00a7 1981,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 452, it adopts for the first time today. Unlike the Court, I find the statute\u2019s text dispositive. Because \u00a71981 by its terms prohibits only discrimination based on race, and because retaliation is not discrimination based on race, \u00a7 1981 does not provide an implied cause of action for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Unable to justify its holding as a matter of statutory interpretation, the Court today retreats behind the figleaf of ersatz <em>stare decisis. </em>The Court\u2019s invocation of <em>stare decisis </em>appears to rest on three considerations: (1) <em>Sullivan\u2019s </em>purported recognition of a cause of action for retaliation under \u00a7 1982; (2) <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>(re)interpretation of <em>Sullivan; </em>and (3) the Courts of Appeals\u2019 view that \u00a7 1981 provides a cause of action for retaliation. None of these considerations, separately or together, justifies implying a cause of action that Congress did not include in the statute. And none can conceal the irony in the Court\u2019s novel use of <em>stare decisis </em>to decide a question of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">I turn first to <em>Sullivan, </em>as it bears most of the weight in the Court\u2019s analysis. As I explained in my dissent in <em>Jackson, Sullivan </em>did not \u201chol[d] that a general prohibition against discrimination permitted a claim of retaliation,\u201d but rather \u201cthat a white lessor had standing to assert the right of a black lessee to be free from racial discrimination.\u201d 544 U. S., at 194.. Thus, \u201c[t]o make out his third-party claim on behalf of the black lessee, the white lessor would necessarily be required to demonstrate that the defendant had discriminated against the black lessee on the basis of race.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, by contrast, respondent \u201cneed not show that the [race] discrimination forming the basis of his complaints actually occurred.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, as it did in <em>Jackson, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Court \u201ccreates an entirely new cause of action for a secondary rights holder, beyond the claim of the original rights holder, and well beyond <em>Sullivan.\u201d Id., </em>at 194-195.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Having reexamined <em>Sullivan, </em>I remain convinced that it was a third-party standing case. Sullivan did not argue that his expulsion from the corporation \u2014 as opposed to the corporation\u2019s refusal to approve the assignment \u2014 violated \u00a7 1982. Instead, he argued that his expulsion was \u201ccontrary to public policy\u201d because it was the \u201cdirect result of his having dealt with Freeman, as the statute requires, on a nondiscriminatory basis.\u201d Brief for Petitioners in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc., </em>O. T. 1969, No. 33, p. 32. Sullivan further contended not that his own rights under \u00a7 1982 had been violated, but that he \u201cha[d] standing to rely on the rights of the Negro, Freeman,\u201d since he was best situated to vindicate those rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 33; see also Pet. for Cert. in <em>Sullivan, </em>p. 17, n. 13 (\u201cAlthough the statute declares the rights of Negroes not to be discriminated against, Sullivan, a Caucasian, has standing to rely on the invasion of the rights of others, since he is the only effective adversary capable of vindicating them in litigation arising from his expulsion\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Similarly, the United States, appearing as <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of Sullivan, argued that because \u201cthe private action involved in refusing to honor the assignment was itself illegal,\u201d \u201crelief should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>available to all persons injured by it, or as a consequence of their efforts to resist it.\u201d Brief for United States in <em>Sullivan, </em>p. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Thus, both Sullivan and the United States argued that Sullivan had standing to seek relief for injuries he suffered as a result of the corporation\u2019s violation of Freeman\u2019s rights \u2014 not that Sullivan\u2019s own rights under \u00a7 1982 were violated. And that is the best interpretation of what the Court subsequently held. Tracking the parties\u2019 arguments, the Court first concluded that the corporation\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to approve the assignment of the membership share . . . was clearly an interference with Freeman\u2019s right to \u2018lease\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 1982. 396 U. S., at 237. Only then did it conclude \u2014 based on <em>Barrows </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>346 U. S. 249 (1953), a third-party standing case in which another white litigant was permitted to \u201crely on the invasion of the rights of others,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 255 \u2014 that Sullivan \u201cha[d] standing to maintain this action.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>396 U. S., at 237. The word \u201cretaliation\u201d does not appear in the Court\u2019s opinion. Nor is there any suggestion that Sullivan would have had \u201cstanding\u201d absent the violation of Freeman\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Of course, <em>Sullivan </em>is not a model of clarity, and Justice Harlan, writing in dissent, was correct to criticize the \u201cundiscriminating manner\u201d in which the Court dealt with Sullivan\u2019s claims. <em>Id., </em>at 251. Sullivan had sought relief both for the corporation\u2019s refusal to approve the assignment and for his expulsion. <em>Id., </em>at 253. But in stating that Sullivan had standing to maintain \u201cthis action,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 237 (majority opinion), the Court did not specify what relief Sullivan was entitled to pursue on remand. Lamenting the Court\u2019s \u201cfailure to provide any guidance as to the legal standards that should govern Sullivan\u2019s right to recovery on remand,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 252 (dissenting opinion), Justice Harlan provided an instructive summary of the ambiguities in the Court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">\u201cOne can imagine a variety of standards, each based on different legal conclusions as to the \u2018rights\u2019 and \u2018du<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ties\u2019 created by \u00a7 1982, and each having very different remedial consequences. For example, does \u00a7 1982 give Sullivan a right to relief only for injuries resulting from Little Hunting Park\u2019s interference with <em>his </em>statutory duty to Freeman under \u00a7 1982? If so, what is Sullivan\u2019s duty to Freeman under \u00a7 1982? Unless \u00a7 1982 is read to impose a duty on Sullivan to <em>protest </em>Freeman\u2019s exclusion, he would be entitled to reinstatement under this standard only if the Board had expelled him for the simple act of assigning his share to Freeman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\u201cAs an alternative, Sullivan might be thought to be entitled to relief from those injuries that flowed from the Board\u2019s violation of <em>its </em>\u2018duty\u2019 to Freeman under \u00a7 1982. Such a standard might suggest that Sullivan is entitled to damages that resulted from Little Hunting Park\u2019s initial refusal to accept the assignment to Freeman but again not to reinstatement. Or does the Court think that \u00a7 1982 gives Sullivan a right to relief from injuries that result from his \u2018legitimate\u2019 protest aimed at convincing the Board to accept Freeman?\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 254-255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">It is noteworthy that of the three possible standards Justice Harlan outlined, the first two clearly depend on a showing that Freeman\u2019s \u00a71982 rights were violated. Only the third \u2014 \u201cOr does the Court think that \u00a7 1982 gives Sullivan a right to relief from injuries that result from his \u2018legitimate\u2019 protest\u201d \u2014 resembles a traditional retaliation claim and, in context, even it is probably best read to presuppose that Sullivan was protesting an actual violation of Freeman\u2019s rights. <em>Id., </em>at 255. Which, if any, of these standards the Court had in mind is anybody\u2019s guess. It did not say.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">I thus adhere to my view that <em>Sullivan </em>is best read as a third-party standing case. That is how the parties argued the case, and that is the most natural reading of the Court\u2019s opinion. But even if <em>Sullivan </em>could fairly be read as having inferred a freestanding cause of action for retaliation \u2014 which I doubt it can, at least not without superimposing an anach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>ronistic outlook on a Court that was not as familiar with retaliation claims as we are today \u2014 the Court\u2019s one-paragraph discussion of the issue was, at best, both cursory and ambiguous. This is hardly the stuff of which <em>stare decisis </em>is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Steadfastly refusing to acknowledge any ambiguity, the Court asserts that it is \u201cnot surprising that following <em>Sullivan, </em>federal appeals courts concluded, on the basis of <em>Sullivan </em>or its reasoning, that \u00a71981 encompassed retaliation claims.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 448. But given <em>Sullivan\u2019s </em>use of the word \u201cstanding\u201d and its reliance on a third-party standing case, what is unsurprising is that each of the cases the Court cites either characterized the issue as one of standing, <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Lear-Siegler, Inc., </em>558 F. 2d 1266, 1270 (CA6 1977) (characterizing the issue as \u201cwhether or not the white plaintiff in this action has standing to sue his former employer under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1981 for discharging him in alleged retaliation for plaintiff\u2019s protesting the alleged discriminatory firing of a black co-worker\u201d), or recognized that it was taking a step beyond <em>Sullivan </em>in inferring a cause of action for retaliation, <em>Choudhury </em>v. <em>Polytechnic Inst, of N. Y., </em>735 F. 2d 38, 42 (CA2 1984) (stating that the Second Circuit \u201cha[d] never decided whether \u00a7 1981 creates a cause of action for retaliation,\u201d even though it had previously held, based on <em>Sullivan, </em>\u201cthat a white person who claimed to have suffered reprisals as a result of his efforts to vindicate the rights of non-whites had standing to sue under \u00a7 1981\u201d); <em>Goff </em>v. <em>Continental Oil Co., </em>678 F. 2d 593, 598, n. 7 (CA5 1982) (recognizing that <em>Sullivan </em>and a previous Fifth Circuit decision relying on <em>Sullivan </em>were \u201cessentially standing cases holding that white people can assert civil rights claims when they are harmed by someone\u2019s discrimination against blacks,\u201d which is distinct from holding that \u201ca particular type of conduct\u2014 retaliation for the filing of a \u00a7 1981 law suit \u2014 is actionable in the first place\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Moreover, even if <em>Sullivan </em>had squarely and unambiguously'held that \u00a7 1982 provides an implied cause of action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>retaliation, it would have been wrong to do so because \u00a7 1982, like \u00a7 1981, prohibits only discrimination based on race, and retaliation is not discrimination based on race.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The question, then, would be whether to extend <em>Sullivan\u2019s </em>erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 1982 to \u00a7 1981. The Court treats this as a foregone conclusion because \u201cour precedents have long construed \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982 similarly.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 447. But erroneous precedents need not be extended to their logical end, even when dealing with related provisions that normally would be interpreted in lockstep.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Otherwise, <em>stare decisis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>designed to be a principle of stability and repose, would become a vehicle of change whereby an error in one area metastasizes into others, thereby distorting the law. Two wrongs do not make a right, and an aesthetic preference for symmetry should not prevent us from recognizing the true meaning of an Act of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The Court\u2019s remaining reasons for invoking <em>stare decisis </em>require little discussion. First, the Court relies on the fact that <em>Jackson </em>interpreted <em>Sullivan </em>as having recognized a cause of action for retaliation under \u00a7 1982. See <em>ante, </em>at 447, 452-453. That is true but irrelevant. It was only through loose language and creative use of brackets that <em>Jackson </em>was able to assert that <em>Sullivan </em>\u201cupheld Sullivan\u2019s cause of action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1982 for '[retaliation] for the advocacy of [the black person\u2019s] cause.\u2019\u201d 544 U. S., at 176 (quoting <em>Sullivan, </em>396 U. S., at 237; brackets in original). Of course, <em>Sullivan </em>did not use the word \u201cretaliation,\u201d did not say anything about a \u201ccause of action,\u201d and did not state that Sullivan had rights under \u00a7 1982. It most certainly did not \u201cinterpret] a general prohibition on racial discrimination to cover retaliation against those who advocate the rights of groups protected by that prohibition.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>544 U. S., at 176. <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>assertion that <em>Sullivan </em>\u201cplainly held that the white owner could maintain his <em>own </em>private cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>action under \u00a7 1982,\u201d 544 U. S., at 176, n. 1, misses the point entirely. While <em>Sullivan </em>held that \u201cthe white owner\u201d had standing to maintain his own <em>suit, </em>it said nothing to suggest that he could sue to vindicate his own <em>right </em>to be free from retaliation under \u00a7 1982. Rather, as I have explained, Sullivan\u2019s \u201cstanding\u201d was derivative of the violation of Freeman\u2019s rights. In short, <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>characterization of <em>Sullivan </em>was erroneous, and I am aware of no principle of <em>stare decisis </em>that requires us to give decisive weight to a precedent\u2019s erroneous characterization of another precedent \u2014 particularly where, as here, the cases involved different statutes, neither of which was the statute at issue in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Second, the Court appears to give weight to the fact that, since Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991,105 Stat. 1071, \u201cthe lower courts have uniformly interpreted \u00a71981 as encompassing retaliation actions.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 451. This rationale fares no better than the others. The Court has never suggested that rejection of a view uniformly held by the courts of appeals violates some principle of <em>stare decisis. </em>To the contrary, we have not hesitated to take a different view if convinced the lower courts were wrong. Indeed, it has become something of a dissenter\u2019s tactic to point out that the Court has decided a question differently than every court of appeals to have considered it. See, <em>e. g., McConnell </em>v. <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n, </em>540 U. S. 93, 278, n. 11 (2003) (Thomas, J., concurring in part, concurring in result in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); <em>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, </em>532 U. S. 598, 643 (2001) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); <em>Sandoval, </em>532 U. S., at 294 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>526 U. S. 227,254 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting); <em>McNally </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 U. S. 350, 365 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting). The Court does not explain what makes this particular line of lower court authority any more sacrosanct than those we have rejected in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Of course, lower court decisions may be persuasive, and when the Court rejects the unanimous position of the courts of appeals, it is fair to point out that fact. But the point has traction only to the extent it tends to show that the Court\u2019s reasoning is flawed on the merits, as demonstrated by the number of judges who have reached the opposite conclusion. See, <em>e. g., Buckhannon, supra, </em>at 643-644 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhen this Court rejects the considered judgment prevailing in the Circuits, respect for our colleagues demands a cogent explanation\u201d). Unlike decisions of this Court, decisions of the courts of appeals, even when unanimous, do not carry <em>stare decisis </em>weight, nor do they relieve us of our obligation independently to decide the merits of the question presented. That is why, when we have affirmed a view unanimously held by the courts of appeals, we have done so (at least until today) not because we gave precedential weight to the lower courts\u2019 decisions, but because we agreed with their resolution of the question on the merits. See, <em>e. g., Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>545 U. S. 524, 531 (2005) (\u201cVirtually every Court of Appeals to consider the question has held that such a pleading ... is in substance a successive habeas petition .... We think those holdings are correct\u201d); <em>Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow </em>v. <em>Gilbertson, </em>501 U. S. 350, 362 (1991) (\u201cThus, we agree with every Court of Appeals that has been called upon to apply a federal statute of limitations to a \u00a7 10(b) claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">As in <em>Jackson, </em>\u201c[t]he question before us is only whether [\u00a71981] prohibits retaliation, not whether prohibiting it is good policy.\u201d 544 U. S., at 195 (Thomas, J., dissenting). \u201cBy crafting its own additional enforcement mechanism, the majority returns this Court to the days in which it created remedies out of whole cloth to effectuate its vision of congressional purpose.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That the Court does so under the guise of <em>stare decisis </em>does not make its decision any more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>justifiable. Because the text of \u00a7 1981 provides no basis for implying a private right of action for retaliation, and because no decision of this Court holds to the contrary, I would reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\"> The United States, appearing as <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of respondent, contends that \u00a7 1981 prohibits not only racial discrimination, but also any other kind of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d that \u201cimpair[s]\u201d the rights guaranteed by \u00a7 1981(a). Brief for United States 17. In support of this argument, the United States points to \u00a7 1981(c), which provides that \u201c[t]he rights protected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>mental discrimination and impairment under color of State law.\u201d Thus, the argument goes, retaliation is prohibited because it is discrimination (differential treatment for those who complain) and it impairs the right granted in \u00a7 1981(a) to be free from racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts (by penalizing assertion of that right).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Although I commend the United States for at least attempting to ground its position in the statutory text, its argument is unconvincing. Section 1981(c) simply codifies the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Runyon </em>v. <em>McCrary, </em>427 U. S. 160 (1976), that \u00a7 1981 applies to private, as well as governmental, discrimination. Nothing in \u00a7 1981(c) indicates that Congress otherwise intended to expand the scope of \u00a7 1981. To the contrary, \u00a7 1981(c) refers to \u201c[t]he rights protected by this section,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>the rights enumerated in \u00a7 1981(a) to make and enforce contracts on the same terms as white citizens. Moreover, the word \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in \u00a7 1981(c) does not refer to \u201call discrimination,\u201d as the United States would have it. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>16, n. 4. Rather, it refers back to the type of discrimination prohibited by \u00a7 1981(a), <em>i. e., </em>discrimination based on race. Thus, \u00a7 1981 is violated only when racial discrimination impairs the right to make and enforce contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-6\"> Of course, if an employer had a <em>different </em>retaliation policy for blacks and whites \u2014 firing black employees who complain of race discrimination but not firing similarly situated white employees \u2014 a black employee who was fired for complaining of race discrimination would have a promising \u00a71981 claim. But his claim would not sound in retaliation; rather, it would be a straightforward claim of racial discrimination. In his briefs before this Court, respondent attempts to shoehorn his claim into this category, asserting that petitioner \u201cretaliated against [him] because he was a black worker who exercised his right\u201d to lodge a grievance under petitioner\u2019s open-door policy. Brief for Respondent 27; see also <em>id., </em>at 33 (\u201c[S]eetion 1981 forbids an employer from having one dismissal policy for blacks who complain about race discrimination, and another for whites who complain about such discrimination\u201d). But respondent cites no record evidence to support his assertion that petitioner treated him differently than it would have treated a similarly situated white complainant. And while the Court of Appeals found that respondent had established a prima facie case of retaliation, 474 F. 3d 387, 406-407 (CA7 2007), it did not identify any evidence that would permit a jury to conclude that the alleged retaliation was race based. Indeed, the Court of Appeals held that respondent had \u201cwaived ... his discrimination claim by devoting only a skeletal argument [to it] in response to [petitioner\u2019s] motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 407.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\"> In contrast to his argument based on \u00a7 1982, which he consistently tied to the violation of Freeman's rights, Sullivan also argued that his <em>own </em>First Amendment rights were violated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201cSince Sullivan\u2019s expulsion was in retaliation for his having obeyed the dictate of the law the expulsion was against public policy, and he should be reinstated.

C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981,1982----Furthermore, by giving sanction to Sullivan\u2019s expulsion, the state court deprived Sullivan of <em>his rights, </em>guaranteed by the First Amendment to criticize the conduct of the association\u2019s directors.\u201d Brief for Petitioners in <em>Sullivan, </em>p. 14 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b531-5\"> The majority claims that <em>Sullivan </em>\u201cdid not embrace\u201d this \u201clinguistic argument.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 453. That is because the argument was not before the Court. The corporation did not argue that \u00a7 1982\u2019s text could not reasonably be construed to create a cause of action for retaliation; nor did Justice Harlan in dissent. No one made this argument because that was not how the issue was framed, either by Sullivan or by the Court. The majority suggests that the argument was \u201capparent at the time the Court decided <em>Sullivan.\u201d Ibid. </em>But the only evidence it cites is Justice Harlan\u2019s observation that the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Alfred H. Mayer Co., </em>392 U. S. 409 (1968), that \u00a7 1982 prohibits private as well as governmental discrimination was \u201cin no way required by [\u00a7 1982\u2019s] language.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>396 U. S., at 241 (dissenting opinion). I fail to see how that observation\u2014 or Justice Harlan\u2019s further observation that the Court in <em>Sullivan </em>had gone \u201cyet beyond <em>Jones,\u201d ibid. </em>\u2014 shows that the Court considered and rejected the entirely different argument that \u00a7 1982\u2019s text does not provide a cause of action for retaliation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\"> For example, we have refused to extend the holding of <em>J.

The Supreme Court requires us to proceed otherwise. <em>Borak </em>dealt with \u00a7 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78n(a).
