S. 159,164 (1983); see also <em>Allied-Signal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>504 U. S. 768, 777 (1992); <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes of Vt, </em>445 U. S. 425, 441-442 (1980). A State may, however, tax an apportioned share of the value generated by the intrastate and extrastate activities of a multistate enterprise if those activities form part of a \u201c\u2018unitary business.\u2019\u201d <em>Hunt-Wesson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal., </em>528 U. S. 458, 460 (2000); <em>Mobil Oil Corp., supra, </em>at 438. We have been asked in this case to decide whether the State of Illinois constitutionally taxed an apportioned share of the capital gain realized by an out-of-state corporation on the sale of one of its business divisions. The Appellate Court of Illinois upheld the tax and affirmed a judgment in the State\u2019s favor. Because we conclude that the state courts misapprehended the principles that we have developed for determining whether a multistate business is unitary, we vacate the decision of the Appellate Court of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Mead Corporation (Mead), an Ohio corporation, is the predecessor in interest and a wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner MeadWestvaco Corporation. From its founding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>in 1846, Mead has been in the business of producing and selling paper, packaging, and school and office supplies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1968, Mead paid $6 million to acquire a company called Data Corporation, which owned an inkjet printing technology and a full-text information retrieval system, the latter of which had originally been developed for the U. S. Air Force. Mead was interested in the inkjet printing technology because it would have complemented Mead\u2019s paper business, but the information retrieval system proved to be the more valuable asset. Over the course of many years, Mead developed that asset into the electronic research service now known as Lexis/Nexis (Lexis). In 1994, it sold Lexis to a third party for approximately $1.5 billion, realizing just over $1 billion in capital gain, which Mead used to repurchase stock, retire debt, and pay taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Mead did not report any of this gain as business income on its Illinois tax returns for 1994. It took the position that the gain qualified as nonbusiness income that should be allocated to Mead\u2019s domiciliary State, Ohio, under Illinois\u2019 Income Tax Act (ITA). See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 35, \u00a7 5/303(a) (West 1994). The State audited Mead\u2019s returns and issued a notice of deficiency. According to the State, the ITA required Mead to treat the capital gain as business income subject to apportionment by Illinois.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State assessed Mead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>with approximately $4 million in additional tax and penalties. Mead paid that amount under protest and then filed this lawsuit in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The case was tried to the bench. Although the court admitted expert testimony, reports, and other exhibits into evidence, see App. D to Pet. for Cert. 29a-34a, the parties\u2019 stipulations supplied most of the evidence of record regarding Mead\u2019s relationship with Lexis, see App. 9-20. We summarize those stipulations here.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Lexis was launched in 1973. For the first few years it was in business, it lost money, and Mead had to keep it afloat with additional capital contributions. By the late 1970\u2019s, as more attorneys began to use Lexis, the service finally turned a profit. That profit quickly became substantial. Between 1988 and 1993, Lexis made more than $800 million of the $3.8 billion in Illinois income that Mead reported. Lexis also accounted for $680 million of the $4.5 billion in business expense deductions that Mead claimed from Illinois during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Lexis was subject to Mead\u2019s oversight, but Mead did not manage its day-to-day affairs. Mead was headquartered in Ohio, while a separate management team ran Lexis out of its headquarters in Illinois. The two businesses maintained separate manufacturing, sales, and distribution facilities, as well as separate accounting, legal, human resources, credit and collections, purchasing, and marketing departments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Mead\u2019s involvement was generally limited to approving Lexis\u2019 annual business plan and any significant corporate transactions (such as capital expenditures, financings, mergers and acquisitions, or joint ventures) that Lexis wished to undertake. In at least one case, Mead procured new equipment for Lexis by purchasing the equipment for its own account and then leasing it to Lexis. Mead also managed Lexis\u2019 free cash, which was swept nightly from Lexis\u2019 bank accounts into an account maintained by Mead. The cash was reinvested in Lexis\u2019 business, but Mead decided how to invest it.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Neither business was required to purchase goods or services from the other. Lexis, for example, was not required to purchase its paper supply from Mead, and indeed Lexis purchased most of its paper from other suppliers. Neither received any discount on goods or services purchased from the other, and neither was a significant customer of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Lexis was incorporated as one of Mead\u2019s wholly owned subsidiaries until 1980, when it was merged into Mead and became one of Mead\u2019s divisions. Mead engineered the merger so that it could offset its income with Lexis\u2019 net operating loss carryforwards. Lexis was separately reincorporated in 1985 before being merged back into Mead in 1993. Once again, tax considerations motivated each transaction. Mead also treated Lexis as a unitary business in its consolidated Illinois returns for the years 1988 through 1994, though it did so at the State\u2019s insistence and then only to avoid litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Lexis was listed as one of Mead\u2019s \u201cbusiness segment[s]\u201d in at least some of its annual reports and regulatory filings. Mead described itself in those reports and filings as \u201cengaged in the electronic publishing business\u201d and touted itself as the \u201cdeveloper of the world\u2019s leading electronic information retrieval services for law, patents, accounting, finance, news and business information.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 93, 59; App. D to Pet. for Cert. 38a.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Based on the stipulated facts and the other exhibits and expert testimony received into evidence, the Circuit Court of Cook County concluded that Lexis and Mead did not constitute a unitary business. The trial court reasoned that Lexis and Mead could not be unitary because they were not functionally integrated or centrally managed and enjoyed no economies of scale. <em>Id., </em>at 35a-36a, 39a. The court nevertheless concluded that the State could tax an apportioned share of Mead\u2019s capital gain because Lexis served an \u201coperational purpose\u201d in Mead\u2019s business:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">\u201cLexis/Nexis was considered in the strategic planning of Mead, particularly in the allocation of resources. The operational purpose allowed Mead to limit the growth of Lexis/Nexis if only to limit its ability to expand or to contract through its control of its capital investment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 38a-39a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed. <em>Mead Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>371 Ill. App. 3d 108, 861 N. E. 2d 1131 (2007). The court cited several factors as evidence that Lexis served an operational function in Mead\u2019s business: (1) Lexis was wholly owned by Mead; (2) Mead had exercised its control over Lexis in various ways, such as manipulating its corporate form, approving significant capital expenditures, and retaining tax benefits and control over Lexis\u2019 free cash; and (3) Mead had described itself in its annual reports and regulatory filings as engaged in electronic publishing and as the developer of the world\u2019s leading information retrieval service. See <em>id., </em>at 111-112, 861 N. E. 2d, at 1135-1136. Because the court found that Lexis served an operational function in Mead\u2019s business, it did not address the question whether Mead and Lexis formed a unitary business. See <em>id., </em>at 117-118, 861 N. E. 2d, at 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The Supreme Court of Illinois denied review in January 2007. <em>Mead Corp. </em>v. <em>Illinois Dept. of Revenue, </em>222 Ill. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>609, 862 N. E. 2d 235 (Table). We granted certiorari. 551 U. S. 1189 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Petitioner contends that the trial court properly found that Lexis and Mead were not unitary and that the Appellate Court of Illinois erred in concluding that Lexis served an operational function in Mead\u2019s business. According to petitioner, the exception for apportionment of income from non-unitary businesses serving an operational function is a narrow one that does not reach a purely passive investment such as Lexis. We perceive a more fundamental error in the state courts\u2019 reasoning. In our view, the state courts erred in considering whether Lexis served an \u201coperational purpose\u201d in Mead\u2019s business after determining that Lexis and Mead were not unitary.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause impose distinct but parallel limitations on a State\u2019s power to tax out-of-state activities. See <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>504 U. S. 298, 305-306 (1992); <em>Mobil Oil Corp., </em>445 U. S., at 451, n. 4 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. </em>v. <em>Missouri Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>390 U. S. 317, 325, n. 5 (1968). The Due Process Clause demands that there exist \u201c \u2018some definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax,\u2019\u201d as well as a rational relationship between the tax and the \u201c \u2018 \u201cvalues connected with the taxing State.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Quill Corp., supra, </em>at 306 (quoting <em>Miller Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>347 U. S. 340,344-345 (1954), and <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Bair, </em>437 U. S. 267, 273 (1978)). The Commerce Clause forbids the States to levy taxes that discriminate against interstate commerce or that burden it by subjecting activities to multiple or unfairly apportioned taxation. See <em>Container Corp., </em>463 U. S., at 170-171; <em>Armco Inc. </em>v. <em>Hardesty, </em>467 U. S. 638, 644 (1984). The \u201cbroad inquiry\u201d subsumed in both constitutional require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ments is \u201c \u2018whether the taxing power exerted by the state bears fiscal relation to protection, opportunities and benefits given by the state\u2019 \u201d \u2014 that is, \u201c \u2018whether the state has given anything for which it can ask return.\u2019\u201d <em>ASARCO Inc. </em>v. <em>Idaho Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>458 U. S. 307, 315 (1982) (quoting <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>J. C. Penney Co., </em>311 U. S. 435, 444 (1940)).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Where, as here, there is no dispute that the taxpayer has done some business in the taxing State, the inquiry shifts from whether the State may tax to what it may tax. Cf. <em>Allied-Signal, </em>504 U. S., at 778 (distinguishing <em>Quill Corp., supra). </em>To answer that question, we have developed the unitary business principle. Under that principle, a State need not \u201cisolate the intrastate income-producing activities from the rest of the business\u201d but \u201cmay tax an apportioned sum of the corporation\u2019s multistate business if the business is unitary.\u201d <em>Allied-Signal, supra, </em>at 772; accord, <em>HuntWesson, </em>528 U. S., at 460; <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue of Wis., </em>447 U. S. 207, 224 (1980); <em>Mobil Oil Corp., supra, </em>at 442; cf. 1 J. Hellerstein &amp; W. Hellerstein, State Taxation \u00b6 8.07[1], p. 8-61 (3d ed. 2001-2005) (hereinafter Hellerstein &amp; Hellerstein). The court must determine whether \u201cintrastate and extrastate activities formed part of a single unitary business,\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp., supra, </em>at 438-439, or whether the out-of-state values that the State seeks to tax \u201c\u2018derive[d] from \u201cunrelated business activity\u201d which constitutes a \u201cdiscrete business enterprise,\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Allied-Signal, supra, </em>at 773 (quoting <em>Exxon Corp., supra, </em>at 224, in turn quoting <em>Mobil Oil Corp., supra, </em>at 439, 442; alteration in original). We traced the history of this venerable principle in <em>Allied-Signal, supra, </em>at 778-783, and, because it figures prominently in this case, we retrace it briefly here.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">With the coming of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, the United States witnessed the emergence of its first truly multistate business enterprises. These railroad, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>telegraph, and express companies presented state taxing authorities with a novel problem: A State often cannot tax its fair share of the value of a multistate business by simply taxing the capital within its borders. The whole of the enterprise is generally more valuable than the sum of its parts; were it not, its owners would simply liquidate it and sell it off in pieces. As we observed in 1876, \u201c[t]he track of the road is but one track from one end of it to the other, and, except in its use as one track, is of little value.\u201d <em>State Railroad Tax Cases, </em>92 U. S. 575, 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The unitary business principle addressed this problem by shifting the constitutional inquiry from the niceties of geographic accounting to the determination of the taxpayer\u2019s business unit. If the value the State wished to tax derived from a \u201cunitary business\u201d operated within and without the State, the State could tax an apportioned share of the value of that business instead of isolating the value attributable to the operation of the business within the State. <em>E. g., Exxon Corp., supra, </em>at 223 (citing <em>Moorman Mfg. Co., supra, </em>at 273). Conversely, if the value the State wished to tax derived from a \u201cdiscrete business enterprise,\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp., supra, </em>at 439, then the State could not tax even an apportioned share of that value. <em>E. g., Container Corp., supra, </em>at 165-166.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">We recognized as early as 1876 that the Due Process Clause did not require the States to assess trackage \u201cin each county where it lies according to its value there.\u201d <em>State Railroad Tax Cases, </em>92 U. S., at 608. We went so far as to opine that \u201c[i]t may well be doubted whether any better mode of determining the value of that portion of the track within any one county has been devised than to ascertain the value of the whole road, and apportion the value within the county by its relative length to the whole.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We generalized the rule of the <em>State Railroad Tax Cases </em>in <em>Adams Express Co. </em>v. <em>Ohio State Auditor, </em>165 U. S. 194 (1897). There we held that apportionment could permissibly be ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>plied to a multistate business lacking the \u201cphysical unity\u201d of wires or rails but exhibiting the \u201csame unity in the use of the entire property for the specific purpose,\u201d with \u201cthe same elements of value arising from such use.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 221. We extended the reach of the unitary business principle further still in later cases, when we relied on it to justify the taxation by apportionment of net income, dividends, capital gain, and other intangibles. See <em>Underwood Typewriter Co. </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>254 U. S. 113, 117, 120-121 (1920) (net income tax); <em>Bass, Ratcliff &amp; Gretton, Ltd. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>266 U. S. 271, 277, 280, 282-283 (1924) (franchise tax); <em>J. C. Penney Co., supra, </em>at 443-445 (tax on the \u201cprivilege of declaring dividends\u201d); cf. <em>Allied-Signal, supra, </em>at 780 (\u201c[F]or constitutional purposes capital gains should be treated as no different from dividends\u201d); see also 1 Hellerstein <em>&amp; </em>Hellerstein \u00b6 8.07[1] (summarizing this history).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">As the unitary business principle has evolved in step with American enterprise, courts have sometimes found it difficult to identify exactly when a business is unitary. We confronted this problem most recently in <em>Allied-Signal. </em>The taxpayer there, a multistate enterprise, had realized capital gain on the disposition of its minority investment in another business. The parties\u2019 stipulation left little doubt that the taxpayer and its investee were not unitary. See 504 U. S., at 774 (observing that \u201cthe question whether the business can be called \u2018unitary\u2019 ... is all but controlled by the terms of a stipulation\u201d). The record revealed, however, that the taxpayer had used the proceeds from the liquidated investment in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to purchase a new asset that would have been used in its unitary business. See <em>id., </em>at 776-777. From that wrinkle in the record, the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that the taxpayer\u2019s minority interest had represented nothing more than a temporary investment of working capital awaiting deployment in the taxpayer\u2019s unitary business. See <em>Bendix Corp. </em>v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>125 N. J. 20, 37, 592 A. 2d 536, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>545 (1991). The State went even further. It argued that, because there could be \u201cno logical distinction between short-term investment of working capital, which all concede is apportionable,.. . and all other investments,\u201d the unitary business principle was outdated and should be jettisoned. 504 U. S., at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">We rejected both contentions. We concluded that \u201cthe unitary business principle is not so inflexible that as new methods of finance and new forms of business evolve it cannot be modified or supplemented where appropriate.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 786; see also <em>id., </em>at 785 (\u201cIf lower courts have reached divergent results in applying the unitary business principle to different factual circumstances, that is because, as we have said, any number of variations on the unitary business theme 'are logically consistent with the underlying principles motivating the approach\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Container Corp., </em>463 U. S., at 167)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We explained that situations could occur in which apportionment might be constitutional even though \u201cthe payee and the payor [were] not... engaged in the same unitary business.\u201d 504 U. S., at 787. It was in that context that we observed that an asset could form part of a taxpayer\u2019s unitary business if it served an \u201coperational rather than an investment function\u201d in that business. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cHence, for example, a State may include within the apportionable income of a nondomiciliary corporation the interest earned on short-term deposits in a bank located in another State if that income forms part of the working capital of the corporation\u2019s unitary business, notwithstanding the absence of a unitary relationship between the corporation and the bank.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>Id., </em>at 787-788. We observed that we had made the same point in <em>Container Corp., </em>where we noted that \u201ccapital transactions can serve either an investment function or an operational function.\u201d 46.3 U. S., at 180, n. 19; cf. <em>Corn Products Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>350 U. S. 46, 50 (1955) (concluding that corn futures contracts in the hands of a corn refiner seeking to hedge itself against increases in corn prices are operational rather than capital assets), cited in <em>Container Corp., supra, </em>at 180, n. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">As the foregoing history confirms, our references to \u201coperational function\u201d in <em>Container Corp. </em>and <em>Allied-Signal </em>were not intended to modify the unitary business principle by adding a new ground for apportionment. The concept of operational function simply recognizes that an asset can be a part of a taxpayer\u2019s unitary business even if what we may term a \u201cunitary relationship\u201d does not exist between the \u201cpayor and payee.\u201d See <em>Allied-Signal, supra, </em>at 791-792 (O\u2019Con-nor, J., dissenting); Hellerstein, State Taxation of Corporate Income From Intangibles: <em>Allied-Signal </em>and Beyond, 48 Tax L. Rev. 739, 790 (1993) (hereinafter Hellerstein). In the example given in <em>Allied-Signal, </em>the taxpayer was not unitary with its banker, but the taxpayer\u2019s deposits (which represented working capital and thus operational assets) were clearly unitary with the taxpayer\u2019s business. In <em>Corn Products, </em>the taxpayer was not unitary with the counterparty to its hedge, but the taxpayer\u2019s futures contracts (which served to hedge against the risk of an increase in the price of a key cost input) were likewise clearly unitary with the taxpayer\u2019s business. In each case, the \u201cpayor\u201d was not a unitary part of the taxpayer\u2019s business, but the relevant asset was. The conclusion that the asset served an operational function was merely instrumental to the constitutionally relevant conclusion that the asset was a unitary part of the business being conducted in the taxing State rather than a discrete asset to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>which the State had no claim. Our decisions in <em>Container Corp. </em>and <em>AUied-Signal </em>did not announce a new ground for the constitutional apportionment of extrastate values in the absence of a unitary business. Because the Appellate Court of Illinois interpreted those decisions to the contrary, it erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Where, as here, the asset in question is another business, we have described the \u201challmarks\u201d of a unitary relationship as functional integration, centralized management, and economies of scale. See <em>Mobil Oil Corp., </em>445 U. S., at 438 (citing <em>Butler Brothers </em>v. <em>McColgan, </em>315 U. S. 501, 506-508 (1942)); see also <em>Allied-Signal, supra, </em>at 783 (same); <em>Container Corp., supra, </em>at 179 (same); <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation and Revenue Dept. of N. M., </em>458 U. S. 354, 364 (1982) (same). The trial court found each of these hallmarks lacking and concluded that Lexis was not a unitary part of Mead\u2019s business. The appellate court, however, made no such determination. Relying on its operational function test, it reserved judgment on whether Mead and Lexis formed a unitary business. The appellate court may take up that question on remand, and we express no opinion on it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The State and its <em>amici </em>argue that vacatur is not required because the judgment of the Appellate Court of Illinois may be affirmed on an alternative ground. They contend that the record amply demonstrates that Lexis did substantial business in Illinois and that Lexis\u2019 own contacts with the State suffice to justify the apportionment of Mead\u2019s capital gain. See Brief for Respondents 18-25, 46-49; Brief for Multistate Tax Commission as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>19-29. The State and its <em>amici </em>invite us to recognize a new ground for the constitutional apportionment of intangibles based on the taxing State\u2019s contacts with the capital asset rather than the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>We decline this invitation because the question that the State and its <em>amici </em>call upon us to answer was neither raised nor passed upon in the state courts. It also was not addressed in the State\u2019s brief in opposition to the petition. We typically will not address a question under these circumstances even if the answer would afford an alternative ground for affirmance. See <em>Glover </em>v. <em>United States, </em>531 U. S. 198, 205 (2001) (citing <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Freeland &amp; Kronz, </em>503 U. S. 638, 646 (1992)); <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>533 U. S. 525,578 (2001) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The case for restraint is particularly compelling here, since the question may impact the law of other jurisdictions. The States of Ohio and New York, for example, have both adopted the rationale for apportionment that respondents urge us to recognize today. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a75733.051(E)-(F) (West 2007); N. Y. Tax Law Ann. \u00a7210, subd. 3, par. (b) (West Supp. 2008); see also <em>Allied-Signal Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Taxation &amp; Finance, </em>229 App. Div. 2d 759, 762, 645 N. Y. S. 2d 895, 898 (3d Dept. 1996) (finding that a \u201csufficient nexus existed between New York and the dividend and capital gain income\u201d of the nondomiciliary parent because \u201cthe corporations generating the income taxed . . . each have their own connection with the taxing jurisdiction\u201d); 1 Hellerstein &amp; Hellerstein \u00b6 9.11[2][a]. Neither Ohio nor New York has appeared as an <em>amicus </em>in this case, and neither was on notice that the constitutionality of its tax scheme was at issue, the question having been raised for the first time in the State\u2019s brief on the merits. So postured, the question is best left for another day.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court of Illinois is vacated, and this case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-5\"> See Prospectus of MeadWestvaco Corporation S-3 (Mar. 19,2003), online at http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1159297/000119312503085265/ d424b5.htm (as visited Apr. 1, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); App. 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b82-6\"> When the sale of Lexis occurred in 1994, the ITA defined \u201cbusiness income\u201d as \u201cincome arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business,\u201d as well as \u201cincome from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u201d 111. Comp. Stat., ch. 35, \u00a7 5/1501(a)(l) (West 1994). This language mirrors the definition of \u201cbusiness income\u201d in the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDITPA). See UDITPA \u00a7 1(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>(2002); see also \u00a79 (subjecting \u201c[a]ll business income\u201d to apportionment). In 2004, the Illinois General Assembly amended the definition of \u201cbusiness income\u201d to \u201call income that may be treated as apportionable business income under the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Pub. Act 93-840, Art. 25, \u00a7 25-5 (codified at Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 35, \u00a7 5/1501(a)(l) (West 2004)); cf. <em>Allied-Signal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>504 U. S. 768,786 (1992) (declining to adopt UDITPA\u2019s \u201cbusiness income\u201d test as the constitutional standard for apportionment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b90-5\"> The dissent agreed that the unitary business principle remained sound, 504 U. S., at 790 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.), but found merit in New Jersey\u2019s premise (and the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion) that no logical distinction could be drawn between short- or long-term investments for purposes of unitary analysis, <em>id., </em>at 793 (\u201cAny distinction between short-term and long-term investments cannot be of constitutional dimension\u201d). We need not revisit that question here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b93-6\"> Resolving this question now probably would not spare the State a remand. The State calculated petitioner\u2019s tax liability by applying the State\u2019s tax rate to Mead\u2019s apportioned business income, which in turn was calculated by applying Mead\u2019s apportionment percentage to its apportion-able business income. See App. 28; Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 35, \u00a7 57304(a) (West <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>1994). But if a constitutionally sufficient link between the State and the value it wished to tax is founded on the State\u2019s contacts with Lexis rather than Mead, then presumably the apportioned tax base should be determined by applying the State\u2019s four-factor apportionment formula not to Mead but to Lexis. Naturally, applying the formula to Lexis rather than Mead would yield a different apportionment percentage. See Brief for Multistate Tax Commission as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>18-19, and n. 9; see also Hellerstein 802-803.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">The Multistate Tax Commission seems to argue that the difference would not affect the result because application of the formula to Lexis would have yielded a higher apportionment percentage. See Brief for Multistate Tax Commission 18-19. <em>Amicus </em>argues, in other words, that petitioner has no cause to complain because it caught a break in the incorrect application of a lower apportionment percentage. <em>Amicus\u2019 </em>argument assumes what we are in no position to decide: that Lexis\u2019 own apportioned tax base was properly calculated. Had petitioner been on notice that Lexis, rather than Mead, would supply the relevant apportionment percentage, it might have persuaded the state courts that Lexis\u2019 apportionment percentage should have been even lower than Mead\u2019s. The State\u2019s untimely resort to an alternative ground for affirmance may have denied petitioner a fair opportunity to make that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b94-6\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"A75\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Although I join the Court\u2019s opinion, I write separately to express my serious doubt that the Constitution permits us to adjudicate cases in this area. Despite the Court\u2019s repeated holdings that \u201c[t]he Due Process and Commerce Clauses forbid the States to tax \u2018extraterritorial values,\u2019\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 19 (quoting <em>Container Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U. S. 159, 164 (1983)), I am not fully convinced of that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">To the extent that our decisions addressing state taxation of multistate enterprises rely on the negative Commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Clause, I would overrule them. As I have previously explained, this Court\u2019s negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence \u201chas no basis in the Constitution and has proved unworkable in practice.\u201d <em>United Haulers Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, </em>550 U. S. 330, 349 (2007) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The Court\u2019s cases in this area have not, however, rested solely on the Commerce Clause. The Court has long recognized that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment may also limit States\u2019 authority to tax multistate businesses. See <em>Adams Express Co. </em>v. <em>Ohio State Auditor, </em>165 U. S. 194, 226 (1897) (concluding that because \u201c[t]he property taxed has its actual situs in the State and is, therefore, subject to the jurisdiction, and ... regulation by the state legislature,\u201d the tax at issue did not \u201camoun[t] to a taking of property without due process of law\u201d). I agree that the Due Process Clause requires a jurisdictional nexus or, as this Court has stated, \u201csome definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax.\u201d <em>Miller Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>347 U. S. 340, 344-345 (1954); see <em>ante, </em>at 24. But apart from that requirement, I am concerned that further constraints \u2014 particularly those limiting the <em>degree </em>to which a State may tax a multistate enterprise \u2014 require us to read into the Due Process Clause yet another unenumerated, substantive right. Cf. <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>530 U. S. 57, 80 (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (leaving open the question whether \u201cour substantive due process cases were wrongly decided and... the original understanding of the Due Process Clause precludes judicial enforcement of unenumerated rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Today the Court applies the additional requirement that there exist \u201ca rational relationship between the tax and the values connected with the taxing State.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 24 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Bair, </em>437 U. S. 267, 273 (1978) (requiring that \u201cthe income attributed to the State for tax purposes ... be rationally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>related to Values connected with the taxing State\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. </em>v. <em>Missouri Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>390 U. S. 317, 325 (1968))). In my view, however, it is difficult to characterize this requirement as providing an exclusively procedural safeguard against the deprivation of property. Scrutinizing the amount of multistate income a State may apportion for tax purposes comes perilously close to evaluating the excessiveness of the State\u2019s taxing scheme \u2014 a question the Fourteenth Amendment does not grant us the authority to adjudicate. See, <em>e. g., Stewart Dry Goods Co. </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>294 U. S. 550, 562 (1935) (\u201cTo condemn a levy on the sole ground that it is excessive would be to usurp a power vested not in the courts but in the legislature, and to exercise the usurped power arbitrarily by substituting our conceptions of public policy for those of the legislative body\u201d). Indeed, divining from the Fourteenth Amendment a right against disproportionate taxation bears a striking resemblance to our long-rejected Lochner-era precedents. See, <em>e. g., Lochner </em>v. <em>New York, </em>198 U. S. 45, 56-58 (1905) (invalidating a state statute as an \u201cunreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right of the individual... to enter into those contracts ... which may seem to him appropriate or necessary\u201d). Moreover, the Court\u2019s involvement in this area is wholly unnecessary given Congress\u2019 undisputed authority to resolve income apportionment issues by virtue of its power to regulate commerce \u201camong the several States.\u201d See U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Although I believe that the Court should reconsider its constitutional authority to adjudicate these kinds of cases, neither party has asked us to do so here, and the Court\u2019s decision today faithfully applies our precedents. I therefore concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
