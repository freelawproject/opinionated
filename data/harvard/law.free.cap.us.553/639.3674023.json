S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968, provides a private right of action for treble damages to \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation\u201d of the Act\u2019s criminal prohibitions. \u00a7 1964(c). The question presented in this case is whether a plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>cated on mail fraud must plead and prove that it relied on the defendant\u2019s alleged misrepresentations. Because we agree with the Court of Appeals that a showing of first-party reliance is not required, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Each year the Cook County, Illinois, Treasurer\u2019s Office holds a public auction at which it sells tax liens it has acquired on the property of delinquent taxpayers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prospective buyers bid on the liens, but not in cash amounts. Instead, the bids are stated as percentage penalties the property owner must pay the winning bidder in order to clear the lien. The bidder willing to accept the lowest penalty wins the auction and obtains the right to purchase the lien in exchange for paying the outstanding taxes on the property. The property owner may then redeem the property by paying the lienholder the delinquent taxes, plus the penalty established at the auction and an additional 12% penalty on any taxes subsequently paid by the lienholder. If the property owner does not redeem the property within the statutory redemption period, the lienholder may obtain a tax deed for the property, thereby in effect purchasing the property for the value of the delinquent taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Because property acquired in this manner can often be sold at a significant profit over the amount paid for the lien, the auctions are marked by stiff competition. As a result, most parcels attract multiple bidders willing to accept the lowest penalty permissible \u2014 0%, that is to say, no penalty at all. (Perhaps to prevent the perverse incentive taxpayers would have if they could redeem their property from a winning bidder for less than the amount of their unpaid taxes, the county does not accept negative bids.) The lower limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>of 0% creates a problem: Who wins when the bidding results in a tie? The county\u2019s solution is to allocate parcels \u201con a rotational basis\u201d in order to ensure that liens are apportioned fairly among 0% bidders. App. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">But this creates a perverse incentive of its own: Bidders who, in addition to bidding themselves, send agents to bid on their behalf will obtain a disproportionate share of liens. To prevent this kind of manipulation, the county adopted the \u201cSingle, Simultaneous Bidder Rule,\u201d which requires each \u201ctax buying entity\u201d to submit bids in its own name and prohibits it from using \u201capparent agents, employees, or related entities\u201d to submit simultaneous bids for the same parcel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 67. Upon registering for an auction, each bidder must submit a sworn affidavit affirming that it complies with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Petitioners and respondents are regular participants in Cook County\u2019s tax sales. In July 2005, respondents filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, contending that petitioners had fraudulently obtained a disproportionate share of liens by violating the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule at the auctions held from 2002 to 2005. According to respondents, peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>tioner Sabre Group, LLC, and its principal Barrett Rochman arranged for related firms to bid on Sabre Group\u2019s behalf and directed them to file false attestations that they complied with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule. Having thus fraudulently obtained the opportunity to participate in the auction, the related firms collusively bid on the same properties at a 0% rate. As a result, when the county allocated liens on a rotating basis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it treated the related firms as independent entities, allowing them collectively to acquire a greater number of liens than would have been granted to a single bidder acting alone. The related firms then purchased the liens and transferred the certificates of purchase to Sabre Group. In this way, respondents allege, petitioners deprived them and other bidders of their fair share of liens and the attendant financial benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Respondents\u2019 complaint contains five counts. Counts I-IV allege that petitioners violated and conspired to violate RICO by conducting their affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity involving numerous acts of mail fraud. In support of their allegations of mail fraud, respondents assert that petitioners \u201cmailed or caused to be mailed hundreds of mailings in furtherance of the scheme,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 49, when they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>sent property owners various notices required by Illinois law. Count V alleges a state-law claim of tortious interference with prospective business advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">On petitioners\u2019 motion, the District Court dismissed respondents\u2019 RICO claims for lack of standing. It observed that \u201c[o]nly [respondents] and other competing buyers, as opposed to the Treasurer or the property owners, would suffer a financial loss from a scheme to violate the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a. But it concluded that respondents \u201care not in the class of individuals protected by the mail fraud statute, and therefore are not within the \u2018zone of interests\u2019 that the RICO statute protects,\u201d because they \u201cwere not recipients of the alleged misrepresentations and, at best were indirect victims of the alleged fraud.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 18a. The District Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over respondents\u2019 tortious-interference claim and dismissed it without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. It first concluded that \u201c[standing is not a problem in this suit\u201d because respondents suffered a \u201creal injury\u201d when they lost the valuable chance to acquire more liens, and because \u201cthat injury can be redressed by damages.\u201d 477 F. 3d 928, 930 (2007). The Court of Appeals next concluded that respondents had sufficiently alleged proximate cause under <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Securities Investor Protection Corporation, </em>503 U. S. 258 (1992), and <em>Anza </em>v. <em>Ideal Steel Supply Corp., </em>547 U. S. 451 (2006), because they (along with other losing bidders) were \u201cimmediately injured\u201d by petitioners\u2019 scheme. 477 F. 3d, at 930-932. Finally, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners\u2019 argument that respondents are not entitled to relief under RICO because they did not receive, and therefore did not rely on, any false statements: \u201cA scheme that injures D by making false statements through the mail to E is mail fraud, and actionable by D through RICO if the injury is not derivative of someone else\u2019s.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>With respect to this last holding, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that courts have taken conflicting views. By its count, \u201c[t]hree other circuits that have considered this question agree . . . that the direct <em>victim </em>may recover through RICO whether or not it is the direct <em>recipient </em>of the false statements,\u201d <em>ibid, </em>(citing <em>Mid Atlantic Telecom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Long Distance Servs., Inc., </em>18 F. 3d 260,263-264 (CA4 1994); <em>Systems Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Loiselle, </em>303 F. 3d 100,103-104 (CA1 2002); <em>Ideal Steel Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Anza, </em>373 F. 3d 251, 263 (CA2 2004)), whereas two Circuits hold that the plaintiff must show that it in fact relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations, 477 F. 3d, at 932 (citing <em>VanDenBroeck </em>v. <em>CommonPoint Mortgage Co., </em>210 F. 3d 696,701 (CA6 2000); <em>Sikes </em>v. <em>Teleline, Inc., </em>281 F. 3d 1350, 1360-1361 (CA11 2002)). Compare also <em>Sandwich Chef of Texas, Inc. </em>v. <em>Reliance Nat. Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>319 F. 3d 205, 223 (CA5 2003) (recognizing \u201ca narrow exception to the requirement that the plaintiff prove direct reliance on the defendant\u2019s fraudulent predicate act... when the plaintiff can demonstrate injury as a direct and contemporaneous result of [a] fraud committed against a third party\u201d), with <em>Appletree Square I, L. P. </em>v. <em>W. R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>29 F. 3d 1283,1286-1287 (CA8 1994) (requiring the plaintiff to show that it detrimentally relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. 1087 (2008), to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals on \u201cthe substantial question,\u201d <em>Anza, supra, </em>at 461, whether first-party reliance is an element of a civil RICO claim predicated on mail fraud.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">We begin by setting forth the applicable statutory provisions. RICO\u2019s private right of action is contained in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1964(c), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d Section 1962 contains RICO\u2019s criminal prohibitions. Pertinent here is \u00a7 1962(c), which makes it \u201cunlawful for any person employed by or associated with\u201d an enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce \u201cto conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d The term \u201cracketeering activity\u201d is defined to include a host of so-called predicate acts, including \u201cany act which is indictable under . . . section 1341 (relating to mail fraud).\u201d \u00a7 1961(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The upshot is that RICO provides a private right of action for treble damages to any person injured in his business or property by reason of the conduct of a qualifying enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of acts indictable as mail fraud. Mail fraud, in turn, occurs whenever a person, \u201chaving devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,\u201d uses the mail \u201cfor the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do.\u201d \u00a71341. The gravamen of the offense is the scheme to defraud, and any \u201cmailing that is incident to an essential part of the scheme satisfies the mailing element,\u201d <em>Schmuck </em>v. <em>United States, </em>489 U. S. 705, 712 (1989) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), even if the mailing itself \u201ccontain[s] no false information,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Once the relationship among these statutory provisions is understood, respondents\u2019 theory of the case is straightforward. They allege that petitioners devised a scheme to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>fraud when they agreed to submit false attestations of compliance with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule to the county. In furtherance of this scheme, petitioners used the mail on numerous occasions to send the requisite notices to property owners. Each of these mailings was an \u201cact which is indictable\u201d as mail fraud, and together they constituted a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d By conducting the affairs of their enterprise through this pattern of racketeering activity, petitioners violated \u00a7 1962(c). As a result, respondents lost the opportunity to acquire valuable liens. Accordingly, respondents were injured in their business or property by reason of petitioners\u2019 violation of \u00a7 1962(c), and RICO\u2019s plain terms give them a private right of action for treble damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Petitioners argue, however, that because the alleged pattern of racketeering activity consisted of acts of mail fraud, respondents must show that they relied on petitioners\u2019 fraudulent misrepresentations. This they cannot do, because the alleged misrepresentations \u2014 petitioners\u2019 attestations of compliance with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule \u2014 were made to the county, not respondents. The <em>county </em>may well have relied on petitioners\u2019 misrepresentations when it permitted them to participate in the auction, but <em>respondents, </em>never having received the misrepresentations, could not have done so. Indeed, respondents do not even allege that they relied on petitioners\u2019 false attestations. Thus, petitioners submit, they fail to state a claim under RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">If petitioners\u2019 proposed requirement of first-party reliance seems to come out of nowhere, there is a reason: Nothing on the face of the relevant statutory provisions imposes such a requirement. Using the mail to execute or attempt to execute a scheme to defraud is indictable as mail fraud, and hence a predicate act of racketeering under RICO, even if no one relied on any misrepresentation. See <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1999) (\u201cThe common-law requirement] of 'justifiable reliance\u2019 . . . plainly ha[s] no place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>in the [mail, wire, or bank] fraud statutes\u201d). And one can conduct the affairs of a qualifying enterprise through a pattern of such acts without anyone relying on a fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">It thus seems plain \u2014 and indeed petitioners do not dispute \u2014 that no showing of reliance is required to establish that a person has violated \u00a7 1962(c) by conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of acts of mail fraud. See <em>Anza, </em>547 U. S., at 476 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cBecause an individual can commit an indictable act of mail or wire fraud even if no one relies on his fraud, he can engage in a pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of \u00a7 1962, without proof of reliance\u201d). If reliance is required, then, it must be by virtue of \u00a7 1964(c), which provides the right of action. But it is difficult to derive a first-party reliance requirement from \u00a7 1964(c), which states simply that \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962\u201d may sue for treble damages. The statute provides a right of action to \u201c[a]ny person\u201d injured by the violation, suggesting a breadth of coverage not easily reconciled with an implicit requirement that the plaintiff show reliance in addition to injury in his business or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Moreover, a person can be injured \u201cby reason of\u201d a pattern of mail fraud even if he has not relied on any misrepresentations. This is a case in point. Accepting their allegations as true, respondents clearly were injured by petitioners\u2019 scheme: As a result of petitioners\u2019 fraud, respondents lost valuable liens they otherwise would have been awarded. And this is true even though they did not rely on petitioners\u2019 false attestations of compliance with the county\u2019s rules. Or, to take another example, suppose an enterprise that wants to get rid of rival businesses mails misrepresentations about them to their customers and suppliers, but not to the rivals themselves. If the rival businesses lose money as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>of the misrepresentations, it would certainly seem that they were injured in their business \u201cby reason of\u201d a pattern of mail fraud, even though they never received, and therefore never relied on, the fraudulent mailings. Yet petitioners concede that, on their reading of \u00a7 1964(c), the rival businesses would have no cause of action under RICO, Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, even though they were the primary and intended victims of the scheme to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Lacking textual support for this counterintuitive position, petitioners rely instead on a combination of common-law rules and policy arguments in an effort to show that Congress should be presumed to have made first-party reliance an element of a civil RICO claim based on mail fraud. None of petitioners\u2019 arguments persuades us to read a first-party reliance requirement into a statute that by its terms suggests none.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Petitioners first argue that RICO should be read to incorporate a first-party reliance requirement in fraud cases \u201cunder the rule that Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.\u201d <em>Neder, supra, </em>at 23. It has long been settled, they contend, that only the recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation may recover for common-law fraud, and that he may do so \u201cif, but only if ... he relies on the misrepresentation in acting or refraining from action.\u201d 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7537 (1977). Given this background rule of common law, petitioners maintain, Congress should be presumed to have adopted a first-party reliance requirement when it created a civil cause of action under RICO for victims of mail fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">In support of this argument, petitioners point to our decision in <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Prupis, </em>529 U. S. 494 (2000). There, we considered the scope of RICO\u2019s private right of action for violations of \u00a7 1962(d), which makes it \u201cunlawful for any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>to conspire to violate\u201d RlCO\u2019s criminal prohibitions. The question presented was \u201cwhether a person injured by an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy may assert a civil RICO conspiracy claim under \u00a7 1964(c) for a violation of \u00a7 1962(d) even if the overt act does not constitute \u2018racketeering activity.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 500. Answering this question in the negative, we held that \u201cinjury caused by an overt act that is not an act of racketeering or otherwise wrongful under RICO is not sufficient to give rise to a cause of action under \u00a7 1964(c) for a violation of \u00a7 1962(d).\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 505 (citation omitted). In so doing, we \u201cturn[ed] to the well-established common law of civil conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 500. Because it was \u201cwidely accepted\u201d by the time of RlCO\u2019s enactment \u201cthat a plaintiff could bring suit for civil conspiracy only if he had been injured by an act that was itself tortious,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 501, we presumed \u201cthat when Congress established in RICO a civil cause of action for a person \u2018injured ... by reason of\u2019 a \u2018conspiracy],\u2019 it meant to adopt these well-established common-law civil conspiracy principles,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 504 (quoting \u00a7\u00a7 1964(c), 1962(d); alterations in original). We specifically declined to rely on the law of criminal conspiracy, relying instead on the law of civil conspiracy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">\u201cWe have turned to the common law of criminal conspiracy to define what constitutes a violation of \u00a7 1962(d), see <em>Salinas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>522 U. S. 52, 63-65 (1997), a mere violation being all that is necessary for criminal liability. This case, however, does not present simply the question of what constitutes a violation of \u00a7 1962(d), but rather the meaning of a civil cause of action for private injury by reason of such a violation. In other words, our task is to interpret \u00a7\u00a7 1964(c) and 1962(d) in conjunction, rather than \u00a7 1962(d) standing alone. The obvious source in the common law for the combined meaning of these provisions is the law of civil conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 501, n. 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Petitioners argue that, as in <em>Beck, </em>we should look to the common-law meaning of civil fraud in order to give content to the civil cause of action \u00a7 1964(c) provides for private injury by reason of a violation of \u00a7 1962(c) based on a pattern of mail fraud. The analogy to <em>Beck, </em>however, is misplaced. The critical difference between <em>Beck </em>and this case is that in \u00a7 1962(d) Congress used a term \u2014 \u201cconspiracy]\u201d\u2014that had a settled common-law meaning, whereas Congress included no such term in \u00a7 1962(c). Section 1962(c) does not use the term \u201cfraud\u201d; nor does the operative language of \u00a71961(1)(B), which defines \u201cracketeering activity\u201d to include \u201cany act which is indictable under ... section 1341.\u201d And the indictable act under \u00a7 1341 is not the fraudulent misrepresentation, but rather the use of the mails with the purpose of executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud. In short, the key term in \u00a7 1962(c) \u2014 \u201cracketeering activity\u201d \u2014 is a <em>defined </em>term, and Congress defined the predicate act not as fraud <em>sim/pliciter, </em>but mail fraud \u2014 a statutory offense unknown to the common law. In these circumstances, the presumption that Congress intends to adopt the settled meaning of common-law terms has little pull. Cf. <em>Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC </em>v. <em>Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., </em>552 U. S. 148, 162 (2008) (rejecting the argument that \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78j(b), incorporates common-law fraud). There is simply no \u201creason to believe that Congress would have defined \u2018racketeering activity\u2019 to include acts indictable under the mail and wire fraud statutes, if it intended fraud-related acts to be predicate acts under RICO only when those acts would have been actionable under the common law.\u201d <em>Anza, </em>547 U. S., at 477-478 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Nor does it help petitioners\u2019 cause that here, as in <em>Beck, </em>the question is not simply \u201cwhat constitutes a violation of \u00a71962[(c)], . . . but rather the meaning of a civil cause of action for private injury by reason of such a violation.\u201d 529 U. S., at 501, n. 6. To be sure, <em>Beck </em>held that a plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>cannot state a civil claim for conspiracy under \u00a7 1964(c) merely by showing a violation of \u00a7 1962(d) and a resulting injury. But in so doing, <em>Beck </em>relied not only on the fact that the term \u201cconspiracy\u201d had a settled common-law meaning, but also on the well-established common-law understanding of what it means to be injured by a conspiracy for purposes of bringing a civil claim for damages. See <em>id., </em>at 501-504. No comparable understanding exists with respect to injury caused by an enterprise conducting its affairs through a pattern of acts indictable as mail fraud. And even the common-law understanding of injury caused by fraud does not support petitioners\u2019 argument. As discussed <em>infra, </em>at 656-657, the common law has long recognized that plaintiffs can recover in a variety of circumstances where, as here, their injuries result directly from the defendant\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentations to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">For these reasons, we reject petitioners\u2019 contention that the \u201ccommon-law meaning\u201d rule dictates that reliance by the plaintiff is an element of a civil RICO claim predicated on a violation of the mail fraud statute. Congress chose to make mail fraud, not common-law fraud, the predicate act for a RICO violation. And \u201cthe mere fact that the predicate acts underlying a particular RICO violation happen to be fraud offenses does not mean that reliance, an element of common-law fraud, is also incorporated as an element of a civil RICO claim.\u201d <em>Anza, swpra, </em>at 476 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Petitioners next argue that even if Congress did not make first-party reliance an element of a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud, a plaintiff who brings such a claim must show that it relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations in order to establish the requisite element of causation. In <em>Holmes, </em>we recognized that \u00a71964(c)\u2019s \u201clanguage can, of course, be read to mean that a plaintiff is injured \u2018by reason of\u2019 a RICO violation, and therefore may recover, simply on showing that</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the defendant violated \u00a7 1962, the plaintiff was injured, and the defendant\u2019s violation was a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d 503 U. S., at 265-266 (footnote omitted). We nonetheless held that not \u201call factually injured plaintiffs\u201d may recover under \u00a7 1964(c). <em>Id., </em>at 266. Because Congress modeled \u00a7 1964(c) on other provisions that had been interpreted to \u201crequir[e] a showing that the defendant\u2019s violation not only was a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well,\u201d we concluded that \u00a7 1964(c) likewise requires the plaintiff to establish proximate cause in order to show injury \u201cby reason of\u201d a RICO violation. <em>Id., </em>at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Proximate cause, we explained, is a flexible concept that does not lend itself to \u201c \u2018a black-letter rule that will dictate the result in every case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 272, n. 20 (quoting <em>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. </em>v. <em>Carpenters, </em>459 U. S. 519, 536 (1983)). Instead, we \u201cuse[d] \u2018proximate cause\u2019 to label generically the judicial tools used to limit a person\u2019s responsibility for the consequences of that person\u2019s own acts,\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>503 U. S., at 268, with a particular emphasis on the \u201cdemand for some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged,\u201d <em>ibid.; </em>see also <em>Anza, supra, </em>at 461 (\u201cWhen a court evaluates a RICO claim for proximate causation, the central question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries\u201d). The direct-relation requirement avoids the difficulties associated with attempting \u201cto ascertain the amount of a plaintiff\u2019s damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors,\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>503 U. S., at 269; prevents courts from having \u201cto adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries,\u201d <em>ibid.; </em>and recognizes the fact that \u201cdirectly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general, without any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 269-270.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Pointing to our reliance on common-law proximate-causation principles in <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Anza, </em>petitioners argue that \u2018\u2018[u]nder well-settled common-law principles, proximate cause is established for fraud claims only where the plaintiff can demonstrate that he relied on the misrepresentation.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 28. In support of this argument, petitioners cite 3 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 548A, which provides that \u201c[a] fraudulent misrepresentation is a legal cause of a pecuniary loss resulting from action or inaction in reliance upon it if, but only if, the loss might reasonably be expected to result from the reliance.\u201d Thus, petitioners conclude, \u201ca plaintiff asserting a civil RICO claim predicated on mail fraud cannot satisfy the proximate cause requirement unless he can establish that his injuries resulted from his reliance on the defendant\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Petitioners\u2019 argument is twice flawed. First, as explained above, the predicate act here is not common-law fraud, but mail fraud. Having rejected petitioners\u2019 argument that reliance is an element of a civil RICO claim based on mail fraud, we see no reason to let that argument in through the back door by holding that the proximate-cause analysis under RICO must precisely track the proximate-cause analysis of a common-law fraud claim. \u201cReliance is not a general limitation on civil recovery in tort; it \u2018is a specialized condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>that happens to have grown up with common law fraud.\u2019\u201d <em>Anza, </em>547 U. S., at 477 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (quoting <em>Systems Management, </em>303 F. 3d, at 104). That \u201cspecialized condition,\u201d whether characterized as an element of the claim or as a prerequisite to establishing proximate causation, simply has no place in a remedial scheme keyed to the commission of mail fraud, a statutory offense that is distinct from common-law fraud and that does not require proof of reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Second, while it may be that first-party reliance is an element of a common-law fraud claim, there is no general common-law principle holding that a fraudulent misrepresentation can cause legal injury only to those who rely on it. The Restatement provision cited by petitioners certainly does not support that proposition. It provides only that the plaintiff\u2019s loss must be a foreseeable result of <em>someone\u2019s </em>reliance on the misrepresentation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It does not say that only those who rely on the misrepresentation can suffer a legally cognizable injury. And any such notion would be contradicted by the long line of cases in which courts have permitted a plaintiff directly injured by a fraudulent misrepresentation to recover even though it was a third party, and not the plaintiff, who relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, so well established is the defendant\u2019s liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>in such circumstances that the Restatement (Second) of Torts sets forth as a \u201c[g]eneral [principle\u201d that \u201c[o]ne who intentionally causes injury to another is subject to liability to the other for that injury, if his conduct is generally culpable and not justifiable under the circumstances.\u201d \u00a7 870. As an illustration, the Restatement provides the example of a defendant who \u201cseeks to promote his own interests by telling a known falsehood to <em>or about </em>the plaintiff or his product.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Comment <em>h </em>(emphasis added). And the Restatement specifically recognizes \u201ca cause of action\u201d in favor of the injured party where the defendant \u201cdefrauds another for the purpose of causing pecuniary harm to a third person.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 435A, Comment <em>a. </em>Petitioners\u2019 contention that proximate cause has traditionally incorporated a first-party reliance requirement for claims based on fraud cannot be reconciled with these authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Nor is first-party reliance necessary to ensure that there is a sufficiently direct relationship between the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s injury to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>proximate-cause principles articulated in <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Anza. </em>Again, this is a case in point. Respondents\u2019 alleged injury\u2014 the loss of valuable liens \u2014 is the direct result of petitioners\u2019 fraud. It was a foreseeable and natural consequence of petitioners\u2019 scheme to obtain more liens for themselves that other bidders would obtain fewer liens. And here, unlike in <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Anza, </em>there are no independent factors that account for respondents\u2019 injury, there is no risk of duplicative recoveries by plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violation, and no more immediate victim is better situated to sue. Indeed, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that respondents and other losing bidders were the <em>only </em>parties injured by petitioners\u2019 misrepresentations. App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a; 477 F. 3d, at 931. Petitioners quibble with that conclusion, asserting that the county would be injured too if the taint of fraud deterred potential bidders from participating in the auction. But that eventuality, in contrast to respondents\u2019 direct financial injury, seems speculative and remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Of course, none of this is to say that a RICO plaintiff who alleges injury \u201cby reason of\u201d a pattern of mail fraud can prevail without showing that <em>someone </em>relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations. Cf. <em>Field </em>v. <em>Mans, </em>516 U. S. 59, 66 (1995) (\u201cNo one, of course, doubts that some degree of reliance is required to satisfy the element of causation inherent in the phrase \u2018obtained by\u2019\u201d in 11 U. S. C. \u00a7523(a)(2)(A), which prohibits the discharge of debts for money or property \u201cobtained by\u201d fraud). In most cases, the plaintiff will not be able to establish even but-for causation if no one relied on the misrepresentation. If, for example, the county had not accepted petitioners\u2019 false attestations of compliance with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule, and as a result had not permitted petitioners to participate in the auction, respondents\u2019 injury would never have materialized. In addition, the complete absence of reliance may prevent the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>tiff from establishing proximate cause. Thus, for example, if the county knew petitioners\u2019 attestations were false but nonetheless permitted them to participate in the auction, then arguably the county\u2019s actions would constitute an intervening cause breaking the chain of causation between petitioners\u2019 misrepresentations and respondents\u2019 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Accordingly, it may well be that a RICO plaintiff alleging injury by reason of a pattern of mail fraud must establish at least third-party reliance in order to prove causation. \u201cBut the fact that proof of reliance is often used to prove an element of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, such as the element of causation, does not transform reliance itself into an element of the cause of action.\u201d <em>Anza, </em>547 U. S., at 478 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Nor does it transform first-party reliance into an indispensable requisite of proximate causation. Proof that the plaintiff relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations may in some cases be sufficient to establish proximate cause, but there is no sound reason to conclude that such proof is always necessary. By the same token, the absence of first-party reliance may in some cases tend to show that an injury was not sufficiently direct to satisfy \u00a7 1964(c)\u2019s proximate-cause requirement, but it is not in and of itself dispositive. A contrary holding would ignore <em>Holmes\u2019 </em>instruction that proximate cause is generally not amenable to bright-line rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">As a last resort, petitioners contend that we should interpret RICO to require first-party reliance for fraud-based claims in order to avoid the \u201cover-federalization\u201d of traditional state-law claims. In petitioners\u2019 view, respondents\u2019 claim is essentially one for tortious interference with prospective business advantage, as evidenced by count V of their complaint. Such claims have traditionally been handled under state law, and petitioners see no reason why Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>gress would have wanted to supplement traditional state-law remedies with a federal cause of action, complete with treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees, in a statute designed primarily to combat organized crime. See <em>Anza, supra, </em>at 471-475 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>Beck, </em>529 U. S., at 496-497. A first-party reliance requirement, they say, is necessary \u201cto prevent garden-variety disputes between local competitors (such as this case) from being converted into federal racketeering actions.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Whatever the merits of petitioners\u2019 arguments as a policy matter, we are not at liberty to rewrite RICO to reflect their \u2014 or our \u2014 views of good policy. We have repeatedly refused to adopt narrowing constructions of RICO in order to make it conform to a preconceived notion of what Congress intended to proscribe. See, <em>e. g., National Organization for Women, Inc. </em>v. <em>Scheidler, </em>510 U. S. 249, 252 (1994) (rejecting the argument that \u201cRICO requires proof that either the racketeering enterprise or the predicate acts of racketeering were motivated by an economic purpose\u201d); <em>H. J. Inc. </em>v. <em>Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>492 U. S. 229, 244 (1989) (rejecting \u201cthe argument for reading an organized crime limitation into RICO\u2019s pattern concept\u201d); <em>Sedima, S. P. R. L. </em>v. <em>Imrex Co., </em>473 U. S. 479, 481 (1985) (rejecting the view that RICO provides a private right of action \u201conly against defendants who had been convicted on criminal charges, and only where there had occurred a \u2018racketeering injury\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">We see no reason to change course here. RICO\u2019s text provides no basis for imposing a first-party reliance requirement. If the absence of such a requirement leads to the undue proliferation of RICO suits, the \u201ccorrection must lie with Congress.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 499. \u201cIt is not for the judiciary to eliminate the private action in situations where Congress has provided it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 499-500.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that a plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud need not show, either as an element of its claim or as a prerequisite to establishing proximate causation, that it relied on the defendant\u2019s alleged misrepresentations. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\"> Because this ease arises from the District Court\u2019s grant of petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss, we \u201caccept as true all of the factual allegations contained in [respondents\u2019] complaint.\u201d <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Pardus, </em>551 U.

While a precise understanding of the county\u2019s system may be necessary to calculate respondents\u2019 damages, nothing in our disposition turns on this issue.

Of course, a misrepresentation can cause harm only if a recipient of the misrepresentation relies on it. But that does not mean that the only injuries proximately caused by the misrepresentation are those suffered by the recipient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\"> Such eases include <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>66 N.

Rather, they \u2014 along with the Restatement\u2019s recognition of specialized torts based on third-party reliance \u2014 show that a fraudulent misrepresentation can proximately cause actionable injury even to those who do not rely on the misrepresentation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
