S. 32,40 (1940). Several exceptions, recognized in this Court\u2019s decisions, temper this basic rule. In a class action, for example, a person not named as a party may be bound by a judgment on the merits of the action, if she was adequately represented by a party who actively participated in the litigation. See <em>id., </em>at 41. In this case, we consider for the first time whether there is a \u201cvirtual representation\u201d exception to the general rule against precluding nonparties. Adopted by a number of courts, including the courts below in the case now before us, the exception so styled is broader than any we have so far approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>The virtual representation question we examine in this opinion arises in the following context. Petitioner Brent Taylor filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act seeking certain documents from the Federal Aviation Administration. Greg Herrick, Taylor\u2019s friend, had previously brought an unsuccessful suit seeking the same records. The two men have no legal relationship, and there is no evidence that Taylor controlled, financed, participated in, or even had notice of Herrick\u2019s earlier suit. Nevertheless, the D. C. Circuit held Taylor\u2019s suit precluded by the judgment against Herrick because, in that court\u2019s assessment, Herrick qualified as Taylor\u2019s \u201cvirtual representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">We disapprove the doctrine of preclusion by \u201cvirtual representation,\u201d and hold, based on the record as it now stands, that the judgment against Herrick does not bar Taylor from maintaining this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA or Act) accords \u201cany person\u201d a right to request any records held by a federal agency. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A) (2006 ed.). No reason need be given for a FOIA request, and unless the requested materials fall within one of the Act\u2019s enumerated exemptions, see \u00a7 552(a)(3)(E), (b), the agency must \u201cmake the records promptly available\u201d to the requester, \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A). If an agency refuses to furnish the requested records, the requester may file suit in federal court and obtain an injunction \u201corder[ing] the production of any agency records improperly withheld.\u201d \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">The courts below held the instant FOIA suit barred by the judgment in earlier litigation seeking the same records. Because the lower courts\u2019 decisions turned on the connection between the two lawsuits, we begin with a full account of each action.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">The first suit was filed by Greg Herrick, an antique aircraft enthusiast and the owner of an F-45 airplane, a vintage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>model manufactured by the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation (FEAC) in the 1930\u2019s. In 1997, seeking information that would help him restore his plane to its original condition, Herrick filed a FOIA request asking the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for copies of any technical documents about the F-45 contained in the agency\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">To gain a certificate authorizing the manufacture and sale of the F-45, FEAC had submitted to the FAA\u2019s predecessor, the Civil Aeronautics Authority, detailed specifications and other technical data about the plane. Hundreds of pages of documents produced by FEAC in the certification process remain in the FAA\u2019s records. The FAA denied Herrick\u2019s request, however, upon finding that the documents he sought are subject to FOIA\u2019s exemption for \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(4). In an administrative appeal, Herrick urged that FEAC and its successors had waived any trade-secret protection. The FAA thereupon contacted FEAC\u2019s corporate successor, respondent Fairchild Corporation (Fairchild). Because Fairchild objected to release of the documents, the agency adhered to its original decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Herrick then filed suit in the U. S. District Court for the District of Wyoming. Challenging the FAA\u2019s invocation of the trade-secret exemption, Herrick placed heavy weight on a 1955 letter from FEAC to the Civil Aeronautics Authority. The letter authorized the agency to lend any documents in its files to the public \u201cfor use in making repairs or replacement parts for aircraft produced by Fairchild.\u201d <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Garvey, </em>298 F. 3d 1184,1193 (CA10 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). This broad authorization, Herrick maintained, showed that the F-45 certification records held by the FAA could not be regarded as \u201csecre[t]\u201d or \u201cconfidential\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 552(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Rejecting Herrick\u2019s argument, the District Court granted summary judgment to the FAA. <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Garvey, </em>200 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>F. Supp. 2d 1321, 1328-1329 (Wyo. 2000). The 1955 letter, the court reasoned, did not deprive the F-45 certification documents of trade-secret status, for those documents were never in fact released pursuant to the letter\u2019s blanket authorization. See <em>id., </em>at 1329. The court also stated that even if the 1955 letter had waived trade-secret protection, Fairchild had successfully \u201creversed\u201d the waiver by objecting to the FAA\u2019s release of the records to Herrick. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">On appeal, the Tenth Circuit agreed with Herrick that the 1955 letter had stripped the requested documents of trade-secret protection. See <em>Herrick, </em>298 F. 3d, at 1194. But the Court of Appeals upheld the District Court\u2019s alternative de<em>termination </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that Fairchild had restored trade-secret status by objecting to Herrick\u2019s FOIA request. <em>Id., </em>at 1195. On that ground, the appeals court affirmed the entry of summary judgment for the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">In so ruling, the Tenth Circuit noted that Herrick had failed to challenge two suppositions underlying the District Court\u2019s decision. First, the District Court assumed trade-secret status could be \u201crestored\u201d to documents that had lost protection. <em>Id., </em>at 1194, n. 10. Second, the District Court also assumed that Fairchild had regained trade-secret status for the documents even though the company claimed that status only <em>\u201cafter </em>Herrick had initiated his request\u201d for the F-45 records. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court of Appeals expressed no opinion on the validity of these suppositions. See <em>id., </em>at 1194-1195, n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">The Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision issued on July 24,2002. Less than a month later, on August 22, petitioner Brent Taylor\u2014 a friend of Herrick\u2019s and an antique aircraft enthusiast in his own right \u2014 submitted a FOIA request seeking the same documents Herrick had unsuccessfully sued to obtain. When the FAA failed to respond, Taylor filed a complaint in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Like Herrick, Taylor argued that FEAC\u2019s 1955 letter had stripped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>the records of their trade-secret status. But Taylor also sought to litigate the two issues concerning recapture of protected status that Herrick had failed to raise in his appeal to the Tenth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">After Fairchild intervened as a defendant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the District Court in D. C. concluded that Taylor\u2019s suit was barred by claim preclusion; accordingly, it granted summary judgment to Fairchild and the FAA. The court acknowledged that Taylor was not a party to Herrick\u2019s suit. Relying on the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Tyus </em>v. <em>Schoemehl, </em>93 F. 3d 449 (1996), however, it held that a nonparty may be bound by a judgment if she was \u201cvirtually represented\u201d by a party. App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a-31a.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">The Eighth Circuit\u2019s seven-factor test for virtual representation, adopted by the District Court in Taylor\u2019s case, requires an \u201cidentity of interests\u201d between the person to be bound and a party to the judgment. See <em>id., </em>at 31a. See also <em>Tyus, </em>93 F. 3d, at 455. Six additional factors counsel in favor of virtual representation under the Eighth Circuit\u2019s test, but are not prerequisites: (1) a \u201cclose relationship\u201d between the present party and a party to the judgment alleged to be preclusive; (2) \u201cparticipation in the prior litigation\u201d by the present party; (3) the present party\u2019s \u201capparent acquiescence\u201d to the preclusive effect of the judgment; (4) \u201cdeliberate] maneuvering]\u201d to avoid the effect of the judgment; (5) adequate representation of the present party by a party to the prior adjudication; and (6) a suit raising a \u201cpublic law\u201d rather than a \u201cprivate law\u201d issue. App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a (citing <em>Tyus, </em>93 F. 3d, at 454-456). These factors, the D. C. District Court observed, \u201cconstitute a fluid test with imprecise boundaries\u201d and call for \u201ca broad, case-by-case inquiry.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>The record before the District Court in Taylor\u2019s suit revealed the following facts about the relationship between Taylor and Herrick: Taylor is the president of the Antique Aircraft Association, an organization to which Herrick belongs; the two men are \u201cclose associate^],\u201d App. 54; Herrick asked Taylor to help restore Herrick\u2019s F-45, though they had no contract or agreement for Taylor\u2019s participation in the restoration; Taylor was represented by the lawyer who represented Herrick in the earlier litigation; and Herrick apparently gave Taylor documents that Herrick had obtained from the FAA during discovery in his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Fairchild and the FAA conceded that Taylor had not participated in Herrick\u2019s suit. App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a. The D. C. District Court determined, however, that Herrick ranked as Taylor\u2019s virtual representative because the facts fit each of the other six indicators on the Eighth Circuit\u2019s list. See <em>id., </em>at 32a-35a. Accordingly, the District Court held Taylor\u2019s suit, seeking the same documents Herrick had requested, barred by the judgment against Herrick. See <em>id., </em>at 35a.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">The D. C. Circuit affirmed. It observed, first, that other Circuits \u201cvary widely\u201d in their approaches to virtual representation. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Blakey, </em>490 F. 3d 965, 971 (2007). In this regard, the D. C. Circuit contrasted the multifactor balancing test applied by the Eighth Circuit and the D. C. District Court with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s narrower approach, which \u201ctreats a party as a virtual representative only if the party is \u2018accountable to the nonparties who file a subsequent suit\u2019 and has \u2018the tacit approval of the court\u2019 to act on the nonpart[ies\u2019] behalf.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Klugh </em>v. <em>United States, </em>818 F. 2d 294, 300 (CA4 1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Rejecting both of these approaches, the D. C. Circuit announced its own five-factor test. The first two factors\u2014 \u201cidentity of interests\u201d and \u201cadequate representation\u201d \u2014 are necessary but not sufficient for virtual representation. 490 F. 3d, at 971-972. In addition, at least one of three other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>factors must be established: \u201ca close relationship between the present party and his putative representative,\u201d \u201csubstantial participation by the present party in the first case,\u201d or \u201ctactical maneuvering on the part of the present party to avoid preclusion by the prior judgment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Applying this test to the record in Taylor\u2019s case, the D. C. Circuit found both of the necessary conditions for virtual representation well met. As to identity of interests, the court emphasized that Taylor and Herrick sought the same result \u2014 release of the F-45 documents. Moreover, the D. C. Circuit observed, Herrick owned an F-45 airplane, and therefore had, \u201cif anything, a stronger incentive to litigate\u201d than Taylor, who had only a \u201cgeneral interest in public disclosure and the preservation of antique aircraft heritage.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 973 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Turning to adequacy of representation, the D. C. Circuit acknowledged that some other Circuits regard notice of a prior suit as essential to a determination that a nonparty was adequately represented in that suit. See <em>id., </em>at 973-974 (citing <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Volvo Car Corp., </em>247 F. 3d 303, 312 (CA1 2001), and <em>Tice </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>162 F. 3d 966, 973 (CA7 1998)). Disagreeing with these courts, the D. C. Circuit deemed notice an \u201cimportant\u201d but not an indispensable element in the adequacy inquiry. The court then concluded that Herrick had adequately represented Taylor even though Taylor had received no notice of Herrick\u2019s suit. For this conclusion, the appeals court relied on Herrick\u2019s \u201cstrong incentive to litigate\u201d and Taylor\u2019s later engagement of the same attorney, which indicated to the court Taylor\u2019s satisfaction with that attorney\u2019s performance in Herrick\u2019s case. See 490 F. 3d, at 974-975.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">The D. C. Circuit also found its \u201cclose relationship\u201d criterion met, for Herrick had \u201casked Taylor to assist him in restoring his F-45\u201d and \u201cprovided information to Taylor that Herrick had obtained through discovery\u201d; furthermore, Taylor \u201cdid not oppose Fairchild\u2019s characterization of Herrick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>as his \u2018close associate.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 975. Because the three above-described factors sufficed-to establish virtual representation under the D. C. Circuit\u2019s five-factor test, the appeals court left open the question whether Taylor had engaged in \u201ctactical maneuvering.\u201d See <em>id., </em>at 976 (calling the facts bearing on tactical maneuvering \u201cambigu[ous]\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. 1136 (2008), to resolve the disagreement among the Circuits over the permissibility and scope of preclusion based on \u201cvirtual representation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">The preclusive effect of a federal-court judgment is determined by federal common law. See <em>Semtek Int\u2019l Inc. </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>531 U. S. 497, 507-508 (2001). For judgments in federal-question cases \u2014 for example, Herrick\u2019s FOIA suit \u2014 federal courts participate in developing \u201cuniform federal rule[s]\u201d of res judicata, which this Court has ultimate authority to determine and declare. <em>Id., </em>at 508.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The federal common law of preclusion is, of course, subject to due process limitations. See <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Jefferson County, </em>517 U. S. 793, 797 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>Taylor\u2019s case presents an issue of first impression in this sense: Until now, we have never addressed the doctrine of \u201cvirtual representation\u201d adopted (in varying forms) by several Circuits and relied upon by the courts below. Our inquiry, however, is guided by well-established precedent regarding the propriety of nonparty preclusion. We review that precedent before taking up directly the issue of virtual representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">The preclusive effect of a judgment is defined by claim preclusion and issue preclusion, which are collectively referred to as \u201cres judicata.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the doctrine of claim preclusion, a final judgment forecloses \u201csuccessive litigation of the very same claim, whether or not relitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit.\u201d <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>532 U. S. 742, 748 (2001). Issue preclusion, in contrast, bars \u201csuccessive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment,\u201d even if the issue recurs in the context of a different claim. <em>Id., </em>at 748-749. By \u201cprecluding] parties from contesting matters that they have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate,\u201d these two doctrines protect against \u201cthe expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserv[e] judicial resources, and foste[r] reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.\u201d <em>Montana </em>v. <em>United States, </em>440 U. S. 147, 153-154 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">A person who was not a party to a suit generally has not had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity to litigate\u201d the claims and issues settled in that suit. The application of claim and issue preclusion to nonparties thus runs up against the \u201cdeep-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court.\u201d <em>Rickards, </em>517 U. S., at 798 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indicating the strength of that tradition, we have often repeated the general rule that \u201cone is not bound by a judgment <em>in personam </em>in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.\u201d <em>Hansberry, </em>311 U. S., at 40. See also, <em>e. g., Richards, </em>517 U. S., at 798; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Wilks, </em>490 U. S. 755, 761 (1989); <em>Zenith Radio Corp. </em>v. <em>Hazeltine Research, Inc., </em>395 U. S. 100, 110 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Though hardly in doubt, the rule against nonparty preclusion is subject to exceptions. For present purposes, the recognized exceptions can be grouped into six categories.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">First, \u201c[a] person who agrees to be bound by the determination of issues in an action between others is bound in accordance with the terms of his agreement.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a740, p. 390 (1980) (hereinafter Restatement). For example, \u201cif separate actions involving the same transaction are brought by different plaintiffs against the same defendant, all the parties to all the actions may agree that the question of the defendant\u2019s liability will be definitely determined, one way or the other, in a \u2018test case.\u2019\u201d D. Shapiro, Civil Procedure: Preclusion in Civil Actions 77-78 (2001) (hereinafter Shapiro). See also <em>California </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>459 U. S. 1096, 1097 (1983) (dismissing certain defendants from a suit based on a stipulation \u201cthat each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>said defendants ... will be bound by a final judgment of this Court\u201d on a specified issue).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Second, nonparty preclusion may be justified based on a variety of pre-existing \u201csubstantive legal relationship[s]\u201d between the person to be bound and a party to the judgment. Shapiro 78. See also <em>Richards, </em>517 U. S., at 798. Qualifying relationships include, but are not limited to, preceding and succeeding owners of property, bailee and bailor, and assignee and assignor. See 2 Restatement \u00a7\u00a743-44, 52, 55. These exceptions originated \u201cas much from the needs of property law as from the values of preclusion by judgment.\u201d 18A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a74448, p. 329 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Third, we have confirmed that, \u201cin certain limited circumstances,\u201d a nonparty may be bound by a judgment because she was \u201cadequately represented by someone with the same interests who [wa]s a party\u201d to the suit. <em>Richards, </em>517 U. S., at 798 (internal quotation marks omitted). Representative suits with preclusive effect on nonparties include properly conducted class actions, see <em>Martin, </em>490 U. S., at 762, n. 2 (citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23), and suits brought by trustees, guardians, and other fiduciaries, see <em>Sea-Land Services, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Gaudet, </em>414 U. S. 573,593 (1974). See also 1 Restatement \u00a741.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Fourth, a nonparty is bound by a judgment if she \u201cassumed] control\u201d over the litigation in which that judgment was rendered. <em>Montana, </em>440 U. S., at 154. See also <em>Schnell </em>v. <em>Peter Eckrich &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>365 U. S. 260,262, n. 4 (1961); 1 Restatement \u00a7 39. Because such a person has had \u201cthe opportunity to present proofs and argument,\u201d he has already \u201chad his day in court\u201d even though he was not a formal party to the litigation. <em>Id., </em>Comment <em>a, </em>at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Fifth, a party bound by a judgment may not avoid its preclusive force by relitigating through a proxy. Preclusion is thus in order when a person who did not participate in a litigation later brings suit as the designated representative of a person who was a party to the prior adjudication. See <em>Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Schendel, </em>270 U. S. 611, 620, 623 (1926); 18A Wright &amp; Miller \u00a74454, at 433-434. And although our decisions have not addressed the issue directly, it also seems clear that preclusion is appropriate when a non-party later brings suit as an agent for a party who is bound by a judgment. See <em>id., </em>\u00a74449, at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Sixth, in certain circumstances a special statutory scheme may \u201cexpressly foreclos[e] successive litigation by non-litigants ... if the scheme is otherwise consistent with due process.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>490 U.

Decisions of these courts, however, have been far from consistent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>See 18A Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 4457, at 513 (virtual representation lacks a \u201cclear or coherent theory\u201d; decisions applying it have \u201can episodic quality\u201d). Some Circuits use the label, but define \u201cvirtual representation\u201d so that it is no broader than the recognized exception for adequate representation. See, <em>e. g., Becherer </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>193 F. 3d 415, 423,427 (CA6 1999) (en banc). But other courts, including the Eighth, Ninth, and D. C. Circuits, apply multifactor tests for virtual representation that permit non-party preclusion in cases that do not fit within any of the established exceptions. See <em>supra, </em>at 888-891, and n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">The D. C. Circuit, the FAA, and Fairchild have presented three arguments in support of an expansive doctrine of virtual representation. We find none of them persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">The D. C. Circuit purported to ground its virtual representation doctrine in this Court\u2019s decisions stating that, in some circumstances, a person may be bound by a judgment if she was adequately represented by a party to the proceeding yielding that judgment. See 490 F. 3d, at 970-971. But the D. C. Circuit\u2019s definition of \u201cadequate representation\u201d strayed from the meaning our decisions have attributed to that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">In <em>Richards, </em>we reviewed a decision by the Alabama Supreme Court holding that a challenge to a tax was barred by a judgment upholding the same tax in a suit filed by different taxpayers. 517 U. S., at 795-797. The plaintiffs in the first suit \u201cdid not sue on behalf of a class,\u201d their complaint \u201cdid not purport to assert any claim against or on behalf of any nonparties,\u201d and the judgment \u201cdid not purport to bind\u201d non-parties. <em>Id., </em>at 801. There was no indication, we emphasized, that the court in the first suit \u201ctook care to protect the interests\u201d of absent parties, or that the parties to that litigation \u201cunderstood their suit to be on behalf of absent [parties].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 802. In these circumstances, we held, the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>plication of claim preclusion was inconsistent with \u201cthe due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The D. C. Circuit stated, without elaboration, that it did not \u201cread <em>Richards </em>to hold a nonparty ... adequately represented only if special procedures were followed [to protect the nonparty] or the party to the prior suit understood it was representing the nonparty.\u201d 490 F. 3d, at 971. As the D. C. Circuit saw this case, Herrick adequately represented Taylor for two principal reasons: Herrick had a strong incentive to litigate; and Taylor later hired Herrick\u2019s lawyer, suggesting Taylor\u2019s \u201csatisfaction with the attorney\u2019s performance in the prior case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The D. C. Circuit misapprehended <em>Richards. </em>As just recounted, our holding that the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s application of res judicata to nonparties violated due process turned on the lack of either special procedures to protect the nonparties\u2019 interests or an understanding by the concerned parties that the first suit was brought in a representative capacity. See <em>Richards, </em>517 U. S., at 801-802. <em>Richards </em>thus established that representation is \u201cadequate\u201d for purposes of nonparty preclusion only if (at a minimum) one of these two circumstances is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">We restated <em>Richards\u2019 </em>core holding in <em>South Central Bell Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>526 U. S. 160 (1999). In that case, as in <em>Richards, </em>the Alabama courts had held that a judgment rejecting a challenge to a tax by one group of taxpayers barred a subsequent suit by a different taxpayer. See 526 U. S., at 164-165. In <em>South Central Bell, </em>however, the nonparty had notice of the original suit and engaged one of the lawyers earlier employed by the original plaintiffs. See <em>id., </em>at 167-168. Under the D. C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Taylor\u2019s case, these factors apparently would have sufficed to establish adequate representation. See 490 F. 3d, at 973-975. Yet <em>South Central Bell </em>held that the application of res judicata in that case violated due process. Our inquiry came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>to an end when we determined that the original plaintiffs had not understood themselves to be acting in a representative capacity and that there had been no special procedures to safeguard the interests of absentees. See 526 U. S., at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Our decisions recognizing that a nonparty may be bound by a judgment if she was adequately represented by a party to the earlier suit thus provide no support for the D. C. Circuit\u2019s broad theory of virtual representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Fairchild and the FAA do not argue that the D. C. Circuit\u2019s virtual representation doctrine fits within any of the recognized grounds for nonparty preclusion. Rather, they ask us to abandon the attempt to delineate discrete grounds and clear rules altogether. Preclusion is in order, they contend, whenever \u201cthe relationship between a party and a non-party is \u2018close enough\u2019 to bring the second litigant within the judgment.\u201d Brief for Respondent Fairchild 20. See also Brief for Respondent FAA 22-24. Courts should make the \u201cclose enough\u201d determination, they urge, through a \u201cheavily fact-driven\u201d and \u201cequitable\u201d inquiry. Brief for Respondent Fair-child 20. See also Brief for Respondent FAA 22 (\u201cthere is no clear test\u201d for nonparty preclusion; rather, an \u201cequitable and fact-intensive\u201d inquiry is demanded (internal quotation marks omitted)). Only this sort of diffuse balancing, Fair-child and the FAA argue, can account for all of the situations in which nonparty preclusion is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">We reject this argument for three reasons. First, our decisions emphasize the fundamental nature of the general rule that a litigant is not bound by a judgment to which she was not a party. See, <em>e. g., Richards, </em>517 U. S., at 798-799; <em>Martin, </em>490 U. S., at 761-762. Accordingly, we have endeavored to delineate discrete exceptions that apply in \u201climited circumstances.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 762, n. 2. Respondents\u2019 amorphous balancing test is at odds with the constrained approach to nonparty preclusion our decisions advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Resisting this reading of our precedents, respondents call up three decisions they view as supportive of the approach they espouse. Fairchild quotes our statement in <em>Coryell </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>317 U. S. 406, 411 (1943), that privity \u201cturns on the facts of particular cases.\u201d See Brief for Respondent Fair-child 20. That observation, however, scarcely implies that privity is governed by a diffuse balancing test.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Fairchild also cites <em>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>University of III. Foundation, </em>402 U. S. 313, 334 (1971), which stated that estoppel questions turn on \u201cthe trial courts\u2019 sense of justice and equity.\u201d See Brief for Respondent Fairchild 20. This passing statement, however, was not made with non-party preclusion in mind; it appeared in a discussion recognizing district courts\u2019 discretion to <em>limit </em>the use of issue preclusion against persons who <em>were </em>parties to a judgment. See <em>Blonder-Tongue, </em>402 U. S., at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The FAA relies on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Des Moines Valley R. Co., </em>84 F. 40 (CA8 1897), an opinion we quoted with approval in <em>Schendel, </em>270 U. S., at 619-620. <em>Des Moines Valley </em>was a quiet title action in which the named plaintiff was the United States. The Government, however, had \u201cno interest in the land\u201d and had \u201csimply permitted [the landowner] to use its name as the nominal plaintiff.\u201d 84 F., at 42. The suit was therefore barred, the appeals court held, by an earlier judgment against the landowner. As the court explained: \u201c[W]here the government lends its name as a plaintiff... to enable one private person to maintain a suit against another,\u201d the government is \u201csubject to the same defenses which exist . . . against the real party in interest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 43. <em>Des Moines Valley, </em>the FAA contended at oral argument, demonstrates that it is sometimes appropriate to bind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>a nonparty in circumstances that do not fit within any of the established grounds for nonparty preclusion. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31-33. Properly understood, however, <em>Des Moines Valley </em>is simply an application of the fifth basis for nonparty preclusion described above: A party may not use a representative or agent to relitigate an adverse judgment. See <em>swpra, </em>at 895-896.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We thus find no support in our precedents for the lax approach to nonparty preclusion advocated by respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Our second reason for rejecting a broad doctrine of virtual representation rests on the limitations attending nonparty preclusion based on adequate representation. A party\u2019s representation of a nonparty is \u201cadequate\u201d for preclusion purposes only if, at a minimum: (1) The interests of the non-party and her representative are aligned, see <em>Hansberry, </em>311 U. S., at 43; and (2) either the party understood herself to be acting in a representative capacity or the original court took care to protect the interests of the nonparty, see <em>Richards, </em>517 U. S., at 801-802; <em>supra, </em>at 897-898. In addition, adequate representation sometimes requires (3) notice of the original suit to the persons alleged to have been represented, see <em>Richards, </em>517 U. S., at 801.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the class-action context, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>these limitations are implemented by the procedural safeguards contained in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">An expansive doctrine of virtual representation, however, would \u201crecogniz[e], in effect, a common-law kind of class action.\u201d <em>Tice, </em>162 F. 3d, at 972 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is, virtual representation would authorize preclusion based on identity of interests and some kind of relationship between parties and nonparties, shorn of the procedural protections prescribed in <em>Hansberry, Rickards, </em>and Rule 23. These protections, grounded in due process, could be circumvented were we to approve a virtual representation doctrine that allowed courts to \u201ccreate <em>de facto </em>class actions at will.\u201d <em>Tice, </em>162 F. 3d, at 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Third, a diffuse balancing approach to nonparty preclusion would likely create more headaches than it relieves. Most obviously, it could significantly complicate the task of district courts faced in the first instance with preclusion questions. An all-things-considered balancing approach might spark wide-ranging, time-consuming, and expensive discovery tracking factors potentially relevant under seven- or five-prong tests. And after the relevant facts are established, district judges would be called upon to evaluate them under a standard that provides no firm guidance. See <em>Tyus, </em>93 F. 3d, at 455 (conceding that \u201cthere is no clear test for determining the applicability of\u201d the virtual representation doctrine announced in that case). Preclusion doctrine, it should be recalled, is intended to reduce the burden of litigation on courts and parties. Cf. <em>Montana, </em>440 U. S., at 153-154. \u201cIn this area of the law,\u201d we agree, \u201c \u2018crisp rules with sharp corners\u2019 are preferable to a round-about doctrine of opaque standards.\u201d <em>Bittinger </em>v. <em>Tecumseh Products Co., </em>123 F. 3d 877, 881 (CA6 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Finally, relying on the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Tyus, </em>93 F. 3d, at 456, the FAA maintains that nonparty preclusion should apply more broadly in \u201cpublic law\u201d litigation than in \u201cprivate law\u201d controversies. To support this position, the FAA offers two arguments. First, the FAA urges, our decision in <em>Richards </em>acknowledges that, in certain cases, the plaintiff has a reduced interest in controlling the litigation \u201cbecause of the public nature of the right at issue.\u201d Brief for Respondent FAA 28. When a taxpayer challenges \u201can alleged misuse of public funds\u201d or \u201cother public action,\u201d we observed in <em>Richards, </em>the suit \u201chas only an indirect impact on [the plaintiff\u2019s] interests.\u201d 517 U. S., at 803. In actions of this character, the Court said, \u201cwe may assume that the States have wide latitude to establish procedures ... to limit the number of judicial proceedings that may be entertained.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Taylor\u2019s FOIA action falls within the category described in <em>Richards, </em>the FAA contends, because \u201cthe duty to disclose under FOIA is owed to the public generally.\u201d Brief for Respondent FAA 34. The opening sentence of FOIA, it is true, states that agencies \u201cshall make [information] available to the public.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 552(a) (2006 ed.). Equally true, we have several times said that FOIA vindicates a \u201cpublic\u201d interest. <em>E. g., National Archives and Records Admin, </em>v. <em>Favish, </em>541 U. S. 157, 172 (2004). The Act, however, instructs agencies receiving FOIA requests to make the information available not to the public at large, but rather to the \u201cperson\u201d making the request. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A). See also \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B) (\u201cIn making any record available <em>to a person </em>under this paragraph, an agency shall provide the record in any [readily reproducible] form or format requested <em>by the person </em>. ...\u201d (emphasis added)); Brief for National Security Archive et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>10 (\u201cGovernment agencies do not systematically make released records available to the general public.\u201d). Thus, in contrast to the public-law litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>tion contemplated in <em>Richards, </em>a successful FOIA action results in a grant of relief to the individual plaintiff, not a decree benefiting the public at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Furthermore, we said in <em>Richards </em>only that, for the type of public-law claims there envisioned, States are free to adopt procedures limiting repetitive litigation. See 517 U. S., at 803. In this regard, we referred to instances in which the first judgment foreclosed successive litigation by other plaintiffs because, \u201cunder state law, [the suit] could be brought only on behalf of the public at large.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 804.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Richards </em>spoke of state legislation, but it appears equally evident that <em>Congress, </em>in providing for actions vindicating a public interest, may \u201climit the number of judicial proceedings that may be entertained.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 803. It hardly follows, however, that <em>this Court </em>should proscribe or confine successive FOIA suits by different requesters. Indeed, Congress\u2019 provision for FOIA suits with no statutory constraint on successive actions counsels against judicial imposition of constraints through extraordinary application of the common law of preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">The FAA next argues that \u201cthe threat of vexatious litigation is heightened\u201d in public-law cases because \u201cthe number of plaintiffs with standing is potentially limitless.\u201d Brief for Respondent FAA 28 (internal quotation marks omitted). FOIA does allow \u201cany person\u201d whose request is denied to resort to federal court for review of the agency\u2019s determination. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A), (4)(B) (2006 ed.). Thus it is theoretically possible that several persons could coordinate to mount a series of repetitive lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">But we are not convinced that this risk justifies departure from the usual rules governing nonparty preclusion. First, <em>stare decisis </em>will allow courts swiftly to dispose of repetitive suits brought in the same circuit. Second, even when <em>stare </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number><em>decisis </em>is not dispositive, \u201cthe human tendency not to waste money will deter the bringing of suits based on claims or issues that have already been adversely determined against others.\u201d Shapiro 97. This intuition seems to be borne out by experience: The FAA has not called our attention to any instances of abusive FOIA suits in the Circuits that reject the virtual representation theory respondents advocate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we disapprove the theory of virtual representation on which the decision below rested. The preclusive effects of a judgment in a federal-question case decided by a federal court should instead be determined according to the established grounds for nonparty preclusion described in this opinion. See Part II-B, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Although references to \u201cvirtual representation\u201d have proliferated in the lower courts, our decision is unlikely to occasion any great shift in actual practice. Many opinions use the term \u201cvirtual representation\u201d in reaching results at least arguably defensible on established grounds. See 18A Wright &amp; Miller \u00a74457, at 535-539, and n. 38 (collecting cases). In these cases, dropping the \u201cvirtual representation\u201d label would lead to .clearer analysis with little, if any, change in outcomes. See <em>Tice, </em>162 F. 3d, at 971 (\u201c[T]he term \u2018virtual representation\u2019 has cast more shadows than light on the problem [of nonparty preclusion].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">In some cases, however, lower courts have relied on virtual representation to extend nonparty preclusion beyond the latter doctrine\u2019s proper bounds. We now turn back to Taylor\u2019s action to determine whether his suit is such a case, or whether the result reached by the courts below can be justified on one of the recognized grounds for nonparty preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">It is uncontested that four of the six grounds for nonparty preclusion have no application here: There is no indication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>that Taylor agreed to be bound by Herrick\u2019s litigation, that Taylor and Herrick have any legal relationship, that Taylor exercised any control over Herrick\u2019s suit, or that this suit implicates any special statutory scheme limiting relitigation. Neither the FA A nor Fairchild contends otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">It is equally clear that preclusion cannot be justified on the theory that Taylor was adequately represented in Herrick\u2019s suit. Nothing in the record indicates that Herrick understood himself to be suing on Taylor\u2019s behalf, that Taylor even knew of Herrick\u2019s suit, or that the Wyoming District Court took special care to protect Taylor\u2019s interests. Under our pathmarking precedent, therefore, Herrick\u2019s representation was not \u201cadequate.\u201d See <em>Richards, </em>517 U. S., at 801-802.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">That leaves only the fifth category: preclusion because a nonparty to an earlier litigation has brought suit as a representative or agent of a party who is bound by the prior adjudication. Taylor is not Herrick\u2019s legal representative and he has not purported to sue in a representative capacity. He concedes, however, that preclusion would be appropriate if respondents could demonstrate that he is acting as Herrick\u2019s \u201cundisclosed agen[t].\u201d Brief for Petitioner 23, n. 4. See also <em>id., </em>at 24, n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Respondents argue here, as they did below, that Taylor\u2019s suit is a collusive attempt to relitigate Herrick\u2019s action. See Brief for Respondent Fairchild 32, and n. 18; Brief for Respondent FAA 18-19, 33, 39. The D. C. Circuit considered a similar question in addressing the \u201ctactical maneuvering\u201d prong of its virtual representation test. See 490 F. 3d, at 976. The Court of Appeals did not, however, treat the issue as one of agency, and it expressly declined to reach any definitive conclusions due to \u201cthe ambiguity of the facts.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We therefore remand to give the courts below an opportunity to determine whether Taylor, in pursuing the instant FOIA suit, is acting as Herrick\u2019s agent. Taylor concedes that such a remand is appropriate. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 56-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>We have never defined the showing required to establish that a nonparty to a prior adjudication has become a litigating agent for a party to the earlier case. Because the issue has not been briefed in any detail, we do not discuss the matter elaboratively here. We note, however, that courts should be cautious about finding preclusion on this basis. A mere whiff of \u201ctactical maneuvering\u201d will not suffice; instead, principles of agency law are suggestive. They indicate that preclusion is appropriate only if the putative agent\u2019s conduct of the suit is subject to the control of the party who is bound by the prior adjudication. See 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 14, p. 60 (1957) (\u201cA principal has the right to control the conduct of the agent with respect to matters entrusted to him.\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">On remand, Fairchild suggests, Taylor should bear the burden of proving he is not acting as Herrick\u2019s agent. When a defendant points to evidence establishing a close relationship between successive litigants, Fairchild maintains, \u201cthe burden [should] shif[t] to the second litigant to submit evidence refuting the charge\u201d of agency. Brief for Respondent Fairchild 27-28. Fairchild justifies this proposed burden-shift on the ground that \u201cit is unlikely an opposing party will have access to direct evidence of collusion.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 28, n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>We reject Fairchild\u2019s suggestion. Claim preclusion, like issue preclusion, is an affirmative defense. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c); <em>Blonder-Tongue, </em>402 U. S., at 350. Ordinarily, it is incumbent on the defendant to plead and prove such a defense, see <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Bock, </em>549 U. S. 199, 204 (2007), and we have never recognized claim preclusion as an exception to that general rule, see 18 Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 4405, at 83 (\u201c[A] party asserting preclusion must carry the burden of establishing all necessary elements.\u201d). We acknowledge that direct evidence justifying nonparty preclusion is often in the hands of plaintiffs rather than defendants. See, <em>e. g., Montana, </em>440 U. S., at 155 (listing evidence of control over a prior suit). But \u201c[v]ery often one must plead and prove matters as to which his adversary has superior access to the proof.\u201d 2 K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7337, p. 475 (6th ed. 2006). In these situations, targeted interrogatories or deposition questions can reduce the information disparity. We see no greater cause here than in other matters of affirmative defense to disturb the traditional allocation of the proof burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-7\"> Although Fairchild provided documents to the Wyoming District Court and filed an <em>amicus </em>brief in the Tenth Circuit, it was not a party to Herrick\u2019s suit.

The Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, like the Fourth Circuit, have constrained the reach of virtual representation by requiring, <em>inter alia, </em>the existence of a legal relationship between the nonparty to be bound and the putative representative. See <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Cockrell, </em>578 F. 2d 1002, 1008 (CA5 1978); <em>Becherer </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>193 F. 3d 415, 424 (CA6 1999) (en banc); <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Perneo Aeroplex, Inc., </em>383 F. 3d 1280, 1289 (CA11 2004). The Seventh Circuit, in contrast, has rejected the doctrine of virtual representation altogether. See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Globe Auto Recycling, Inc., </em>227 F. 3d 950, 953 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b953-10\"> For judgments in diversity cases, federal law incorporates the rules of preclusion applied by the State in which the rendering court sits. See <em>Semtek Int\u2019l Inc. </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>531 U. S. 497, 508 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b954-8\"> These terms have replaced a more confusing lexicon. Claim preclusion describes the rules formerly known as \u201cmerger\u201d and \u201cbar,\u201d while issue preclusion encompasses the doctrines once known as \u201ccollateral estoppel\u201d and \u201cdirect estoppel.\u201d See <em>Migra </em>v. <em>Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., </em>465 U. S. 75, 77, n. 1 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b955-8\"> The established grounds for nonparty preclusion could be organized differently. See, <em>e. g., </em>1 &amp; 2 Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7\u00a739-62 . (1980) (hereinafter Restatement); D. Shapiro, Civil Procedure: Preclusion in Civil Actions 75-92 (2001); 18A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4448, pp. 327-329 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller). The list that follows is meant only to provide a framework for our consideration of virtual representation, not to establish a definitive taxonomy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b956-7\"> The Restatement observes that a nonparty may be bound not only by express or implied agreement, but also through conduct inducing reliance by others. See 2 Restatement \u00a7 62. See also 18A Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 4453, at 425-429. We have never had occasion to consider this ground for non-party preclusion, and we express no view on it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b956-8\"> The substantive legal relationships justifying preclusion are sometimes collectively referred to as \u201cprivity.\u201d See, <em>e. g., Richards </em>v. <em>Jefferson County, </em>517 U. S. 793, 798 (1996); 2 Restatement \u00a7 62, Comment <em>a. </em>The term \u201cprivity,\u201d however, has also come to be used more broadly, as a way to express the conclusion that nonparty preclusion is appropriate on any ground. See 18A Wright &amp; Miller \u00a74449, at 351-353, and n. 33 (collecting cases). To ward off confusion, we avoid using the term \u201cprivity\u201d in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b961-6\"> Moreover, <em>Coryell </em>interpreted the term \u201cprivity\u201d not in the context of res judicata, but as used in a statute governing shipowner liability. See <em>Coryell </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>317 U. S. 406, 407-408, and n. 1 (1943). And we made the statement Fairchild quotes in explaining why it was appropriate to defer to the findings of the lower courts, not as a comment on the substantive rules of privity. See <em>id., </em>at 411.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b962-6\"> The FA A urges that there was no agency relationship between the landowner and the United States because the landowner did not control the U. S. Attorney\u2019s conduct of the suit. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. That point is debatable. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Des Moines Valley R. Co., </em>84 F. 40, 42-43 (CA8 1897) (the United States was only a \u201cnominal plaintiff\u201d; it merely \u201clen[t]\u201d its name to the landowner). But even if the FAA is correct about agency, the United States plainly litigated as the landowner\u2019s designated representative. See <em>id., </em>at 42 (\u201cThe bill does not attempt to conceal the fact that... its real purpose is to champion the cause of [the landowner] . . . .\u201d). See also <em>Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Schendel, </em>270 U. S. 611, 618-620 (1926) (classifying <em>Des Moines Valley </em>with other cases of preclusion based on representation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b962-7\"> <em>Richards </em>suggested that notice is required in some representative suits, <em>e. g., </em>class actions seeking monetary relief. See 517 U. S., at 801 (citing <em>Hansberry </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>311 U. S. 32, 40 (1940), <em>Eisen </em>v. <em>Carlisle &amp; Jac</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number><em>quelin, </em>417 U. S. 156,177 (1974), and <em>Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U. S. 306, 319 (1950)). But we assumed without deciding that a lack of notice might be overcome in some circumstances. See <em>Richards, </em>517 U. S., at 801.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b965-8\"> Nonparty preclusion in such cases ranks under the sixth exception described above: special statutory schemes that expressly limit subsequent suits. See <em>supra, </em>at 895.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b968-7\"> Our decision in <em>Montana </em>v. <em>United States, </em>440 U. S. 147 (1979), also suggests a \u201ccontrol\u201d test for agency. In that case, we held that the United States was barred from bringing a suit because it had controlled a prior unsuccessful action filed by a federal contractor. See <em>id., </em>at 155. We see no reason why preclusion based on a lesser showing would have been appropriate if the order of the two actions had been switched \u2014 that is, if the United States had brought the first suit itself, and then sought to relitigate the same claim through the contractor. See <em>Schendel, </em>270 U. S., at 618 (\u201c[I]f, in legal contemplation, there is identity of parties\u201d when two suits are brought in one order, \u201cthere must be like identity\u201d when the order is reversed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
