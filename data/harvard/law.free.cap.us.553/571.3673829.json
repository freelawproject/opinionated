S. C. \u00a7 504(a)(1) (2006 ed.) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (2000 ed.), allows a prevailing party in a case brought by or against the Government to recover fees for paralegal services at the market rate for such services or only at their cost to the party\u2019s attorney. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit limited recovery to the attorney\u2019s cost. 472 F. 3d 1370 (2006). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">Petitioner Richlin Security Service Co. (Richlin) is a small California proprietorship. In the early 1990\u2019s, it was engaged by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>to provide guard services for detainees at Los Angeles International Airport. Through mutual mistake, the parties\u2019 two contracts misclassified Richlin\u2019s employees under the Service Contract Act of 1965, 41 U. S. C. \u00a7 351 <em>et seq. </em>The Department of Labor discovered the misclassification and ordered Richlin to pay its employees back wages. Richlin responded by filing a claim against the Government with the Department of Transportation\u2019s Board of Contract Appeals (Board). The claim sought reformation of the two contracts in order to force the Government to make additional payments necessary to cover Richlin\u2019s liability under the Service Contract Act. Richlin prevailed after extensive litigation, and the Board entered an award in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Richlin then filed an application with the Board for reimbursement of its attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs pursuant to EAJA. Under EAJA, \u201c[a]n agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall award, to a prevailing party other than the United States, fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with that proceeding, unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 504(a)(1). In addition to its other fees and expenses, Richlin sought $45,141.10 for 523.8 hours of paralegal work on its contract claim and $6,760 for 68.2 hours of paralegal work on the EAJA application itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Th\u00e9 Board granted Richlin\u2019s application in part. <em>Richlin Security Service Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Justice, </em>Docket Nos. 3034E, 3035E, Contract Nos. WRO-06-90, WRO-03-91, 2005 WL 1635099 (June 30, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a. It found that Richlin met \u00a7 504(b)(l)(B)\u2019s eligibility requirements, see <em>id., </em>at 30a, and that the Government\u2019s position had not been \u201csubstantially justified\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 504(a)(1), <em>id., </em>at 32a. It concluded, however, that Richlin was not entitled to recover its paralegal fees at the rates (ranging from $50 per hour to $95 per hour) at which Richlin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>was billed by its law firm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>id., </em>at 39a. The Board held that EAJA limited recovery of paralegal fees to \u201cthe cost to the firm rather than ... the billed rate.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Richlin had not submitted any evidence regarding the cost of the paralegal services to its law firm, see <em>ibid., </em>but the Board found that \u201c$35 per hour is a reasonable cost to the firm[,] having taken judicial notice of paralegal salaries in the Washington D. C. area as reflected on the internet,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 42a-43a.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">A divided panel of the Federal Circuit affirmed. 472 F. 3d 1370. The court construed the term \u201cfees,\u201d for which \u00c9AJA authorizes recovery at \u201cprevailing market rates,\u201d \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A), as embracing only the fees of attorneys, experts, and agents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>id., </em>at 1374. The court declined to follow the contrary decision of the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>863 F. 2d 759 (1988), aff\u2019d <em>sub nom. Commissioner </em>v. <em>Jean, </em>496 U. S. 154 (1990). It also distinguished this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>491 U. S. 274 (1989), and <em>West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>499 U. S. 83 (1991), reasoning that those cases involved a different fee-shifting statute with different \u201c\u2018goals and objectives.\u2019\u201d 472 F. 3d, at 1375-1377, 1379 (discussing the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976,42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988). The court instead found support for its interpretation in EAJA\u2019s legislative history, see 472 F. 3d, at 1381 (citing S. Rep. No. 98-586 (1984) (hereinafter S. Rep.)), and in considerations of public policy, see 472 F. 3d, at 1380-1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Judge Plager dissented. He believed that the authorities distinguished by the majority (particularly this Court\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>sions in <em>Jenkins </em>and Casey) were indistinguishable. He also identified \u201csound policy reasons for... adopting the Supreme Court\u2019s take of the case, even if we thought we had a choice.\u201d 472 F. 3d, at 1383.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Richlin petitioned for rehearing, pointing out that the approach taken by the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Jean </em>had been followed by several other Circuits. See 482 F. 3d 1358, 1359 (CA Fed. 2007) (citing <em>Role Models Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Brownlee, </em>353 F. 3d 962, 974 (CADC 2004); <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Barnhart, </em>315 F. 3d 239, 255 (CA4 2002); and <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alamo, </em>983 F. 2d 856, 862 (CA8 1993)). The panel denied rehearing over Judge Plager\u2019s dissent, and the full court denied rehearing en banc. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We granted certiorari. 552 U. S. 1021 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">EAJA permits an eligible prevailing party to recover \u201cfees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with\u201d a proceeding before an administrative agency. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 504(a)(1). EAJA defines \u201cfees and other expenses\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">\u201c \u2018[F]ees and other expenses\u2019 includes the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project which is found by the agency to be necessary for the preparation of the party\u2019s case, and reasonable attorney or agent fees (The amount of fees awarded under this section shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, except that (i) no expert witness shall be compensated at a rate in excess of the highest rate of compensation for expert witnesses paid by the agency involved, and (ii) attorney or agent fees shall not be awarded in excess of $125 per hour unless the agency determines by regulation that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the limited availability of qualified attorneys or agents for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.)\u201d \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In this case, Richlin \u201cincurred\u201d \u201cfees\u201d for paralegal services in connection with its contract action before the Board. Since \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A) awards fees at \u201cprevailing market rates,\u201d a straightforward reading of the statute leads to the conclusion that Richlin was entitled to recover fees for the paralegal services it purchased at the market rate for such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The Government resists this reading by distinguishing \u201cfees\u201d from \u201cother expenses.\u201d The Government concedes that \u201cfees\u201d are reimbursable at \u201cprevailing market rates,\u201d but it insists that \u201cother expenses\u201d (including expenses for \u201cany study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project\u201d) are reimbursable only at their \u201creasonable cost.\u201d And in the Government\u2019s view, outlays for paralegal services are better characterized as \u201cother expenses\u201d than as \u201cfees.\u201d The Government observes that the second sentence of \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A), which explains how to calculate awards for \u201cfees,\u201d refers to attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses, without mentioning paralegals. From this omission, the Government infers that Congress intended to treat expenditures for paralegal services not as \u201cfees\u201d but as \u201cother expenses,\u201d recoverable at \u201creasonable cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We find the Government\u2019s fractured interpretation of the statute unpersuasive. Contrary to the Government\u2019s contention, \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A) does not clearly distinguish between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the rates at which \u201cfees\u201d and \u201cother expenses\u201d are reimbursed. Although the statute does refer to the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of \u201cany study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project,\u201d Congress may reasonably have believed that market rates would not exist for work product of that kind. At one point, Congress even appears to use the terms \u201cexpenses\u201d and \u201cfees\u201d interchangeably: The first clause of \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A) refers to the \u201creasonable expenses of expert witnesses,\u201d while the parenthetical characterizes expert compensation as \u201cfees.\u201d There is no indication that Congress, in using the term \u201cexpenses\u201d in one place and \u201cfees\u201d in the other, was referring to two different components of expert remuneration.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Even if the dichotomy that the Government draws between \u201cfees\u201d and \u201cother expenses\u201d were supported by the statutory text, it would hardly follow that amounts billed for paralegal services should be classified as \u201cexpenses\u201d rather than as \u201cfees.\u201d The Government concludes that the omission of paralegal fees from \u00a7 504(b)(l)(A)\u2019s parenthetical (which generally authorizes reimbursement at \u201cprevailing market rates\u201d) implies that the recovery of paralegal fees is limited to cost. But one could just as easily conclude that the omission of paralegal fees from the litany of \u201cany study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project\u201d (all of which are recoverable at \u201creasonable cost\u201d) implies that paralegal fees are recoverable at market rates. Surely paralegals are more analogous to attorneys, experts, and agents than to studies, analyses, reports, tests, and projects. Even the Government\u2019s brief, which incants the term \u201cparalegal expenses,\u201d <em>e. g., </em>Brief for Respondent 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, slips up once and refers to them as \u201cfees,\u201d see <em>id., </em>at 35 (\u201cAs the court of appeals explained, treating paralegal fees as attorney fees could \u2018distort the normal allocation of work and result in a less efficient performance of legal services\u2019 under the EAJA . .. \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>But even if we agreed that E A JA limited a prevailing party\u2019s recovery for paralegal fees to \u201creasonable cost,\u201d it certainly would not follow that the cost should be measured from the perspective of the party\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To the contrary, it would be anomalous to measure cost from the perspective of the attorney rather than the client. We do not understand the Government to contend, for example, that the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of an \u201cengineering report\u201d or \u201canalysis\u201d should be calculated from the perspective of the firm that employs the engineer or analyst. Such an interpretation would be tough to square with the statutory language, which provides that an agency shall award to a prevailing party \u201cfees and other expenses <em>incurred by that party.\u201d </em>5 U. S. C. \u00a7 504(a)(1) (emphasis added); see also \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A). That language leaves no doubt that Congress intended the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of the specified items in \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A) to be calculated from the perspective of the litigant. That being the case, we find it hard to believe that Congress, without even mentioning paralegals, intended to make an exception of them by calculating their cost from the perspective of their employer rather than the litigant. It seems more plausible that Congress intended all \u201cfees and other expenses\u201d to be recoverable at the litigant\u2019s \u201creasonable cost,\u201d subject to the proviso that \u201creasonable cost\u201d would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>deemed to be \u201cprevailing market rates\u201d when such rates could be determined.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">To the extent that some ambiguity subsists in the statutory text, we need not look far to resolve it, for we have already addressed a similar question with respect to another fee-shifting statute. In <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>491 U. S. 274 (1989), we considered whether litigants could recover paralegal fees under the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988. Section 1988 provides that \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d We concluded that the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fee\u201d in \u00a7 1988 \u201ccannot have been meant to compensate only work performed personally by members of the bar.\u201d 491 U. S., at 285. Although separate billing for paralegals had become \u201cincreasingly widespread,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 286 (internal quotation marks omitted), attorney\u2019s fees had traditionally subsumed both the attorney\u2019s personal labor and the labor of paralegals and other individuals who contributed to the attorney\u2019s work product, see <em>id., </em>at 285. We were so confident that Congress had given the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d this traditional gloss that we declared it \u201cself-evident\u201d that the term embraced the fees of paralegals as well as attorneys. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>We think <em>Jenkins </em>substantially answers the question before us. EAJA, like \u00a71988, entitles certain parties to recover \u201creasonable attorney . . . fees.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A). EAJA, like \u00a7 1988, makes no mention of the paralegals, \u201csecretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product for which an attorney bills her client.\u201d <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>at 285. And we think EAJA, like \u00a7 1988, must be interpreted as using the term \u201cattorney .. . fees\u201d to reach fees for paralegal services as well as compensation for the attorney\u2019s personal labor. The Government does not contend that the meaning of the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d changed so much between \u00a7 1988\u2019s enactment in 1976 and EAJA\u2019s enactment in 1980 that the term\u2019s meaning in one statute must be different from its meaning in the other. Under the reasoning of <em>Jenkins, </em>we take it as \u201cself-evident\u201d that when Congress instructed agencies to award \u201cattorney... fees\u201d to certain parties prevailing against the Government, that term was intended to embrace paralegal fees as well. Since \u00a7504 generally provides for recovery of attorney\u2019s fees at \u201cprevailing market rates,\u201d it follows that fees for paralegal services must be recoverable at prevailing market rates as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The Government contends that our decision in <em>Jenkins </em>was driven by considerations arising from the different context in which the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fee\u201d was used in \u00a7 1988. At the time <em>Jenkins </em>was decided, \u00a71988 provided for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees without reference to any other recoverable \u201cexpenses.\u201d The Government insists that <em>Jenkins </em>found paralegal fees recoverable under the guise of \u201cattorney\u2019s fee[s]\u201d because otherwise paralegal fees would not be recoverable at all. Since EAJA expressly permits recovery (albeit at \u201ccost\u201d) for items other than attorney, agent, and expert witness fees, the Government sees no reason to give EAJA the broad construction that <em>Jenkins </em>gave \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The Government\u2019s rationale for distinguishing <em>Jenkins </em>finds no support either in our opinion there or in our subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>quent decisions. Our opinion in <em>Jenkins </em>expressed no apprehension at the possibility that a contrary decision would leave the claimant emptyhanded. This omission is unsurprising, since our decision in <em>Jenkins </em>did not rest on the conviction that recovery at market rates was better than nothing. Our decision rested instead on the proposition\u2014 a proposition we took as \u201cself-evident\u201d \u2014 that the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fee\u201d had historically included fees for paralegal services.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Indeed, the Government\u2019s interpretation of <em>Jenkins </em>was rejected by this Court just two years after <em>Jenkins </em>was handed down. In <em>West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>499 U. S. 83, the petitioner sought to recover expert witness fees from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania pursuant to \u00a7 1988. The petitioner looked to <em>Jenkins </em>for the proposition that the \u201cbroad remedial purposes\u201d of \u00a7 1988 allowed the recovery of fees not expressly authorized by statute. The Court rejected that interpretation of <em>Jenkins:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">\u201cThe issue [in Jenkins] was not, as [petitioner] contends, whether we would permit our perception of the \u2018policy\u2019 of the statute to overcome its \u2018plain language.\u2019 It was not remotely plain in <em>Jenkins </em>that the phrase \u2018attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 did not include charges for law clerk and paralegal services. Such services, like the services of \u2018secretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product,\u2019 had traditionally been included in calculation of the lawyers\u2019 hourly rates. Only recently had there arisen \u2018the increasingly widespread custom of separately billing for [such] services.\u2019 By contrast, there has never been, to our knowledge, a practice of including the cost of expert services within attorneys\u2019 hourly rates. There was also no record in <em>Jenkins </em>\u2014 as there is a lengthy record here \u2014 of statutory usage that recognizes a distinction between the charges at issue and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Casey, supra, </em>at 99 (quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ing 491 U. S., at 285-286; some internal quotation marks and citations omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Our analysis of <em>Jenkins </em>in <em>Casey </em>refutes the Government\u2019s claim that <em>Jenkins </em>had to stretch the law to fit hard facts. As <em>Casey </em>shows, our decision in <em>Jenkins </em>turned not on extra-textual policy goals but on the traditional meaning of the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The Government parries this textual and doctrinal analysis with legislative history and public policy. We are not persuaded by either. The legislative history cited by the Government does not address the question presented, and policy considerations actually counsel in favor of Richlin\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">The Government contends first that a 1984 Senate Report accompanying the bill that reenacted EAJA<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> unequivocally expressed congressional intent that paralegal fees should be recovered only <em>\u201c\u2018at cost.\u2019\u201d </em>Brief for Respondent 29 (quoting S. Rep., at 15; emphasis in original). It next contends that the Report tacitly endorsed the same result by approving model rules of the Administrative Conference of the United States and a pre-EAJA Sixth Circuit decision, both of which had adopted schemes of reimbursement at attorney cost. See Brief for Respondent 29. We are not persuaded. In our view, the legislative history does not even address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>question presented, much less answer it in the Government\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\">The Senate Report accompanying the 1984 bill remarked that \u201c[e]xamples of the type of expenses that should ordinarily be compensable [under EAJA] include paralegal time (billed at cost).\u201d S. Rep., at 15. The Government concludes from this stray remark that Congress intended to limit recovery of paralegal fees to attorney cost. But as we observed earlier, the word \u201ccost\u201d could just as easily (and more sensibly) refer to the client\u2019s cost rather than the attorney\u2019s cost. Under the former interpretation, the Senate Report simply indicates that a prevailing party who satisfies E A JA\u2019s other requirements should generally be able to \u201cbil[l] \u201d the Government for any reasonable amount the party paid for paralegal services. Since the litigant\u2019s out-of-pocket cost for paralegal services would normally be equal to' the \u201cprevailing market rat[e]\u201d for such services, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A), the Senate Report could easily support Richlin\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Moreover, even if the Government\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201ccost\u201d is correct, that interpretation would not be inconsistent with our decision today. \u201cNothing in [EAJA] requires that the work of paralegals invariably be billed separately. If it is the practice in the relevant market not to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>so, or to bill the work of paralegals only at cost, that is all that [EAJA] requires.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>491U. S., at 288 (construing 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988). We thus recognize the possibility, as we did in <em>Jenkins, </em>that the attorney\u2019s cost for paralegal services will supply the relevant metric for calculating the client\u2019s recovery. Whether that metric is appropriate depends on market practice. The Senate Report, even under the Government\u2019s contestable interpretation, is not inconsistent with that conclusion. On the contrary, the Report implies that courts should look to market practice in setting EAJA awards. See S. Rep., at 15 (\u201cThe Act should not be read ... to permit reimbursement for items <em>ordinarily </em>included in office overhead, nor for any other expenses not reasonable in amount, necessary for the conduct of the litigation, <em>and customarily chargeable to </em>clients\u201d (emphasis added)). Beyond that vague guidance, the Report does not address the critical question in this case: whether EAJA limits recovery of paralegal fees to attorney cost <em>regardless of market practice. </em>As such, the Report does not persuade us of the soundness of the Government\u2019s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The Government\u2019s reliance on the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Northcross </em>v. <em>Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, </em>611 F. 2d 624 (1979), founders for the same reason. The Government contends that <em>Northcross </em>approved of reimbursement at attorney cost under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988 and that the 1984 Senate Report, by endorsing <em>Northcross, </em>tacitly approved of the same result for EAJA. See Brief for Respondent 30 (citing <em>Northcross, supra, </em>at 639). The problem again is that <em>Northcross </em>did not decide whether a litigant\u2019s recovery for paralegal services would be limited to his attorney\u2019s cost even in a market where litigants were customarily billed at \u201cprevailing market rates.\u201d Although the Sixth Circuit seems to have been aware that paralegal services could be billed to clients at market rates, some language in its opinion suggests that the court assumed that attorneys billed their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>clients only for the out-of-pocket cost of paralegal services.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since <em>Northcross </em>does not clearly address the question presented, its endorsement in the Senate Report means little.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Finally, the model rules cited in the Senate Report may actually support Richlin\u2019s position. The implementing release for the rules describes the Administrative Conference\u2019s approach to paralegal costs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201cCommenters also took varying positions on whether paralegal costs should be chargeable as expenses. We do not believe the rules should discourage the use of paralegals, which can be an important cost-saving measure. On the other hand, lawyers\u2019 practices with respect to charging for paralegal time, as with respect to other expenses such as duplicating, telephone charges and the like, vary according to locality, field of practice, and individual custom. We have decided not to designate specific items as compensable expenses. Instead, we will adopt a suggestion of the Treasury Department and revise the model rule to provide that expenses may be charged as a separate item if they are ordinarily so charged to the attorney\u2019s clients.\u201d Administrative Conference of the U. S., Equal Access to Justice Act: Agency Implementation, 46 Fed. Reg. 32905 (1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">To the extent that this passage addresses the question presented at all, it seems to take the same approach that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Court took in <em>Jenkins </em>and that we adopt today: It allows the recovery of paralegal fees according to \u201cthe practice in the relevant market.\u201d 491 U. S., at 288. But we think the fairest interpretation of the implementing release is that it does not address how awards for paralegal fees should be calculated. Instead, it addresses the anterior question whether courts may award paralegal fees under EAJA at all. See, <em>e. g., </em>46 Fed. Reg. 32905 (responding to comments urging that the model rules \u201cidentify particular expenses of attorneys and witnesses that are compensable\u201d). Like the other legislative authorities cited by the Government, the model rules fail to persuade us of the soundness of the Government\u2019s interpretation because they fail to clearly address the question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">We find the Government\u2019s policy rationale for recovery at attorney cost likewise unpersuasive. The Government argues that market-based recovery would distort litigant incentives because EAJA would cap paralegal and attorney\u2019s fees at the same rate. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A) (\u201c[Attorney or agent fees shall not be awarded in excess of $125 per hour unless the agency determines by regulation that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or agents for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee\u201d). The Government observes that paralegal rates are lower than rates for attorneys operating in the same market. If EAJA reimbursed both attorney time and paralegal time at market rates, then the cap would clip more off the top of the attorney\u2019s rates than the paralegal\u2019s rates. According to the Government, a market-based scheme would encourage litigants to shift an inefficient amount of attorney work to paralegals, since paralegal fees could be recovered at a greater percentage of their full market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The problem with this argument, as Richlin points out, is that it proves too much. The same reasoning would imply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>that agent fees should not be recoverable at market rates.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If market-based recovery of paralegal time resulted in excessive reliance on paralegals, then market-based recovery of agent time should result in excessive reliance on agents. The same reasoning would also imply that fees for junior attorneys (who generally bill at lower rates than senior attorneys) should not be recoverable at market rates. Cf. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>at 287 (\u201cIf the fees are consistent with market rates and practices, the \u2018windfall\u2019 argument has no more force with regard to paralegals than it does for associates\u201d). Yet despite the possibility that market-based recovery of attorney and agent fees would distort litigant incentives, \u00a7 504 unambiguously authorizes awards of \u201creasonable attorney or agent fees . . . [at] prevailing market rates.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A). The Government offers no persuasive reason why Congress would have treated paralegal fees any differently. The Government\u2019s policy rationale thus founders on the text of the statute, which shows that Congress was untroubled by the very distortion the Government seeks to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">We also question the practical feasibility of the Government\u2019s interpretation of the statute. The Board in this case relied on the Internet for data on paralegal salaries in the District of Columbia, but the Government fails to explain why a law firm\u2019s cost should be limited to salary. The benefits and perks with which a firm compensates its staff come out of the bottom line no less than salary. The Government has offered no solution to this accounting problem, and we do not believe that solutions are readily to be found. Market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>practice provides by far the more transparent basis for calculating a prevailing party\u2019s recovery under EAJA. It strains credulity that Congress would have abandoned this predictable, workable framework for the uncertain and complex accounting requirements that a cost-based rule would inflict on litigants, their attorneys, administrative agencies, and the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Confronted with the flaws in its interpretation of the statute, the Government seeks shelter in a canon of construction. According to the Government, any right to recover paralegal fees under E A JA must be read narrowly in light of the statutory canon requiring strict construction of waivers of sovereign immunity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The sovereign immunity canon is just that \u2014 a canon of construction. It is a tool for interpreting the law, and we have never held that it displaces the other traditional tools of statutory construction. Indeed, the cases on which the Government relies all used other tools of construction in tandem with the sovereign immunity canon. See <em>Ardestani </em>v. <em>INS, </em>502 U. S. 129, 137 (1991) (relying on the canon as \u201creinforce[ment]\u201d for the independent \u201cconclusion that any ambiguities in the legislative history are insufficient to undercut the ordinary understanding of the statutory language\u201d); <em>Ruckelshaus </em>v. <em>Sierra Club, </em>463 U. S. 680, 682, 685-686 (1983) (relying on the canon in tandem with \u201chistoric principles of fee-shifting in this and other countries\u201d to define the scope of a fee-shifting statute); <em>Department of Energy </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>503 U. S. 607, 626-627 (1992) (resorting to the canon only after a close reading of the statutory provision had left the Court \u201cwith an unanswered question and an unresolved tension between closely related statutory provisions\u201d); see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>507 U. S. 197, 201-203 (1993) (invoking the sovereign immunity canon only after observing that the claimant\u2019s argument was \u201cundermine[d]\u201d by the \u201ccommonsense meaning\u201d of the statutory language). In this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>traditional tools of statutory construction and considerations of <em>stare decisis </em>compel the conclusion that paralegal fees are recoverable as attorney\u2019s fees at their \u201cprevailing market rates.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 504(b)(1)(A). There is no need for us to resort to the sovereign immunity canon because there is no ambiguity left for us to construe.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">For these reasons, we hold that a prevailing party that satisfies EAJA\u2019s other requirements may recover its paralegal fees from the Government at prevailing market rates. The Board\u2019s contrary decision was error, and the Federal Circuit erred in affirming that decision. The judgment of the Federal Circuit is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b635-15\">Justice Scalia joins this opinion except as to Part III-A, and Justice Thomas joins this opinion except as to Parts II-B and III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\"> Richlin was actually billed for paralegal services at rates as high as $135 per hour, but it amended its application to cap the fees at $95 per hour.

We assume without deciding that the reasoning of our opinion would extend equally to \u00a7\u00a7 504 and 2412. We confine our discussion to \u00a7 504.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b641-5\"> The Government contends that the question presented does not fairly include the question whether the cost of paralegal services should be calculated from the perspective of the litigant rather than the litigant\u2019s attorney. We disagree. The question presented in Riehlin\u2019s petition for certiorari was whether \u201ca prevailing party [may] be awarded attorney fees for paralegal services at the market rate for such services,... [or at] cost only.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. A decision limiting reimbursement to \u201ccost only\u201d would simply beg the question of how that cost should be measured. Since the question presented cannot genuinely be answered without addressing the subsidiary question, we have no difficulty concluding that the latter question is \u201cfairly included\u201d within the former. See this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\"> It is worth recalling that the Board calculated Riehlin\u2019s award based on an Internet survey of paralegal salaries in the District of Columbia. Presumably the salaries the Board identified represented the market rate for paralegal compensation. The limited award that the Government wants affirmed was thus based, ironically enough, on the \u201cprevailing market rates\u201d for paralegal services. The fact that paralegal salaries respond to market forces no less than the fees that clients pay suggests to us that this case has more to do with determining whose expenditures get reimbursed (the attorney\u2019s or the client\u2019s) than with determining how expenditures are calculated (at cost or at market). Since EAJA authorizes the recovery of fees and other expenses \u201cincurred by [the] party,\u201d \u00a7 504(a)(1), rather than the party\u2019s attorney, the answer to the former question is plain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\"> Following our decision in <em>Casey, </em>Congress amended \u00a71988 to allow parties to recover \u201cexpert fees as part of the attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Civil Rights Act of 1991, \u00a7 113(a), 105 Stat. 1079 (codified at 42 U.
