S. C. \u00a7 633a(a). We hold that such a claim is authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">Petitioner Myrna G\u00f3mez-P\u00e9rez was a window distribution clerk for the United States Postal Service. In October 2002, petitioner, then 45 years of age, was working full time at the Post Office in Dorado, Puerto Rico. She requested a trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>fer to the Post Office in Moca, Puerto Rico, in order to be closer to her mother, who was ill. The transfer was approved, and in November 2002, petitioner began working at the Moca Post Office in a part-time position. Later that month, petitioner requested a transfer back to her old job at the Dorado Post Office, but her supervisor converted the Dorado position to part-time, filled it with another employee, and denied petitioner\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">After first filing an unsuccessful union grievance seeking a transfer back to her old job, petitioner filed a Postal Service equal employment opportunity age discrimination complaint. According to petitioner, she was then subjected to various forms of retaliation. Specifically, petitioner alleges that her supervisor called her into meetings during which groundless complaints were leveled at her, that her name was written on anti-sexual-harassment posters, that she was falsely accused of sexual harassment, that her co-workers told her to \u201c <em>\u2018go </em>back\u2019 \u201d to where she \u201c \u2018belonged],\u2019 \u201d and that her work hours were drastically reduced. 476 F. 3d 54, 56 (CA1 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Petitioner responded by filing this action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, claiming, among other things, that respondent had violated the federal-sector provision of the ADEA, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 633a(a), by retaliating against her for filing her equal employment opportunity age discrimination complaint. Respondent moved for summary judgment, arguing that the United States has not waived sovereign immunity for ADEA retaliation claims and that the ADEA federal-sector provision does not reach retaliation. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent on the basis of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U. S. C. \u00a7 401(1), unequivocally waived the Postal Service\u2019s sovereign immunity, see 476 F. 3d, at 54, 57, but the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>affirmed the decision of the District Court on the alternative ground that the federal-sector provision\u2019s prohibition of \u201cdiscrimination based on age,\u201d \u00a7 633a(a), does not cover retaliation, <em>id., </em>at 60, creating a split among the Courts of Appeals. Cf. <em>Forman </em>v. <em>Small, </em>271 F. 3d 285, 296 (CADC 2001) (ADEA federal-sector provision covers retaliation). We granted certiorari. 551 U. S. 1188 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The federal-sector provision of the ADEA provides that \u201c[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age . . . shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.\u201d \u00a7 633a(a). The key question in this case is whether the statutory phrase \u201cdiscrimination based on age\u201d includes retaliation based on the filing of an age discrimination complaint. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In reaching this conclusion, we are guided by our prior decisions interpreting similar language in other antidiscrimination statutes. In <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc., </em>396 U. S. 229 (1969), we considered whether a claim of retaliation could be brought under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1978, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1982, which provides that \u201c[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right ... as is enjoyed by white citizens ... to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\u201d While \u00a7 1982 does not use the phrase \u201cdiscrimination based on race,\u201d that is its plain meaning. See <em>Tennessee </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>541 U. S. 509, 561 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (describing \u00a7 1982 as \u201cbanning public or private racial discrimination in the sale and rental of property\u201d); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Alfred H. Mayer Co., </em>392 U. S. 409 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In <em>Sullivan, </em>a white man (Sullivan) held membership shares in a nonstock corporation that operated a park and playground for residents of the area in which he owned a home. Under the bylaws of the corporation, a member who leased a home in the area could assign a membership share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>in the corporation. But when Sullivan rented his house and attempted to assign a membership share to an African-American (Freeman), the corporation disallowed the assignment because of Freeman\u2019s race and subsequently expelled Sullivan from the corporation for protesting that decision. Sullivan sued the corporation, and we held that his claim that he had been expelled \u201cfor the advocacy of Freeman\u2019s cause\u201d was cognizable under \u00a7 1982. 396 U. S., at 237. A contrary holding, we reasoned, would have allowed Sullivan to be \u201cpunished for trying to vindicate the rights of minorities\u201d and would have given \u201cimpetus to the perpetuation of racial restrictions on property.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">More recently, in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed., </em>544 U. S. 167 (2005), we relied on <em>Sullivan </em>in interpreting Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, as amended, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1681 <em>et seq. </em>Jackson, a public school teacher, sued his school board under Title IX, \u201calleging that the Board retaliated against him because he had complained about sex discrimination in the high school\u2019s athletic program.\u201d 544 U. S., at 171. Title IX provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o person in the United States shall, <em>on the basis of sex, </em>... be subjected to <em>discrimination </em>under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d \u00a7 1681(a) (emphasis added). Holding that this provision prohibits retaliation, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201cRetaliation against a person because that person has complained of sex discrimination is another form of intentional sex discrimination .... Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional act. It is a form of \u2018discrimination\u2019 because the complainant is being subjected to differential treatment. Moreover, retaliation is discrimination \u2018on the basis of sex\u2019 because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegatipn of sex discrimination. We conclude that when a funding recipient retaliates against a person <em>because </em>he complains of sex discrimination, this constitutes inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>tional \u2018discrimination\u2019 \u2018on the basis of sex,\u2019 in violation of Title IX.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 173-174 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">This interpretation, we found, flowed naturally from <em>Sullivan: </em>\u201cRetaliation for Jackson\u2019s advocacy of the rights of the girls\u2019 basketball team in this case is \u2018discrimination\u2019 \u2018on the basis of sex,\u2019 just as retaliation for advocacy on behalf of a black lessee in <em>Sullivan </em>was discrimination on the basis of race.\u201d 544 U. S., at 176-177.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Following the reasoning of <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Jackson, </em>we interpret the ADEA federal-sector provision\u2019s prohibition of \u201cdiscrimination based on age\u201d as likewise proscribing retaliation. The statutory language at issue here (\u201cdiscrimination based on age\u201d) is not materially different from the language at issue in <em>Jackson </em>(\u201c\u2018discrimination\u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018on the basis of sex\u2019\u201d) and is the functional equivalent of the language at issue in <em>Sullivan, </em>see <em>Jackson, supra, </em>at 177 (describing <em>Sullivan </em>as involving \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of race\u201d). And the context in which the statutory language appears is the same in all three cases; that is, all three cases involve remedial provisions aimed at prohibiting discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The <em>Jackson </em>dissent strenuously argued that a claim of retaliation is conceptually different from a claim of discrimination, see 544 U. S., at 184-185 (opinion of Thomas, J.), but that view did not prevail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And respondent in this case does not ask us to overrule <em>Sullivan </em>or <em>Jackson. </em>Nor does re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>spondent question the reasoning of those decisions. Indeed, in <em>Jackson, </em>the Government contended that \u201c[t]he text. . . of Title IX demonstrate^] that it encompasses protection against retaliation\u201d since \u201cretaliation against a person because that person has filed a sex discrimination complaint is a form of intentional sex discrimination.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed., O. </em>T. 2004, No. 02-1672, p. 8. Similarly, in another case this Term, the Government has urged us to follow the reasoning of <em>Sullivan </em>and to hold that a claim of retaliation may be brought under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1977, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1981. In that case, the Government argues that \u00a7 1981\u2019s prohibition of \u201c \u2018discrimination\u2019 . . . quite naturally includes discrimination on account of having complained about discrimination.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curia# </em>in <em>CBOCS West, Inc. </em>v. <em>Humphries, </em>O. T. 2007, No. 06-1431, p. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The decision of the Court of Appeals, which respondent defends, perceived a \u201cclear difference between a cause of action for discrimination and a cause of action for retaliation\u201d and sought to distinguish <em>Jackson </em>on three grounds. 476 F. 3d, at 58-59. We are not persuaded, however, by any of these attempted distinctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The Court of Appeals first relied on the fact that the ADEA expressly creates a private right of action whereas Title IX, the statute at issue in <em>Jackson, </em>does not. See 476 F. 3d, at 58. The Court of Appeals appears to have reasoned that, because the private right of action under Title IX is implied and not express, see <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>University of Chicago, </em>441 U. S. 677 (1979), the <em>Jackson </em>Court had greater leeway to adopt an expansive interpretation of Title IX\u2019s prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>This reasoning improperly conflates the question whether a statute confers a private right of action with the question whether the statute\u2019s substantive prohibition reaches a particular form of conduct. These questions are analytically distinct, and confusing them would lead to exceedingly strange results.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">For example, under the Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning, Title IX\u2019s prohibition of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d \u201con the basis of sex,\u201d in 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1681(a), might have a narrower scope and might not reach retaliation if Title IX contained a provision expressly authorizing an aggrieved private party to bring suit to remedy a violation of \u00a7 1681(a). We do not see how such a conclusion could be defended. Section 1681(a)\u2019s prohibition of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d either does or does not reach retaliation, and the presence or absence of another statutory provision expressly creating a private right of action cannot alter \u00a71681(a)\u2019s scope. In addition, it would be perverse if the enactment of a provision explicitly creating a private right of action \u2014 a provision that, if anything, would tend to suggest that Congress perceived a need for a strong remedy\u2014 were taken as a justification for narrowing the scope of the underlying prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning also seems to lead to the strange conclusion that, despite <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>holding that a private party may assert a retaliation claim under Title IX, the Federal Government might not be authorized to impose upon an entity that engages in retaliation the administrative remedies, including the termination of funding, that are expressly sanctioned under \u00a71682. It would be extremely odd, however, if \u00a7 1681(a) had a broader scope when enforced by a means not expressly sanctioned by statute than it does when enforced by the means that the statute explicitly provides. For these reasons, we reject the proposition that <em>Jackson </em>may be distinguished from the present case on the ground that Title IX\u2019s private right of action is implied.</p>\n<p id=\"AUY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The Court of Appeals next attempted to distinguish <em>Jackson </em>on the ground that retaliation claims play a more important role under Title IX than they do under the ADEA. The Court of Appeals pointed to our statement in <em>Jackson </em>that \u201c 'teachers and coaches ... are often in the best position to vindicate the rights of their students because they are better able to identify discrimination and bring it to the attention of administrators.\u2019\u201d 476 F. 3d, at 58 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>544 U. S., at 181). The Court of Appeals suggested that third parties are not needed to \u201cidentify instances of age discrimination and bring it to the attention of supervisors\u201d and that, consequently, there is no need to extend \u00a7633a(a) to reach retaliation. 476 F. 3d, at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">This argument ignores the basis for the decision in <em>Jackson. Jackson </em>did not hold that Title IX prohibits retaliation because the Court concluded as a policy matter that such claims are important. Instead, the holding in <em>Jackson </em>was based on an interpretation of the \u201ctext of Title IX.\u201d 544 U. S., at 173, 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Moreover, the statements in <em>Jackson </em>on which the Court of Appeals relied did not address the question whether the statutory term \u201cdiscrimination\u201d encompasses retaliation. Instead, those statements addressed the school board\u2019s argument that, even if Title IX was held to permit some retaliation claims, only a \u201cvictim of the discrimination\u201d \u2014 and not third parties \u2014 should be allowed to assert such a claim. <em>Id., </em>at 179-182. It was in response to this argument that the Court noted the particular importance of reports of Title IX violations by third parties such as teachers and coaches. <em>Id., </em>at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Finally, the Court of Appeals attempted to distinguish <em>Jackson </em>on the ground that \u201cTitle IX was adopted in re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>sponse to the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Sullivan,\u201d </em>whereas \u201cthere is no evidence in the legislative history that the ADEA\u2019s federal sector provisions were adopted in a similar context.\u201d 476 F. 3d, at 58-59. <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>reliance on <em>Sullivan, </em>however, did not stem from \u201cevidence in the legislative history\u201d of Title IX. <em>Jackson </em>did not identify any such evidence but merely observed that \u201cCongress enacted Title IX just three years after <em>Sullivan </em>was decided.\u201d 544 U. S., at 176. Due to this chronology, the Court concluded, it was \u201c\u2018not only appropriate but also realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with <em>[Sullivan] </em>and that it expected its enactment [of Title IX] to be interpreted in conformity with [it].\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Cannon, </em>441 U. S., at 699). See also 544 U. S., at 176 (\u201cTitle IX was enacted in 1972, three years after <em>[Sullivan]\u201d)-, id., </em>at 179-180 <em>(\u201cSullivan . . . </em>formed an important part of the backdrop against which Congress enacted Title IX\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">What <em>Jackson </em>said about the relationship between <em>Sullivan </em>and the enactment of Title IX can be said as well about the relationship between <em>Sullivan </em>and the enactment of the ADEA\u2019s federal-sector provision, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 633a. <em>Sullivan </em>was decided in 1969 and \u00a7633a was enacted in 1974\u2014 five years after the decision in <em>Sullivan </em>and two years after the enactment of Title IX. We see no reason to think that Congress forgot about <em>Sullivan </em>during the two years that passed between the enactment of Title IX in 1972 and the enactment of \u00a7 633a in 1974. And if, as <em>Jackson </em>presumed, Congress had <em>Sullivan </em>in mind when it enacted Title IX in 1972, it is \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201crealistic\u201d to presume that Congress expected its prohibition of \u201cdiscrimination based on age\u201d in \u00a7 633a(a) \u201c \u2018to be interpreted in conformity with\u2019 \u201d its similarly worded prohibition of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d \u201con the basis of sex\u201d in 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1681(a), which it had enacted just two years earlier. 544 U. S., at 176 (quoting <em>Cannon, supra, </em>at 699).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In arguing that \u00a7633a(a) does not encompass retaliation claims, respondent relies principally on the presence of a provision in the ADEA specifically prohibiting retaliation against individuals who complain about age discrimination in the private sector, \u00a7 623(d), and the absence of a similar provision specifically prohibiting retaliation against individuals who complain about age discrimination in federal employment. According to respondent, \u201cthe strong presumption is that [the] omission reflects that Congress acted intentionally and purposely in including such language in Section 623 of the Act and excluding it from Section 633a.\u201d Brief for Respondent 17 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\u201c[N]egative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest\u201d in those instances in which the relevant statutory provisions were \u201cconsidered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.\u201d <em>Lindh </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>521 U. S. 320,330 (1997). Here, the two relevant provisions were not considered or enacted together. Section 623(d), which specifically prohibits private-sector retaliation, was enacted in 1967, see \u00a74(d), 81 Stat. 603, but the federal-sector provision, \u00a7633a, was not added until 1974, see \u00a7 28(b)(2), 88 Stat. 74.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Respondent's argument is also undermined by the fact that the prohibitory language in the ADEA\u2019s federal-sector provision differs sharply from that in the corresponding ADEA provision relating to private-sector employment. In the private-sector provision, Congress set out a specific list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>of forbidden employer practices. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 623(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The omission from such a list of a specific prohibition of retaliation might have been interpreted as suggesting that Congress did not want to reach retaliation, and therefore Congress had reason to include a specific prohibition of retaliation, \u00a7 623(d), in order to dispel any such inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The ADEA federal-sector provision, however, was not modeled after \u00a7 623(d) and is couched in very different terms. The ADEA federal-sector provision was patterned \u201cdirectly after\u201d Title VII\u2019s federal-sector discrimination ban. <em>Lehman </em>v. <em>Nakshian, </em>453 U. S. 156,167, n. 15 (1981). Like the ADEA\u2019s federal-sector provision, Title VII\u2019s federal-sector provision contains a broad prohibition of \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d rather than a list of specific prohibited practices. Compare \u00a711, 86 Stat. 111, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-16(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (personnel actions affecting federal employees \u201cshall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\u201d), with 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (personnel actions affecting federal employees who are at least 40 years of age \u201cshall be made free from any discrimination based on age\u201d). And like the ADEA\u2019s federal-sector provision, Title VII\u2019s federal-sector provision incorporates certain private-sector provisions but does not incorporate the provision prohibiting re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>taliation in the private sector. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-16(d) (incorporating \u00a7\u00a72000e-5(f) to (k) but not \u00a72000e-3(a), which forbids private-sector retaliation).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">When Congress decided not to pattern 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 633a(a) after \u00a7 623(a) but instead to enact a broad, general ban on \u201cdiscrimination based on age,\u201d Congress was presumably familiar with <em>Sullivan </em>and had reason to expect that this ban would be interpreted \u201c \u2018in conformity\u2019 \u201d with that precedent. <em>Jackson, </em>544 U. S., at 176. Under the reasoning of <em>Sullivan, </em>retaliation for complaining about age discrimination is \u201cdiscrimination based on age,\u201d \u201cjust as retaliation for advocacy on behalf of [the] black lessee in <em>Sullivan </em>was discrimination on the basis of race.\u201d 544 U. S., at 176-177. Thus, because \u00a7\u00a7 623(d) and 633a were enacted separately and are couched in very different terms, the absence of a federal-sector provision similar to \u00a7 623(d) does not provide a sufficient reason to depart from the reasoning of <em>Sullivan </em>and Jackson.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">We see even less merit in respondent\u2019s reliance on 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 633a(f), which provides that personnel actions by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>federal department, agency, or other entity covered by \u00a7 633a \u201cshall not be subject to, or affected by, any provisions of this chapter\u201d other than \u00a7\u00a7633a and 631(b), the provisions that restrict the coverage of the ADEA to persons who are at least 40 years of age. Respondent contends that recognizing federal-sector retaliation claims would be tantamount to making \u00a7 623(d) applicable to federal-sector employers and would thus contravene \u00a7 633a(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">This argument is unsound because our holding that the ADEA prohibits retaliation against federal-sector employees is not in any way based on \u00a7 623(d). Our conclusion, instead, is based squarely on \u00a7 633a(a) itself, \u201cunaffected by other sections\u201d of the ADEA. <em>Lehman, supra, </em>at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Respondent next advances a complicated argument concerning \u201c[t]he history of congressional and executive branch responses to the problem of discrimination in federal employment.\u201d Brief for Respondent 27. After Title VII was made applicable to federal employment in 1972, see Equal Employment Opportunity Act, \u00a711, 86 Stat. Ill, the Civil Service Commission issued new regulations that prohibited discrimination in federal employment based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin (but not age), see 5 CFR \u00a7713.211 (1973), as well as \u201creprisals]\u201d prompted by complaints about such discrimination, \u00a7 713.262(a). When Congress enacted the ADEA\u2019s federal-sector provisions in 1974, respondent argues, Congress anticipated that the enactment of \u00a7 633a would prompt the Civil Service Commission to \u201cextend its existing reprisal regulations\u201d to cover age discrimination complaints and that Congress intended for the civil service process to provide the exclusive avenue for asserting retaliation claims. Brief for Respondent 27, 33, and n. 7. Respondent suggests that Congress took this approach because it believed that the civil service regulations \u201creflected] a distinct set of public policy concerns in the civil service sector.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Respondent cites no direct evidence that Congress actually took this approach;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> respondent\u2019s argument rests on nothing more than unsupported speculation. And, in any event, respondent\u2019s argument contradicts itself. If, as respondent maintains, \u201c[sjection 633a(a) does not confer an anti-retaliation right,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 9, then there is no reason to assume that Congress expected the Civil Service Commission to respond to the enactment of \u00a7 633a(a) by issuing new regulations prohibiting retaliation. On the contrary, if, as respondent maintains, Congress had declined to provide an antiretaliation right, then Congress presumably would have expected the Civil Service Commission to abide by that policy choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Respondent\u2019s final argument is that principles of sovereign immunity \u201crequire that Section 633a(a) be read narrowly as prohibiting substantive age discrimination, but not retaliation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 44. Respondent contends that the broad waiver of sovereign immunity in the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U. S. C. \u00a7401(1), is beside the point for present purposes because, for many federal agencies, the only provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>that waives sovereign immunity for ADEA claims is contained in \u00a7633a, and therefore this waiver provision \u201cmust be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign.\u201d Brief for Respondent 44 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nordic Village, Inc., </em>503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992); internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Respondent is of course correct that \u201c[a] waiver of the Federal Government\u2019s sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text\u201d and \u201cwill be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\u201d <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>518 U. S. 187, 192 (1996). But this rule of construction is satisfied here. Subsection (c) of \u00a7633a unequivocally waives sovereign immunity for a claim brought by \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved\u201d to remedy a violation of \u00a7 633a. Unlike \u00a7 633a(c), \u00a7 633a(a) is not a waiver of sovereign immunity; it is a substantive provision outlawing \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d That the waiver in \u00a7 633a(c) applies to \u00a7 633a(a) claims does not mean that \u00a7 633a(a) must surmount the same high hurdle as \u00a7 633a(c). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe, </em>537 U. S. 465,472-473 (2003) (where one statutory provision unequivocally provides for a waiver of sovereign immunity to enforce a separate statutory provision, that latter provision \u201c \u2018need not... be construed in the manner appropriate to waivers of sovereign immunity\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>463 U. S. 206, 218-219 (1983))). But in any event, even if \u00a7633a(a) must be construed in the same manner as \u00a7 633a(c), we hold, for the reasons previously explained, that \u00a7633a(a) prohibits retaliation with the requisite clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">For these reasons, we hold that \u00a7633a(a) prohibits retaliation against a federal employee who complains of age discrimination. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join as to all but Part I, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The Court today holds that the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act encompasses not only claims of age discrimination \u2014 which its language expressly provides \u2014 but also claims of retaliation for complaining about age discrimination \u2014 which its language does not. Protection against discrimination may include protection against retaliation for complaining about discrimination, but that is not always the case. The separate treatment of each in the private-sector provision of the ADEA makes that clear. In my view, the statutory language and structure, as well as the fact that Congress has always protected federal employees from retaliation through the established civil service process, confirm that Congress did not intend those employees to have a separate judicial remedy for retaliation under the ADEA. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Congress enacted the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, which at the time applied only to private employers, with the purpose of \u201cpromot[ing] employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age;... [of] prohibiting] arbitrary age discrimination in employment; [and of] helping] employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7621(b). The 1967 Act implemented this purpose in two principal ways. First, the statute made it unlawful for an employer to \u201cdiscriminate against any individual. . . because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d \u00a7 623(a)(1). Second, Congress enacted a specific antiretaliation provision, which made it \u201cunlawful for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment . . . because such individual . . . has opposed any practice made unlawful by this section, or because such individual... has made a charge, testified, assisted, or partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ipated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under\u201d the ADEA. \u00a7 623(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 (FLSA Amendments), \u00a7 28(b)(2), 88 Stat. 74, Congress (among other things) extended the ADEA to most Executive Branch employees by adopting 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 633a. Like its private-sector counterpart, this federal-sector provision includes a ban on discrimination on the basis of age. Unlike its private-sector counterpart, the federal-sector provision does <em>not </em>include a separate ban on retaliation. The federal-sector provision specifies only that \u201c[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age [in various federal agencies] shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.\u201d \u00a7 633a(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Despite the absence of an express retaliation provision in \u00a7 633a(a), the Court finds that the statute encompasses both discrimination and retaliation claims. To support this proposition, the Court principally relies on our decisions in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc., </em>396 U. S. 229 (1969), and <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed., </em>544 U. S. 167 (2005). In my view, the majority reads these cases for more than they are worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">As the majority correctly states, we held in <em>Sullivan </em>that 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1982, which prohibits race discrimination in the sale or rental of property, also provides a cause of action for retaliation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 396 U. S., at 237. More recently, we held in <em>Jackson </em>that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373 \u2014 which provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>eluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1681(a) \u2014 encompasses claims of retaliation for complaints about sex discrimination. 544 U. S., at 173-174.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">To the extent the majority takes from these precedents the principle that broad antidiscrimination provisions may also encompass an antiretaliation component, I do not disagree. That is why I am able to join today\u2019s opinion in <em>CBOCS West, Inc. </em>v. <em>Humphries, ante, </em>at 457 (holding that a retaliation claim is cognizable under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1981). But it cannot be \u2014 contrary to the majority\u2019s apparent view\u2014 that <em>any </em>time Congress proscribes \u201cdiscrimination based on X,\u201d it means to proscribe retaliation as well. That is clear from the private-sector provision of the ADEA, which includes a ban on \u201cdiscriminat[ion] against any individual . . . because of such individual\u2019s age,\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 623(a)(1), but <em>also </em>includes a separate (and presumably not superfluous) ban on retaliation, \u00a7 623(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Indeed, we made this precise observation in <em>Jackson </em>itself. The respondent in that case argued that Title IX\u2019s ban on discrimination could not include a cause of action for retaliation because Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, like the private-sector provision of the ADEA, includes discrete discrimination and retaliation provisions. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72000e-2 (discrimination), 2000e-3 (retaliation). We distinguished Title VII on the ground that \u201cTitle IX is a broadly written general prohibition on discrimination,\u201d while \u201cTitle VII spells out in greater detail the conduct that constitutes discrimination in violation of that statute.\u201d 544 U. S., at 175. Thus, while we distinguished Title VII from Title IX in <em>Jackson, </em>we also acknowledged that not every express ban on discrimination must be read as a ban on retaliation as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">What is more, although the majority asserts that <em>Jackson </em>rejected the view that \u201ca claim of retaliation is conceptually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>different from a claim of discrimination,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 481, we have since explained that antidiscrimination and antiretaliation provisions are indeed conceptually distinct, and serve distinct purposes. In <em>Burlington N. &amp; S. F. R. Co. </em>v. <em>White, </em>548 U. S. 53 (2006), we considered whether the antiretaliation provision in the Title VII private-sector provision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) \u2014 which is materially indistinguishable from that in the ADEA \u2014 applies \u201conly [to] those employer actions and resulting harms that are related to employment or the workplace.\u201d 548 U. S., at 61. In answering that question in the negative, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u201cThe antidiscrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their [protected] status. The antiretaliation provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee\u2019s efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act\u2019s basic guarantees. The substantive provision seeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are, <em>i. e., </em>their status. The antiretaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do, <em>i. e., </em>their conduct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 63 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">While I take from <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Jackson </em>the proposition that broad bans on discrimination, standing alone, may be read to include a retaliation component, the provision at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>issue here does not stand alone. And, as <em>Jackson </em>itself makes clear, see 544 U. S., at 173,175, \u201cthe words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme,\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Treasury, </em>489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989). Here the text and structure of the statute, the broader statutory scheme of which it is a part, and distinctions between federal- and private-sector employment convince me that \u00a7633a(a) does not provide a cause of action for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We have explained that \u201c[w]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d <em>Russello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). If, as the majority holds, the ban on \u201cdiscrimination based on age\u201d in \u00a7633a(a) encompasses both discrimination and retaliation claims, it is difficult to understand why Congress would have felt the need to specify in \u00a7 623 separate prohibitions against <em>both </em>\u201cdiscrimination]\u201d \u201cbecause of [an] individual\u2019s age,\u201d <em>and </em>retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The majority responds by noting that \u201c \u2018[negative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest\u2019 in those instances in which the relevant statutory provisions were \u2018considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 486 (quoting <em>Lindh </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>521 U. S. 320,330 (1997)). Here, the majority notes that \u00a7 623 was enacted in 1967, while \u00a7 633a was not passed until 1974. <em>Ante, </em>at 486. Fair enough, but while I do not quarrel with this principle as a general matter, I do not think it does the work the majority thinks it does. Congress obviously had the private-sector ADEA provision prominently before it when it enacted \u00a7 633a, because the same bill that included \u00a7633a also amended the private-sector provision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>See, <em>e. g., </em>\u00a7 28(a)(2), 88 Stat. 74 (amending the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 630(b) to include States and their political subdivisions). Indeed, it is quite odd to assume, as the majority does, see <em>ante, </em>at 485, 488, that the Congress that enacted \u00a7 633a was aware of and relied upon our decision in <em>Sullivan </em>\u2014 which, interpreted 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1982, a wholly unrelated provision \u2014 but was not attuned to its own work reflected in the differences between 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7623 and 633a. Even if the negative implication to be drawn from those differences may not be at its \u201cstrongest\u201d under these circumstances, it is certainly strong enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Moreover, and more to the point, we have relied on the differences in language between the federal- and private-sector provisions of the ADE A specifically in our interpretation of \u00a7 633a. In <em>Lehman </em>v. <em>Nakshian, </em>453 U. S. 156 (1981), we faced the question whether a person bringing an action under \u00a7 633a(c), alleging a violation of \u00a7 633a(a), was entitled to a trial by jury. In holding that there was no jury-trial right available against the Federal Government, we relied on the fact that while the ADEA\u2019s federal-sector provision did not include a provision for a jury trial, the analogous grant of a right of action in the private-sector provision, \u00a7 626(c), <em>\u201cexpressly </em>provides for jury trials.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 162. We reasoned that \u201cCongress accordingly demonstrated that it knew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial when it wished to do so elsewhere in the very \u2018legislation cited.\u2019... But in [\u00a7 633a(c)] it failed explicitly to do so.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Galloway </em>v. <em>United States, </em>319 U. S. 372, 389 (1943)). So too here. \u201cCongress . . . demonstrated that it knew how to\u201d provide a retaliation cause of action \u201cwhen it wished to do so elsewhere in the very \u2018legislation cited,\u2019 \u201d but \u201cfailed explicitly to do so\u201d in \u00a7 633a(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The majority argues that this inference is weakened by the fact that, in \u201cthe private-sector provision, Congress set out a specific list of forbidden employer practices,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 486-487, while \u00a7 633a(a) is a \u201cbroad, general ban on \u2018diserimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>nation based on age/ \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 488. This point cuts against the majority. Section 623 drew a distinction between prohibited \u201cemployer practices\u201d that discriminate based on age, and retaliation. See \u00a7\u00a7 623(a) (discriminatory \u201c[ejmployer practices\u201d), 623(d) (retaliation). Section 633a(a) phrased the prohibited discrimination in terms of \u201cpersonnel actions.\u201d Just as Congress did not regard retaliation as included within \u201cemployer practices,\u201d but dealt with it separately in \u00a7 623(d), the counterpart to \u201cemployer practices\u201d in \u00a7 633a\u2014 discriminatory \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d \u2014 should similarly not be read to include retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The argument that some meaning ought to attach to Congress\u2019s inclusion of an antiretaliation provision in \u00a7623 but not in \u00a7633a is further supported by several other factors. To begin with, Congress <em>expressly </em>made clear that the ADEA\u2019s private-sector provisions should not apply to their federal-sector counterpart, by providing that \u201c[ajny personnel action . . . referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall not be subject to, or affected by, any provision of\u201d the ADEA, except for one provision not relevant here. \u00a7 633a(f). The majority sees no \u201cmerit in respondent\u2019s reliance on 29 U. S. C. \u00a7633a(f).\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 488. But again, we relied on this very provision in <em>Lehman. </em>We explained that this subsection \u201cclearly emphasize[s] that [\u00a7633a] was self-contained and unaffected by other sections\u201d of the ADEA, 453 U. S., at 168, a fact that we used to support our holding that the federal-sector provision does not provide a right to a jury trial, even though the private-sector provision does. In short, Congress was aware that there were significant differences between the private- and federal-sector portions of the ADEA, and specified that no part of the former should be understood to have been implicitly imported into the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Other actions Congress took at the same time that it enacted \u00a7 633a in 1974 further underscore the point that Congress deliberately chose to exclude retaliation claims from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the ADEA\u2019s federal-sector provision. The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, as the Act\u2019s name suggests, dealt for the most part not with the ADEA, but with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, extending that statute\u2019s protections to federal employees. See FLSA Amendments, \u00a7 6(a)(2), 88 Stat. 58. In doing so, Congress explicitly subjected federal employers to the FLSA\u2019s express antiretaliation provision, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 215(a)(3). Congress did <em>not </em>similarly subject the Federal Government to the express antiretaliation provision in the ADEA, strongly suggesting that this was a conscious choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The majority responds that this \u201cinference ... is unfounded\u201d because \u201cCongress had good reason to expect that this broad ban would be interpreted in the same way that <em>Sullivan... </em>had interpreted the broad ban on racial discrimination in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1982.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 490, n. 6. Anything is possible, but again, it seems far more likely that Congress had its eye on the private-sector provision of the ADEA in crafting the federal one, rather than on one of our precedents on a different statute. See <em>supra, </em>at 496-497.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">But whatever the merits of this argument, it does not rebut the import of other probative provisions of the FLSA Amendments. In particular, Congress specifically chose in the FLSA Amendments to treat States and the Federal Government differently with respect to the ADEA itself. It subjected the former to the ADEA\u2019s private-sector provision, see FLSA Amendments, \u00a7 28(a)(2), 88 Stat. 74\u2014 including the express prohibition against retaliation in \u00a7 623(d) \u2014 while creating \u00a7633a as a stand-alone prohibition against discrimination in federal employment, without an antiretaliation provision, see \u00a7 28(b)(2), <em>ibid. </em>This decision evinces a deliberate legislative choice <em>not </em>to extend those portions of the ADEA\u2019s private-sector provisions that are not expressly included in \u00a7633a, as of course Congress specified in \u00a7 633a(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Given all this, it seems safe to say that the text and structure of the statute strongly support the proposition that Congress did not intend to include a cause of action for retaliation against federal employees in \u00a7 633a(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">But <em>why </em>would Congress allow retaliation suits against private-sector and state employers, but not against the Federal Government? The answer is that such retaliation was dealt with not through a judicial remedy, but rather the way retaliation in the federal workplace was typically addressed \u2014 through the established civil service system, with its comprehensive protection for Government workers. Congress was quite familiar with that detailed administrative system \u2014 one that already existed for most federal employees, but not for private ones. This approach, unlike the Court\u2019s, is consistent with the fact that Congress has recognized that regulation of the civil service is a complex issue, requiring \u201ccareful attention to conflicting policy considerations\u201d and \u201cbalancing governmental efficiency and the rights of employees,\u201d <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>462 U. S. 367, 388, 389 (1983). The resulting system often requires remedies different from those found to be appropriate for the private sector (or even for the States).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Before Title VII was extended to federal employees in 1972, discrimination in federal employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was prohibited by executive order. See Exec. Order No. 11478, 34 Fed. Reg. 12985 (1969). Civil service regulations implemented this policy by authorizing Executive Branch employees to bring administrative complaints for allegedly discriminatory acts, including \u201cpersonnel action[s],\u201d 5 CFR \u00a7\u00a7713.211, 713.214(a)(l)(i) (1972). These regulations further provided that such complainants, their representatives, and witnesses \u201cshall be free from restraint, interference, coercion, discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>nation, or reprisal\u201d for their involvement in the complaint process. \u00a7\u00a7 713.214(b) (complainants and representatives), 713.218(e) (witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The Civil Service Commission (CSC) promulgated a detailed scheme through which federal employees could vindicate these rights, including the express antiretaliation protections. More serious personnel actions, known as \u201cadverse actions,\u201d could be challenged before the employing agency and appealed to the CSC, see \u00a7\u00a7 713.219(a) and (b), 752.203, 771.202, 771.208, 771.222, while less serious personnel actions and \u201cany [other] matter of concern or dissatisfaction\u201d could be challenged under alternative procedures that were also appealable to the CSC, see \u00a7\u00a7 713.217(b), 713.218, 713.219(a) and (c), 713.231(a), 771.302(a). Retaliation was proscribed in all events. See, <em>e. g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 713.219(a) and (c) (incorporating Part 771 antiretaliation provisions to complaint procedures except certain appeals to the CSC); \u00a7\u00a7 771.105(a)(1) and (b)(1), 771.211(e) (antiretaliation provisions for CSC appeals).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In 1972, Congress applied Title VII to the federal sector, Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (EEO Act), \u00a7 11, 86 Stat. Ill, mandating that \u201c[a]ll personnel actions\u201d with respect to federal employees \u201cshall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-16(a). Congress empowered the CSC \u201cto enforce the provisions of subsection (a) of this section through appropriate remedies,\u201d and to \u201cissue such rules, regulations, orders and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities under this section.\u201d \u00a7 2000e-16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Under this grant of authority, as well as its prior authority under statute and executive order, the CSC revised its regulations both \u201cto implement the [EEO Act] and to strengthen the system of complaint processing.\u201d 37 Fed. Reg. 22717 (1972) (Part 713 Subpart B). As with its prior system of administrative enforcement, the CSC distinguished between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u201ccomplaints of discrimination on grounds of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\u201d 5 CFR \u00a7713.211 (1973), on the one hand, and charges by a \u201ccomplainant, his representative, or a witness who alleges restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination, or reprisal in connection with the presentation of a complaint,\u201d \u00a7 713.262(a), on the other. The regulations imposed upon employing agencies the obligation of \u201ctimely investigation and resolution of complaints including complaints of coercion and reprisal,\u201d 37 Fed. Reg. 22717; see also 5 CFR \u00a7 713.220, and made clear the procedures for processing retaliation claims, \u00a7\u00a7713.261, 713.262. The regulations further mandated that the CSC \u201crequire the [employing] agency to take whatever action is appropriate\u201d with respect to allegations of retaliation if the agency itself has \u201cnot completed an appropriate inquiry,\u201d \u00a7 713.262(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Thus, leading up to the enactment of 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 633a in 1974, the CSC\u2019s comprehensive regulatory scheme set forth a broadly applicable remedy for retaliation against federal employees for filing complaints or otherwise participating in the EEO process. And when Congress empowered the CSC in 1974 to \u201cenforce the provisions of [\u00a7 633a(a)] through appropriate remedies,\u201d and to \u201cissue such rules, regulations, orders, and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities\u201d under that statute, \u00a7 28(b)(2), 88 Stat. 75, the assumption that Congress expected the CSC to create an administrative antiretaliation remedy, just as it had for complaints of discrimination under Title VII, is compelling. And sure enough, the CSC did just that promptly after \u00a7 633a was enacted. See 39 Fed. Reg. 24351 (1974); 5 CFR \u00a7713.511 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Given this history of addressing retaliation through administrative means, combined with the complicated nature (relative to the private sector) of federal personnel practices, it is therefore by no means anomalous that Congress would have dealt with the \u201cprimary objective\u201d of combating age discrimination through a judicial remedy, <em>Burlington, </em>548 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>U. S., at 63, but left it to expert administrators used to dealing with personnel matters in the federal work force to \u201csecure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee\u2019s efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act\u2019s basic guarantees,\u201d <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The majority discounts the above argument as \u201cunsupported speculation.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 490. . It seems to me that the fact that the Executive Branch had always treated discrimination and retaliation as distinct, and that it enacted administrative remedies for retaliation almost immediately after the passage of the Title VII and ADEA federal-sector provisions, provide plenty of support. But even if the majority is right, the view that Congress intended to treat retaliation for age discrimination complaints as a problem to be dealt with primarily through administrative procedures, rather than through the judicial process in the first instance, is confirmed by Congress\u2019s passage of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), 92 Stat. 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The CSRA, as amended, has a detailed comprehensive antiretaliation provision, which generally makes it unlawful for Executive Branch employers to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">\u201ctake or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment because of . . . (A) the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation [or] (B) testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any right referred to in subparagraph (A).\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>This antiretaliation provision, which plainly applies to retaliation for exercising rights under the civil rights statutes, including the ADEA, is supported by a host of administrative remedies. If the alleged retaliation results in adverse actions such as removal, suspension for more than 14 days, or reduction in pay, see \u00a77512, an appeal can be taken directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), \u00a7\u00a7 7513(d), 7701, with judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, \u00a7 7703(b)(1). Retaliation claims based on less serious allegations are first investigated by the Office of Special Counsel. If the Office finds that there are reasonable grounds supporting the retaliation charge, it must report its determination to, and may seek corrective action from, the MSPB. \u00a7\u00a7 1214(a)(1)(A), (b)(2)(B), (C), and 1214(c). Again, judicial review in the Federal Circuit is available. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). In all events, upon a finding that retaliation has in fact occurred, the MSPB has the authority to order corrective action, \u00a7\u00a7 1214(b)(4), 7701(b)(2), to order attorney\u2019s fees on appeal, \u00a7 7701(g), and to discipline federal employees responsible for retaliatory acts, \u00a7 1215.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">To be sure, the CSRA was enacted after \u00a7 633a. Nevertheless, we have explained, in the same context of federal employee remedies, that the \u201cclassic judicial task of reconciling many laws enacted over time, and getting them to \u2018make sense\u2019 in combination, necessarily assumes that the implications of a statute may be altered by the implications of a later statute.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fausto, </em>484 U. S. 439, 453 (1988). That is precisely the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Indeed, this is particularly true with respect to Congress\u2019s regulation of federal employment. We have explained that the CSRA is an \u201cintegrated scheme of administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 445. Perhaps the CSRA\u2019s \u201ccivil service remedies [are] not as effective as an individual damages remedy\u201d that can be obtained in federal court, <em>Bush, </em>462 U. S., at 372, or perhaps a quicker and more familiar administrative remedy <em>is </em>more effective as a practical matter. That is not the issue. Cf. <em>id., </em>at 388 (the question whether a judicial remedy against a federal employer for a First Amendment violation should be implied \u201cobviously cannot be answered simply by noting that existing remedies do not provide complete relief for the plaintiff\u201d). The CSRA establishes an \u201celaborate, comprehensive scheme that encompasses substantive provisions forbidding arbitrary action by supervisors and procedures \u2014 administrative and judicial \u2014 by which improper action may be redressed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 385. Retaliation as a general matter was already addressed for federal employees. I would not read into \u00a7 633a a judicial remedy for retaliation when Congress\u2014 which has \u201cdeveloped considerable familiarity with balancing governmental efficiency and the rights of employees,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 389 \u2014 chose to provide a detailed administrative one.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The question whether a ban against \u201cdiscrimination based on\u201d a protected status such as age can also be read to encompass a ban on retaliation can be answered only after careful scrutiny of the particular provision in question. In this case, an analysis of the statutory language of \u00a7 633a and the broader scheme of which it is a part confirms that Congress did not intend implicitly to create a judicial remedy for retaliation against federal employees, when it did so expressly for private-sector employees. Congress was not sloppy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>creating this distinction; it did so for good reason: because the federal workplace is governed by comprehensive regulation, of which Congress was well aware, while the private sector is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">I join all but Part I of The Chief Justice\u2019s dissent. I write separately to reiterate my view that <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed., </em>544 U. S. 167 (2005), incorrectly conflated the concepts of retaliation and discrimination. The text of the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 is clear: It prohibits only \u201cdiscrimination based on age.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7633a(a). If retaliation is not \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of sex,\u201d <em>Jackson, supra, </em>at 185 (Thomas, J., dissenting), or \u201cdiscrimination based on race,\u201d <em>CBOCS West, Inc. </em>v. <em>Humphries, ante, </em>at 459 (Thomas, J., dissenting), it is certainly not \u201cdiscrimination based on age.\u201d Because \u00a7633a(a) provides no basis for implying a private right of action for retaliation claims, and its context only reaffirms its plain meaning, see <em>ante, </em>at 496-500 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.), I would affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\"> Suggesting that we have retreated from the reasoning of <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Jackson, </em>The Chief Justice, citing <em>Burlington N. &amp; S. F. R. Co. </em>v. <em>White, </em>548 U. S. 53, 63-65 (2006), states that \u201cwe have since explained that anti-discrimination and antiretaliation provisions are indeed conceptually distinct, and serve distinct purposes.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 495 (dissenting opinion). But as the Court explains today in <em>CBOCS West, Inc. </em>v. <em>Humphries, ante, </em>at 456, \u201c[i]n <em>Burlington </em>... we used the status/conduct distinction to help explain why Congress might have wanted its explicit Title VII antiretaliation provision to sweep more broadly <em>(i. e., </em>to include conduct <em>outside </em>the workplace) than its substantive Title VII (status-based) antidiscrimination provision. <em>Burlington </em>did not suggest th\u00e1t Congress must separate the two in all events.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> The situation here is quite different from that which we faced in <em>Lehman </em>v. <em>Nakshian, </em>453 U. S. 156 (1981), where both the private- and federal-sector provisions of the ADEA already existed and a single piece of legislation \u2014 the 1978 amendments to the ADEA \u2014 added a provision conferring a jury-trial right for private-sector ADEA suits but failed to include any similar provision for federal-sector suits. See Age Discrimination in Employment Act Amendments of 1978, \u00a7 4(a)(2), 92 Stat. 190.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\"> Section 623 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">\u201c(a) Employer practices</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">\u201c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">\u201c(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s age; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">\u201c(3) to reduce the wage rate of any employee in order to comply with this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\"> While the federal-sector provision of Title VII does not incorporate \u00a72000e-3(a), the federal-sector provision of Title VII does incorporate a remedial provision, \u00a72000e-5(g)(2)(A), that authorizes relief for a violation of \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Petitioner argues that this remedial provision shows that Congress meant for the Title VII federal-sector provision\u2019s broad prohibition of \u201cdiscrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\u201d to reach retaliation because otherwise there would be no provision banning retaliation in the federal sector and thus no way in which relief for retaliation could be awarded. Brief for Petitioner 20. The Federal Government, however, has declined to take a position on the question whether Title VII bans retaliation in federal employment, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, and that issue is not before us in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b550-10\"> The Government\u2019s theory that the absence of a provision specifically banning federal-sector retaliation gives rise to the inference that \u00a7 633a(a) does not ban retaliation would lead logically to the strange conclusion that \u00a7 633a(a) also does not forbid age-discriminatory job notices and advertisements because \u00a7633a(a), unlike \u00a7 623(e), fails to mention such practices expressly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\"> Respondent asks us to infer that \u00a7 633a(a) does not proscribe retaliation because, when Congress made the ADEA applicable to the Federal Government, Congress did not simply subject the Federal Government to the ADEA\u2019s private-employment provisions by amending the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d to include the United States. Respondent contends that a similar inference may be drawn from the fact that in 1974 Congress added to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) a provision specifically making it unlawful to retaliate against an employee for attempting to vindicate FLSA rights. See \u00a7 215(a)(3). These arguments fail to appreciate the significance of \u00a7 633a(a)\u2019s broad prohibition of \u201cdiscrimination based on age.\u201d Because Congress had good reason to expect that this broad ban would be interpreted in the same way that <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc., </em>392 U. S. 657 (1968) <em>(per curiam), </em>had interpreted the broad ban on racial discrimination in 42 U. S.

S. 167 (2005). Compare <em>id., </em>at 176, and n. 1, with <em>id., </em>at 194 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Whatever the merits of this disagreement, I accept <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>(and the Court\u2019s) interpretation as a matter of <em>stare decisis. </em>See <em>CBOCS West, Inc. </em>v. <em>Humphries, ante, </em>at 447.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\"> The Court views this discussion of <em>Burlington </em>as \u201c[suggesting that [the Court has] retreated from the reasoning of <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Jackson.\u201d Ante, </em>at 481, n. 1. Not a bit. The discussion simply points out what <em>Burlington </em>plainly said: that there is a distinction between discrimination and retaliation claims. That does not mean Congress cannot address both in the same provision, as we held it did in <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Jackson </em>and as we hold today it did in <em>CBOCS West, Inc., ante, </em>at 457.
