S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The question in this case is whether driving under the influence of alcohol is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as the Act defines it. We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Federal law prohibits a previously convicted felon from possessing a firearm. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000 ed.). A related provision provides for a prison term of up to 10 years for an ordinary offender. \u00a7 924(a)(2). The Armed Career Criminal Act imposes a more stringent 15-year mandatory minimum sentence on an offender who has three prior convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">The Act defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">\u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>\u201c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We here consider whether driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), as set forth in New Mexico\u2019s criminal statutes, falls within the scope of the second clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The relevant background circumstances include the following: In September 2004, New Mexico police officers received a report that Larry Begay, the petitioner here, had threatened his sister and aunt with a rifle. The police arrested him. Begay subsequently conceded he was a felon and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1). Begay\u2019s presentence report said that he had been convicted a dozen times for DUI, which under New Mexico\u2019s law becomes a felony (punishable by a prison term of more than one year) the fourth (or subsequent) time an individual commits it. See N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 66-8-102(G) to (J) (Supp. 2007). The sentencing judge consequently found that Begay had at least three prior convictions for a crime \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d 377 F. Supp. 2d 1141,1143 (NM 2005). The judge also concluded that Begay\u2019s \u201cthree felony DUI convictions involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1145, The judge consequently concluded that Begay had three or more prior convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d and should receive a sentence that reflected a mandatory minimum prison term of 15 years. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Begay, claiming that DUI is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the terms of the statute, appealed. The Court of Appeals panel by a vote of 2 to 1 rejected that claim. 470 F. 3d 964 (CA10 2006). Begay sought certiorari, and we agreed to decide the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">New Mexico\u2019s DUI statute makes it a crime (and a felony-after three earlier convictions) to \u201cdrive a vehicle within [the] state\u201d if the driver \u201cis under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d (or has an alcohol concentration of .08 or more in his blood or breath within three hours of having driven the vehicle resulting from \u201calcohol consumed before or while driving the vehicle\u201d). \u00a7\u00a766-8-102(A), (C). In determining whether this crime is a violent felony, we consider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine it in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>495 U. S. 575, 602 (1990) (adopting this \u201ccategorical approach\u201d); see also <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>550 U. S. 192, 208-209 (2007) (attempted burglary is a violent felony even if, on <em>some </em>occasions, it can be committed in a way that poses no serious risk of physical harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">We also take as a given that DUI does not fall within the scope of the Act\u2019s <em>clause (i) </em>\u201cviolent felony\u201d definition. DUI, as New Mexico defines it, nowhere \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Finally, we assume that the lower courts were right in concluding that DUI involves conduct that \u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Drunk driving is an extremely dangerous crime. In the United States in 2006, alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes claimed the lives of more than 17,000 individuals and harmed untold amounts of property. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., Traffic Safety Facts, 2006 Traffic Safety Annual Assessment \u2014 Alcohol-Related Fatalities 1 (No. 810821, Aug. 2007), http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/ Pubs/810821.PDF (as visited Apr. 11, 2008, and available in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Even so, we find that DUI falls outside the scope of clause (ii). It is simply too unlike the provision\u2019s listed examples for us to believe that Congress intended the provision to cover it.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In our view, the provision\u2019s listed examples \u2014 burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives\u2014 illustrate the kinds of crimes that fall within the statute\u2019s scope. Their presence indicates that the statute covers only <em>similar </em>crimes, rather than <em>every </em>crime that \u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). If Congress meant the latter, <em>i. e., </em>if it meant the statute to be all encompassing, it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all. Without them, clause (ii) would cover <em>all </em>crimes that present a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Additionally, if Congress meant clause (ii) to include <em>all </em>risky crimes, why would it have included clause (i)? A crime which has as an element the \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d against the person (as clause (i) specifies) is likely to create \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury\u201d and would seem to fall within the scope of clause (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Of course, Congress <em>might </em>have included the examples solely for quantitative purposes. Congress might have intended them to demonstrate no more than the degree of risk sufficient to bring a crime within the statute\u2019s scope. But were that the case, Congress would have likely chosen examples that better illustrated the \u201cdegree of risk\u201d it had in mind. Our recent case, <em>James </em>v. <em>United States </em>\u2014 where we considered only matters of degree, <em>i. e., </em>whether the amount of risk posed by attempted burglary was comparable to the amount of risk posed by the example crime of burglary\u2014 illustrates the difficulty of interpreting the examples in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>respect. Compare 550 U. S., at 203-207, with <em>id., </em>at 215, 218-219, 229 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Indeed, the examples are so far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses that it is difficult to accept clarification in respect to degree of risk as Congress\u2019 only reason for including them. See <em>id., </em>at 229 (\u201cCongress provided examples [that]... have little in common, most especially with respect to the level of risk of physical injury that they pose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">These considerations taken together convince us that, \u201c To give effect... to every clause and word\u2019 \u201d of this statute, we should read the examples as limiting the crimes that clause (ii) covers to crimes that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves. <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>533 U. S. 167,174 (2001) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Menasche, </em>348 U. S. 528,538-539 (1955); some internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Leocal </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>543 U. S. 1,12 (2004) (describing the need to interpret a statute in a way that gives meaning to each word).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The concurrence complains that our interpretive approach is insufficiently specific. See <em>post, </em>at 150-151 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). But the concurrence\u2019s own approach demands a crime-by-crime analysis, uses a standard of measurement (comparative degree of risk) that even the concurrence admits is often \u201cunclear,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 151, requires the concurrence to turn here to the still less clear \u201crule of lenity,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 153, and, as we explain, is less likely to reflect Congress\u2019 intent. See, <em>e. g., post, </em>at 153-154 (recognizing inability to measure quantitative seriousness of risks associated with DUI).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The statute\u2019s history offers further support for our conclusion that the examples in clause (ii) limit the scope of the clause to crimes that are similar to the examples themselves. Prior to the enactment of the current language, the Act applied its enhanced sentence to offenders with \u201cthree previous convictions for robbery or burglary.\u201d <em>Taylor, supra, </em>at 581 (internal quotation marks omitted). Congress sought t<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>expand that definition to include both crimes against the person (clause (i)) and certain physically risky crimes against property (clause (ii)). See H. R. Rep. No. 99-849, p. 3 (1986) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). When doing so, Congress rejected a broad proposal that would have covered <em>every </em>offense that involved a substantial risk of the use of \u201c\u2018physical force against the person or property of another.\u2019\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U. S., at 583 (quoting S. 2312, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986); H. R. 4639, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986)). Instead, it added the present examples. And in the relevant House Report, it described clause (ii) as including \u201cState and Federal felonies against property such as burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives and <em>similar </em>crimes as predicate offenses where the conduct involved presents a serious risk of injury to a person.\u201d H. R. Rep., at 5 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Of course, the statute places the word \u201cotherwise,\u201d just after the examples, so that the provision covers a felony that is one of the example crimes \u201cor <em>otherwise </em>involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). But we cannot agree with the Government that the word \u201cotherwise\u201d is <em>sufficient </em>to demonstrate that the examples do not limit the scope of the clause. That is because the word \u201cotherwise\u201d <em>can </em>(we do not say <em>must, </em>cf. <em>post, </em>at 151 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)) refer to a crime that is similar to the listed examples in some respects but different in others \u2014 similar, say, in respect to the degree of risk it produces, but different in respect to the \u201cway or manner\u201d in which it produces that risk. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1598 (1961) (defining \u201cotherwise\u201d to mean \u201cin a different way or manner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In our view, DUI differs from the example crimes \u2014 burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives \u2014 in at least one pertinent, and important, respect. The listed crimes all typically involve purposeful, \u201cviolent,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>and \u201caggressive\u201d conduct. 470 F. 3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part); see, <em>e. g., Taylor, supra, </em>at 598 (\u201cburglary\u201d is an unlawful or unprivileged entry into a building or other structure with \u201cintent to commit a crime\u201d); ALI Model Penal Code \u00a7220.1(1) (1985) (\u201carson\u201d is causing a fire or explosion with \u201cthe purpose of,\u201d <em>e. g., </em>\u201cdestroying a building... of another\u201d or \u201cdamaging any property ... to collect insurance\u201d); <em>id., </em>\u00a7223.4 (extortion is \u201cpurposely\u201d obtaining property of another through threat of, <em>e. g., </em>inflicting \u201cbodily injury\u201d); <em>Leocal, supra, </em>at 9 (the word \u201c \u2018use\u2019... most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct\u201d which fact helps bring it outside the scope of the statutory term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d). That conduct is such that it makes more likely that an offender, later possessing a gun, will use that gun deliberately to harm a victim. Crimes committed in such a purposeful, violent, and aggressive manner are \u201cpotentially more dangerous when firearms are involved.\u201d 470 F. 3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part). And such crimes are \u201ccharacteristic of the armed career criminal, the eponym of the statute.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">By way of contrast, statutes that forbid driving under the influence, such as the statute before us, typically do not insist on purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct; rather, they are, or are most nearly comparable to, crimes that impose strict liability, criminalizing conduct in respect to which the offender need not have had any criminal intent at all. The Government argues that \u201cthe knowing nature of the conduct that produces intoxication combined with the inherent recklessness of the ensuing conduct more than suffices\u201d to create an element of intent. Brief for United States 35. And we agree with the Government that a drunk driver may very well drink on purpose. But this Court has said that, unlike the example crimes, the conduct for which the drunk driver is convicted (driving under the influence) need not be purposeful or deliberate. See <em>Leocal, supra, </em>at 11 (a DUI offense involves \u201caccidental or negligent conduct\u201d); see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>470 F. 3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part) (\u201c[D]runk driving is a crime of negligence or recklessness, rather than violence or aggression\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A6j\">When viewed in terms of the Act\u2019s basic purposes, this distinction matters considerably. As suggested by its title, the Armed Career Criminal Act focuses upon the special danger created when a particular type of offender \u2014 a violent criminal or drug trafficker \u2014 possesses a gun. See <em>Taylor, supra, </em>at 587-588; 470 F. 3d, at 981, n. 3 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part) (\u201c[T]he title [of the Act] was not merely decorative\u201d). In order to determine which offenders fall into this category, the Act looks to past crimes. This is because an offender\u2019s criminal history is relevant to the question whether he is a career criminal, or, more precisely, to the kind or degree of danger the offender would pose were he to possess a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In this respect \u2014 namely, a prior crime\u2019s relevance to the possibility of future danger with a gun \u2014 crimes involving intentional or purposeful conduct (as in burglary and arson) are different from DUI, a strict-liability crime. In both instances, the offender\u2019s prior crimes reveal a degree of callousness toward risk, but in the former instance they also show an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger. We have no reason to believe that Congress intended a 15-year mandatory prison term where that increased likelihood does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Were we to read the statute without this distinction, its 15-year mandatory minimum sentence would apply to a host of crimes which, though dangerous, are not typically committed by those whom one normally labels \u201carmed career criminals.\u201d See, <em>e.g., </em>Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 8-4-103(a)(2)(A)(ii) (2007) (reckless polluters); 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1319(c)(1) (individuals who negligently introduce pollutants into the sewer system); 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1365(a) (individuals who recklessly tamper with consumer products); \u00a71115 (seamen whose inattention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>duty causes serious accidents). We have no reason to believe that Congress intended to bring within the statute\u2019s scope these kinds of crimes, far removed as they are from the deliberate kind of behavior associated with violent criminal use of firearms. The statute\u2019s use of examples (and the other considerations we have mentioned) indicate the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The dissent\u2019s approach, on the other hand, would likely include these crimes within the statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony,\u201d along with any other crime that can be said to present a \u201c\u2018potential risk of physical injury.\u2019\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 156 (opinion of Alito, J.). And it would do so because it believes such a result is compelled by the statute\u2019s text. See <em>post, </em>at 155. But the dissent\u2019s explanation does not account for a key feature of that text \u2014 namely, the four example crimes intended to illustrate what kind of \u201cviolent felony\u201d the statute covers. The dissent at most believes that these examples are relevant only to define the requisite serious risk associated with a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 158-159. But the dissent does not explain how to identify the requisite level of risk, nor does it describe how these various examples might help determine what other offenses involve conduct presenting the same level of risk. If they were in fact helpful on that score, we might expect more predictable results from a purely risk-based approach. Compare <em>post, </em>at 148, 153-154 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), with <em>post, </em>at 156-158 (dissenting opinion). Thus, the dissent\u2019s reliance on these examples for a function they appear incapable of performing reads them out of the statute and, in so doing, fails to effectuate Congress\u2019 purpose to punish only a particular subset of offender, namely, career criminals.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The distinction we make does not minimize the seriousness of the risks attached to driving under the influence. Nor does our argument deny that an individual with a criminal history of DUI might later pull the trigger of a gun. (Indeed, we may have such an instance before us. 470 F. 3d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>at 965.) Rather, we hold only that, for purposes of the particular statutory provision before us, a prior record of DUI, a strict-liability crime, differs from a prior record of violent and aggressive crimes committed intentionally such as arson, burglary, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives. The latter are associated with a likelihood of future violent, aggressive, and purposeful \u201carmed career criminal\u201d behavior in a way that the former are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We consequently conclude that New Mexico\u2019s crime of \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d falls outside the scope of the Armed Career Criminal Act\u2019s clause (ii) \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition. And we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in relevant part and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b210-7\">Justice Scalia,</author>\n<p id=\"AGp\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The statute in this case defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d in part as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that... is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Contrary to the Court, I conclude that the residual clause unambiguously encompasses <em>all </em>crimes that present a serious risk of injury to another. But because I cannot say that drunk driving clearly poses such a risk (within the meaning of the statute), the rule of lenity brings me to concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Last Term, in <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>550 U. S. 192 (2007), the Court held that attempted burglary qualifies as a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e). It concluded that to determine whether a predicate crime falls under the residual clause, a court should first identify the enumerated crime to which the predicate crime is most closely analogous and then decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>whether the risk posed by the predicate crime is roughly equivalent to the risk posed by the enumerated crime. Because burglary was the enumerated crime most closely analogous to attempted burglary, and attempted burglary in the Court\u2019s judgment posed roughly the same risk of physical injury as burglary, attempted burglary qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e). See <em>id., </em>at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Unfortunately, the Court\u2019s approach in deciding that case provided no guidance for deciding future cases that involve predicate crimes other than attempted burglary, particularly those for which there are no clear analogs among the enumerated crimes. Pointing out that problem in dissent, I anticipated this very case: \u201cIs, for example, driving under the influence of alcohol more analogous to burglary, arson, extortion, or a crime involving use of explosives?\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">My dissent set out a different approach to the statute. In my view, the best way to interpret \u00a7 924(e) is first to determine which of the enumerated offenses poses the least serious risk of physical injury, and then to set that level of risk as the \u201cserious potential risk\u201d required by the statute. Crimes that pose at least that serious a risk of injury are encompassed by the residual clause; crimes that do not are excluded. In my judgment, burglary was the least risky crime among the enumerated offenses, and I therefore concluded that attempted burglary, which is less risky than burglary, is not covered by the residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The Court held otherwise in <em>James, </em>and since this is a statutory case that holding has a strong claim to <em>stare decisis. </em>But the concomitant of the sad fact that the theory of <em>James </em>has very limited application is the happy fact that its <em>stare decisis </em>effect is very limited as well. It must be followed, I presume, for unenumerated crimes that are analogous to enumerated crimes <em>(e. g., </em>attempted arson). It provides no answer, and suggests no approach to an answer, where, as here, the predicate crime has no analog among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the enumerated crimes. For such cases I would therefore adhere to the principles I set forth in my <em>James </em>dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Today the Court devises a different way to give concrete meaning to the residual clause. Confronted with a predicate crime that has no obvious analog among the enumerated offenses, the Court engrafts a requirement onto the residual clause that a predicate crime involve \u201cpurposeful, \u2018violent/ and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 144-145. By doing so, it excludes a slew of crimes from the scope of the residual clause, including (not by happenstance) the crime at issue here, drunk driving. Like <em>James, </em>this latest made-for-the-case improvisation does not (as my resolution does) provide a complete framework that will embrace all future cases. There are still many crimes that are not analogous to the enumerated crimes (so that their status cannot be resolved by James) but do involve \u201cpurposeful, \u2018violent/ and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct\u201d (so that their status cannot be resolved by today\u2019s <em>deus ex machina). </em>Presumably some third (and perhaps fourth and fifth) gimmick will be devised to resolve those cases \u00e1s they arise, leaving our brethren on the district courts and courts of appeals much room for enjoyable speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">But quite apart from its regrettable continuation of a piecemeal, suspenseful, Scrabble-like approach to the interpretation of this statute, the problem with the Court\u2019s holding today is that it is not remotely faithful to the statute that Congress wrote. There is simply no basis (other than the necessity of resolving the present case) for holding that the enumerated and unenumerated crimes must be similar in respects <em>other than the degree of risk that they pose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The Court is correct that the clause \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d signifies a similarity between the enumerated and unenumerated crimes. It is not, however, <em>any </em>old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>similarity, such as (to take a random example) \u201cpurposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct.\u201d Rather, it is the <em>particular </em>similarity specified after the <em>\u201cotherwise\u201d </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that they all pose a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. They need not be similar in any other way. As the Court correctly notes, the word \u201cotherwise\u201d in this context means \u201c \u2018in a different way or manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 144; see also <em>James, </em>550 U. S., at 218 (Scalia, J., dissenting); Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1729 (2d ed. 1957) (\u201cin another way, or in other ways\u201d). Therefore, by using the word \u201cotherwise\u201d the writer draws a substantive connection between two sets only on one specific <em>dimension </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>whatever follows \u201cotherwise.\u201d What that means here is that \u201ccommitting one of the enumerated crimes ... is <em>one way </em>to commit a crime \u2018involving] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u2019; and that <em>other ways </em>of committing a crime of that character similarly constitute \u2018violent felon[ies].\u2019\u201d <em>James, supra, </em>at 218 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The Court rejects this seemingly straightforward statutory analysis, reading the residual clause to mean that the unenumerated offenses must be similar to the enumerated offenses not only in the degree of risk they pose, but also \u201cin kind,\u201d despite the fact that \u201cotherwise\u201d means that the <em>common </em>element of risk must be presented \u201c \u2018in a <em>different </em>way or manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 143,144 (emphasis added). The Court\u2019s explanation for this interpretation seems to be that the enumerated crimes are \u201cso far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses that it is difficult to accept clarification in respect to degree of risk as Congress\u2019 only reason for including them.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 143. While I certainly agree that the degree of risk associated with the enumerated crimes is unclear, I find it unthinkable that the solution to that problem is to write a different statute. The phrase \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d limits inclusion in the statute only by a crime\u2019s degree of risk. See <em>James, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>supra, </em>at 218 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The use of the adjective \u201cserious\u201d seems to me to signify a purely quantitative measure of risk. If both an intentional and a negligent crime pose a 50% risk of death, could one be characterized as involving a \u201cserious risk\u201d and the other not? Surely not.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The Court supports its argument with that ever-ready refuge from the hardships of statutory text, the (judicially) perceived statutory purpose. According to the Court, because the Armed Career Criminal Act is concerned with \u201cthe special danger created when a particular type of offender \u2014 a violent criminal or drug trafficker \u2014 possesses a gun,\u201d the statutory purpose favors applying \u00a7924(e)\u2019s enhanced penalty only to those criminals \u201cwho might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 146. I cannot possibly infer that purpose from the statute. For all I know, the statute was meant to punish those who are indifferent to human life, or who are undeterred by the criminal penalties attached to the commission of other crimes (after all, the statute enhances penalties for drug traffickers, see \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)). While the Court\u2019s asserted purpose would surely be a reasonable one, it has no more grounding in the statutory text than do these other possibilities. And what is more, the Court\u2019s posited purpose is positively contradicted by the fact that one of the enumerated crimes\u2014 the unlawful use of explosives \u2014 may involve merely negligent or reckless conduct. See ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 220.2(2) (1985) (\u201cA person is guilty of a misdemeanor if he recklessly creates a risk of catastrophe in the employment of fire, explosives or other dangerous means\u201d); <em>id., </em>\u00a7220.3 (\u201cA person is guilty of criminal mischief if he . . . damages tangible property of another purposely, recklessly, or by negligence in the employment of fire, explosives, or other dangerous means\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The Court says that an interpretation of the residual clause that includes all crimes posing a serious risk of injury would render superfluous \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), which provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>that a \u201cviolent felony\u201d is any crime that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person\u201d of another. <em>Ante, </em>at 142 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the canon against surplusage has substantially less force when it comes to interpreting a broad residual clause like the one at issue here. Though the second clause renders the first superfluous, it would raise no eyebrows to refer to \u201ccrimes that entail the use of force and crimes that, while not entailing the use of force, nonetheless present a serious risk of injury to another person.\u201d In any event, the canon against surplusage merely helps decide between competing permissible interpretations of an ambiguous statute; it does not sanction writing in a requirement that Congress neglected to think of. And finally, come to think of it, the Court\u2019s solution does nothing whatever to solve the supposed surplusage problem. Crimes that include as an element \u201cthe use ... of physical force against the person of another\u201d are all embraced (and the. reference to them thus rendered superfluous) by the requirement of \u201cpurposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct\u201d that the Court invents.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Under my interpretation of \u00a7 924(e), I must answer one question: Does drunk driving pose at least as serious a risk of physical injury to another as burglary? From the evidence presented by the Government, I cannot conclude so. Because of that, the rule of lenity requires that I resolve this case in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The Government cites the fact that in 2006,17,062 persons died from alcohol-related car crashes, and that 15,121 of those deaths involved drivers with blood-alcohol concentrations of 0.08 or higher. See Brief for United States 17. Drunk driving is surely a national problem of great concern. But the fact that it kills many people each year tells us very little about whether a single act of drunk driving \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>jury to another.\u201d It may well be that an even greater number of deaths occurs annually to pedestrians crossing the street; but that hardly means that crossing the street presents a serious potential risk of injury. Where the issue is \u201crisk,\u201d the annual number of injuries from an activity must be compared with the annual incidents of the activity. Otherwise drunk driving could be said to pose a more serious risk of physical harm than murder. In addition, drunk driving is a combination of two activities: (1) drinking and (2) driving. If driving alone results in injury in a certain percentage of cases, it could hardly be said that the entirety of the risk posed by drunk driving can be attributed to the combination. And finally, injuries to the drunk drivers themselves must be excluded from the calculus, because the statute counts only injuries to other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Needless to say, we do not have these relevant statistics. And even if we did, we would still need to know similar statistics for burglary, which are probably even harder to come by. This does not mean that I will never be able to identify a crime that falls under the residual clause. For some crimes, the severity of the risk will be obvious. Crimes like negligent homicide, see ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7210.4 (1980), conspiracy to commit a violent crime, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 5.03 (1985), inciting to riot, 18 U. S. C. \u00a72101, and the production of chemical weapons, \u00a7229, certainly pose a more serious risk of physical injury to others than burglary. (By contrast, the Court\u2019s approach eliminates from the residual clause all negligent crimes, even those that entail a 100% risk of physical injury such as negligent homicide.) But I can do no more than guess as to whether drunk driving poses a more serious risk than burglary, and I will not condemn a man to a minimum of 15 years in prison on the basis of such speculation. See <em>Ladner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958). Applying the rule of lenity to a statute that demands it, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Justice Alito, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Thomas join,</author>\n<p id=\"AIgs\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The statutory provision at issue in this ease \u2014 the so-called \u201cresidual clause\u201d of 18 U.

Unfortunately, the Court\u2019s interpretation simply cannot be reconciled with the statutory text, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In September 2004, after a night of heavy drinking, petitioner pointed a rifle at his aunt and threatened to shoot if she did not give him money. When she replied that she did not have any money, petitioner repeatedly pulled the trigger, but the rifle was unloaded and did not fire. Petitioner then threatened his sister in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">At the time of this incident, petitioner was a convicted felon. He had 12 prior convictions in New Mexico for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). While DUI is generally a misdemeanor under New Mexico law, the offense of DUI after at least three prior DUI convictions is a felony requiring a sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a766-8-102(G) (Supp. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Petitioner pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). A violation of that provision generally carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years, see \u00a7 924(a)(2), but the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that petitioner was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years because he had at least three prior convictions for the New Mexico felony of DUI after being convicted of DUI on at least three prior occasions. 377 F. Supp. 2d 1141,1143-1145 (NM 2005); 470 F. 3d 964, 966-975, 977 (CA10 2006). The lower courts concluded that these offenses were crimes \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d and \u201cinvolve[d] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>conduct that presented] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The Court does not hold that the maximum term of imprisonment that petitioner faced on his felony DUI convictions was less than one year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor does the Court dispute that petitioner\u2019s offenses involved a \u201cpotential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The only remaining question, therefore, is whether the risk presented by petitioner\u2019s qualifying DUI felony convictions was \u201cserious,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>\u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cimportant.\u201d See, <em>e. g., </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2073 (2002) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s); 15 Oxford English Dictionary 15 (def. 6(a)) (2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter OED). In my view, it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Statistics dramatically show that driving under the influence of alcohol is very dangerous. Each year, approximately 15,000 fatal alcohol-related crashes occur, accounting for roughly 40% of all fatal crashes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Approximately a quarter million people are injured annually in alcohol-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>crashes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The number of people who are killed each year by drunk drivers is far greater than the number of murders committed during any of the crimes specifically set out in the statutory provision at issue here, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) \u2014 burglary, arson, extortion, and offenses involving the use of explosives.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Petitioner\u2019s qualifying offenses, moreover, fell within the statute only because he had been convicted of DUI on at least three prior occasions. As noted, petitioner had <em>a dozen </em>prior DUI convictions. Persons who repeatedly drive drunk present a greatly enhanced danger that they and others will be injured as a result.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, it has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>estimated that the ratio of DUI incidents to DUI arrests is between 250 to 1 and 2,000 to l.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the risk presented by a 10th, 11th, and 12th DUI conviction may be viewed as the risk created by literally thousands of drunk-driving events. That risk was surely \u201cserious,\u201d and therefore petitioner\u2019s offenses fell squarely within the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Moreover, taking the statutory language to mean what it says would not sweep in all DUI convictions. Most DUI convictions are not punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year and thus fall outside the scope of the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s convictions qualified only because of his extraordinary \u2014 and, I would say, extraordinarily dangerous \u2014 record of drunk driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The Court holds that an offense does not fall within the residual clause unless it is \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risked posed,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 143, to the crimes specifically listed in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), <em>i. e., </em>burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving the use of explosives. These crimes, according to the Court, \u201call typically involve purposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 144-145 (quoting 470 F. 3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">This interpretation cannot be squared with the text of the statute, which simply does not provide that an offense must be \u201cpurposeful,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d or \u201caggressive\u201d in order to fall within the residual clause. Rather, after listing burglary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>arson, extortion, and explosives offenses, the statute provides (in the residual clause) that an offense qualifies if it \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Therefore, offenses falling within the residual clause must be similar to the named offenses in one respect only: They must \u201cotherwise\u201d \u2014 which is to say, \u201cin a different manner,\u201d 10 OED 984 (def. B(l)); see also Webster\u2019s 1598 \u2014 \u201cinvolv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Requiring that an offense must also be \u201cpurposeful,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d or \u201caggressive\u201d amounts to adding new elements to the statute, but we \u201cordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.\u201d <em>Bates </em>v. <em>United States, </em>522 U. S. 23, 29 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Each part of this additional, judicially added requirement presents other problems as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"><em>Purposeful. </em>At least one State\u2019s DUI law requires proof of purposeful conduct. See <em>Tam </em>v. <em>State, </em>232 Ga. App. 15, 15-16, 501 S. E. 2d 51, 52 (1998) (requiring proof of the intent to drive). In addition, many States recognize involuntary intoxication as a defense. See 4 R. Essen &amp; R. Erwin, Defense of Drunk Driving Cases: Criminal \u2014 Civil \u00a7 44.04 (2007). And even in States that do not require purposefulness, I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of DUI defendants purposefully drank before getting behind the wheel and were purposefully operating their vehicles at the time of apprehension. I suspect that many DUI statutes do not require proof of purposefulness because the element is almost always present, requiring proof of the element would introduce an unnecessary complication, and it would make no sense to preclude conviction of those defendants who were so drunk that they did not even realize that they were behind the wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\"><em>Violent. </em>It is clear that 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) is not limited to \u201cviolent\u201d crimes, for if it were, it would be redun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>dant. The prior subparagraph, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A), includes offenses that have as an element the use or threatened use of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\"><em>Aggressive. </em>The concept of \u201caggressive\u201d crimes is vague, and in any event, it is hardly apparent why DUI \u2014 not to mention the species of felony DUI recidivism that resulted in petitioner\u2019s predicament \u2014 is not \u201caggressive.\u201d Driving can certainly involve \u201caggressive\u201d conduct. Indeed, some States have created the offense of \u201caggressive driving.\u201d See M. Savage, M. Sundeen, <em>&amp; </em>A. Teigen, Transportation Series, Traffic Safety and Public Health: State Legislative Action 2007, p. 17, and App. J (NCSL, No. 32, Dec. 2007), online at http.7/www.ncsl.org/print/transportation/ 07trafficsafety.pdf. Most States have a toll-free telephone number to call to report \u201caggressive\u201d driving. See Campaign Safe &amp; Sober, Phone Numbers for Reporting Impaired, Aggressive, or Unsafe Driving, online at http://www.nhtsa. dot.gov/people/outreach/safesobr/16qp/phone.html.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The Court defends its new statutory element on the ground that a defendant who merely engages in felony drunk driving is not likely to be \u201cthe kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 146. The Court cites no empirical support for this conclusion, and its accuracy is not self-evident. Petitioner\u2019s pattern of behavior may or may not be typical of those defendants who have enough DUI convictions to qualify under N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a766-8-102(G) and 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), but the example of his behavior in this case \u2014 pointing a gun at his aunt\u2019s head and repeatedly pulling the trigger \u2014 should surely be enough to counsel against uncritical rebane\u00e9 on stereotypes about \u201cthe type\u201d of people who commit felony DUI violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Defendants who qualify for an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) based (in whole or in part) on felony DUI convictions share at least three characteristics that are relevant for present purposes. First, they are per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>sons who, in the judgment of Congress, cannot be trusted to use a firearm responsibly. In order to qualify for an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e), a defendant must of course be convicted of violating the felon-in-possession statute, \u00a7 922(g) (2000 ed.). The felon-in-possession statute necessarily rests on the judgment that a person with a prior felony conviction cannot be trusted with a firearm. See <em>Caron </em>v. <em>United States, </em>524 U. S. 308, 315 (1998) (\u201cCongress meant to keep guns away from all offenders who, the Federal Government feared, might cause harm . . . \u201d). And there is no dispute that a prior felony DUI conviction qualifies as a felony under the felon-in-possession law. If Congress thought that a person with a prior felony DUI conviction is not \u201cthe kind of person\u201d who is likely to use a gun unlawfully, why would Congress have made it a crime for such a person to possess a gun?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Second, defendants with DUI convictions that are counted under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) are likely to have serious alcohol abuse problems. As previously mentioned, ordinary DUI convictions are generally not counted under \u00a7 924(e) because they are not punishable by imprisonment for more than a year. Such penalties are generally reserved for persons, like petitioner, with a record of repeated DUI violations. See NCSL, <em>supra. </em>Such individuals are very likely to have serious alcohol abuse problems and a propensity to engage in irresponsible conduct while under the influence. Alcohol use often precedes violent crimes, see, <em>e. g., </em>Roizen, Epidemiological Issues in Alcohol-Related Violence, in 13 Recent Developments in Alcoholism 7, 8-9 (M. Galanter ed. 1997), and thus there is reason to worry about the misuse of firearms by defendants whose alcohol abuse problems are serious enough to result in felony DUI convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Third, defendants with DUI convictions that are counted under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) have either (1) such serious alcohol abuse problems that they have at least three prior felony DUI convictions or (2) both one or two felony DUI convictions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>one or two offenses that fall under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) (offenses that have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d) or that are specifically set out in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (burglary, arson, extortion, or an explosives offense). Defendants with three felony DUI convictions are likely to be super-DUI-recidivists like petitioner. Defendants with a combination of felony DUI and other qualifying convictions \u2014 for example, convictions for assault or burglary \u2014 are persons who, even by the Court\u2019s lights, could be classified as \u201cthe kind of person who might deliberately point [a] gun and pull the trigger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Unlike the Court, I cannot say that persons with these characteristics are less likely to use a gun illegally than are persons convicted of other qualifying felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Justice Scalia\u2019s concurrence takes a different approach, but his analysis is likewise flawed. Justice Scalia would hold (1) that an offense does not fall within the residual clause unless it presents a risk that is at least as great as that presented by the least dangerous of the enumerated offenses; (2) that burglary is the least dangerous of the enumerated offenses; (3) that the relevant measure of risk is the risk that the typical burglary, DUI, etc., would result in injury; and (4) that the risk presented by an incident of DUI is less than the risk presented by a burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Justice Scalia, like the Court, does not follow the statutory language. The statute says that offenses falling within the residual clause must present \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d The statute does not say that these offenses must present at least as much risk as the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The statute also does not say, as Justice Scalia would hold, that the relevant risk is the risk that each incident of DUI will result in injury. I see no basis for concluding that Congress was not also concerned with the risk faced by potential victims, particularly since the statute explicitly refers to \u201cpotential risk.\u201d Drunk driving is regarded as a severe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>societal problem in large me\u00e1sure because of the very large number of victims it produces each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Finally, Justice Scalia\u2019s conclusion that burglary is the least risky of the enumerated offenses is based on a proerustean reading of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This provision refers, without qualification, to \u201cextortion.\u201d In his dissent in <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>550 U.

Only by finding that the term \u201cextortion\u201d in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) really means only certain forms of extortion was Justice Scalia able to come to the conclusion that burglary is the least risky of the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">For all these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Tenth Circuit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\"> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>now pending before the Court, presents the question \u201c[w]hether a state drug-trafficking offense, for which state law authorized a ten-year sentence because the defendant was a recidivist, qualifies as a predicate offense under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.

See Dept, of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports/Crime in the United States (Annual Reports 1996-2006), online at http://www. fbi.gov/uer/ucr.htm#cius. While murders committed in the course of extortion were not separately reported, common sense and the fact that the total number of murders was similar to the number of fatal alcohol-related crashes at least after 1997 indicates that murders involving extortion would not rival deaths in alcohol-related auto accidents. Even if one were to expand beyond murders to all fatalities and even injuries, it is estimated that arson causes the relatively small number of 475 deaths and over 2,000 injuries annually.
