Second Amended Complaint in No. l:05-CV-0634-SEB-VSS (SD Ind.), pp. 6-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">After discovery, District Judge Barker prepared a comprehensive 70-page opinion explaining her decision to grant defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. 458 F. Supp. 2d 775 (SD Ind. 2006). She found that petitioners had \u201cnot introduced evidence of a single, individual Indiana resident who will be unable to vote as a result of SEA 483 or who will have his or her right to vote unduly burdened by its requirements.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 783. She rejected \u201cas utterly incredible and unreliable\u201d an expert\u2019s report that up to 989,000 registered voters in Indiana did not possess either a driver\u2019s license or other acceptable photo identification. <em>Id., </em>at 803. She estimated that as of 2005, when the statute was enacted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>around 43,000 Indiana residents lacked a state-issued driver\u2019s license or identification card. <em>Id., </em>at 807.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 472 F. 3d 949 (CA7 2007). The majority first held that the Democrats had standing to bring a facial challenge to the constitutionality of SEA 483. Next, noting the absence of any plaintiffs who claimed that the law would deter them from voting, the Court of Appeals inferred that \u201cthe motivation for the suit is simply that the law may require the Democratic Party and the other organizational plaintiffs to work harder to get every last one of their supporters to the polls.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 952. It rejected the argument that the law should be judged by the same strict standard applicable to a poll tax because the burden on voters was offset by the benefit of reducing the risk of fraud. The dissenting judge, viewing the justification for the law as \u201chollow\u201d \u2014 more precisely as \u201ca not-too-thinly-veiled attempt to discourage election-day turnout by certain folks believed to skew Democratic\u201d\u2014 would have applied a stricter standard, something he described as \u201cclose to \u2018strict scrutiny light.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 954, 956 (opinion of Evans, J.). In his view, the \u201claw imposes an undue burden on a recognizable segment of potential eligible voters\u201d and therefore violates their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. <em>Id., </em>at 956-957.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Four judges voted to grant a petition for rehearing en banc. 484 F. 3d 436, 437 (CA7 2007) (Wood, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Because we agreed with their assessment of the importance of these cases, we granted certiorari. 551 U. S. 1192 (2007). We are, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>persuaded that the District Court and the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the evidence in the record is not sufficient to support a facial attack on the validity of the entire statute, and thus affirm.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Virginia Bd. of Elections, </em>383 U. S. 663 (1966), the Court held that Virginia could not condition the right to vote in a state election on the payment of a poll tax of $1.50. We rejected the dissenters\u2019 argument that the interest in promoting civic responsibility by weeding out those voters who did not care enough about public affairs to pay a small sum for the privilege of voting provided a rational basis for the tax. See <em>id., </em>at 685 (opinion of Harlan, J.). Applying a stricter standard, we concluded that a State \u201cviolates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment whenever it makes the affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 666 (opinion of the Court). We used the term \u201cinvidiously discriminate\u201d to describe conduct prohibited under that standard, noting that we had previously held that while a State may obviously impose \u201creasonable residence restrictions on the availability of the ballot,\u201d it \u201cmay not deny the opportunity to vote to a bona fide resident merely because he is a member of the armed services.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 666-667 (citing <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Rash, </em>380 U. S. 89, 96 (1965)). Although the State\u2019s justification for the tax was rational, it was invidious because it was irrelevant to the voter\u2019s qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Thus, under the standard applied in <em>Harper, </em>even rational restrictions on the right to vote are invidious if they are unrelated to voter qualifications. In <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>460 U. S. 780 (1983), however, we confirmed the general rule that \u201cevenhanded restrictions that protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself\u201d are not invidious and satisfy the standard set forth in <em>Harper. </em>460 U. S., at 788, n. 9. Rather than applying any \u201clitmus test\u201d that would neatly separate valid from invalid restrictions, we concluded that a court must identify and evaluate the interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule, and then make the \u201chard judgment\u201d that our adversary system demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In later election cases we have followed <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>balancing approach. Thus, in <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>502 U. S. 279, 288-289 (1992), after identifying the burden Illinois imposed on a political party\u2019s access to the ballot, we \u201ccalled for the demonstration of a corresponding interest sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation,\u201d and concluded that the \u201csevere restriction\u201d was not justified by a narrowly drawn state interest of compelling importance. Later, in <em>Burdick </em>v. <em>Takuslni, </em>504 U. S. 428 (1992), we applied <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>standard for \u201c \u2018reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions,\u2019 \u201d 504 U. S., at 434, and upheld Hawaii\u2019s prohibition on write-in voting despite the fact that it prevented a significant number of \u201cvoters from participating in Hawaii elections in a meaningful manner,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 443 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). We reaffirmed <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>requirement that a court evaluating a constitutional challenge to an election regulation weigh the asserted injury to the right to vote against the \u201c\u2018precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.\u2019 \u201d 504 U. S., at 434 (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>460 U. S., at 789).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>In neither <em>Norman </em>nor <em>Burdick </em>did we identify any litmus test for measuring the severity of a burden that a state law imposes on a political party, an individual voter, or a discrete class of voters. However slight that burden may appear, as <em>Harper </em>demonstrates, it must be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests \u201csufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.\u201d <em>Norman, </em>502 U. S., at 288-289. We therefore begin our analysis of the constitutionality of Indiana\u2019s statute by focusing on those interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The State has identified several state interests that arguably justify the burdens that SEA 488 imposes on voters and potential voters. While petitioners argue that the statute was actually motivated by partisan concerns and dispute both the significance of the State\u2019s interests and the magnitude of any real threat to those interests, they do not question the legitimacy of the interests the State has identified. Each is unquestionably relevant to the State\u2019s interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The first is the interest in deterring and detecting voter fraud. The State has a valid interest in participating in a nationwide effort to improve and modernize election procedures that have been criticized as antiquated and inefficient.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The State also argues that it has a particular interest in preventing voter fraud in response to a problem that is in part the product of its own maladministration \u2014 namely, that Indiana\u2019s voter registration rolls include a large number of names of persons who are either deceased or no longer live in Indiana. Finally, the State relies on its interest in safeguarding voter confidence. Each of these interests merits separate comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\n<em>Election Modernization</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Two recently enacted federal statutes have made it necessary for States to reexamine their election procedures. Both contain provisions consistent with a State\u2019s choice to use government-issued photo identification as a relevant source of information concerning a citizen\u2019s eligibility to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), 107 Stat. 77,42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1973gg <em>et seq., </em>Congress established procedures that would both increase the number of registered voters and protect the integrity of the electoral process. \u00a71973gg. The statute requires state motor vehicle driver\u2019s license applications to serve as voter registration applications. \u00a71973gg-3. While that requirement has increased the number of registered voters, the statute also contains a provision restricting States\u2019 ability to remove names from the lists of registered voters. \u00a7 1973gg~6(a)(3). These protections have been partly responsible for inflated lists of registered voters. For example, evidence credited by Judge Barker estimated that as of 2004 Indiana\u2019s voter rolls were inflated by as much as 41.4%, see 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 793, and data collected by the Election Assistance Committee in 2004 indicated that 19 of 92 Indiana counties had registration totals exceeding 100% of the 2004 voting-age population, Dept. of Justice Complaint in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>No. l:06-cv-1000-RLY-TAB (SD Ind., June 27, 2006), p. 4, App. 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In HAVA, Congress required every State to create and maintain a computerized statewide list of all registered voters. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 15483(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V). HAVA also requires the States to verify voter information contained in a voter registration application and specifies either an \u201capplicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license number\u201d or \u201cthe last 4 digits of the applicant\u2019s social security number\u201d as acceptable verifications. \u00a7 15483(a)(5)(A)(i). If an individual has neither number, the State is required to assign the applicant a voter identification number. \u00a7 15483(a)(5)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>HAVA also imposes new identification requirements for individuals registering to vote for the first time who submit their applications by mail. If the voter is casting his ballot in person, he must present local election officials with written identification, which may be either \u201ca current and valid photo identification\u201d or another form of documentation such as a bank statement or paycheck. \u00a7 15483(b)(2)(A). If the voter is voting by mail, he must include a copy of the identification with his ballot. A voter may also include a copy of the documentation with his application or provide his driver\u2019s license number or Social Security number for verification. \u00a7 15483(b)(3). Finally, in a provision entitled \u201cFail-safe voting,\u201d HAVA authorizes the casting of provisional ballots by challenged voters. \u00a7 15483(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Of course, neither HAVA nor NVRA required Indiana to enact SEA 483, but they do indicate that Congress believes that photo identification is one effective method of establishing a voter\u2019s qualification to vote and that the integrity of elections is enhanced through improved technology. That conclusion is also supported by a report issued shortly after the enactment of SEA 483 by the Commission on Federal Election Reform chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, which is a part of the record in these cases. In the introduction to their discussion of voter identification, they made these pertinent comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201cA good registration list will ensure that citizens are only registered in one place, but election officials still need to make sure that the person arriving at a polling site is the same one that is named on the registration list. In the old days and in small towns where everyone knows each other, voters did not need to identify themselves. But in the United States, where 40 million people move each year, and in urban areas where some people do not even know the people living in their own</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>apartment building let alone their precinct, some form of identification is needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">\u201cThere is no evidence of extensive fraud in U. S. elections or of multiple voting, but both occur, and it could affect the outcome of a close election. The electoral system cannot inspire public confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of voters. Photo [identification cards] currently are needed to board a plane, enter federal buildings, and cash a check. Voting is equally important.\u201d Building Confidence in U. S. Elections \u00a72.5 (Sept. 2005), App. 136-137 (Carter-Baker Report) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>Voter Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The only kind of voter fraud that SEA 483 addresses is in-person voter impersonation at polling places. The record contains no evidence of any such fraud actually occurring in Indiana at any time in its history. Moreover, petitioners argue that provisions of the Indiana Criminal Code punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ing such conduct as a felony provide adequate protection against the risk that such conduct will occur in the future. It remains true, however, that flagrant examples of such fraud in other parts of the country have been documented throughout this Nation\u2019s history by respected historians and journalists,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that occasional examples have surfaced in recent years,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that Indiana\u2019s own experience with fraudulent voting in the 2003 Democratic primary for East Chicago Mayor<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014 though perpetrated using absentee ballots and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>in-person fraud \u2014 demonstrate that not only is the risk of voter fraud real but that it could affect the outcome of a close election.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">There is no question about the legitimacy or importance of the State\u2019s interest in counting only the votes of eligible voters. Moreover, the interest in orderly administration and accurate recordkeeping provides a sufficient justification for carefully identifying all voters participating in the election process. While the most effective method of preventing election fraud may well be debatable, the propriety of doing so is perfectly clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In its brief, the State argues that the inflation of its voter rolls provides further support for its enactment of SEA 483. The record contains a November 5, 2000, newspaper article asserting that as a result of NVRA and \u201csloppy record-keeping,\u201d Indiana\u2019s lists of registered voters included the names of thousands of persons who had either moved, died, or were not eligible to vote because they had been convicted of felonies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The conclusion that Indiana has an unusually inflated list of registered voters is supported by the entry of a consent decree in litigation brought by the Federal Government alleging violations of NVRA. Consent Decree and Order in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>No. l:06-cv-1000-RLYTAB (SD Ind., June 27, 2006), App. 299-307. Even though Indiana\u2019s own negligence may have contributed to the serious inflation of its registration lists when SEA 483 was enacted, the fact of inflated voter rolls does provide a neutral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>and nondiscriminatory reason supporting the State\u2019s decision to require photo identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\n<em>Safeguarding Voter Confidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Finally, the State contends that it has an interest in protecting public confidence \u201cin the integrity and legitimacy of representative government.\u201d Brief for State Respondents 53. While that interest is closely related to the State\u2019s interest in preventing voter fraud, public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process has independent significance, because it encourages citizen participation in the democratic process. As the Carter-Baker Report observed, the \u201c 'electoral system cannot inspire public confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of voters.\u2019\u201d <em>Supra, </em>at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">States employ different methods of identifying eligible voters at the polls. Some merely check off the names of registered voters who identify themselves; others require voters to present registration cards or other documentation before they can vote; some require voters to sign their names so their signatures can be compared with those on file; and in recent years an increasing number of States have relied primarily on photo identification.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A photo identification requirement imposes some burdens on voters that other methods of identification do not share. For example, a voter may lose his photo identification, may have his wallet stolen on the way to the polls, or may not resemble the photo in the identification because he recently grew a beard. Burdens of that sort arising from life\u2019s vagaries, however, are neither so serious nor so frequent as to raise any question about the constitutionality of SEA 483; the availability of the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>cast a provisional ballot provides an adequate remedy for problems of that character.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The burdens that are relevant to the issue before us are those imposed on persons who are eligible to vote but do not possess a current photo identification that complies with the requirements of SEA 483.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The fact that most voters already possess a valid driver\u2019s license, or some other form of acceptable identification, would not save the statute under our reasoning in <em>Harper, </em>if the State required voters to pay a tax or a fee to obtain a new photo identification. But just as other States provide free voter registration cards, the photo identification cards issued by Indiana\u2019s BMV are also free. For most voters who need them, the inconvenience of making a trip to the BMV, gathering the required documents, and posing for a photograph surely does not qualify as a substantial burden on the right to vote, or even represent a significant increase over the usual burdens of voting.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Both evidence in the record and facts of which we may take judicial notice, however, indicate that a somewhat heavier burden may be placed on a limited number of persons. They include elderly persons born out of State, who may have difficulty obtaining a birth certificate;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> persons who because of economic or other personal limitations may find it difficult either to secure a copy of their birth certificate or to assemble the other required documentation to obtain a state-issued identification; homeless persons; and persons with a religious objection to being photographed. If we assume, as the evidence suggests, that some members of these classes were registered voters when SEA 483 was enacted, the new identification requirement may have imposed a special burden on their right to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The severity of that burden is, of course, mitigated by the fact that, if eligible, voters without photo identification may cast provisional ballots that will ultimately be counted. To do so, however, they must travel to the circuit court clerk\u2019s office within 10 days to execute the required affidavit. It is unlikely that such a requirement would pose a constitutional problem unless it is wholly unjustified. And even assuming that the burden may not be justified as to a few voters,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>conclusion is by no means sufficient to establish petitioners\u2019 right to the relief they seek in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Given the fact that petitioners have advanced a broad attack on the constitutionality of SEA 483, seeking relief that would invalidate the statute in all its applications, they bear a heavy burden of persuasion. Only a few weeks ago we held that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had failed to give appropriate weight to the magnitude of that burden when it sustained a preelection, facial attack on a Washington statute regulating that State\u2019s primary election procedures. <em>Washington State Grange </em>v. <em>Washington State Republican Party, </em>552 U. S. 442 (2008). Our reasoning in that case applies with added force to the arguments advanced by petitioners in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Petitioners ask this Court, in effect, to perform a unique balancing analysis that looks specifically at a small number of voters who may experience a special burden under the statute and weighs their burdens against the State\u2019s broad interests in protecting election integrity. Petitioners urge us to ask whether the State\u2019s interests justify the burden imposed on voters who cannot afford or obtain a birth certificate and who must make a second trip to the circuit court clerk\u2019s office after voting. But on the basis of the evidence in the record it is not possible to quantify either the magnitude of the burden on this narrow class of voters or the portion of the burden imposed on them that is fully justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">First, the evidence in the record does not provide us with the number of registered voters without photo identification; Judge Barker found petitioners\u2019 expert\u2019s report to be \u201cutterly incredible and unreliable.\u201d 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 803. Much of the argument about the numbers of such voters comes from extrarecord, postjudgment studies, the accuracy of which has not been tested in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Further, the deposition evidence presented in the District Court does not provide any concrete evidence of the burden imposed on voters who currently lack photo identification. The record includes depositions of two case managers at a day shelter for homeless persons and the depositions of members of the plaintiff organizations, none of whom expressed a personal inability to vote under SEA 483. A deposition from a named plaintiff describes the difficulty the elderly woman had in obtaining an identification card, although her testimony indicated that she intended to return to the BMV since she had recently obtained her birth certificate and that she was able to pay the birth certificate fee. App. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Judge Barker\u2019s opinion makes reference to six other elderly named plaintiffs who do not have photo identifications, but several of these individuals have birth certificates or were born in Indiana and have not indicated how difficult it would be for them to obtain a birth certificate. 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 797-799. One elderly named plaintiff stated that she had attempted to obtain a birth certificate from Tennessee, but had not been successful, and another testified that he did not know how to obtain a birth certificate from North Carolina. The elderly in Indiana, however, may have an easier time obtaining a photo identification card than the non-elderly, see n. 17, <em>supra, </em>and although it may not be a completely acceptable alternative, the elderly in Indiana are able to vote absentee without presenting photo identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The record says virtually nothing about the difficulties faced by either indigent voters or voters with religious objections to being photographed. While one elderly man stated that he did not have the money to pay for a birth certificate, when asked if he did not have the money or did not wish to spend it, he replied, \u201cboth.\u201d App. 211-212. From this limited evidence we do not know the magnitude of the impact SEA 483 will have on indigent voters in Indiana. The record does contain the affidavit of one homeless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>woman who has a copy of her birth certificate, but was denied a photo identification card because she did not have an address. <em>Id., </em>at 67. But that single affidavit gives no indication of how common the problem is.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">In sum, on the basis of the record that has been made in this litigation, we cannot conclude that the statute imposes \u201cexcessively burdensome requirements\u201d on any class of voters. See <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>415 U. S. 724, 738 (1974).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A facial challenge must fail where the statute has a \u201c \u2018 \u201cplainly legitimate sweep.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Washington State Grange, </em>552 U. S., at 449 (citing and quoting <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U. S. 702, 739-740, and n. 7 (1997) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgments)). When we consider only the statute\u2019s broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>application to all Indiana voters, we conclude that it \u201cimposes only a limited burden on voters\u2019 rights.\u201d <em>Burdick, </em>504 U. S., at 439. The \u201c \u2018precise interests\u2019 \u201d advanced by the State are therefore sufficient to defeat petitioners\u2019 facial challenge to SEA 483. <em>Id., </em>at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Finally we note that petitioners have not demonstrated that the proper remedy \u2014 even assuming an unjustified burden on some voters \u2014 would be to invalidate the entire statute. When evaluating a neutral, nondiscriminatory regulation of voting procedure, \u201c[w]e must keep in mind that \u2018 \u201c[a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people.\u201d\u2019 <em>Ayotte </em>v. <em>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., </em>546 U. S. 320, 329 (2006) (quoting <em>Began </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>468 U. S. 641, 652 (1984) (plurality opinion)).\u201d <em>Washington State Grange, </em>552 U. S., at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In their briefs, petitioners stress the fact that all of the Republicans in the General Assembly voted in favor of SEA 483 and the Democrats were unanimous in opposing it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In her opinion rejecting petitioners\u2019 facial challenge, Judge Barker noted that the litigation was the result of a partisan dispute that had \u201cspilled out of the state house into the courts.\u201d 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 783. It is fair to infer that partisan considerations may have played a significant role in the decision to enact SEA 483. If such considerations had provided the only justification for a photo identification requirement, we may also assume that SEA 483 would suffer the same fate as the poll tax at issue in <em>Harper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>But if a nondiscriminatory law is supported by valid neutral justifications, those justifications should not be disregarded simply because partisan interests may have provided one motivation for the votes of individual legislators. The state interests identified as justifications for SEA 483 are both neutral and sufficiently strong to require us to reject petitioners\u2019 facial attack on the statute. The application of the statute to the vast majority of Indiana voters is amply justified by the valid interest in protecting \u201cthe integrity and reliability of the electoral process.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>460 U.

First, the fact that the District Judge estimated that when the statute was passed in 2005, 43,000 citizens did not have photo identification, see 458 F. Supp. 2d 775, 807 (SD Ind. 2006), tells us nothing about the number of free photo identification cards issued since then. Second, the fact that public transportation is not available in some Indiana counties tells us nothing about how often elderly and indigent citizens have an opportunity to obtain a photo identification at the BMV, either during a routine outing with family or friends or during a special visit to the BMV arranged by a civic or political group such as the League of Women Voters or a political party. Further, nothing in the record establishes the distribution of voters who lack photo identification. To the extent that the evidence sheds any light on that issue, it suggests that such voters reside primarily in metropolitan areas, which are served by public transportation in Indiana (the majority of the plaintiffs reside in Indianapolis and several of the organizational plaintiffs are Indianapolis organizations). Third, the indigent, elderly, or disabled need not \u201ctravel all the way to their county seats every time they wish to vote,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 236, if they obtain a free photo identification card from the BMV.

S. 351, 358 (1997); <em>Clingman </em>v. <em>Beaver, </em>544 U. S. 581, 586-587 (2005). \u201c[S]trict scrutiny is appropriate only if the burden is severe.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 592. Thus, the first step is to decide whether a challenged law severely burdens the right to vote. Ordinary and widespread burdens, such as those requiring \u201cnominal effort\u201d of everyone, are not severe. See <em>id., </em>at 591, 593-597. Burdens are severe if they go beyond the merely inconvenient. See <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>415 U. S. 724, 728-729 (1974) (characterizing the law in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>393 U. S. 23 (1968), as \u201csevere\u201d because it was \u201cso burdensome\u201d as to be \u201c \u2018virtually impossible\u2019 \u201d to satisfy).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Of course, we have to identify a burden before we can weigh it. The Indiana law affects different voters differently, <em>ante, </em>at 198-199, but what petitioners view as the law\u2019s several light and heavy burdens are no more than the different <em>impacts </em>of the single burden that the law uniformly imposes on all voters. To vote in person in Indiana, <em>everyone </em>must have and present a photo identification that can be obtained for free. The State draws no classifications, let alone discriminatory ones, except to establish <em>optional </em>absentee and provisional balloting for certain poor, elderly, and institutionalized voters and for religious objectors. Nor are voters who already have photo identifications exempted from the burden, since those voters must maintain the accuracy of the information displayed on the identifications, renew them before they expire, and replace them if they are lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The Indiana photo-identification law is a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation, and our precedents refute the view that individual impacts are relevant to determining the severity of the burden it imposes. In the course of concluding that the Hawaii laws at issue in <em>Burdick </em>\u201cim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>pose[d] only a limited burden on voters\u2019 rights to make free choices and to associate politically through the vote,\u201d 504 U. S., at 439, we considered the laws and their reasonably foreseeable effect on <em>voters generally. </em>See <em>id., </em>at 436-437. We did not discuss whether the laws had a severe effect on Mr. Burdick\u2019s own right to vote, given his particular circumstances. That was essentially the approach of the <em>Burdick </em>dissenters, who would have applied strict scrutiny to the laws because of their effect on \u201csome voters.\u201d See <em>id., </em>at 446 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); see also <em>id., </em>at 448 (\u201cThe majority\u2019s analysis ignores the inevitable and significant burden a write-in ban imposes upon <em>some individual voters </em>. . . \u201d (emphasis added)). Subsequent cases have followed <em>Bur-dick\u2019s </em>generalized review of nondiscriminatory election laws. See, <em>e. g., Timmons, supra, </em>at 361-362; <em>Clingman, </em>544 U. S., at 590-591 (plurality opinion); <em>id., </em>at 592-593 (opinion of the Court). Indeed, <em>Clingman\u2019s </em>holding that burdens are not severe if they are ordinary and widespread would be rendered meaningless if a single plaintiff could claim a severe burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Not all of our decisions predating <em>Burdick </em>addressed whether a challenged voting regulation severely burdened the right to vote, but when we began to grapple with the magnitude of burdens, we did so categorically and did not consider the peculiar circumstances of individual voters or candidates. See, <em>e. g., Jenness </em>v. <em>Fortson, </em>403 U. S. 431, 438-441 (1971). Thus, in <em>Rosario </em>v. <em>Rockefeller, </em>410 U. S. 752 (1973), we did not link the State\u2019s interest in inhibiting party raiding with the petitioners\u2019 own circumstances. See <em>id., </em>at 760-762. And in <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>we observed that the severity of the burden of a regulation should be measured according to its \u201cnature, extent, and <em>likely impact.\u201d Id., </em>at 738 (emphasis added). We therefore instructed the District Court to decide on remand whether \u201ca <em>reasonably diligent </em>independent candidate [could] be expected to satisfy the signature requirements, or will it be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>only rarely that the unaffiliated candidate will succeed in getting on the ballot?\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 742 (emphasis added). Notably, we did not suggest that the District Court should consider whether one of the petitioners would actually find it more difficult than a reasonably diligent candidate to obtain the required signatures. What mattered was the general assessment of the burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Insofar as our election-regulation cases rest upon the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, see <em>Anderson, </em>460 U. S., at 786, n. 7, weighing the burden of a nondiscriminatory voting law upon each voter and concomitantly requiring exceptions for vulnerable voters would effectively turn back decades of equal-protection jurisprudence. A voter complaining about such a law\u2019s effect on him has no valid equal-protection claim because, without proof of discriminatory intent, a generally applicable law with disparate impact is not unconstitutional. See, <em>e. g., Washington </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>426 U. S. 229, 248 (1976). The Fourteenth Amendment does not regard neutral laws as invidious ones, <em>even when their burdens purportedly fall disproportionately on a protected class. A fortiori </em>it does not do so when, as here, the classes complaining of disparate impact are not even protected.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>448 U. S. 297, 323, and n. 26 (1980) (poverty); <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>473 U. S. 432, 442 (1985) (disability); <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>501 U.

S. 872, 878-879 (1990) (First Amendment does not require exceptions for religious objectors to neutral rules of general applicability).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Even if I thought that <em>stare decisis </em>did not foreclose adopting an individual-focused approach, I would reject it as an original matter. This is an area where the dos and don\u2019ts need to be known in advance of the election, and voter-by-voter examination of the burdens of voting regulations would prove especially disruptive. A case-by-case approach naturally encourages constant litigation. Very few new election regulations improve everyone\u2019s lot, so the potential allegations of severe burden are endless. A State reducing the number of polling places would be open to the complaint it has violated the rights of disabled voters who live near the closed stations. Indeed, it may even be the case that some laws already on the books are especially burdensome for some voters, and one can predict lawsuits demanding that a State adopt voting over the Internet or expand absentee balloting.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">That sort of detailed judicial supervision of the election process would flout the Constitution\u2019s express commitment of the task to the States. See Art. I, \u00a74. It is for state legislatures to weigh the costs and benefits of possible changes to their election codes, and their judgment must prevail unless it imposes a severe and unjustified overall burden upon the right to vote, or is intended to disadvantage a particular class. Judicial review of their handiwork must apply an objective, uniform standard that will enable them to determine, <em>ex ante, </em>whether the burden they impose is too severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The lead opinion\u2019s record-based resolution of these cases, which neither rejects nor embraces the rule of our precedents, provides no certainty, and will embolden litigants who surmise that our precedents have been abandoned. There is no good reason to prefer that course.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The universally applicable requirements of Indiana\u2019s voter-identification law are eminently reasonable. The burden of acquiring, possessing, and showing a free photo identification is simply not severe, because it does not \u201ceven represent a significant increase over the usual burdens of voting.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 198. And the State\u2019s interests, <em>ante, </em>at 191-197, are sufficient to sustain that minimal burden. That should end the matter. That the State accommodates some voters by permitting (not requiring) the casting of absentee or provisional ballots, is an indulgence \u2014 not a constitutional imperative that falls short of what is required.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-6\">A number of our early right-to-vote decisions, purporting to rely upon the Equal Protection Clause, strictly scrutinized nondiseriminatory voting laws requiring the payment of fees. See, <em>e. g., Harper </em>v. <em>Virginia Bd. of Elections, </em>383 U. S. 663, 670 (1966) (poll tax); <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>405 U. S. 134,145 (1972) (ballot-access fee); <em>Lubin </em>v. <em>Panish, </em>415 U. S. 709, 716-719 (1974) (ballot-access fee). To the extent those decisions continue to stand for a principle that <em>Burdick </em>v. <em>Takushi, </em>504 U. S. 428 (1992), does not already encompass, it suffices to note that we have never held that legislatures must calibrate <em>all </em>election laws, even those totally unrelated to money, for their impacts on poor voters or must otherwise accommodate wealth disparities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b271-5\">Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,</author>\n<p id=\"AtP\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Indiana\u2019s \u201cVoter ID Law\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> threatens to impose nontrivial burdens on the voting right of tens of thousands of the State\u2019s citizens, see <em>ante, </em>at 198-199 (lead opinion), and a significant percentage of those individuals are likely to be deterred from voting, see <em>ante, </em>at 199. The statute is unconstitutional under the balancing standard of <em>Burdick </em>v. <em>Ta~ kushi, </em>504 U. S. 428 (1992): a State may not burden the right to vote merely by invoking abstract interests, be they legitimate, see <em>ante, </em>at 191-197, or even compelling, but must make a particular, factual showing that threats to its interests outweigh the particular impediments it has imposed. The State has made no such justification here, and as to some aspects of its law, it has hardly even tried. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s judgment sustaining the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_c\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\">Voting-rights cases raise two competing interests, the one side being the fundamental right to vote. See <em>Burdick, supra, </em>at 433 (\u201cIt is beyond cavil that \u2018voting is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Illinois Bd. of Elections </em>v. <em>Socialist Workers Party, </em>440 U. S. 173, 184 (1979))); see also <em>Purcell </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>549 U. S. 1, 3-4 (2006) <em>(per curiam); Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein, </em>405 U. S. 330, 336 (1972); <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>377 U. S. 533, 561-562 (1964); <em>Yick Wo </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>118 U. S. 356,370 (1886). The Judiciary is obliged to train a skeptical eye on any qualification of that right. See <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>at 562 (\u201cEspecially since the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">As against the unfettered right, however, lies the \u201cCommon sense, as well as constitutional law ... that government must play an active role in structuring elections; \u2018as a practical matter, there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the democratic processes.\u2019\u201d <em>Burdick, supra, </em>at 433 (quoting <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>415 U. S. 724, 730 (1974)); see also <em>Burdick, </em>504 U. S., at 433 (\u201cElection laws will invariably impose some burden upon individual voters\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Given the legitimacy of interests on both sides, we have avoided preset levels of scrutiny in favor of a sliding-scale balancing analysis: the scrutiny varies with the effect of the regulation at issue. And whatever the claim, the Court has long made a careful, ground-level appraisal both of the practical burdens on the right to vote and of the State\u2019s reasons for imposing those precise burdens. Thus, in <em>Burdick:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">\u201cA court considering [such] a challenge . . . must weigh \u2018the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Amendments that the jplaintiff seeks to vindicate\u2019 against \u2018the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,\u2019 taking into consideration \u2018the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff\u2019s rights.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 434 (quoting <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>460 U. S. 780, 789 (1983)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The lead opinion does not disavow these basic principles. See <em>ante, </em>at 190-191 (discussing Burdick); see also <em>ante, </em>at 191 (\u201cHowever slight [the] burden may appear, ... it must be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). But I think it does not insist enough on the hard facts that our standard of review demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Under <em>Burdick, </em>\u201cthe rigorousness of our inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights,\u201d 504 U. S., at 434, upon an assessment of the \u201c \u2018character and magnitude of the asserted [threatened] injury,\u2019 \u201d <em>ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Anderson, supra, </em>at 789), and an estimate of the number of voters likely to be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The first set of burdens shown in these cases is the travel costs and fees necessary to get one of the limited variety of federal or state photo identifications needed to cast a regular ballot under the Voter ID Law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The travel is required for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the personal visit to a license branch of the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV), which is demanded of anyone applying for a driver\u2019s license or nondriver photo identification. See 458 F. Supp. 2d 775, 791 (SD Ind. 2006). The need to travel to a BMV branch will affect voters according to their circumstances, with the average person probably viewing it as nothing more than an inconvenience. Poor, old, and disabled voters who do not drive a car, however, may find the trip prohibitive,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> witness the fact that the BMV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>has far fewer license branches in each county than there are voting precincts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Marion County, for example, has over 900 active voting precincts, see Brief for Respondent Marion County Election Board 4,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> yet only 12 BMV license branches;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in Lake County, there are 565 active voting precincts, see n. 6, <em>supra, </em>to match up with only 8 BMV locations;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Allen County, with 309 active voting precincts, see <em>ibid., </em>has only 3 BMV license branches.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The same pattern holds in counties with smaller populations. Brown County has 12 active voter precincts, see <em>ibid., </em>and only 1 BMV office;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> while there were 18 polling places available in Fayette County\u2019s 2007 municipal primary,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> there was only 1 BMV license branch;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Henry County, with 42 polling places approved for 2008 elections,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> has only 1 BMV office.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The burden of traveling to a more distant BMV office rather than a conveniently located polling place is probably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>serious for many of the individuals who lack photo identification.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> They almost certainly will not own cars, see Brief for Current and Former State Secretaries of State as <em>Amici Curiae </em>11, and public transportation in Indiana is fairly limited. According to a report published by Indiana\u2019s Department of Transportation in August 2007, 21 of Indiana\u2019s 92 counties have no public transportation system at all,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and as of 2000, nearly 1 in every 10 voters lived within 1 of these 21 counties.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Among the counties with some public system, 21 provide service only within certain cities, and 32 others restrict public transportation to regional county service, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>leaving only 18 that offer eountywide public transportation, see n. 15, <em>swpra. </em>State officials recognize the effect that travel costs can have on voter turnout, as in Marion County, for example, where efforts have been made to \u201cestablish] most polling places in locations even more convenient than the statutory minimum,\u201d in order to \u201cprovid[e] for neighborhood voting.\u201d Brief for Respondent Marion County Election Board 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Although making voters travel farther than what is convenient for most and possible for some does not amount to a \u201csevere\u201d burden under <em>Burdick, </em>that is no reason to ignore the burden altogether. It translates into an obvious economic cost (whether in worktime lost, or getting and paying for transportation) that an Indiana voter must bear to obtain an ID.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">For those voters who can afford the round trip, a second financial hurdle appears: in order to get photo identification for the first time, they need to present \u201ca birth certificate, certificate of naturalization, U. S. veterans photo identification, U. S. military photo identification, or a U. S. passport.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 198, n. 17 (lead opinion) (citing Ind. Admin. Code, tit. 140, \u00a77-4-3 (2008)). As the lead opinion says, the two most common of these documents come at a price: Indiana counties charge anywhere from $3 to $12 for a birth certificate (and in some other States the fee is significantly higher), see <em>ante, </em>at 198, n. 17, and that same price must usually be paid for a first-time passport, since a birth certificate is required to prove U. S. citizenship by birth. The total fees for a passport, moreover, are up to about $100.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> So most voters must pay at least one fee to get the ID necessary to cast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>a regular ballot.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As with the travel costs, these fees are far from shocking on their face, but in the <em>Burdick </em>analysis it matters that both the travel costs and the fees are disproportionately heavy for, and thus disproportionately likely to deter, the poor, the old, and the immobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">To be sure, Indiana has a provisional-ballot exception to the ID requirement for individuals the State considers \u201cindigent\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> as well as those with religious objections to being photographed, see <em>ante, </em>at 199-200 (lead opinion), and this sort of exception could in theory provide a way around the costs of procuring an ID. But Indiana\u2019s chosen exception does not amount to much relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The law allows these voters who lack the necessary ID to sign the pollbook and cast a provisional ballot. See 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 786 (citing Ind. Code Ann. \u00a73-11-8-25.1 (West Supp. 2007)). As the lead opinion recognizes, though, <em>ante, </em>at 199-200, that is only the first step; to have the provisional ballot counted, a voter must then appear in person before the circuit court clerk or county election board within 10 days of the election, to sign an affidavit attesting to indigency or religious objection to being photographed (or to present an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>ID at that point),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> see 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 786. Unlike the trip to the BMV (which, assuming things go smoothly, needs to be made only once every four years for renewal of non-driver photo identification, see <em>id., </em>at 791), this one must be taken every time a poor person or religious objector wishes to vote, because the State does not allow an affidavit to count in successive elections. And unlike the trip to the BMV (which at least has a handful of license branches in the more populous counties), a county has only one county seat. Forcing these people to travel to the county seat every time they try to vote is particularly onerous for the reason noted already, that most counties in Indiana either lack public transportation or offer only limited coverage. See <em>supra, </em>at 213-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">That the need to travel to the county seat each election amounts to a high hurdle is shown in the results of the 2007 municipal elections in Marion County, to which Indiana\u2019s Voter ID Law applied. Thirty-four provisional ballots were cast, but only two provisional voters made it to the county clerk\u2019s office within the 10 days. See Brief for Respondent Marion County Election Board 8-9. All 34 of these aspiring voters appeared at the appropriate precinct; 33 of them provided a signature, and every signature matched the one on file; and 26 of the 32 voters whose ballots were not counted had a history of voting in Marion County elections. See <em>id., </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">All of this suggests that provisional ballots do not obviate the burdens of getting photo identification. And even if that were not so, the provisional-ballot option would be inade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>quate for a further reason: the indigency exception by definition offers no relief to those voters who do not consider themselves (or would not be considered) indigent but as a practical matter would find it hard, for nonfinancial reasons, to get the required ID (most obviously the disabled).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Indiana\u2019s Voter ID Law thus threatens to impose serious burdens on the voting right, even if not \u201csevere\u201d ones, and the next question under <em>Burdick </em>is whether the number of individuals likely to be affected is significant as well. Record evidence and facts open to judicial notice answer yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Although the District Court found that petitioners failed to offer any reliable empirical study of numbers of voters affected, see <em>ante, </em>at 200 (lead opinion),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we may accept that court\u2019s rough calculation that 43,000 voting-age residents lack the kind of identification card required by Indiana\u2019s law. See 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 807. The District Court made that estimate by comparing BMV records reproduced in petitioners\u2019 statistician\u2019s report with U. S. Census Bureau figures for Indiana\u2019s voting-age population in 2004, see <em>ibid., </em>and the State does not argue that these raw data are unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The State, in fact, shows no discomfort with the District Court\u2019s finding that an \u201cestimated 43,000 individuals\u201d (about 1% of the State\u2019s voting-age population) lack a qualifying ID. Brief for State Respondents 25. If the State\u2019s willingness to take that number is surprising, it may be less so in light of the District Court\u2019s observation that \u201cseveral factors . . . suggest the percentage of Indiana\u2019s voting age population with photo identification is actually lower than 99%, \u201d 458 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>F. Supp. 2d, at 807, n. 43,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> a suggestion in line with national surveys showing roughly 6%-10% of voting-age Americans without a state-issued photo identification card. See Brief for Petitioners in No. 07-21, pp. 39-40, n. 17 (citing National Commission on Election Reform, To Assure Pride and Confidence: Task Force Reports, ch. VI: Verification of Identity, p. 4 (Aug. 2001), http://webstorage3.mcpa.virginia.edu/ commissions/comm_2001_taskforce.pdf).

To be sure, the 43,000 figure has to be discounted to some extent, residents of certain nursing homes being exempted from the photo identification requirement. 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 786. But the State does not suggest that this narrow exception could possibly reduce 43,000 to an insubstantial number.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The upshot is this. Tens of thousands of voting-age residents lack the necessary photo identification.

There is accordingly no reason to doubt that a significant number of state residents will be discouraged or disabled from voting. Cf. 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 823 (\u201cWe do not doubt that such individuals exist somewhere, even though Plaintiffs were unable to locate them\u201d); 472 F. 3d, at 952 (\u201cNo doubt there are at least a few [whom the law will deter from voting] in Indiana . . . \u201d); see also <em>ante, </em>at 199-200 (lead opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Petitioners, to be sure, failed to nail down precisely how great the cohort of discouraged and totally deterred voters will be, but empirical precision beyond the foregoing numbers has never been demanded for raising a voting-rights claim.

And the fact that Indiana\u2019s photo identification requirement is one of the most restrictive in the country, see Brief for Current and Former State Secretaries of State as <em>Amici Curiae </em>27-30 (compiling state voter-identification statutes); see also Brief for State of Texas et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>10-13 (same),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> makes a critical examination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>State\u2019s claims all the more in order.

See <em>ante, </em>at 191-197. But having found the Voter ID Law burdens far from trivial, I have to make a rigorous assessment of \u201c \u2018the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,\u2019 [and] \u2018the extent to which those inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff\u2019s rights.\u2019\u201d <em>Burdick, </em>504 U. S., at 434 (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>460 U. S., at 789).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">As this quotation from <em>Burdick </em>indicates, the interests claimed to justify the regulatory scheme are subject to discount in two distinct ways. First, the generalities raised by the State have to be shaved down to the precise \u201caspect[s of claimed interests] addressed by the law at issue.\u201d <em>California Democratic Party </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>530 U. S. 567, 584 (2000) (emphasis deleted); see <em>ibid, </em>(scrutiny of state interests \u201cis not to be made in the abstract, by asking whether [the interests] are highly significant values; but rather by asking whether the <em>aspect </em>of [those interests] addressed by the law at issue is highly significant\u201d (emphasis in original)). And even if the State can show particularized interests addressed by the law, those interests are subject to further discount.depending on \u201cthe extent to which [they] make it necessary to burden the plaintiff\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Burdick, supra, </em>at 434 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">As the lead opinion sees it, the State has offered four related concerns that suffice to justify the Voter ID Law: modernizing election procedures, combating voter fraud, addressing the consequences of the State\u2019s bloated voter rolls, and protecting public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process. See <em>ante, </em>at 191-197. On closer look, however, it appears that the first two (which are really just one) can claim modest weight at best, and the latter two if anything weaken the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The lead opinion\u2019s discussion of the State\u2019s reasons begins with the State\u2019s asserted interests in \u201celection modernization,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 192-197, and in combating voter fraud, see <em>ante, </em>at 194-197. Although these are given separate headings, any line drawn between them is unconvincing; as I un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>derstand it, the \u201ceffort to modernize elections,\u201d Brief for State Respondents 12, is not for modernity\u2019s sake, but to reach certain practical (or political) objectives.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In any event, if a proposed modernization were in fact aimless, if it were put forward as change for change\u2019s sake, a State could not justify any appreciable burden on the right to vote that might ensue; useless technology has no constitutional value. And in fact that is not the case here. The State says that it adopted the ID law principally to combat voter fraud, and it is this claim, not the slogan of \u201celection modernization,\u201d that warrants attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">There is no denying the abstract importance, the compelling nature, of combating voter fraud. See <em>Purcell, </em>549 U. S., at 4 (acknowledging \u201cthe State\u2019s compelling interest in preventing voter fraud\u201d); cf. <em>Eu </em>v. <em>San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., </em>489 U. S. 214, 231 (1989) (\u201cA State indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election process\u201d). But it takes several steps to get beyond the level of abstraction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">To begin with, requiring a voter to show photo identification before casting a regular ballot addresses only one form of voter fraud: in-person voter impersonation. The photo identification requirement leaves untouched the problems of absentee-ballot fraud, which (unlike in-person voter impersonation) is a documented problem in Indiana, see 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 793; of registered voters voting more than once (but maintaining their own identities) in different counties or in different States; of felons and other disqualified individuals voting in their own names; of vote buying; or, for that matter, of ballot stuffing, ballot miscounting, voter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>intimidation, or any other type of corruption on the part of officials administering elections. See Brief for Brennan Center for Justice et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>7.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">And even the State\u2019s interest in deterring a voter from showing up at the polls and claiming to be someone he is not must, in turn, be discounted for the fact that the State has not come across a single instance of in-person voter impersonation fraud in all of Indiana\u2019s history. See 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 792-793; see also <em>ante, </em>at 194-197 (lead opinion). Neither the District Court nor the Indiana General Assembly that passed the Voter ID Law was given any evidence whatsoever of in-person voter impersonation fraud in the State. See 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 793. This absence of support is consistent with the experience of several veteran poll watchers in Indiana, each of whom submitted testimony in the District Court that he had never witnessed an instance of attempted voter impersonation fraud at the polls. <em>Ibid. </em>It is also consistent with the dearth of evidence of in-person voter impersonation in any other part of the country. See <em>ante, </em>at 195, n. 12 (lead opinion) (conceding that there are at most \u201cscattered instances of in-person voter fraud\u201d); see also Brief for Brennan Center for Justice, <em>supra, </em>at 11-25 (demonstrating that \u201cthe national evidence \u2014 including the very evidence relied on by the courts below \u2014 suggests that the type of voting fraud that may be remedied by a photo identification requirement is virtually nonexistent: the \u2018problem\u2019 of voter impersonation is not a real problem at all\u201d).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The State responds to the want of evidence with the assertion that in-person voter impersonation fraud is hard to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>tect. But this is like saying the \u201cman who wasn\u2019t there\u201d is hard to spot,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and to know whether difficulty in detection accounts for the lack of evidence one at least has to ask whether in-person voter impersonation is (or would be) relatively harder to ferret out than other kinds of fraud <em>(e. g., </em>by absentee ballot) which the State has had no trouble documenting. The answer seems to be no; there is reason to think that \u201cimpersonation of voters is . . . the most likely type of fraud to be discovered.\u201d U. S. Election Assistance Commission, Election Crimes: An Initial Review and Recommendations for Future Study 9 (Dec. 2006) (hereinafter EAC Report), http://www.eac.gov/clearinghouse/docs/ reports-and-surveys-2006electioncrimes.pdf/attachment_ download/file. This is in part because an individual who impersonates another at the polls commits his fraud in the open, under the scrutiny of local pollworkers who may well recognize a fraudulent voter when they hear who he claims to be. See Brief for Respondent Marion County Election Board 6 (\u201c[P]reeinet workers may recognize an imposter, and precinct election workers have the authority to challenge persons appearing to vote if the election board member \u2018is not satisfied that a person who offers to vote is the person who the person represents the person to be\u2019 \u201d (quoting Ind. Code Ann. \u00a73-11-8-27 (West 2006))).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The relative ease of discovering in-person voter impersonation is also owing to the odds that any such fraud will be committed by \u201corganized groups such as campaigns or political parties\u201d rather than by individuals acting alone. L. Minnite &amp; D. Callahan, Securing the Vote: An Analysis of Election Fraud 14 (2003), http://www.demos.org/pubs/ EDR_-_Securing_the_Vote.pdf. It simply is not worth it for individuals acting alone to commit in-person voter impersonation, which is relatively ineffectual for the foolish few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>who may commit it. If an imposter gets caught, he is subject to severe criminal penalties. See, <em>e. g., </em>Ind. Code Ann. \u00a73-14-2-9 (West 2006) (making it a felony \u201cknowingly [to] vot[e] or offe[r] to vote at an election when the person is not registered or authorized to vote\u201d); \u00a7 3-14-2-11 (with certain exceptions, \u201ca person who knowingly votes or offers to vote in a precinct except the one in which the person is registered and resides\u201d commits a felony); \u00a7 3-14-2-12(1) (making it a felony \u201cknowingly [to] vot[e] or mak[e] application to vote in an election in a name other than the person\u2019s own\u201d); \u00a7 3-14-2-12(2) (a person who, \u201chaving voted once at an election, knowingly applies to vote at the same election in the person\u2019s own name or any other name\u201d commits a felony); see also 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1973i(e)(l) (any individual who \u201cvotes more than once\u201d in certain federal elections \u201cshall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both\u201d). And even if he succeeds, the imposter gains nothing more than one additional vote for his candidate. See EAC Report 9 (in-person voter impersonation \u201cis an inefficient method of influencing an election\u201d); J. Levitt, The Truth About Voter Fraud 7 (2007), online at http://truthaboutfraud. org/pdf/TruthAboutVoterFraud.pdf (\u201c[F]raud by individual voters is a singularly foolish and ineffective way to attempt to win an election. Each act of voter fraud in connection with a federal election risks five years in prison and a $10,000 fine, in addition to any state penalties. In return, it yields at most one incremental vote. That single extra vote is simply not worth the price\u201d (footnote omitted)); cf. 472 F. 3d, at 951 (\u201c[A] vote in a political election rarely has any <em>instrumental </em>value, since elections for political office at the state or federal level are never decided by just one vote\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In sum, fraud by individuals acting alone, however difficult to detect, is unlikely. And while there may be greater incentives for organized groups to engage in broad-gauged in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>person voter impersonation fraud, see Minnite &amp; Callahan, <em>supra, </em>at 20, it is also far more difficult to conceal larger enterprises of this sort. The State\u2019s argument about the difficulty of detecting the fraud lacks real force.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Nothing else the State has to say does much to bolster its case. The State argues, for example, that even without evidence of in-person voter impersonation in Indiana, it is enough for the State to show that \u201copportunities [for such fraud] are transparently obvious in elections without identification checks,\u201d Brief for State Respondents 54. Of course they are, but Indiana elections before the Voter ID Law were not run \u201cwithout identification checks\u201d; on the contrary, as the Marion County Election Board informs us, \u201c[t]imetested systems were in place to detect in-person voter impersonation fraud before the challenged statute was enacted,\u201d Brief for Respondent Marion County Election Board 6. These included hiring pollworkers who were precinct residents familiar with the neighborhood and making signature comparisons, each effort being supported by the criminal provisions mentioned before. <em>Id., </em>at 6-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">For that matter, the deterrence argument can do only so much work, since photo identification is itself hardly a fail-safe against impersonation. Indiana knows this, and that is why in 2007 the State began to issue redesigned driver\u2019s licenses with digital watermarking.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The State has made this shift precisely because, in the words of its BMV, \u201cvisual inspection is not adequate to determine the authenticity\u201d of driver\u2019s licenses. See Indiana BMV, <em>supra </em>n. 30. Indeed, the BMV explains that the digital watermark (which can be scanned using equipment that, so far, Indiana does not use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>at polling places) is needed to \u201ctak[e] the guesswork out of inspection.\u201d Ibid.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> So, at least until polling places have the machines and special software to scan the new driver\u2019s licenses, and until all the licenses with the older designs expire (the licenses issued after 2006 but before the 2007 redesigning are good until 2012, see 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 791), Indiana\u2019s law does no more than ensure that any in-person voter fraud will take place with fake IDs, not attempted signature forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Despite all this, I will readily stipulate that a State has an interest in responding to the risk (however small) of in-person voter impersonation. See <em>ante, </em>at 196 (lead opinion). I reach this conclusion, like others accepted by the Court, because \u201c \u2018[wjhere a legislature has significantly greater institutional expertise, as, for example, in the field of election regulation, the Court in practice defers to empirical legislative judgments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Randall, </em>548 U. S., at 285 (Souter, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em>528 U. S. 377, 402 (2000) (Breyer, J., concurring)). Weight is owed to the legislative judgment as such. But the ultimate valuation of the particular interest a State asserts has to take account of evidence against it as well as legislative judgments for it (certainly when the law is one of the most restrictive of its kind, see n. 26, <em>supra), </em>and on this record it would be unreasonable to accord this assumed state interest more than very modest significance.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AV8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">The antifraud rationale is open to skepticism on one further ground, what <em>Burdick </em>spoke of as an assessment of the degree of necessity for the State\u2019s particular course of action. Two points deserve attention, the first being that the State has not even tried to justify its decision to implement the photo identification requirement immediately on passage of the new law. A phase-in period would have given the State time to distribute its newly designed licenses, and to make a genuine effort to get them to individuals in need, and a period for transition is exactly what the Commission on Federal Election Reform, headed by former President Carter and former Secretary of State Baker, recommended in its report. See Building Confidence in U. S. Elections \u00a72.5 (Sept. 2005), App. 136, 140 (hereinafter Carter-Baker Report) (\u201cFor the next two federal elections, until January 1, 2010, in states that require voters to present identification at the polls, voters who fail to do so should nonetheless be allowed to cast a provisional ballot, and their ballot would count if their signature is verified\u201d). During this phase-in period, the report said, States would need to make \u201cefforts to ensure that all voters are provided convenient opportunities to obtain\u201d the required identification. Id., at 141. The former President and former Secretary of State explained this recommendation in an op-ed essay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\u201cYes, we are concerned about the approximately 12 percent of citizens who lack a driver\u2019s license. So we proposed that states finally assume the responsibility to seek out citizens to both register voters and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>vide them with free ID\u2019s that meet federal standards. States should open new offices, use social service agencies and deploy mobile offices to register voters. By connecting ID\u2019s to registration, voting participation will be expanded.\u201d Carter &amp; Baker, Voting Reform Is in the Cards, N. Y. Times, Sept. 23, 2005, p. A19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Although Indiana claims to have adopted its ID requirement relying partly on the Carter-Baker Report, see Brief for State Respondents 5,13, 49; see also <em>ante, </em>at 194 (lead opinion), the State conspicuously rejected the Carter-Baker Report\u2019s phase-in recommendation aimed at reducing the burdens on the right to vote, and just as conspicuously fails even to try to explain why.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">What is left of the State\u2019s claim must be downgraded further for one final reason: regardless of the interest the State may have in adopting a photo identification requirement as a general matter, that interest in no way necessitates the particular burdens the Voter ID Law imposes on poor people and religious objectors. Individuals unable to get photo identification are forced to travel to the county seat every time they wish to exercise the franchise, and they have to get there within 10 days of the election. See <em>supra, </em>at 216-218. Nothing about the State\u2019s interest in fighting voter fraud justifies this requirement of a postelection trip to the county seat instead of some verification process at the polling places.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In briefing this Court, the State responds by pointing to an interest in keeping lines at polling places short. See Brief for State Respondents 58. It warns that \u201c[i]f election workers \u2014 a scarce resource in any election \u2014 must attend to the details of validating provisional ballots, voters may have to wait longer to vote,\u201d and it assures us that \u201c[njothing deters voting so much as long lines at the polls.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But this argument fails on its own terms, for whatever might be the number of individuals casting a provisional ballot, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>State could simply allow voters to sign the indigency affidavit at the polls subject to review there after the election.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> After all, the Voter ID Law already requires voters lacking photo identification to sign, at the polling site, an affidavit attesting to proper registration. See 458 F. Supp. 2d, at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Indeed, the State\u2019s argument more than fails; it backfires, in implicitly conceding that a not-insignificant number of individuals will need to rely on the burdensome provisional-ballot mechanism. What is more, as the District Court found, the Voter ID Law itself actually increases the likelihood of delay at the polls. Since any minor discrepancy between a voter\u2019s photo identification card and the registration information may lead to a challenge, \u201cthe opportunities for presenting challenges ha[ve] increased as a result of the photo identification requirements.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 789; cf. 472 F. 3d, at 955 (Evans, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe potential for mischief with this law is obvious. Does the name on the ID \u2018conform\u2019 to the name on the voter registration list? If the last name of a newly married woman is on the ID but her maiden name is on the registration list, does it conform? If a name is misspelled on one \u2014 Schmit versus Schmitt \u2014 does it conform? If a \u2018Terence\u2019 appears on one and a shortened \u2018Terry\u2019 on the other, does it conform?\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The State\u2019s asserted interests in modernizing elections and combating fraud are decidedly modest; at best, they fail to offset the clear inference that thousands of Indiana citizens will be discouraged from voting. The two remaining justifications, meanwhile, actually weaken the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The lead opinion agrees with the State that \u201cthe inflation of its voter rolls provides further support for its enactment of\u201d the Voter ID Law. <em>Ante, </em>at 196. This is a puzzling conclusion, given the fact, which the lead opinion notes, that the National Government filed a complaint against Indiana, containing this allegation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">\u201cIndiana has failed to conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to identify and remove ineligible voters from the State\u2019s registration list; has failed to remove such ineligible voters; and has failed to engage in oversight actions sufficient to ensure that local election jurisdictions identify and remove such ineligible voters.\u201d App. 309, 312.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The Federal Government and the State agreed to settle the case, and a consent decree and order have been entered, see <em>ante, </em>at 196, requiring Indiana to fulfill its list-maintenance obligations under \u00a7 8 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 82, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1973gg-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">How any of this can justify restrictions on the right to vote is difficult to say. The State is simply trying to take advantage of its own wrong: if it is true that the State\u2019s fear of in-person voter impersonation fraud arises from its bloated voter checklist, the answer to the problem is in the State\u2019s own hands. The claim that the State has an interest in addressing a symptom of the problem (alleged impersonation) rather than the problem itself (the negligently maintained bloated rolls) is thus self-defeating; it shows that the State has no justifiable need to burden the right to vote as it does, and it suggests that the State is not as serious about combating fraud as it claims to be.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>The State\u2019s final justification, its interest in safeguarding voter confidence, similarly collapses. The problem with claiming this interest lies in its connection to the bloated voter rolls; the State has come up with nothing to suggest that its citizens doubt the integrity of the State\u2019s electoral process, except its own failure to maintain its rolls. The answer to this problem is not to burden the right to vote, but to end the official negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">It should go without saying that none of this is to deny States\u2019 legitimate interest in safeguarding public confidence. The Court has, for example, recognized that fighting perceptions of political corruption stemming from large political contributions is a legitimate and substantial state interest, underlying not only campaign finance laws, but bribery and antigratuity statutes as well. See <em>Nixon, </em>528 U. S., at 390. But the force of the interest depends on the facts (or plausibility of the assumptions) said to justify invoking it. See <em>id., </em>at 391 (\u201cThe quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised\u201d). While we found in <em>Nixon </em>that \u201cthere is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will work actual corruption of our political system, and no reason to question the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 395, there is plenty of reason to be doubtful here, both about the reality and the perception. It is simply not plausible to assume here, with no evidence of in-person voter impersonation fraud in a State, and very little of it nationwide, that a public perception of such fraud is nevertheless \u201cinherent\u201d in an election system providing severe criminal penalties for fraud and mandating signature checks at the polls. Cf. <em>id., </em>at 390 (\u201c[T]he perception of corruption [is] \u2018inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions\u2019 to candidates for public office\u201d (quoting <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>424 U. S. 1, 27 (1976) <em>(per curiam))).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Without a shred of evidence that in-person voter impersonation is a problem in the State, much less a crisis, Indiana has adopted one of the most restrictive photo identification requirements in the country. The State recognizes that tens of thousands of qualified voters lack the necessary federally issued or state-issued identification, but it insists on implementing the requirement immediately, without allowing a transition period for targeted efforts to distribute the required identification to individuals who need it. The State hardly even tries to explain its decision to force indigents or religious objectors to travel all the way to their county seats every time they wish to vote, and if there is any waning of confidence in the administration of elections it probably owes more to the State\u2019s violation of federal election law than to any imposters at the polling places. It is impossible to say, on this record, that the State\u2019s interest in adopting its signally inhibiting photo identification requirement has been shown to outweigh the serious burdens it imposes on the right to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">If more were needed to condemn this law, our own precedent would provide it, for the calculation revealed in the Indiana statute crosses a line when it targets the poor and the weak. Cf. <em>Anderson, </em>460 U. S., at 793 (\u201c[I]t is especially difficult for the State to justify a restriction that limits political participation by an identifiable political group whose members share a particular viewpoint, associational preference, or economic status\u201d). If the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Virginia Bd. of Elections, </em>383 U. S. 663 (1966), stands for anything, it is that being poor has nothing to do with being qualified to vote. <em>Harper </em>made clear that \u201c[t]o introduce wealth or payment of a fee as a measure of a voter\u2019s qualifications is to introduce a capricious or irrelevant factor.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 668. The State\u2019s requirements here, that people without cars travel to a motor vehicle registry and that the poor who fail to do that get to their county seats within 10 days of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>every election, likewise translate into unjustified economic burdens uncomfortably close to the outright $1.50 fee we struck down 42 years ago. Like that fee, the onus of the Indiana law is illegitimate just because it correlates with no state interest so well as it does with the object of deterring poorer residents from exercising the franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The Indiana Voter ID Law is thus unconstitutional: the state interests fail to justify the practical limitations placed on the right to vote, and the law imposes an unreasonable and irrelevant burden on voters who are poor and old. I would vacate the judgment of the Seventh Circuit, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\"> Senate Enrolled Act No. 483, 2005 Ind.

But as petitioners\u2019 <em>amici </em>AARP and the National Senior Citizens Law Center point out, there are crucial differences between the absentee and regular ballot. Brief for AARP et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>12-16. Voting by absentee ballot leaves an individual without the possibility of receiving assistance from pollworkers, and thus increases the likelihood of confusion and error. More seriously, as the Supreme Court of Indiana has recognized, Indiana law \u201ctreats absentee voters differently from the way it treats Election Day voters,\u201d in the important sense that \u201can absentee ballot may not be recounted in situations where clerical error by an election officer rendered it invalid.\u201d <em>Horseman </em>v. <em>Keller, </em>841 N.

This is a valid consideration, but is unlikely to overcome the additions that must be made for the various factors listed above. Second, the court noted that the BMV records do not account for the exceptions to the photo identification requirement (such as the indigency and absentee-ballot exceptions). This factor does not warrant a deduction of the 43,000 number because, as I have argued, the indigency exception imposes serious burdens of its own, see <em>swpra, </em>at 216-218, and the absentee-ballot exception is not a wholly adequate substitute for voting in person, see n. 4, <em>supra. </em>Finally, the District Court noted that many individuals are not registered to vote.

In determining whether this statute violates the Federal Constitution, I would balance the voting-related interests that the statute affects, asking \u201cwhether the statute burdens any one such interest in a manner out of proportion to the statute\u2019s salutary effects upon the others (perhaps, but not necessarily, because of the existence of a clearly superior, less restrictive alternative).\u201d <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em>528 U. S. 377, 402 (2000) (Breyer, J., concurring); <em>ante, </em>at 190-191 (lead opinion) (similar standard); <em>ante, </em>at 210-211 (Souter, J., dissenting) (same). Applying this standard, I believe the statute is unconstitutional because it imposes a disproportionate burden upon those eligible voters who lack a driver\u2019s license or other statutorily valid form of photo ID.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Like Justice Stevens, I give weight to the fact that a national commission, chaired by former President Jimmy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker, studied the issue and recommended that States should require voter photo IDs. See Report of the Commission on Federal Election Reform, Building Confidence in U. S. Elections \u00a72.5 (Sept. 2005) (Carter-Baker Report), App. 136-144. Because the record does not discredit the Carter-Baker Report or suggest that Indiana is exceptional, I see nothing to prevent Indiana\u2019s Legislature (or a federal court considering the constitutionality of the statute) from taking account of the legislatively relevant facts the report sets forth and paying attention to its expert conclusions. Thus, I share the general view of the lead opinion insofar as it holds that the Constitution does not <em>automatically </em>prohibit Indiana from enacting a photo ID requirement. Were I also to. believe, as Justice Stevens believes, that the burden imposed by the Indiana statute on eligible voters who lack photo IDs is indeterminate \u201con the basis of the record that has been made in this litigation,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 202, or were I to believe, as Justice Scalia believes, that the burden the statute imposes is \u201cminimal\u201d or \u201cjustified,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 204 (opinion concurring in judgment), then I too would reject the petitioners\u2019 facial attack, primarily for the reasons set forth in Part II of the lead opinion, see <em>ante, </em>at 191-197.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">I cannot agree, however, with Justice Stevens\u2019 or Justice Scalia\u2019s assessment of the burdens imposed by the statute. The Carter-Baker Commission <em>conditioned </em>its recommendation upon the States\u2019 willingness to ensure that the requisite photo IDs \u201cbe easily available and issued free of charge\u201d and that the requirement be \u201cphased in\u201d over two federal election cycles, to ease the transition. Carter-Baker Report, App. 139,140. And as described in Part II of Justice So\u00fater\u2019s dissenting opinion, see <em>ante, </em>at 211-223, Indiana\u2019s law fails to satisfy these aspects of the Commission\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">For one thing, an Indiana nondriver, most likely to be poor, elderly, or disabled, will find it difficult and expensive to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>travel to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, particularly if he or she resides in one of the many Indiana counties lacking a public transportation system. See <em>ante, </em>at 213-215 (Souter, J., dissenting) (noting that out of Indiana\u2019s 92 counties, 21 have no public transportation system at all and 32 others restrict public transportation to regional county service). For another, many of these individuals may be uncertain about how to obtain the underlying documentation, usually a passport or a birth certificate, upon which the statute insists. And some may find the costs associated with these documents unduly burdensome (up to $12 for a copy of a birth certificate; up to $100 for a passport). By way of comparison, this Court previously found unconstitutionally burdensome a poll tax of $1.50 (less than $10 today, inflation adjusted). See <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Virginia Bd. of Elections, </em>383 U. S. 663, 664, n. 1, 666 (1966); <em>ante, </em>at 236-237 (Souter, J., dissenting). Further, Indiana\u2019s exception for voters who cannot afford this cost imposes its own burden: a postelection trip to the county clerk or county election board to sign an indigency affidavit <em>after each election. </em>See <em>ante, </em>at 216-218 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">By way of contrast, two other States \u2014 Florida and Georgia \u2014 have put into practice photo ID requirements significantly less restrictive than Indiana\u2019s. Under the Florida law, the range of permissible forms of photo ID is substantially greater than in Indiana. See Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7101.043(1) (West Supp. 2008) (including a debit or credit card, a student ID, a retirement center ID, a neighborhood association ID, and a public assistance ID). Moreover, a Florida voter who lacks photo ID may cast a provisional ballot at the polling place that will be counted if the State determines that his signature matches the one on his voter registration form. \u00a7\u00a7 101.043(2); 101.048(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Georgia restricts voters to a more limited list of acceptable photo IDs than does Florida, but accepts in addition to proof of voter registration a broader range of underlying documen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>tation than does Indiana. See Ga. Code Ann. \u00a721-2-417 (Supp. 2007); Ga. Comp. Rules &amp; Regs., Rule 183-1-20.01 (2006) (permissible underlying documents include a paycheck stub, Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid statement, school transcript, or federal affidavit of birth, as long as the document includes the voter\u2019s full name and date of birth). Moreover, a Federal District Court found that Georgia \u201chas undertaken a serious, concerted effort to notify voters who may lack Photo ID cards of the Photo ID requirement, to inform those voters of the availability of free [state-issued] Photo ID cards or free Voter ID cards, to instruct the voters concerning how to obtain the cards, and to advise the voters that they can vote absentee by mail without a Photo ID.\u201d <em>Common Cause/Georgia </em>v. <em>Billups, </em>504 F. Supp. 2d 1333, 1380 (ND Ga. 2007). While Indiana allows only certain groups such as the elderly and disabled to vote by absentee ballot, in Georgia <em>any </em>voter may vote absentee without providing any excuse, and (except where required by federal law) need not present a photo ID in order to do so. Compare Ind. Code Ann. \u00a73-11-4-1 (West 2006) with Ga. Code Ann. \u00a721-2-381 (Supp. 2007). Finally, neither Georgia nor Florida insists, as Indiana does, that indigent voters travel each election cycle to potentially distant places for the purposes of signing an indigency affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The record nowhere provides a convincing reason why Indiana\u2019s photo ID requirement must impose greater burdens than those of other States, or than the Carter-Baker Commission recommended nationwide., Nor is there any reason to think that there are proportionately fewer such voters in Indiana than elsewhere in the country (the District Court\u2019s rough estimate was 43,000). See 458 F. Supp. 2d 775, 807 (SD Ind. 2006). And I need not determine the constitutionality of Florida\u2019s or Georgia\u2019s requirements (matters not before us), in order to conclude that Indiana\u2019s requirement imposes a significantly harsher, unjustified burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Of course, the Carter-Baker Report is not the Constitution of the United States. But its findings are highly relevant to both legislative and judicial determinations of the reasonableness of a photo ID requirement; to the related necessity of ensuring that all those eligible to vote possess the requisite IDs; and to the presence of alternative methods of ensuring that possession, methods that are superior to those that Indiana\u2019s statute sets forth. The Commission\u2019s findings, taken together with the considerations set forth in Part II of Justice Stevens\u2019 opinion, and Part II of Justice Souter\u2019s dissenting opinion, lead me to the conclusion that while the Constitution does not in general prohibit Indiana from enacting a photo ID requirement, this statute imposes a disproportionate burden upon those without valid photo IDs. For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
