Defendant and respondent Timothy Walton (Walton) asked the trial court to dismiss the case for lack of standing and lack of jurisdiction because the named plaintiff, The Rossdale Group, LLC, was only a fictitious business name and the entity to which that name was registered was a dissolved Florida limited liability company called Miami Legal Resources, LLC. Because no legitimate standing or jurisdictional issue was raised by Walton's motion, we will reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This lawsuit had its genesis in an earlier action filed in 2010 by Walton against a defendant he called The Rossdale Group, LLC (Rossdale). Walton, who the complaint in this case alleges is a licensed California attorney, \"maintained a litigation factory\" by \"placing dozens of e-mail addresses on the Internet,\" collecting \" 'spam' \" messages sent to those addresses, and then demanding \"compensation\" for supposed violations of California law. After Rossdale refused to pay in response to a demand letter for \"prohibited forms of e-mail advertising,\" Walton filed suit against Rossdale, claiming, among other things, a violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code sections 1750 et seq. Walton's lawsuit against Rossdale was dismissed after the trial court granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings with prejudice, and judgment was entered on May 2, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The same day, this action was filed against Walton, stating a single claim for malicious prosecution, based on the allegation that Walton's prior lawsuit was pursued on legal theories Walton knew to be erroneous and discovery tactics meant to prolong a meritless lawsuit. The plaintiff in this lawsuit is identified as \"The Rossdale Group, LLC,\" \"a Florida Limited Liability Company.\" As it turns out, however, Rossdale was merely a fictitious business name registered in Florida to a Florida limited liability company called Miami Legal Resources, LLC (Miami Legal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before we go further, we pause to note the following, given the somewhat convoluted history of the various related entities: the plaintiff in this case always has been Miami Legal (and Miami Legal is also the appellant here). When suit was filed in May 2014, the plaintiff was identified as the \"Rossdale Group, LLC.\" The records show (and the parties never disputed below) that, at that time, the Rossdale name was duly registered to Miami Legal and Miami Legal was itself in active status as a Florida limited liability company. \"Use of a fictitious business name does not create a separate legal entity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Pinkerton's, Inc. v.

No substitution of parties ever occurred so Miami Legal remained the plaintiff below and is, because the notice of appeal was filed by Rossdale, the appellant here as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In January 2016, Walton filed what he called a \"motion to dismiss.\" Basing his motion on Code of Civil Procedure section 367 and case authority on standing as a jurisdictional defect, Walton argued that the lawsuit had to be dismissed because \"[i]n actuality, The Rossdale Group, LLC, is a fictitious business name registered by a company that has now dissolved\"-a dissolution that occurred after the lawsuit was filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   With the dissolution of Miami Legal, Walton argued, \"the legal entity that is the Plaintiff in this action disappeared.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Miami Legal, filing under the Rossdale name, opposed the motion, supported by a declaration from Susan Lunden (Lunden), who identified herself as the \"CEO\" for the \"Rossdale Group, LLC.\" The opposition contained no denial that Miami Legal had been dissolved. Instead, Miami Legal argued that all of its assets and liabilities had been transferred to a Delaware entity called Rossdale, CLE, Inc. (Rossdale Delaware). According to Miami Legal, Rossdale Delaware had become its \"owner\" in April 2013 (apparently Miami Legal was Rossdale Delaware's subsidiary). The process of transferring the assets and liabilities of Miami Legal to Rossdale Delaware had started in 2013 and by September 2014, the \"entire business\" of Miami Legal had been transferred to Rossdale Delaware, which Miami Legal referred to as its \"successor in interest to the causes of action asserted in their [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] lawsuit.\" The opposition also referred to an \"amend[ment]\" of Rossdale's fictitious business name statement with Florida, which was filed to \"to reflect that The Rossdale Group, LLC is now owned by the new successor in interest, [Rossdale Delaware].\" (Although there are references to this amendment in the supporting declaration to Miami Legal's opposition, no copy of it is in the record.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In his reply, Walton asserted that no documentary evidence was provided by Lunden to support her claim that the assets and liabilities of Miami Legal had in fact been assigned to Rossdale Delaware. He also implied that any such assignment would have been void because it would have been done by the time Miami Legal was dissolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After a hearing on March 3, 2016, the court granted the motion to dismiss. The order states as follows: \"The Rossdale Group, LLC, lacks standing to sue. The Rossdale Group, LLC ('Rossdale') asserts that Defendant Timothy Walton waived any right to complain concerning lack of standing. However, lack of capacity to sue is a jurisdictional defect which may be raised at any time.\n   <em>\n    Common Cause of California v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County\n   </em>\n   (1989)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1974343\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/49/432/#p438\">\n    49 Cal.3d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 438 [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=261%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20574\">\n    261 Cal.Rptr. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=777%20P.2d%20610\">\n    777 P.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] [ (\n   <em>\n    Common Cause\n   </em>\n   ) ] (contentions based on lack of standing involve a jurisdictional challenge and\n   may be raised at any point in the proceeding).

That statute, however, merely provides the general rule that every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 367.) In fact, Walton was pursuing what is called a plea in abatement. \"At common law a number of special pleas in abatement, also called 'dilatory pleas,' were made preliminarily as separate pleadings prior to both the demurrer and pleas in bar. A plea in abatement did not challenge the plaintiff's claim on the merits but merely objected to the particular proceeding to enforce it. The code system abolished the separate pleading but allowed the same kind of objections to be raised by demurrer or answer.\" (5 Witkin, California Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Pleading, \u00a7 1129, p. 556.) As our Supreme Court has stated, \"a plea of lack of capacity of a corporation to maintain an action by reason of a suspension of corporate powers ... 'is a plea in abatement which is not favored in law, is to be strictly construed and must be supported by facts warranting the abatement' at the time of the plea.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 437-439,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=261%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20574\">\n    261 Cal.Rptr. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=777%20P.2d%20610\">\n    777 P.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Our Supreme Court held that the taxpayers did have standing because they were seeking, by a writ of mandamus, to procure the enforcement of a public duty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 439-440,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=261%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20574\">\n    261 Cal.Rptr. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=777%20P.2d%20610\">\n    777 P.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) These facts are far afield from what Walton argued in his motion. This case involves simply a corporate capacity issue. We are not being asked to discern here whether members of the taxpaying public might have standing nor to discern the dividing line between a generalized grievance and particularized injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We also reject the notion that either section 367 or the concept of standing prohibited Miami Legal from pursuing its case under a fictitious name. As our\n   Supreme Court noted over a century ago, \"a person may adopt any name in which to prosecute business, and may sue or be sued in such a name.\" (\n   <em>\n    Emery v. Kipp\n   </em>\n   (1908)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1984649\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal/154/83/#p86\">\n    154 Cal. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 86,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20P.%2017\">\n    97 P. 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In addition, the argument that a \"plaintiff has no standing to sue under a fictitious name\" was more recently rejected in\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Lincoln Unified School Dist.\n   </em>\n   (2010)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054000\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/188/758/#p765\">\n    188 Cal.App.4th 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 765-766,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20191\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.3d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Unified\n   </em>\n   ). In that case, a school teacher brought an action against her school district (among other defendants), seeking a writ of mandate to compel the district to initiate certain proceedings under the Education Code to determine her mental fitness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 762,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20191\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.3d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The teacher brought suit under a fictitious name to protect her privacy and the school district objected, arguing that plaintiff's remedy was to file her documents under seal pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 2.551. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 765,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20191\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.3d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The district's arguments were rejected: \"The question here is not one of standing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Unified, supra,\n   </em>\n   188 Cal.App.4th at p. 765,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20191\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.3d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) \"The\n   question for purposes of standing is not the name used by the party suing but whether the party suing is the party possessing the right sued upon. In this matter, there is no question plaintiff is the party injured by virtue of defendants' actions and, therefore, she is the party possessing the right sued upon. Thus, the question is not whether plaintiff has standing to sue but whether she may do so using a fictitious name.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) The\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Unified\n   </em>\n   court then examined a long line of cases allowing plaintiffs to proceed under a fictitious name.

[Citation.] ' \"A real party in interest ordinarily is defined as the person possessing the right sued upon by reason of the substantive law.\" [Citation.] A complaint filed by someone other than the real party in interest is subject to general demurrer on the ground that it fails to state a cause of action.

Nor did Walton's motion in fact raise any supposed violation of any fictitious name statute. Both this case and\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Unified\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   however, stand for the proposition that, whatever other complications might arise from the use of fictitious names, doing so does not, in and of itself, raise a question of standing or jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The judgment is reversed.

For example, in Walton's motion to dismiss, he brought to the trial court's attention the existence of another limited liability company, also called \"Miami Legal Resources, LLC,\" which had filed its articles of organization with the state of Florida in September 2015. Walton appears to have been anticipating that Miami Legal would argue that all of its assets were transferred to this new entity and so could continue the lawsuit as before. In its opposition, however, Miami Legal conceded that this new entity was \"irrelevant\" to Walton's motion. Why there is or was a second entity using the same name as the first (or even whether it is or was indeed a truly separate entity) has never been explained by Miami Legal and has only added to the convoluted background of this case. The record does show that the first Miami Legal was dissolved in September 2014. And the current status report available from Florida's Division of Corporations, which we take judicial notice of on our own motion, shows the second Miami Legal appears to be operating under the same taxpayer identification number as the first Miami Legal. (See Florida Division of Corporations, &lt; http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&amp; directionType=Initial&amp; searchNameOrder=MIAMILEGALRESOURCESL\u00a8150001509300&amp; aggregateId=flal-l15000150930-fc58a47e-9a4f-4a34-ba92-46fbed3e9c8c&amp; searchTerm=MiamiL\u00a8egal&amp; listNameOrder=MIAMILEGALASSISTP\u00a8160000012750&gt;, as of Jun. 6, 2017.) Because Walton's motion did not cite any state statute regarding Miami Legal's status and relied only on standing and jurisdictional arguments, we need not discuss this topic in detail.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Walton's brief as respondent was stricken for his failure to pay the filing fee required by Government Code section 68926, subdivision (b). As a result, we may accept as true the facts stated in appellant's opening brief. (See\n    <em>\n     Miles v.

As we have mentioned, neither Walton's motion nor the memorandum in support of it state statute relating to either a fictitious name registration problem or capacity to sue based on a dissolution. Walton's motion was instead based solely on standing and jurisdiction (which he argued were inherent in Code of Civil Procedure section 367 ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    We note that at least one court has treated a motion to strike pleadings raising corporate capacity issues as akin to a motion for summary judgment because of the disputed nature of the evidence and applied the same standard of review applicable to such motions. (See\n    <em>\n     Mediterranean Exports, Inc. v. Superior Court\n    </em>\n    (1981)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2058351\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/119/605/#p615\">\n     119 Cal.App.3d 605\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 615,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=174%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20169\">\n     174 Cal.Rptr. 169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) The procedural difficulties raised by pleas in abatement are perhaps caused by the fact that their common law origins fit uneasily in today's code centered environment.
