The superior court sustained the demurrers of the City and real parties to SJJC's first amended petition and complaint without leave to amend.

(Atlantic),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is a fixed base operator (FBO) that currently operates a full-service facility at the Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport, which is owned by the City. In early 2012 the City addressed a plan to add a second FBO on the west side of the airport. The new FBO would, according to the City's expectations, \"create a competitive environment for facilities providing a range of services to the public, meeting the needs of Silicon Valley companies for access to global markets, providing economic benefit to the region, and revenue to the City and Airport.\" Consistent with that plan, in August 2012 the City issued a request for proposals (RFP) \"for the development and operation of aeronautical services facilities to serve general aviation\n   activities at the [airport].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to a specific description of the operations and services to be undertaken, the detailed requirements for the proposal included an explanation of the proposer's experience, financial qualifications, management and business plan, and marketing approach, as well as a \"proposed rent schedule\" and lease term.\n   In the RFP the City explained that an evaluation panel would first determine, according to pass/fail criteria,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which proposals were responsive and then rank those responsive proposals using scoring criteria. The scoring criteria most important to the City were revenue to the airport and revenue to the City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The selected respondent or respondents would be recommended to the City Council for the award of a ground lease and operating agreement. The RFP emphasized that revenue generation would be the \"primary consideration\" in selecting the proposals to be submitted for approval; the highest revenue-generating proposal would be placed at the site, with the second highest proposal to merit placement on the remaining available land. The RFP also emphasized that proposals that did not conform to the standards and procedures described might be considered \"non-responsive and subject to rejection.\" Attached to the RFP was an \"Exemplar Agreement\" which was anticipated to govern the parties' relationship \"in substantially the form attached to this RFP,\" but with revisions incorporating pertinent details of the successful bidder's proposal. The City reserved the right \"to waive any informality or irregularity in any proposal.\" It also reserved \"the right to reject any and all proposals or portions thereof received in response to this RFP and thereafter reissue the RFP.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The City received responses from three companies: Signature, Ross Aviation (Ross), and SJJC. Signature's proposal offered a 50-year lease term with a capital investment of $82 million. It anticipated construction of a facility covering 29 acres\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   encompassing a terminal, seven hangars, and a shop area. SJJC, on the other hand, proposed a \"phased approach\": Rather than immediate construction of facilities, it contemplated\n   <em>\n    planning\n   </em>\n   for development; it would pay \"up to $290 million\" in exchange for five-year options to develop the entire west side of the airport. Some of the specific requested elements of the RFP were deemed inapplicable-for example, no management plan was included because SJJC's proposal was \"not defined as FBO or SASO.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, SJJC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   did not include a business plan because \"[t]he proposal is not specifically defined as of this time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both Ross's and SJJC's proposals were rejected as nonresponsive. Ross's proposal had failed to include FBO storage information, a \"pass/fail\" selection criterion. SJJC had omitted nine required elements, including a rent proposal, its minimum capital investment, and minimum guaranteed property, sales, and use taxes. The staff summary of the three proposals indicated that SJJC had described no facility, whereas Ross and Signature had outlined provisions for a terminal, hangar, shop area, and ramp, among other terms relating to the lease area and specific sources of projected revenue generation for the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Both Ross and SJJC submitted letters of protest. In SJJC's letter it acknowledged that its proposal had not addressed all the specific items the City had identified as disqualifying it for consideration. Because it was \"not proposing any facilities,\" several of the requested items were considered \"not applicable to Atlantic's proposal.\" In SJJC's view, however, its \"strictly financial proposal\"-\"[i]n essence a simple real estate development agreement\"-offered a higher value to the City, consistent with the City Council's intent \"to make revenue generation the primary consideration in a successful proposal.\" SJJC believed that its \"Plan First\" approach was superior to the \"RFP First\" approach contemplated by the City, because it would allow the airport to \"pursue a comprehensive planning process\" in partnership with SJJC, thus accruing revenue while maintaining \"total flexibility\" to develop the land once the City determined the \"highest-and-best use\" for the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Unsuccessful in its protest, SJJC then submitted an appeal challenging both its disqualification and the City's \"Notice of Intended Award\" to Signature. The City Attorney advised the City Council that the defects in SJJC's proposal were material and thus not waivable as minor irregularities; to accept its proposal with such material omissions \"would result in Atlantic['s] gaining a competitive advantage over the proposer that complied with all of the RFP submittal requirements.\" SJJC complained that the City had not followed its own procedures, having rejected SJJC's proposal while ignoring \"serious material flaws in Signature's [p]roposal.\" In SJJC's view, the City had treated Signature preferentially instead of adhering to the same standards. Thus, if the City upheld the rejection of SJJC's proposal, it should reject Signature's as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In anticipation of the City Council's meeting on the FBO project, William F. Sherry, the Director of Aviation for the City, updated the council on the negotiations with Signature, which he had already recommended for the award. Sherry reminded the council that it had directed the RFP to specify that the successful applicant would be subject to the existing \"Airport Curfew\n   Ordinance\" that applied to existing FBOs and their subtenants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those existing leases contained curfew provisions that went beyond the curfew ordinance, but they were applicable only if they were contained in all FBO leases. However, Signature-and in particular, its subtenant, BCH-had objected to the additional provisions. BCH was concerned about the term that allowed the City to\n   evict a tenant if it violated the curfew even once, even though that had never occurred since the addition of the provisions in 2004. Nevertheless, Signature was willing to agree to the provisions in the lease presented to it, which contained a term requiring compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Sherry believed that this provision was sufficient to bind Signature to the curfew ordinance, and he recommended not including the additional curfew term in the proposed Signature lease. The existing curfew terms with the other tenants, including SJJC, would then no longer be enforceable; all would be subjected only to the curfew ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the City Council hearing on April 9, 2013, SJJC's attorney voiced its objections to the recommendation of Signature for the award, identifying defects in Signature's proposal that should invalidate acceptance of its bid. SJJC also had objections to the City Council's approval of staff recommendations until completion of the environmental review process under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After hearing from representatives of the affected entities and the public, the City Council \"denied\" SJJC's appeal. It then heard input from affected parties regarding the curfew provisions and other issues. Following the April 9 hearing, the City Council adopted a resolution authorizing the City Manager to negotiate a ground lease and operating agreement with Signature for the construction and operation of its FBO facility. One week later a supplemental resolution authorized the City Manager to execute those agreements, as amended to use the general language currently used in airline leases-that is, a requirement to comply with all laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   SJJC filed two petitions for a writ of mandate in May 2013 against the City and the City Council, naming Signature and BCH. The first, filed on May 9, challenged the award to Signature as a violation of CEQA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second, the subject of this appeal, was filed May 16, seeking an order to rescind the\n   award and reissue the RFP. Each petition was combined with a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In July 2013 Signature, joined by BCH, demurred to the petition and moved to strike portions of it, as did the City. The superior court denied the motions to strike without prejudice, but it sustained the demurrers in part with leave to amend, finding an insufficient basis for the vague allegations that state and local law and \"ministerial and/or mandatory duties must have been breached.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   SJJC filed its first amended petition and complaint on October 23, 2013. As it had in the previous pleading, it complained that the City had \"prejudicially abused its discretion and acted arbitrarily and capriciously by awarding the [FBO] Project to Signature.\" According to SJJC, the City had favored Signature, overlooking the deficiencies in Signature's proposal and materially deviating from the requirements of the RFP, thus giving Signature a competitive advantage over the other proposers. The City thus violated its \"clear mandatory, ministerial, non-discretionary duty\" to conduct a fair RFP process by failing to disqualify the Signature proposal and by changing the terms of the RFP, including the curfew requirements. SJJC invoked the S.J.M.C. as the basis for its allegation of an unfair, biased procedure, referring to chapters 4.12 and 4.07, and specifically citing\n   sections 4.12.210, 4.12.215, 14.07.100, 14.07.300, 14.07.600, 14.07.660, and 14.07.560(B). It also alleged violations of sections 1217 and 1302 of the City's charter (pertaining to bid requirements for public works projects and grants of franchises respectively). In addition to its request for a writ of mandate, SJJC sought a judicial declaration of the City's violations and an injunction to stop the City and Signature from proceeding with the project. Both SJJC and the public, SJJC alleged, would be \"irreparably harmed\" if the court did not force the City to set aside its prior approval and \"rebid the Project\" in compliance with state and municipal law, the City's charter, and the RFP itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Signature (jointly with BCH) and the City each demurred again, asserting that SJJC had failed to cite any applicable statutory duty that the City had violated. The cited provisions of the City's charter and its municipal code were inapplicable, they argued, because they concerned public works projects and public utility franchises, whereas the RFP at issue was for a lease of public property for a private FBO facility involving no expenditure by the City. They further argued that SJJC had no standing, other than through its CEQA challenge, to oppose the FBO award to Signature because SJJC was not a party \"beneficially interested\" within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1086 (hereafter, section 1086 ); instead, it was only a competitor which had submitted a nonresponsive bid. Real parties also renewed their motion to strike, in which the City joined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   SJJC responded that it was not required to allege \"a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     specific\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   legal provision to support a petition for a writ of mandate.\" In addition to the code sections already cited, the City violated the terms of the RFP itself by accepting a proposal with material omissions, contrary to the City's \"inherent\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     duty\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to treat all proposals the same.\" SJJC also responded to the assertion that it had no standing to petition for the writ: it did have standing as \"a party who participated in the skewed RFP process,\" because it was \"specifically and adversely affected by the City's modification of the curfew requirements (and Exemplar Agreement) after all the proposals were submitted and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the release of the Notice of Intended Award.\" Such \"arbitrary actions,\" SJJC argued, \"provided Signature with a competitive advantage at the expense of Atlantic (and others)\" and thus \"compel that [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] the award be rescinded and rebid.\" SJJC also claimed \" 'citizen standing' \" to bring this action \"in order to protect the public fisc,\" an undertaking for which it believed it was especially well suited as one of the three entities that had bid on the project and as a current airport tenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 18, 2014, the court heard argument on the demurrers together with the motion to strike and several requests for judicial notice. On March 4, 2014, it filed its order sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend. After taking judicial notice of the text of the code sections on which SJJC had relied, the court concluded that SJJC had failed to cite applicable authority supporting its assertion that the City had violated a mandatory duty. It had also failed to allege abuse of discretion. The court denied further leave to amend, because SJJC had failed to show how any amendment would change the legal effect of its pleading. On May 2, 2014, the court entered its judgment dismissing the action with prejudice. SJJC then brought this timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   SJJC contends that the court erred in sustaining the City's and real parties'\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   demurrers\n   because it had pleaded legally sufficient causes of action showing abuse of discretion in the City's RFP process and award to Signature.

In claiming a beneficial interest as one of the entities that submitted bids to the City, SJJC fails to show how the alleged defect in the City's RFP process undermined the effort by SJJC to submit a responsive proposal, or how it made any difference in the process of determining which bids were responsive. The reason SJJC's bid was rejected had nothing to do with existing curfew conditions; it was rejected because it did not include nine of the required items listed in the RFP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Any additional criterion in which the proposer would have had to agree to a more restrictive curfew would not have enhanced the chances of SJJC's success in either the bidding process or its challenge to the City's decision, because its own bid inadequately addressed the objectives of the RFP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The superior court articulated a significant point at the demurrer hearing. The change of which SJJC complains occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the City determined which of the three submissions met all of the criteria listed in the RFP-and more importantly, that change did not relax any requirements that existed at the time the RFP was issued, such as the obligation to follow existing law. The Exemplar Agreement itself did not contain the proposed curfew term to which Signature and BCH objected-i.e., the potential eviction of noncompliant aircraft and termination of the lease. Although the City attempted to make the curfew policy more restrictive (consistent with existing FBO leases at the airport) before completing the award to Signature, Signature refused to agree to the additional term, and the parties were, as the court put it, brought \"back to square one,\" with no additional curfew restriction beyond what had been presented in the RFP. Thus, the eventual award did not grant Signature any benefits beyond what any responsive bidder would have enjoyed. And even if SJJC were able to show that a benefit did accrue to Signature through the retraction of the proposed additional curfew restriction, that benefit could not\n   have had any effect on SJJC, which remained a nonresponsive bidder for reasons independent of the curfew issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   SJJC argues that even if its bid was nonresponsive, it still has a beneficial interest because it would have an opportunity to submit a new bid responsive to a new RFP issued \"on fair and lawful terms.\" In effect, SJJC envisions a judicially mandated opportunity for a losing bidder to submit a successful proposal even when the losing bid was incontrovertibly nonresponsive. The court was under no duty to provide such a second bite at the apple in those circumstances. Thus, even assuming that the City impermissibly relaxed its curfew restrictions to benefit Signature, we fail to see how a new RFP would make any difference to SJJC's chances of success, since its proposal was disqualified at the preliminary phase for failing to conform to the City's criteria in multiple respects\n   <em>\n    unrelated\n   </em>\n   to curfew conditions. We\n   must conclude, therefore, that SJJC did not suffer prejudice from either the failure to include the proposed curfew restriction in the original RFP or the alleged change in the curfew conditions culminating in the City's award of the lease to Signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   SJJC relies on\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Lima\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Hamilton Corp\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1962)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2106207\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/208/803/\">\n    208 Cal.App.2d 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20798\">\n    25 Cal.Rptr. 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ) to illustrate its point about receiving a second chance. Its reliance is misplaced. In that case Baldwin, in the second of its two bids, was awarded a contract to furnish equipment to the City and County of San Francisco, but that second bid was nonresponsive because Baldwin had not complied with a term requiring manufacture of the equipment in the United States. Although that term was deemed invalid, its first bid, while responsive to the bid call, was higher than that of its competitor, petitioner Allis. The superior court properly issued a writ of mandate based on abuse of discretion by the city's purchasing agent in awarding the contract to Baldwin.

It contends that it was \"adversely affected by the City's arbitrary failure to timely disclose-until after the bids had been submitted-that it would change the conditions of the RFP.\" (Emphasis omitted.) But beyond this conclusory assertion SJJC does not explain\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   it was harmed by the process leading to the City's decision.

The inability to make that showing confirms that even if the City abused its discretion in accepting Signature's proposal, no prejudice to SJJC has resulted. SJJC submitted a patently nonresponsive proposal, which was properly rejected for failing to conform to even the most basic requirements of the RFP. No reissuance of the RFP setting forth the S.J.M.C. curfew laws would improve SJJC's prospects of that proposal's being selected. In short, neither SJJC nor the public would derive any benefit from reversal of the superior court's order. The court properly denied the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    3\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Injunctive Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In its second cause of action SJJC sought an injunction to prevent the City and Signature from pursuing the project \"until such time as the City has\n   rejected all responses to its RFP and re-issue [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] the RFP, pursuant to S.J.M.C. section 14.07.620(A), in compliance with its mandatory\n   legal duties under its own Charter, Municipal Code, State law, and all other applicable rules, regulations, procedures and express terms of the RFP.\" SJJC alleged that without such an order it would suffer \"great and irreparable harm,\" including deprivation of \"an opportunity to participate in a fair, unbiased RFP process\" conducted in compliance with those \"laws and regulations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In its demurrer the City (joined by Signature) asserted the same grounds as in its challenge to SJJC's request for mandamus relief-that is, (1) SJJC had failed to identify any mandatory duty violated by the City; and (2) it lacked a beneficial interest sufficient to confer standing to challenge the award to Signature. As noted earlier, the superior court agreed with the City and Signature that SJJC had \"conspicuously fail[ed] to identify any \"specific law, statute or regulation imposing a mandatory/ministerial duty\" that the City had violated. The court also rejected SJJC's attempt to state a cause of action \"by simply alleging that the City of San Jose violated the terms of the RFP itself.\" Finally, the court stated that SJJC had \"fail[ed] to properly allege any abuse of discretion\" by the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On appeal, SJJC maintains that it has standing to seek injunctive relief because it is an unsuccessful bidder with no adequate remedy at law.

Although the superior court did not directly address the request for an injunction, it implicitly determined that SJJC was not entitled to this remedy because it had failed to cite an\n   <em>\n    applicable\n   </em>\n   S.J.M.C. or charter provision supporting its allegation that the City had \"arbitrarily and capriciously conduct[ed] an irregular, inconsistent and biased RFP process\" in contravention of the S.J.M.C. and \"well-settled State law.\" We find no error in this reasoning. In addition, as discussed earlier, even if the City departed from its own RFP procedure by altering the curfew requirements, that deviation had no effect on SJJC, whose bid was unquestionably nonresponsive for multiple reasons that were independent of the curfew conditions. As SJJC will suffer no actual injury\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   by the conduct of which it complains, the court was not required to enjoin the City and Signature from pursuing the FBO agreement they had reached.

While denying that the current pleading is insufficient, SJJC submits that it can cure the defect \"to more clearly allege and demonstrate that the City is subject [to] the requirements of the Public Contract Code and its mandatory duties.\" SJJC suggests that \"the provisions of the Public Contract Code may be applicable to\n   the City, even though it is a charter city,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   as provided by Public Contract Code [section] 1100.7,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it asserts that with leave to amend, it will \"further allege more specific violations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   It is not enough, however, for a plaintiff to assert generally that applicable statutory provisions exist and that it will allege a violation of those provisions in its next pleading.
