The steamboat was adjudged by the court below to have been solely at fault, and it was decreed that the libelant recover accordingly. A careful examination of the evidence has satisfied us that the decree should be affirmed. No culpability appears on the part of the barge, or of the tug R. G. Townsend, which had the barge in tow on the occasion in question. While slowly passing out under one bell and before leaving the slip the tug blew the usual long whistle to notify vessels on the river of its approach. When the steamboat gave her first signal of two short whistles the tug with the barge promptly stopped in order that the steamboat might safely pass up the river to, the westward of them. The signal thus given by the steamboat was a notification to the tug and barge that she would so pass to the westward. If the steamboat had, upon' first blowing her whistle; immediately put her helm to starboard she would, according to the evidence, have swung sufficiently to port to enable her to clear the barge. But this she omitted to do; and when she did starboard her helm it was too late. It was in the middle of the day, she 'had plenty of water way and there was nothing to prevent her from pursuing a proper and safe course. Nothing but gross negligence can account for the omission by the steamboat to observe her plain duty. The decree of the court below -is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
