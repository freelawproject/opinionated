The question that was answered was then put. It was, \u201c What did you observe about the effect on his mind of this dog bite, if any ? \u201d The answer was, \u201c Well, he was mentally depressed.\u201d We assume in the defendant\u2019s favor that the objection and exception taken to the question which was first put apply to the question which was answered. The question and answer were plainly admissible. As finally put the question called only for what the witness had observed in his attendance upon, the plaintiff, and the answer was confined to that. So far as the answer involved matter of opinion it was something in regard to which the witness as a physician was clearly competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"AZH\">The next question was, \u201c And in what way did that evidence itself ? \u201d This question was not objected to. The answer was, \u201c Well, it evidenced itself in himself and in his family. I took my meals at his house and every time that I would return to a meal I would find the whole family depressed, and his mother in particular.\u201d Thereupon counsel for the defendant said to the judge, \u201c <em>Now </em>does your Honor allow me an exception to evidence of this family worry <em>et cetera ? </em>\u201d The judge responded, \u201c I haven\u2019t heard you claim any yet.\u201d Counsel replied, \u201c I have to the answer of the witness before.\u201d The judge said, \u201cYour exception may be noted.\u201d It will be observed that the exception relied on by the defendant was that previously taken and which has already been considered, and that the exception so taken was a general one to the competency of the question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>That exception having been overruled it would seem to follow that this one must be also. The question to which the answer was made that the defendant objected to was a proper one, and, if the defendant wished to have any part of the answer stricken out as irresponsive, he should have made a motion to that effect. As it was, the judge evidently understood that he was relying on the general exception which he had taken to the question which had been previously admitted against his objection and ruled accordingly. It cannot be said that the ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The remaining exception to the question \u201c What is the danger to hydrophobia, of hydrophobia from a dog bite ? \u201d which was allowed to be put against the defendant\u2019s objection has not been argued, and we treat it as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
