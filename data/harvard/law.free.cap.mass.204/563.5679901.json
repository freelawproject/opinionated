See for example <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Pitts, </em>7 Cush. 503 ; <em>Knowlton </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>136 Mass. 32; <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>199 Mass. 1, 3. The tax deeds in question in the cases of <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Crapo, </em>127 Mass. 39, <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Boardman, </em>149 Mass. 106, and <em>Downey </em>v. <em>Lancy, </em>178 Mass. 465, were cases where the tax title was attacked for defects of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">There was no defect of this kind in the ease at bar. The sale was duly made and the statutory requirements were all complied with. If the title here in question is void, it is void because although the sale was valid the deed is not in due form.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">A.t common law a deed under a power is valid if it conveys the property and the power to execute it is proved <em>aliunde. </em>See for example <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>6 Allen, 576, 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">But the form of a tax deed in Massachusetts is a matter which has been regulated by statute for more than a century. (St. 1785, c. 70, \u00a7 7. Rev. Sts. c. 8, \u00a7 31. Gen. Sts. c. 12, \u00a7 35. Pub. Sts. c. 12, \u00a7 38. St. 1888, c. 390, \u00a7 43. R. L. c. 13, \u00a7 43.) It has been established law for a long time that a tax deed is void which does not contain the statements prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-14\">One of the facts which must be set forth in a tax deed is (and always has been, see St. 1785, c. 70, \u00a7 7) a statement of \u201cthe cause of sale.\u201d R. L. c. 13, \u00a7 43. It was held in <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>6 Allen, 576, that by this is meant a statement of such facts as show that there was a legal cause of sale. The plaintiff\u2019s contention is that the tax title here in question is bad because (1) the deed does not state that the assessment for State, county and city taxes assessed upon Maria L. S. de Vaudreuil as owner of the land conveyed by the deed was assessed by the assessors of the city of Worcester, and because (2) it is not there stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>that this was included in the tax list committed by the assessors with their warrant to the collector in accordance with R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\">The deed is in the form authorized by St. 1901, c. 519. It is identical with that form with one exception, to wit: It begins with a statement that the grantor was collector of taxes for the city of Worcester. But the form authorized by St. 1901, c. 519, ends with a statement to that effect. The repetition of that statement at the beginning of the deed is of no consequence. St. 1901, c. 519, was repealed in terms by R. L. c. 227. The question of the validity of 'the deed here in question therefore depends upon its being a \u201c suitable \u201d one within the provision of R. L. c. 13, \u00a7 87, that \u201cother suitable forms may also be used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">In determining whether this deed sets forth a legal cause of sale with sufficient accuracy, no reliance can be put on the use of the word \u201cduly.\u201d The deed must state facts and not the collector\u2019s opinion as to facts, or (as it is usually put) a tax deed must state facts and not conclusions of law. <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Dungan, </em>99 Mo. 126. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>91 Mo. 616. <em>Spurlock </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>49 Mo. 178. <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Gillette, </em>37 Kans. 156. <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>White, </em>69 Texas, 103. <em>Maddocks </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>89 Maine, 336, 337. Cooley on Taxation, (3d ed.) 998, 999. Blackwell on Tax Titles, (5th ed.) \u00a7 778. The tax deed in question in <em>O'Grady </em>v. <em>Barnhisel, </em>23 Cal. 287, followed the words of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"A6ht\">Again, in determining what is a suitable form (apart from a form allowed by statute) it is proper to consider what forms have been used in practice. The form most commonly used in Massachusetts is that set forth in the report in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>126 Mass. 278, to wit: \u201c Whereas, the assessors of taxes of-, in the list of assessments for taxes which they committed to me to collect for the year-, duly assessed-as owner of the real estate in said city, which is hereinafter described, the sum \u201d etc. It appears from the report of <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>Pixley, </em>164 Mass. 335, and from the original papers in <em>Lunenburg </em>v. <em>Heywood Chair Co. </em>118 Mass. 540, <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Crapo, </em>127 Mass. 39, <em>Knowlton </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>136 Mass. 32, and <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>142 Mass. 576, that the deeds in those cases were in the same form. The deed in <em>Harrington v. Worcester, </em>6 Allen, 576, and the form authorized by St. 1888, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>c. 390, \u00a7 96, form 14, and by R. L. c. 13, \u00a7 87, form 14, are not materially different.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\">The singular thing about these deeds and all the forms of tax deeds set forth in the statutes is that although the issuance by the assessors of their warrant to the collector is the foundation of a legal right to collect the taxes committed to him and so is the foundation of a legal cause of sale, no form and no deed that has come to our attention states in terms that the assessors issued their warrant to the collector. (For the form of such a warrant see St. 1785, c. 50, \u00a7 6.) Under these circumstances it could not be held that the statement of a legal cause of sale in the deed here in question is insufficient because it is not stated in terms that the assessors issued their warrant to collect this tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">While the power of selling land for non-payment of taxes is <em>striotissimi juris </em>and for that reason the statutory requirements of a valid sale must be complied with in minute particulars, the terms in which a tax deed must be drawn are not <em>striotissimi iuris, </em>and it is not necessary to state the facts which must be set out in a tax deed with the precision of a common law indictment. No right of the owner is affected or secured by the statement in the tax deed of \u201c the cause of sale \u201d in the sense in which that is true of the requirement that \u201c the residence of the grantee \u201d from whom the owner has a right to redeem must be stated in the tax deed. In the statement of \u201c the cause of sale \u201d a reasonable certainty in our opinion is sufficient. And having in mind what must be taken to be a sufficient statement of the issuance by the assessors of their warrant to the collector, we are of opinion that the statement in this deed, omitting the word \u201c duly,\u201d is a sufficient statement that the tax here in question was assessed by the assessors, and that they issued their warrant to the collector to collect the same. It is to be noted as to the latter fact that now a warrant may be issued by the assessors to collect taxes at any one of three different times, namely, within a reasonable time after the original assessments are completed; R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 67; after assessments which were omitted in the original list have been made; R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 85; and after re-assessments; R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 86. If a warrant were issued under R. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 85 or 86, the statement in the form authorized by St. 1888, c. 390, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u00a7 96, form 14, and by R. L. c. 13, \u00a7 87, form 14, is not strictly accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s mortgage contained a covenant that the premises were free of incumbrances. The tax deed here in question was a valid one and was in existence at the date of that deed. The defendant has a right to retain the sum paid for extinguishing it. See also R. L. c. 134, \u00a7 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
