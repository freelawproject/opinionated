The plaintiff introduced evidence showing that he was a manufacturer and that the defendant agreed to buy from him all his glue material for five years, paying for it during the first two years in shares of the defendant\u2019s capital stock at par and thereafter in cash, that the plaintiff delivered to the defendant certain glue material and received the shares in question, that the plaintiff asked the defendant\u2019s vice president, who also was one of its directors and one of its executive committee of three, whether there was any doubt as to the value of the shares, that the vice president answered, \u201c No, not a bit; if you have any doubt about it I will take it off your hands and pay you a hundred cents on the dollar,\u201d that the plaintiff asked the defendant\u2019s vice president to put that in writing, whereupon the vice president wrote and signed in his individual name the following: \u201c In regard to our talk over the phone I hereby agree to pay you one hundred cents on the dollar for your stock in the Glue Company.\u201d The plaintiff called as a witness the defendant\u2019s vice president, who testified that he did not propose to purchase the shares in his own behalf, but he did not testify that he undertook to act iu behalf of the defendant or anybody else. He testified that one of the other three members of the executive committee acted in conjunction with him in trying to secure the rights of the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the testimony last mentioned did not warrant a finding that a majority of the executive committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>agreed to a purchase of the plaintiffs shares on hehalf of the defendant, that there was no evidence that the vice president?in signing the agreement to buy the plaintiffs shares was acting for the defendant or was authorized to act for it, and that a verdict rightly was ordered for the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b101-4\">Contract or tort against a corporation, the first count, in tort, alleging in substance that the defendant with intent to defraud the plaintiff made false and fraudulent representations to him, and thereby induced him to deliver to the defendant large quantities of glue material in exchange for shares of the capital stock of the defendant, and the second count, in contract, alleging the breach of a contract to buy from the plaintiff at par one hundred and twenty-seven shares of the capital stock of the defendant.

The directors elected on J une 17,1904, held over until October 21, 1905, when a new election took place. At some time not stated before August 29,1905, the plaintiff was elected the defendant\u2019s treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">On January 25, 1904, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a contract by which the plaintiff was to deliver to the defendant all his glue material for five years and to be paid for it as follows: For the glue material delivered during the first two years one share of preferred and one half share of common stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>in the defendant corporation for every one hundred dollars\u2019 worth of glue material; and for that delivered thereafter, in cash. The plaintiff proceeded to deliver glue material under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\">About August 29, 1905, the plaintiff asked one Lennox (who was a director, vice president and one of the executive committee of the defendant corporation) whether there was any doubt as \"to the value of the stock of the defendant corporation. To which Lennox answered: \u201c No, not a bit; if you have any doubt about it I will take it off your hands and pay you a hundred cents on the dollar.\u201d The plaintiff asked him to put that in writing and Lennox accordingly wrote to the plaintiff the following letter under date of August 29,1905: \u201c In regard to our talk over the phone I hereby agree to pay you one hundred cents on the dollar for your stock in the Glue Company.\u201d This was signed \u201c James T. Lennox.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">This letter was admitted <em>de lene </em>on the offer of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to make it competent by showing that although the letter was signed by Lennox personally he was in fact acting for the defendant corporation and was authorized to act for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The plaintiff failed to do either.</p>\n<p id=\"ArC\">Lennox, when put upon the witness stand, testified that, when he signed the letter of August 29, \u201c I did not propose to purchase Kelley\u2019s stock on my own behalf.\u201d But he did not testify that in signing that letter he undertook to act on behalf of anybody else, much less that he undertook to act in the defendant\u2019s behalf. He testified that \u201c the concern was not successful,\u201d and \u201c we were all dissatisfied with the result received from the management of the business and I think we all agreed that it would be a good idea to dispose of it to somebody that would pay more attention to it.\u201d But when asked if the purchase of stock was talked over in directors\u2019 meetings he persisted in saying that it was not, and went further and said, \u201cI worked entirely independent of the company.\u201d Lennox did say that he had neg\u00f3tiated with persons entitled to stock who were in fact a majority of the board of directors, for the sale of their stock. But there was nothing in his testimony that warranted a finding that these negotiations were for a sale to the corporation, or that a majority of the board knew that he was undertaking to bjjy stock in the defendant\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Lennox also testified that one Clark \u201c acted in conjunction with me in trying to secure the rights of the tanners.\u201d Clark and Lennox were a majority of the executive committee which consisted of three persons. But this evidence did not warrant a finding that a majority of the executive committee agreed to a purchase of the tanners\u2019 stock on behalf of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">The only other evidence introduced by the plaintiff was the testimony of an attorney at law. But there was nothing in hia testimony which helped the plaintiff. It has not been alluded to by the learned counsel for the plaintiff either in his argument or in his brief and need not be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
