Goodsell against Etta A., Bernard and David H. Shalit, alleging in substance that the defendants were in possession of certain personal property formerly of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, which they claimed as a valid <em>donatio causa mortis; </em>that the defendant Etta A. Shalit was in possession of certain real estate \u201c belonging to the estate of the said Penfield B. Goodsell, the title to which stood in his name at the time of his death \u201d and of which he was in possession and control at the time of his death; \u201cthat there was a certain alleged deed of the said prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>erty running from said Penfield B. Goodsell to said Bernard Shalit, which was in the office of Evelyn B. Goodsell and Penfield B. Goodsell; that one R. W. Gloag, an attorney, who had desk room in the office occupied by the said Evelyn B. Goodsell, after the death of said Penfield B. Goodsell, delivered up the deed to said Bernard Shalit, who caused the same to be put on record and has since conveyed the same to his mother, the said Etta A. Shalit\u201d ; that the estate of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate had been declared insolvent; \u201cthat, even if said Penfield B. Goodsell, in his lifetime, made a gift of the property hereinbefore referred to, which plaintiff denies, he was at the time insolvent and said gifts are void as against his creditors and as against the administrator of his estate, who has duly demanded said property so claimed by the defendants to enable him to pay the debts of the estate of said Penfield B. Goodsell.\u201d The prayers of the bill were that the defendants be ordered to deliver to the plaintiff the personal property described in the bill, and that the defendant Etta A. Shalit be ordered to convey to him the real estate, and that she and the defendant Bernard Shalit be ordered to account to the plaintiff for the rents and income of the real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-5\">The case was heard by <em>Fox, </em>J., who filed the following report of material facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">\u201cPenfield B.

The deed was immediately put on record and the property was subsequently deeded to Etta A. Shalit, the respondent, who has since been in possession and control of the real estate.

Gloag, attorney, was given for a good and valuable consideration and was a valid conveyance and good as against the plaintiff or the creditors of Penfield B.

L. c. 142, \u00a7 2, having been represented insolvent, and commissioners appointed by the Probate Court, the administrator as their representative could recover for the payment of debts property conveyed by the intestate in fraud of his creditors. But an administrator cannot maintain either a writ of entry or the concurrent remedy of a bill in equity to recover possession of land fraudulently conveyed unless he first obtains a license to sell. R. L. c. 146, \u00a7 17. <em>Pease </em>v. Pease, 8 Met. 395. <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>152 Mass. 257. <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>156 Mass. 203. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>189 Mass. 353, 357. <em>Tyndale </em>v. <em>Stanwood, </em>190 Mass. 513, 516. If a demurrer had been interposed or the defense specially raised in the answer, the bill must have been dismissed as to the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>estate, for it contained no averment of this jurisdictional requirement, and the record fails to show that a license was granted. It is only by operation of the statute that an administrator upon recovery is enabled to transmit the title of his intestate to purchasers as if the fraudulent conveyance had not been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">By the memorandum of facts, the defendant holds under a voluntary conveyance from her son. If, therefore, the first conveyance was invalid, the defendant, not having been a purchaser for value, cannot retain the land. But upon evidence not reported the presiding judge found, that even if at the date of the deed to the defendant\u2019s son, as well as at his decease, the intestate was insolvent, the conveyance was given in payment of services rendered by the grantee. A preference founded upon a valuable consideration, although made with intent to defeat other creditors, is valid at common law. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>6 Mass. 338, 342. <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Walcott, </em>15 Pick. 94, 97. If proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency have not been instituted before the debtor\u2019s death, the right of his administrator to set aside a preference depends solely on our statutes relating to the distribution among creditors of the estate. But no provisions similar to those found in B,. L. c. 163, \u00a7 110, governing preferences made by insolvent debtors having been enacted as to the settlement of insolvent estates of deceased persons, the common law controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">If, however, the plaintiff cannot set aside the preference, the further finding that the deed was delivered in escrow to take effect on the grantor\u2019s death does not as the plaintiff contends avoid the conveyance or entitle him to a decree for a reconveyance or for its cancellation. It was the intention of the grantor that the scrivener, to whom he gave instructions accordingly, should take and retain possession until the grantor\u2019s death, when the deed was to be delivered to the grantee upon payment by him of the expenses of preparing the instrument. The directions having been followed and the payment made, there was an acceptance by the grantee, and the estate vested from the time of the execution of the deed. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Mansfield, </em>3 Met. 412. <em>O'Kelly </em>v. <em>O'Kelly, </em>8 Met. 436. <em>Timothy </em>v.
