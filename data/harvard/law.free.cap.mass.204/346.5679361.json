The agreement contained a statement of certain restrictions, a covenant on the part of P. to hold his land subject thereto during a certain period, and a covenant by the defendant to hold certain land of his own, including a part of that here in question, subject to the same restrictions for the same period. A master to whom the case was referred found that it was a term of the oral contract between the parties, of which the agent\u2019s letter was a memorandum, that the land should be conveyed subject to <em>\u201c </em>the usual W. restrictions,\u201d that this phrase was intended by the defendant and his agent to mean those restrictions which already had been imposed by the agreement of P., and that at the time of the. oral contract the plaintiff understood this phrase to refer to some restrictions existing on the land but did not have in mind the agreement of P. until it was sent to him by the defendant\u2019s agent, after which he wrote to the defendant's agent reciting his purchase and agreeing to pay the stipulated price. The master also found that there was no dispute between the parties as to these restrictions until a disagreement had arisen between them as to other matters. The defendant contended that the minds of the parties never met upon the matter of the restrictions, which was a material part of their bargain, and therefore that no contract was made. <em>Held, </em>that the phrase \u201c the usual W. restrictions \u201d used in the letter of the defendant\u2019s agent had been fixed and made -certain through the subsequent adoption by the parties of the restrictions in the agreement of P. as the ones intended by the words used, and that a final and complete agreement had been reached between the plaintiff and the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-9\">A memorandum of a contract for the sale of land belonging <em>to one W. </em>signed by the agent of W., which contains in all other respects a complete statement of the agreement of the parties but refers to restrictions to which the land is subject as \u201c the usual W. restrictions,\u201d offering to send the purchaser a copy of such restrictions if he cares to see them, can be made a complete memorandum of the contract sufficient to satisfy the requirements of R.

The defendants filed an answer, and the case was referred to William D. Turner, Esquire, as master. He filed a report stating findings in favor of the plaintiff. Upon a motion by the defendants the case was recommitted to the master for such additional findings as might be warranted by the evidence upon the two following questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">\u201c1. Whether the reference to \u2018the usual Weld restrictions which cover this neighborhood \u2019 in the negotiations, and in the letter of the broker Balch to the plaintiff dated October 29, 1906, was made, intended and understood by the parties and the broker as a mere recital of fact, or as a term of the contract providing the restrictions subject to which the defendant should convey; and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-9\">\u201c 2. Whether or not one of the terms of the oral contract of the parties was that all the land should be conveyed subject to \u2018the usual Weld restrictions.\u2019\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-10\">The master filed a supplemental report in which he made the following findings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-11\">\u201c At the interview between Balch and the plaintiff, at which the oral contract was concluded, Balch referred to the restrictions as already existing, and as known to the plaintiff. All the terms of the oral contract were covered and accurately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>expressed by the letter or memorandum signed by Balch. The plaintiff understood that these restrictions already existed, but both Balch and the plaintiff also intended and understood that the reference to these restrictions was not a mere or unimportant recital of fact which could be disregarded if the fact turned out to be the other way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-5\">\u201c The land was offered and accepted as wholly restricted, and both parties intended that the deed which the plaintiff should receive should express and thus reimpose these restrictions, and, therefore, the reference to \u2018the usual Weld restrictions\u2019 was not only a recital of fact, but also a term of the contract which was to be carried out; but the plaintiff did not understand that the restrictions were to be framed or settled by means of further negotiations, because he accepted Balch\u2019s representation and understood it according to the natural meaning of Balch\u2019s language as referring to restrictions already legally established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-6\">\u201cI find, also, that Balch likewise understood that these restrictions were to be recited and reimposed by the conveyance to the plaintiff, and that he had in mind by the phrase \u2018the usual Weld restrictions\u2019 those embodied in the Potter agreement, which were \u2018usual\u2019 in the sense that Weld usually restricted land which he conveyed away, and by restrictions which were similar in many respects, although not absolutely identical.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-7\">\u201c There was no direct testimony as to the extent of Balch\u2019s knowledge of the imposition of the Potter restrictions. He understood in a general way what the defendant\u2019s wishes were from previous instructions on the subject of restrictions, and he either understood that the defendant wanted the same restrictions which already applied to a portion of the premises extended, so as to cover the remainder of the land embraced in this sale, or he supposed that this had already been done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-8\">\u201c In the absence of his own testimony as to the extent of his knowledge, I think I must find the latter as the true explanation, because he did not intend to deceive the plaintiff, and his representation was clearly to the effect that the restrictions existed, and that the plaintiff knew them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\u201c The defendant, on the other hand, must be assumed to have known the real fact; but when he read Balch\u2019s letter before forwarding it to the plaintiff, which he did hurriedly, his attention was not particularly drawn to the matter of restrictions, nor was this matter afterwards referred to by either party during the controversy which subsequently arose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-5\">\u201c I find, therefore, that the defendant intended this phrase of the letter to have its legal significance and to be a recital of existing facts. If not wholly true at the time, it could be made true when the deed to the plaintiff was passed, because the defendant also intended and understood that the land should be wholly restricted, and that these restrictions should be expressed and reimposed by the deed to be given to the plaintiff; and in this sense, therefore, the recital was also a term of the contract. It was not a matter which either party would be at liberty to disregard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-6\">\u201c Upon the question whether or not one of the terms of the oral contract of the parties was that all the land should be conveyed subject to 6 the usual Weld restrictions,\u2019 I find that it was a term of the oral contract that the land should be conveyed subject to what Balch called \u2018 the usual Weld restrictions,\u2019 but that this phrase was intended by Balch and Weld to mean those restrictions which had already been imposed by the Potter agreement. Nickerson understood this phrase at the time of the oral interview to refer to some restrictions existing on this land, but he did not have in mind the Potter agreement until it was sent him by Balch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-7\">\u201c There was nothing in the contract, nor in the negotiations, up to the time the contract was completed, on the subject of restrictions, except what I have found either in this or in my previous report, and the contract in this respect was never altered by the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-8\">\u201cThe copy of the Potter agreement, which was sent, was understood by Balch and Nickerson as showing the restrictions already mentioned and agreed upon between them, and not as being a new set of restrictions then for the first time to be agreed upon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-9\">The letter of Balch referred to by the master and also referred to in the opinion was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>\u201c October 29, 1906.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-3\">\u201c William G.

L. c. 74, \u00a7 1, cl. 4; and (3) whether such contract afterwards was rescinded and abandoned by mutual consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">I. The plaintiff and the defendant Stephen M. Weld, hereinafter called Weld, who then owned the land in question and other land in that neighborhood, made an agreement by which the plaintiff bought and Weld sold to him that land for a stipulated sum and on definite terms, but with the statement that the land was \u201c subject to the usual Weld restrictions.\u201d In fact, a large part of the land was not then subject to any restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">We are satisfied, however, upon the facts reported by the master, that this language was intended as a stipulation that the conveyance to the plaintiff was to be made subject to the restrictions stated. As to this, the defendants contend that the words used, \u201cthe usual Weld restrictions,\u201d do not describe any particular restrictions which can now be fixed and determined by the court; that it is impossible to say that both parties had any definite restrictions or any one scheme of restrictions in their minds; that this question was still to be agreed upon between them ; that accordingly their minds never met upon this material part of their bargain; and so that it cannot be said that there ever was concluded between them any final and definite agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The plaintiff, after receiving from Balch the letter of October 29, 1906, which contains the memorandum upon which he now mainly relies, wrote at once to Balch, asking for a copy of \u201c the usual Weld restrictions,\u201d of which Balch had said, \u201cI will be glad to send you a copy if you care to see them.\u201d Balch thereupon sent to the plaintiff a copy of an agreement between Weld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>and one Potter, to whom Weld had conveyed land in the vicinity of the land in question. This agreement contained a statement of certain restrictions, hereinafter called the Potter restrictions, and a covenant on the part of Potter to hold her land subject thereto. The plaintiff accepted these as \u201c the usual Weld restrictions \u201d named in the original memorandum. It is plain that if it had been Weld who had sent this statement of the Potter restrictions to the plaintiff, it would have fixed definitely the contemplated restrictions, and upon their acceptance a final agreement would have been completed. But this copy was sent by Balch to the plaintiff without the actual knowledge of Weld and without any express authority from him; and it is contended by the defendants that he is not bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The master has found that Weld is bound by this act of Balch, for reasons which are stated in his report. We are of opinion that this finding must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">There is no dispute that in the beginning of this matter Balch was acting as the agent of Weld, with Weld\u2019s knowledge and consent. The letter of October 29 was sent to the plaintiff through Weld himself, who read the letter and acquiesced in it, and adopted it as binding upon himself. It was still, however, Balch\u2019s letter, though binding upon Weld. And this letter contained an express promise by Balch, that he, Balch, would send to the plaintiff a copy of \u201c the usual Weld restrictions \u201d if the plaintiff so desired. This was an important part of Balch\u2019s letter by which Weld consented to be bound. The plaintiff, accepting this letter as written by Weld\u2019s authority, had a right to believe that Balch was authorized by Weld to make this promise, as indeed was the case; and this would include, as to the plaintiff, authority to keep the promise. The copy of the restrictions was not to be sent by Weld personally, or under some subsequent authority to be given or withheld as Weld might choose; it was to be sent by Balch, under authority from Weld then given by Weld\u2019s very act in assenting to Balch\u2019s promise and allowing himself to become bound thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Accordingly the words \u201c the usual Weld restrictions \u201d in the original memorandum have been fixed and made certain through the subsequent adoption by the parties of the Potter restrictions as the ones intended by the words originally used. We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>understand it to be now denied that in every other respect a complete agreement had been made. Accordingly we are of opinion that it appears that a final and complete agreement had been reached between the plaintiff and Weld, and that the first ground of defense set up fails the defendants. This view is confirmed by the findings of the master that there was no dispute between the parties as to these restrictions, but that the disagreement was due in the first instance to certain other claims made by Weld.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\">2. It is a different question whether there was any memorandum of this agreement sufficient to satisfy the provisions of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"AHM\">The memorandum of course must state upon its face or by means of other documents to which reference may be had all of the essential terms of the agreement. <em>Whelan </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>102 Mass. 204. <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>144 Mass. 465, 468. <em>White </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>154 Mass. 593, 595. <em>Bogigian </em>v. <em>Booklovers Library, </em>193 Mass. 444. Looking at this memorandum by itself accordingly, the first question is whether any, and if any, what meaning can be given to the words \u201c the usual Weld restrictions.\u201d Oral testimony is competent to show both the situation of the parties and what restrictions, if any, had previously been put by Weld upon other land of his forming a part of the same tract of land or situated in its neighborhood, and also to determine whether any and what definite scheme of restrictions had been formed or framed by Weld, so as in either event to be fairly in-eluded within the words used. Such evidence may be received for the purpose of determining the exact subject matter which is spoken of, of applying the language to that subject matter, and thus of ascertaining precisely what was in the minds of the parties and so construing correctly the language they used, <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>100 Mass. 58. <em>Swett </em>v. <em>Shumway, </em>102 Mass. 365. <em>New England Dressed Meat &amp; Wool Co. </em>v. <em>Standard Worsted Co. </em>165 Mass. 328. <em>Buffington </em>v. <em>McNally, </em>192 Mass. 198. <em>DeFriest </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>192 Mass. 346, 352. <em>Garfield &amp; Proctor Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Coal &amp; Coke Co. </em>199 Mass. 22. Such testimony was received by the master; audit now appears that Weld had conveyed several parcels of his land near to the land in question, and had imposed upon the lands thus conveyed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>certain restrictions which, while they had many features in common, were not uniform; and it has not been found that any of them could have been accurately described as \u201cthe usual Weld restrictions.\u201d But the Potter restrictions, and only the Potter restrictions, did apply to a part of the land in question. It was only they that had been adopted or applied by Weld to any part of this land. And it is somewhat significant that these restrictions were not created by the deed from Weld to Potter. They were created by the agreement already mentioned between Weld and Potter. By this agreement, after reference to the previous deed of the land, Potter covenanted to hold for a fixed period the land which had been so conveyed to her subject to the restrictions stated in the agreement, and Weld covenanted to hold certain land of his own, including a part of that here in question, subject to the same restrictions for the same period. Under these circumstances it well might be claimed that by the phrase used the parties intended the Potter restrictions, which, though mentioned in only one recorded paper, had been adopted by Weld as the ones that were to be enforced upon a part of this tract and were the only ones that had been so adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">But however this may be, it seems clear to us that the copy of the Potter agreement which was sent by Balch to the plaintiff is to be taken in connection with his first letter, and that these two papers are to be construed together in determining whether there was a sufficient memorandum of the agreement. Apart from the fact that the Potter agreement was already in existence when Balch\u2019s first letter was written, the fact that this copy was sent and may have been prepared after the first letter was written is not material. <em>Freeland </em>v. <em>Ritz, </em>154 Mass. 257. Both of these papers must be deemed to have been parts of the same transaction. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>167 Mass. 426. Balch\u2019s first letter was written on October 29, 1906, apparently the same day on which the oral agreement was made. The plaintiff immediately asked for a copy of the restrictions, and it seems to have been sent to him at once. The plaintiff then, on October 30, wrote another letter to Balch, reciting his purchase and agreeing to pay the stipulated price. Manifestly the whole correspondence was but one transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The old rule, by which no other paper could be used to help out the memorandum unless incorporated into it by reference in the memorandum itself <em>(Morton </em>v. Dean, 13 Met. 385, <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Spooner, </em>13 Allen, 353), is no longer followed. The connection between different papers, so that they may be considered together and their sufficiency be determined by the contents of all of them, may be proved by oral evidence, at least so far as it is the result of that evidence to establish the fact that all of the different papers which are so to be considered together were brought to the attention of both parties, and were linked together in their minds, so that the parties themselves may be found to have adopted all the papers as the expression of their purpose. This is the effect of the recent cases. \u201c There is no doubt under the authorities,\u201d said the present Chief Justice in <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>167 Mass. 426, \u201c that the letter and receipt, as well as the paper containing the promise, may be used to complete the memorandum in writing required by the statute of frauds to make such a contract binding____ It is also well settled that paroi evidence may be introduced to show the situation of the parties and the circumstances attendant upon the transaction for the purpose of applying the contract to the subject matter, and of showing the connection of different writings constituting the memorandum with one another.\u201d This doctrine was applied, with a statement of both the old rule and that now followed, in <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Hunting, </em>44 Ch. D. 205, in which Kekewich, J., uses this language: \u201c It is difficult, perhaps, to say where paroi evidence is to stop; but substantially it never stops short of this, that wherever paroi evidence is required to connect two written documents together, then that paroi evidence is admissible.\u201d See <em>Lerned </em>v. <em>Wannemacher, </em>9 Allen, 412, 416; <em>Freeland </em>v. <em>Ritz, </em>154 Mass. 257 ; <em>Hibbard </em>v. <em>Hatch Storage Battery Co. </em>174 Mass. 296; <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>95 U. S. 289; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Bay State Gas Co. </em>127 Fed. Rep. 482; <em>Sheers </em>v. <em>Thimbleby, </em>76 L. T. (N. S.) 709; <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Moreman, </em>84 Ky. 635; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>66 Ala. 345; <em>White </em>v. <em>Breen, </em>106 Ala. 159 ; <em>Strouse </em>v. <em>Elting, </em>110 Ala. 132; <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Horst &amp; Lachmund Co. </em>127 Cal. 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">It cannot be contended that the Potter agreement was not signed by Weld, and so is not to be taken against him as \u00e1 part of the memorandum. <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>144 Mass. 465. In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>case, the deed was prepared by the plaintiff and offered in vain to the defendant for execution; here, the copy was sent to the plaintiff by Weld, acting through Balch. And although the master finds that no writing accompanied the copy, yet the copy must have shown Weld\u2019s copied signature, and having been sent by Weld through Balch, as it must now be treated, this was of course enough. It was a statement in writing by Weld of what he intended by the words he had used as to the restrictions, and constitutes a part of the memorandum. It was not a variation or alteration of the former agreement or of the terms stated in Balch\u2019s first letter. It was a statement in detail of the restrictions which were described in that first letter. And it was found by the master in his supplementary report that Balch, when he wrote the first letter, intended by the words \u201c the usual Weld restrictions \u201d those which were stated in the Potter agreement, and that it was the understanding of Weld that these were the restrictions to be specified in the deed to be made to the plaintiff, and that the original agreement never was altered by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">Accordingly, we are of opinion that there was here a sufficient memorandum of the agreement to satisfy the requirements of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">3. The finding of the master that there had been no rescission of the contract cannot be said to have been plainly wrong. The fact that Weld said that he would throw up the contract unless his claims were conceded, and that the plaintiff replied \u201c All right,\u201d is not decisive of such a rescission. It might have shown a rescission by mutual consent; but it also might show merely that Weld threatened to repudiate his agreement, and that the plaintiff intimated that Weld could do as he pleased, and in that case he, the plaintiff, would act as he pleased. And the master could find that Weld\u2019s remark was not intended as more than a tentative suggestion. Upon all the facts reported, we cannot revise the master\u2019s finding upon this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">What we have said disposes of all the contentions that were made at the argument before us. The final decree must be modified so as to charge the defendants with the costs of this appeal, and so modified must be</p>\n<p id=\"AkI\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
