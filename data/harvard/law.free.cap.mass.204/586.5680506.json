Bangs of Wareham were doing business as copartners under the firm name of Bangs and Wells, and had a usual place of business in Boston; that during a portion of that time, and until his decease in the autumn of 1903, Samuel Wells also was a member of the firm;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-7\">That the business of the firm consisted of the handling as agents, trustees, or attorneys, or in some representative capacity, of various properties consisting of real estate and stocks and bonds and cash, receiving the income therefrom, and paying the expenses thereof from the net income of this real and personal property; that they received their commissions for handling the property and turned over the dividends to the various trustees and individuals for whom they were acting as agents or otherwise;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-8\">That after the decease of Samuel Wells, S. Gannett Wells and Edward A. Bangs were entitled and bound to share the profits and losses in equal portions, and on dissolution of the firm were entitled and bound to share the assets and liabilities in the same manner;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-11\">That on February 18, 1907, S. Gannett Wells died, leaving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Bangs the sole surviving partner, and the defendants were appointed by the Probate Court of Suffolk county executors of the will of S.

JSTor would the money, assets and property which the plaintiff sought to recover in this suit from the defendants, together with all the other assets of the firm, be sufficient to pay in full all the claims of the creditors of the firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-7\">That on or about August 1, 1903, Bangs had become heavily involved in serious financial difficulties, and the entire control of the firm business of Bangs and Wells was placed in the hands of S. Gannett Wells, who alone had authority to sign checks or make collections and disbursements; that all the bank deposits which were in the name of Bangs and Wells at that time were placed in the name of Wells, subject only to his personal signature ; that no firm bank accounts were thereafter subject in any manner to the signature of Bangs, nor did he have any control over such bank accounts, nor was he in any way consulted as to the withdrawals or disbursements therefrom by Wells so far as known to the plaintiff;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-8\">That between August 1, 1903, and February 18, 1907, Wells used the bank accounts of the firm, which stood in his name as above set forth, and used the other assets of the firm, consisting of book accounts due for commissions, cash on hand in the money drawer, and the like, as he saw fit, and at various times between those dates subscribed to and paid for shares in the capital stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>of various building trusts with the firm\u2019s money and out of the firm\u2019s assets and business, and made loans and advances to various persons and trusts with whom he was associated with the firm\u2019s money and out of the firm\u2019s assets and business; that all of this stock was purchased in his own name and all of these loans or advances were evidenced by papers or charges in his own name;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-3\">That at the time these purchases and advances were made by Wells the firm of Bangs and Wells was hopelessly insolvent, as he well knew, and the money which was used by him individually was money which came into the firm on account of these various clients whom the firm represented as above set forth, either as collections on their accounts or as commissions on their business, all being placed in the firm\u2019s bank account, subject to the signature of Wells only;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-4\">That the plaintiff was unable to say whether Bangs at the time of these purchases and advances knew of them, or knew of the insolvent condition of the firm, and fraudulently assented thereto, or whether Wells, in the exercise of his control over the assets and business of the firm, concealed the financial condition of the firm from his partner, and concealed the fact that he was purchasing in his own name such stocks and securities, and was making such advances and loans, or not;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\">That at the time of the filing of the bill some of the stocks which were purchased in this manner by Wells were in the hands of the defendants as executors of his estate; that some of them had been sold by the defendants since his decease and the proceeds thereof were in their hands and readily ascertainable; and that some of the money so advanced by him was evidenced by notes payable to him, some of which were secured by mortgage and were also in the possession of the defendants;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-6\">That it appeared from the books of the partnership that during the time when Wells had entire control of the business of the firm he withdrew from the assets thereof about $14,000 above his share of the profits thereof, and thereby rendered the firm insolvent; that this was done by him with his knowledge of the condition of the firm and of the fact that these withdrawals out of the capital of the firm or out of the money of the clients which came into the accounts of the firm were reducing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>fund to which the creditors would some day be obliged to look for payments of their accounts;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-3\">That all of the purchases, payments and loans by and to S. Gannett Wells were entered on the books of the firm, and that Bangs at all times had, or might have had if he so wished, access to the books; and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-4\">That the estate of Wells was insolvent and unable to pay his individual creditors in full.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-5\">The bill prayed</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-6\">1. That an accounting might be had between the parties, and the amount due from the estate of Wells to the partnership should be determined;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-7\">2.

It was merely a device adopted to remove Bangs, at least for a time, from any active control or management of the business of the firm and to give the power of management exclusively to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Wells. But the interest and ownership of each of them remained unaffected by the adoption of this device. The rule of <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>9 Cush. 583, <em>Case </em>v. <em>Beauregard, </em>99 U. S. 119, and <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>160 Fed. Rep. 57, has no application here. This case more nearly resembles <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>13 Gray, 114, but is yet stronger than that. Each of the partners remained the owner of a one half interest in the firm and in all its assets. The control which was given to Wells was to be exercised by him for the benefit of Bangs as well as of himself. And upon the averments of the bill it must now be taken that Bangs could at any time have intervened and put a stop to the arrangement that had been made, and have resumed his equal control and power of disposition over the business and assets of the firm. It follows that upon the death of Wells, Bangs as the sole surviving partner at once became the owner of all the partnership property, and charged with the duty of winding up the affairs of the firm, turning its assets into money, and applying such money to the payment of its debts. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>171 Mass. 279. For this purpose he was entitled to demand and receive from the defendants, the executors of the will of his deceased partner, whatever property of the firm might come into their hands. <em>Crabtree </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>133 Mass. 552. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Gilman, </em>138 N. Y. 369. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>International Bank, </em>125 App. Div. (N. Y.) 568, quoting and following <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Whedon, </em>109 N. Y. 333, and <em>Secor </em>v. <em>Tradesmen's National Bank, </em>92 App. Div. (N. Y.) 294. <em>Kutz </em>v. <em>Dreibelbis, </em>126 Penn. St. 335. <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Capron, </em>17 R. I. 679. <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Flannagan, </em>106 U. S. 648. As was said by Colt, J., in <em>Shearer </em>v. <em>Paine, </em>12 Allen, 289, 291, this right of the surviving partner is \u201ca right incident to all partnerships, and one of which he cannot be deprived by the personal representative of the deceased partner, in the absence of any allegation of mismanagement or want of capacity,\u201d and there is no such allegation here. The amount recoverable in a suit to enforce this right may depend upon the solvency or insolvency of the firm, upon the state of the partnership accounts, or other circumstances. <em>Wilby </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>15 Mass. 116. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>144 Mass. 181. <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>77 Maine, 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">This right extends also to all real estate of the partnership, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>in whosesoever name the legal title may have been, so far as may be necessary to wind up its affairs, pay its debts, and settle the partnership accounts. <em>Burnside </em>v. Merrick, 4 Met. 537. <em>Dyer </em>v. Clark, 5 Met. 562. <em>Merritt </em>v. Dickey, 38 Mich. 41. <em>Shanks </em>v. Klein, 104 U. S. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\">The surviving partner takes the firm property as \"its absolute owner, though subject to a liability to account for its proceeds and for their application to the payment of the firm debts and the settlement of the partnership accounts. Accordingly his own debts and demands and those due to or from the late firm may be joined in a single action or may be set off against each other. <em>Holbrook </em>v. Lackey, 13 Met. 132, and cases there cited. An allowance may be made to his widow from the firm assets as from his own personal estate, even though the firm be insolvent. Bush v. <em>Clark, </em>127 Mass. 111. He may make a valid assignment of the firm property for the benefit of its creditors. <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>116 N. Y. 487. He is in all respects dealt with as the owner of the property, though liable to account for its proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Accordingly it was held under our insolvent law that upon proceedings in insolvency by or against a surviving partner, his assignee will take both the separate property and the firm property of the insolvent debtor, to be distributed respectively in the manner prescribed by the statute. <em>Burnside </em>v. <em>Merrick, </em>4 Met. 537. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Priest, </em>5 Met. 582. <em>Rice, </em>appellant, 7 Allen, 112. <em>Durgin </em>v. <em>Coolidge, </em>3 Allen, 554. Merrick, J., said in the case last cited: \u201c It is therefore quite clear that, upon the death of one of two partners, the survivor may rightfully apply to the Court of Insolvency by petition, and that thereupon due proceedings may be had for the sequestration of the partnership property, and the disposal of it for the payment of the debts due to the partnership creditors.\u201d The rule under the United States Bankrupt Acts has not been uniform. In many districts the doctrine declared in this Commonwealth has been adopted and followed. <em>In re Stevens, </em>1 Sawyer, 397. <em>In re Temple, </em>4 Sawyer, 92. <em>Briswalter </em>v. <em>Long, </em>14 Fed. Rep. 153. <em>In re Pierce, </em>102 Fed. Rep. 977. It has been denied. <em>In re Evans, </em>20 Am. Bankr. Rep. 406. <em>In re Bertenshaw, </em>157 Fed. Rep. 363. In other cases, although the question was not really raised and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>decided, the views taken by different courts have not been the same. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Nostrand, </em>94 N. Y. 31. <em>Moses </em>v. <em>Pond, </em>4 Am. Bankr. Rep. 655. <em>In re Sectional Dock Co. </em>3 Dillon, 83. <em>Vaccaro </em>v. <em>Security Bank, </em>103 Fed. Rep. 436. <em>In re Mercur, </em>122 Fed. Rep. 384. <em>In re Forbes, </em>128 Fed. Rep. 137. <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>159 Fed. Rep. 897. In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Terrell, </em>4 Fed. Rep. 796, Woods, Circuit Judge, said that the only method by which after the death of one of the partners the property of a partnership could be brought into the bankruptcy court was by service upon the surviving partner, in whom was the title to all the partnership property. In the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of <em>In re Stein, </em>127 Fed. Rep. 547, holding that the insanity of a partner will not bar the prosecution of proceedings in bankruptcy against a firm, it was said: \u201c And so it has been held that a copartnership may be adjudged a bankrupt after the death of one partner, upon an act of bankruptcy committed by the surviving partner, and that the adjudication of bankruptcy of a copartnership does not necessarily draw into the proceeding the estate of every individual member. There have been several adjudications in which the question has been fully considered, and in the result of which we fully concur.\u201d And the court cited, beside cases already referred to, <em>Chemical National Bank </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>92 Fed. Rep. 896, affirmed upon appeal <em>sub nom. In re Meyer, </em>98 Fed. Rep. 976; <em>In re Duguid, </em>100 Fed. Rep. 274; <em>In re Barden, </em>101 Fed. Rep. 553; <em>In re Hale, </em>107 Fed. Rep. 432; <em>In re Farley, </em>115 Fed. Rep. 359; <em>In re Dunnigan, </em>95 Fed. Rep. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">We are of opinion, that the rule declared in our own decisions already cited has been approved by the weight of authority in the administration of the federal bankrupt act. It is not denied that it has been adopted by the federal courts of this district. The decision in the Bangs case, brought before us in the record of another case between these parties argued a few days after the case at bar, is decisive upon that point. The plaintiff will be held to account in the bankruptcy court for whatever assets of the late firm they may be able to get into their hands. It is desirable that all those assets should be administered and the affairs of the late firm adjusted, so far as may be, in one forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Accordingly we consider that the plaintiff has a right to main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>tain this hill for the purpose of compelling the defendants to turn over to him whatever assets and property of the late firm of Bangs and Wells have come into the hands of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\">It is suggested however that much of the funds in the defendants\u2019 hands which are the subject of this bill must be regarded as merely irust funds which ought not to be paid over to a trustee in bankruptcy. But the bill avers that the money which was drawn or received by Wells and used by him in the purchase of the stocks that are sought to be recovered included money of the firm and commissions to which it was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
