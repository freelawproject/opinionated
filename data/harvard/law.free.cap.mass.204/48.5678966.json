It was not stated what answer to the question was expected, nor was there any offer to show that the writ had been lost or destroyed. It appeared that it had not been returned into court. The presiding judge excluded the question. <em>Held, </em>that the exclusion was proper, since the writ itself was the best evidence, and its absence was not accounted for.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b68-13\">An exception to the admission of a question to and answer by a witness at a trial. will not be sustained if it appears that the witness previously at the same trial had testified to the same effect without objection by the excepting party.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b68-14\">At the trial of an action of contract for the price of lumber alleged to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>sold by the plaintiff to the defendant, the defendant contended that the lumber was sold, not to the defendant but to S., and the plaintiff contended and introduced evidence tending to show that S. applied to him for lumber to use in building a house for the defendant, that at that time S. was unknown to him, that he had conversations with the defendant and his son, the defendant\u2019s agent, and the son had told him of difficulties in which S. was, that therefore he had agreed to sell the lumber, not to S. but to the defendant. The plaintiff against objection by the defendant was allowed to ask S. upon cross-examination, \u201c You had nothing in your own name <em>1 </em>\u201d S. answered \u201c No.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the question and answer properly were admitted in evidence as bearing directly upon the issue whether credit was given to S. or to the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b69-5\">An exception to the refusal of a presiding judge to make certain rulings will not be sustained although the rulings requested were correct statements of the law and were germane to the issues of the case, if in his charge to the jury the judge in substance although not in terms stated the law in accordance with the rulings requested.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b69-6\">A commissioner, who was appointed by this court to hear the parties and report the facts in relation to a petition by a defendant to establish exceptions taken by him at the trial of an action, reported that at the hearing before him the defendant presented a new draft of his bill of exceptions, to which the plaintiff made no objection, and that the commissioner thereupon found the new draft to be correct and to contain \u201c all the exceptions which were properly saved in the original bill, and only such as were properly saved in that bill.\u201d After the filing of the report, the commissioner filed what he entitled a \u201csupplementary report,\u201d not stating that the matter contained in it formed part of the bill of exceptions. This \u201c supplementary report \u201d he began with the words, \u201c If I am allowed to do so, I herewith present a supplementary report in the above case,\u201d and in it he made a quotation from the report of the official stenographer at the trial which seemed to show that the presiding judge, in a colloquy with counsel after his charge, had stated that he had told the stenographer to cross out a-certain portion of his charge which was in accordance with a request of the defendant for a ruling. In his original report the commissioner had stated that, subject to exceptions by the defendant, the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings were refused except as such rulings were given in the charge. In his \u201c supplementary report,\u201d the commissioner stated that the parties disagreed as to whether the colloquy, which took place before the jury had retired, was heard by the jury. The defendant did not except to the alleged final statement of the presiding judge. <em>Held, </em>that the question whether the rule of law as contended to have been stated finally by the judge, contrary to the request made by the defendant, was correct, was not before this court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">Contbact, upon an account annexed containing one hundred and fifty-eight items of lumber alleged to have been sold to the defendant by the plaintiff. Writ dated October 4,1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-8\">The case was referred to Benjamin Cook, junior, Esquire, as auditor. He found \u201c that the plaintiff sold the goods stated in the account annexed on the sole credit of the defendant and sold them to the defendant,\u201d and that the account annexed was a true statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The case was tried before Raymond, J. The plaintiff introduced the auditor\u2019s report in evidence and rested. The defendant\u2019s contention was that the plaintiff sold the goods to one Saucier and that the defendant at most merely agreed orally to see that Saucier paid the account, and he relied on the statute of frauds and introduced in evidence a letter from the plaintiff to Saucier stating \u201c I am sorry to inform you that I can\u2019t let you have any more stock before I receive some money. I saw Mr. Healy and did not get much satisfaction from him.\u201d He also introduced in evidence a bill of sale from the plaintiff bearing the heading \u201cMr. Elzear Saucier bought of Thomas Hindle, Lumber Dealer,\u201d and a page of the plaintiff\u2019s ledger showing the items which were in the account annexed, and which had the name of Elzear Saucier at the top of the page.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">The defendant also called as a witness one Catherine Barring-ton, and asked her the following questions, all of which, upon objections by the plaintiff and subject to exceptions by the defendant, were excluded: Q. \u201cDid you see a writ of a suit brought by Thomas Hindle against Elzear Saucier in which Thomas Healy was named as trustee, prior to March, 1900 ? \u201d Q. \u201c Did you see a writ of a suit brought by Thomas Hindle against Elzear Saucier in which Thomas Healy was named as trustee for the collection of this same money ? \u201d Q. \u201c Did you see a writ for a suit brought by Thomas Hindle against Elzear Saucier in which Thomas Healy was named as trustee prior to March, 1900 ? \u201d Ho statement of the answers expected to these questions was made by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">The substance of a part of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was that Saucier, whom previously he had not known, had come to see him about some lumber to use in building houses for the defendant, that he went to see the defendant, and told him of his interview with Saucier. \u201c I told him I wasn\u2019t acquainted with Saucier, and he said he would pay the bill; \u2018let Mr. Saucier have what he needed for the different jobs he was going to work on and he would pay the bill.\u2019 \u201d He also testified that the defendant referred him to his son John E. Healy as his agent, that be interviewed the son, who told him that Saucier was in difficulties so that \u201c he couldn\u2019t get his lumber from any other yard. . . . \u2018 So I agreed with him, on condition that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>pay the bill \u2014 he and his father \u2014 to furnish the material, and he was going to arrange it so that nobody could harm us in any way, and I left him feeling that everything was all right. He told me to bring the bill for lumber to him. I asked him at the time whether I should charge it to Mr. Saucier or to Mr. Healy. He <em>said,1 </em>Charge it to Saucier. Let him have all he wants for the building and leave him the bill.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">Evidence of the defendant controverted that of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked the presiding judge to make certain. rulings, the substance of which is stated in the opinion. Except as stated in the opinion, the requests were refused, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-7\">The defendant also excepted to the following portion of the charge of the presiding judge, as being in violation of E. L. c. 173, \u00a7 80:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">\u201c Considerable has been said about the fact that the goods were charged to Mr. Saucier, and that demands were made on Mr. Saucier by the plaintiff. That is to be weighed by you just the same as the other testimony is to be weighed but it is not a controlling consideration. You heard the testimony as to the method of doing business there. It is a lumber yard. The plaintiff is out in the yard or about the city, and he has a bookkeeper and he has a yard man, according to the testimony in the case, and he makes an agreement with an individual with reference to the sale of lumber. The bookkeeper makes the charges; the bookkeeper charges it to the man to whom the lumber is delivered. You will see that that is not a controlling consideration as to whether or not the actual credit was given to Mr. Healy, with whom the plaintiff testifies that he had certain talk constituting an agreement. If you find that there was that independent talk with Mr. Healy, or with John E. Healy after his father had referred the lumber dealer to John E. Healy, and that he gave credit in consequence of that talk, then the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict, and the verdict would be in the sum set forth in the auditor\u2019s report, and at the bottom of this long bill of items.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-9\">The jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions which were disallowed by the presiding judge as not being in conformity with the truth. The defendant thereupon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>filed in this court a petition to establish his exceptions, and William H. Fox, Esquire, was appointed a commissioner, before whom the defendant presented a new draft of the exceptions to which the plaintiff did not object.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-5\">After the commissioner had filed his report, he filed another document, material portions of which are stated in the opinion, beginning, \u201c If I am allowed to do so, I herewith present a supplementary report in the above case, after having given a hearing on the matter to both parties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">While the case was pending, the defendant died and the executrix of his will was admitted as defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-7\">Other facts are stated in the opinion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-8\"><em>jD. B. Badovsky, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-9\"><em>JE. Higginson, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-10\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnY\">This case comes here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the admission and exclusion of evidence, and to the refusal of the presiding judge to give certain rulings that were requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">1. The first exception is to the exclusion of questions put on direct examination by the defendant to the witness Barrington as to whether she had seen a writ in an action brought by the plaintiff against Saucier in which Thomas Healy was named as trustee. If such a writ had been issued, the writ itself or the record, if it had been returned to court, was the best evidence. No offer was made to show that the writ had been lost or destroyed. For aught that appeared it was still in the possession of the attorney who filled it out, or of the officer in whose hands it had been placed for service, if the matter had gone as far as that. The statement by the defendant\u2019s counsel which appears in the supplementary report, assuming that it is a part of the bill of exceptions, that the writ was not returned into court because Saucier filed a petition in bankruptcy before the return day, was not sufficient to let in secondary evidence. See <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>3 Met. 396; <em>Hackett </em>v. <em>King, </em>6 Allen, 58; <em>Dailey </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>122 Mass. 64; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>33 Maine, 213, 214. Furthermore, it did not appear what the answers to the questions or any of them would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">2. Saucier was called as a witness by the defendant, and the plaintiff was allowed to ask him on cross-examination sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ject to the defendant\u2019s exception, -\u201cYon had nothing in your own name?\u201d and he answered, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d The witness had already testified to the same effect and no harm therefore was done by the question and answer. Independently of that the question was properly allowed as bearing directly on the principal issue in the case, namely, whether credit was given to Saucier or Healy. <em>Lee </em>v. Wheeler, 11 Gray, 236, 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">3. The exception to the exclusion of the question \u201cWas Mr. Healy supposed to give you the money to pay for the lumber ? \u201d has not been argued and we treat it as waived. What Mr. Healy was supposed to do was utterly irrelevant and immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">4. The first request that upon all of the evidence the defendant was entitled to recover has not been argued, and it is plain that it was rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The defendant\u2019s requests, numbered 4 to 8 inclusive, presented in different forms the proposition that in order to recover the plaintiff must show that credit was given to Healy alone, and that if credit was given to Saucier, or to Saucier and Healy, or to Saucier with Healy as guarantor, or as agreeing to be responsible, then the plaintiff could not recover. The judge did not give these requests in terms, but instructed the jury that the burden rested on the plaintiff to establish his case by a fair preponderance of the evidence; that he had to prove that \u201c the credit on furnishing the goods was given to Healy and to Healy alone \u201d; that if credit was given to Saucier, then their verdict should be for the defendant; and that that must likewise be so if credit was given to Saucier with Healy as guarantor. As the matter was thus left, it is plain, it seems to us, that the jury must have understood that they could not render a verdict for the plaintiff unless they found that credit was given to Healy alone, and that if they found that credit was given to Saucier with Healy as guarantor or as responsible for what was furnished to Saucier, then their verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The only doubt in regard to this matter arises from what appears in the supplementary report. After the commissioner had filed his report in regard to the exceptions, he filed another report termed a supplementary report, containing two quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>tians from the stenographer\u2019s report, \u2014 both made at the request of the defendant. The first quotation has been already referred to in connection with the first exception. The second quotation was to the effect that immediately after the charge counsel for the plaintiff addressed the court, saying that he did not know how the charge left the matter of credit to both, and that he wished to except to so much of the charge as instructed the jury that if credit was given to both the plaintiff could not recover. Thereupon the presiding judge stated that he had \u201c expressly said that was not so,\u201d and had \u201c asked the stenographer to cross it out and said expressly that was not the law.\u201d And upon counsel for the plaintiff saying, \u201c I understood your Honor to cross out part of it,\u201d the judge added \u201cYes, that was all crossed out, \u2018if credit were given to both.\u2019 It would be possible, if credit were given to both, still to find for the plaintiff. When I said it was not possible, I withdrew it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">It is doubtful whether what is contained in the supplementary report forms a part of the bill of exceptions. There is no finding by the commissioner that it does. On the contrary in his original report he expressly stated that the \u201c new draft \u201d presented by the- defendant, which he finds is correct and to which the plaintiff made no objection, \u201c contains all the exceptions which were properly saved in the original bill, and only such as were properly saved in that bill.\u201d Neither does it appear that, though spoken in the court room before the jury retired, what was said was heard or was intended to be heard by the jury.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Nor does it appear that any exception was taken by the defendant to the final statement by the presiding judge of the rule of law. There is nothing in the bill of exceptions as established by the commissioner in his first report, or in the charge therein contained, to show that what is above stated took place, or that there was any modification of the charge. We are unable to see, therefore, how any question as to the correctness of the rule there finally laid down is before us, or if it is, how the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>harmed by what was said. We do not mean to imply anything one way or the other in regard to the correctness of the rule. The other requests were rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">There was nothing in the charge obnoxious to R. L. c. 173, \u00a780.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\"> The commissioner stated, in the so called \u201c supplementary report,\u201d \u201c It is agreed that these remarks were made in the court room before the jury retired. Counsel for the defendant insists that they were spoken within the hearing of the jury. Counsel for the plaintiff does not admit that they were heard or were intended to be heard by the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
