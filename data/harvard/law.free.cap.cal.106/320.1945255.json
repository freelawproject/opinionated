The information fails to allege ownership in anybody of the money alleged to have been obtained by defendant, and is therefore fatally defective. <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>8 Ad. &amp; E., 481; Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, 8th. ed, sec. 1223; 2 Bishop\u2019s Criminal Procedure, secs. 173, 174; <em>Leobold </em>v. <em>State, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>14 Mass. 217; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manly, </em>12 Pick., 173; Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, 8th ed., sec, 949; 1 Wharton\u2019s Precedents of Indictments and Pleas, 4th ed., pp. 20, 21; <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>3 Ad. &amp; E. 292; <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>8 Car. &amp; P. 196; <em>Sill </em>v. <em>Queen, </em>Dearsly\u2019s Crown Cases, 132; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lathrop, 15 </em>Vt. 279.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-5\"><em>Attorney General </em>W. <em>H.

Among other things the information charged that the prosecuting witness was induced to loan the defendant, Millan, eight hundred and thirty-one dollars, lawful money of the United States, upon the representations that two certain bars of metal, which the defendant produced and turned over to the prosecuting witness as security for the loan, were gold, when in fact they were but brass.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">1. The jury rendered a verdict in the following form: \u201c We, the jury, find the defendant guilty as charged in the information.\u201d It is now claimed that the verdict is substantially defective in not finding the amount of money obtained by defendant from the fraud practiced. There is nothing in the point. The defendant is charged with obtaining eight hundred and thirty-one dollars, lawful money of the United States, and he was convicted of the <em>\u201c </em>offense charged.\u201d The verdict, when taken in connection with the information, becomes as certain as to the amount of money obtained as if the amount were stated in the verdict in express terms. There is no question of degree involved in the offense of which the defendant was charged and upon trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">2. It is claimed that the information is defective in failing to allege a value to the money taken, but it is not demurrable in this regard. The provisions of section 967 of the Penal Code are broad enough to include the offense here charged, and the allegation is directly in line with the provisions of that section. Neither do we think the information fatally defective in not containing a direct allegation as to the lack of knowledge upon the part of the defendant that the representations made by him were known to be false. The information was demurrable upon this ground, but no demurrer was interposed; and, taken as a whole, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>think it sufficiently charges the offense to support a verdict and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">3. The remaining points of importance which are urged by appellant are opposed to the views of this court as declared in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>66 Cal. 10, that case in principle being quite similar to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Beatty, C. J., did not participate in the foregoing decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
