McQuaid, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b606-14\">The demurrer to the petition should have been sustained, as it does not show that the petitioners are firms or partnerships, or that the names of five or any creditors are set forth in the petition. (Insolvent Act, secs. 8, 9.) It is not shown that J. A. Folger &amp; Co., in whose behalf the petition purports to be verified, is a corporation formed or existing under the laws of this state, or is in any sense a resident of this state, or entitled to verify said petition. (Insolvent Act, sec. 8.) There is no value alleged in the petition to any of the goods alleged to be sold to the defendant. It does not appear that any or all of them \u201c amount\u201d in value to five hundred dollars, or any other sum. (Insolvent Act, sec. 8.) The allegations are insufficient to maintain a civil action on either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>of the demands in the petition. <em>(In re Russell, </em>70 Cal. 132.) The petitioners merely charge that the defendant is \u201cindebted\u201d to them, without stating the facts constituting the indebtedness; as the petition tenders nothing but a conclusion of law for issue it is clearly demurrable. (<em>Wells </em>v. <em>McPike, </em>21 Cal. 216; <em>In re Russell, supra.) </em>The verification of the petition by one described as vice-president of the petitioning corporation is insufficient, as this is a supposed officer unknown to the law. (Civ. Code, sec. 308.) The court erred in overruling the petition for the allowance of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, as it was proper that there should be reserved from his estate sufficient to pay attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. <em>(In re Harris, </em>81 Cal. 350; <em>In re Luce, </em>83 Cal. 303.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-5\"><em>Joseph Kirk, </em>and <em>Ford &amp; Burnell, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-6\">The petition is sufficient and complies with all the requirements of section 8 of the Insolvent Act. (<em>Wright </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>88 Cal. 328. See, also, Bump on Bankruptcy, 8th ed., 927; <em>In re Sheehan, 8 </em>Bank. Reg. 245.) The verification is sufficient. The verification by the vice-president of the corporation of J. A. Folger &amp; Co. was proper, as the vice-president of a corporation is an officer thereof. (6 Century Dictionary, 6747; Code Civ. Proc., sec. 446; Webster\u2019s International Dictionary, 1608; 2 Abbott\u2019s Law Dictionary, 635; <em>In re St. Lawrence etc. R. R. Co., </em>133 N. Y. 270; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Cohn, supra.) </em>The allegation of partnership is sufficient. <em>(Anable </em>v. <em>Conklin, </em>25 N. Y. 470.) The allegation that the creditors were all residents of this state was sufficient, and it was not necessary for the petition to set out how the corporation was incorporated. <em>(La Fayette Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>30 Barb. 491; <em>Elizabethport Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>13 Abb. Pr. 86; <em>Shoe &amp; Leather Bank </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>9 Abb.

Dec. 372; <em>Canandarqua Academy </em>v. <em>McKechnie, </em>19 Hun, 62; 90 N.

Co.y. Marsh, </em>49 Iowa, 11; <em>Wendall </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>63 Iowa, 101.) The allegations as to the value of the goods are sufficient. <em>(In re Dennery, </em>89 Cal. 102; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Judd </em>(Cal., Aug. 26, 1885), 7 West. Coast Rep. 372; 7 Pac. Eep. 804; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>7 N. Y. 476; 57 Am. Dec. 542.) The facts constituting the indebtedness are sufficiently set forth in the petition. <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>Judd, supra; Wright </em>v. <em>Cohn, supra; Halleck </em>v. <em>Mixer, </em>16 Cal. 577; <em>Drais </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>50 Cal. 125.) The Insolvent Act of 1880 does not authorize the court to make an allowance out of the estate of the insolvent to pay costs and counsel fees. Insolvency proceedings are statutory, and must be strictly pursued. <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>5 Cal. 195; <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Strode, </em>7 Cal. 428; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Kohlman, </em>8 Cal. 47; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>31 Cal. 167; <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>39 Cal. 137.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b608-5\">Searls, C.</author>\n<p id=\"ABA\">This is an appeal by Benjamin Close from the judgment of the superior court in and for Humboldt county adjudging him an insolvent debtor, and from an order denying his application for an allowance from his estate of money sufficient to employ counsel, pay costs, expenses, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The petition is in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\u201c In the Superior Court of the County of Humboldt, State of California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">\n<em>\u201cIn the matter of Benjamin Close in insolvency.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Creditors\u2019 Petition in Involuntary Insolvency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">\u201cThe petition of the hereinafter mentioned creditors respectfully shows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">\u201c That said respondent, Benjamin Close, is indebted to the following petitioners, all residents of the state of California:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">\u201cTo Eoot &amp; Sanderson, a partnership, in the sum of $537.26 for goods sold and delivered to said Benjamin Close within twenty-three months last past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-13\">\u201cTo H.

The petition is sufficient within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>rulings of the court in <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>88 Cal. 328, and <em>In re Dennery, </em>89 Cal. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">It shows that all of the petitioners are residents of the state of California; that the demands are due, and accrued in this state; the nature and amount of their several demands, and the other facts required by section 8 of the Insolvent Law, approved April 16,1880. (Stats. 1880, p. 82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The demurrer was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">A motion was also made to strike out the petition, \u201cupon the ground that the same is not verified by three of the petitioners named therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">The motion was overruled, and error is predicated upon such ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">As will be observed, the affidavit is by three persons, one of whom (C.

(a corporation), one of the petitioners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Section 446 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides, in reference to the verifications of pleadings, that, when a corporation is a party, \u201cthe verification may be made by any officer thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">A vice-president certainly is or may be an officer of a corporation, and, when he states under oath that he is such officer, it is sufficient. It is not more necessary for a vice-president to set out the fact of his selection as an officer of the corporation than it would be for the president, secretary, or other officer to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">A vice-president, or one who acts in the place of and instead of the president, is an officer well known and recognized by the law in incorporated companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">His statement in an affidavit to a pleading that he is such officer is sufficient to give validity thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">The motion on the part of the appellant here for an allowance of two hundred and fifty dollars from his estate to employ counsel and pay expenses, etc., was properly refused for two reasons: 1. The law makes no provision for such an allowance; 2. The petition therefor was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>It did not show the nature or value of the estate.
