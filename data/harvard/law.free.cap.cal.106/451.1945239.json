The evidence as to the intention to dedicate is, perhaps, somewhat meager, but we deem it substantially conflicting, while, upon the question of user, it was practically without conflict; and this was sufficient to show an acceptance by the public. \u201c This acceptance is generally established by the use by the public of the land for the purpose to which it was dedicated.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>San Luis Obispo, </em>95 Cal. 470; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>79 Cal. 170; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>34 Cal. 497.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The notice given by the road commission to defendant to remove the obstruction was, we think, in substantial compliance with the statute; but, if otherwise, defendant is not in a position to be heard upon his objection thereto. The notice was put in evidence without objection, and the finding of the court that such notice was given is not attacked in the specifications of insufficiency of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The evidence was sufficient to sustain the finding as to the extent and width of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The action was properly brought in the name of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>road commissioner. <em>(Bailey </em>v. <em>Dale, </em>71 Cal. 36; <em>San Benito County </em>v. <em>Whitesides, </em>51 Cal. 416.)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">These are the only points requiring special mention.</p>\n<p id=\"A7N\">We find no error in the record, and the judgment and order denying a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Garoutte, J., and Habbison, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
