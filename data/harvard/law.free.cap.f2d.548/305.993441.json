Accordingly, we shall relate the factual setting as succinctly as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-24\">Pinkey was incarcerated in the Colorado State Penitentiary when the charged offenses occurred. At trial the Government called thirteen witnesses and presented twelve exhibits which were admitted in evidence. The crux of the charges is that Pinkey wrote nearly identical letters from the penitentiary to four widowed ladies residing in the State of Colorado after he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>read of the deaths of their husbands from newspaper obituary accounts. Pinkey wrote them that he was a friend of the decedents;\u2019 that he had been jailed with them either in \u201cDenver County Jail\u201d or the \u201cJefferson County Jail\u201d after the decedents had been arrested \u201cfor being under the influence [of] alcohol\u201d; that he had loaned them money to \u201cget out of jail\u201d which had not been repaid; and that he wished to have them send him \u201cat least\u201d $80.00 of the $75.00 he had loaned their respective husbands by money order \u201cas soon as possible\u201d because he was to leave for college in October of 1975. In truth, Pinkey did not know the decedents nor did he loan any of them money.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Before the trial commenced, the court fully and completely advised Pinkey of his right to counsel. The judge recommended that Pinkey avail himself of competent court appointed counsel in view of the fact that mail fraud cases are often complicated and technical. [R., Vol. I, pp. 2, 3.] Pinkey responded that he wished to represent himself with counsel present and available simply to advise him. He then volunteered that he intended to testify, whereupon his counsel advised the court that he had discussed the matter with Pinkey and that he (counsel) agreed that Pinkey\u2019s testimony was \u201crelevant, material and necessary.\u201d [R., Vol. I, p. 4.] In Pinkey\u2019s opening statement to the jury, immediately following that of the prosecutor, he remarked, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c. . . as far as the letters, the money order, and this type of thing, <em>I can prove that I never wrote these letters </em>. . .\u201d [R., Vol. I, p. 13] At trial, Pin-key voluntarily testified. He then acknowledged writing the letters as \u201cjust an idea\u201d but he denied mailing them. There was substantial evidence otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">During the court\u2019s voir dire examination of the jurors, Pinkey hand printed on a yellow legal-sized sheet three questions which he wished to have the judge ask the jurors. These questions were written in the presence of the jurors and submitted to the trial judge. These handwritten questions were later introduced in evidence by the Government, at the suggestion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">A Mr. Verle Truman testified as the Government\u2019s expert on questioned documents, both with regard to comparison and identity of handwriting and typewriting. Truman was then employed at the Western Regional Postal Inspection Service\u2019s Crime Laboratory at San Bruno, California. He gave detailed expert testimony which tied Pinkey to the documents then in evidence, which included the letters, envelopes, etc., offered and admitted during the Government\u2019s case-in-chief. Truman specifically and unequivocally identified the handwriting on the exhibits as that of Pinkey. He demonstrated the identification technique by the use of \u201cblow up charts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">When Pinkey testified, he stated that he had written the respective letters (contrary to that which he stated he would prove in his opening statement) but he denied mailing them. He contended that he had placed them in a \u201cbox\u201d in his cell; that they were nothing more than \u201cjust an idea\u201d on his part; and that someone caused the letters to be taken out of the box and placed in the mail. These contentions, we hold, had been effectively \u2014 and overwhelmingly \u2014 refuted by the Government\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">On appeal, Pinkey contends that the trial court erred in (1) denying him a fair trial by having suggested to the United States Attorney (out of the presence of the jury) that the handwritten suggested voir dire questions prepared by Pinkey should be furnished to the Government\u2019s handwriting expert for handwriting analysis, said analysis forming the basis of his opinion and (2) denying Pinkey\u2019s right to represent himself by suggesting to the United States Attorney that the aforesaid handwritten voir dire questions be furnished to the handwriting expert for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">Pinkey\u2019s contentions on appeal will be treated and considered jointly in view of the fact that both relate to the same alleged trial court error involving the additional testimony of the expert witness, Tru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>man. At the conclusion of Truman\u2019s direct testimony as a Government witness, the following colloquy occurred out of the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">THE COURT: These proceedings are being had outside the presence of the jury. I do invite your attention, Mr. Waters, to the fact \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if you and Mr. Truman are the least bit interested in it \u2014 but I do invite your attention to the fact that this being a pro se case, the Defendant submitted here in open court in the presence of the jury earlier today certain samples of his printing. It\u2019s available here if Mr. Truman would like to compare it. The jury saw these samples prepared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">MR. WATERS: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">THE COURT: They are here and we\u2019ll take a recess. They are here, Mr. Truman, if you would like to look at them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACu\">MR. WATERS: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agr\">[R., Vol. I, pp. 86, 87.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Following the above exchange, the Government (through Mr. Waters) caused to have the three voir dire questions which had been hand printed by Pinkey on a yellow sheet marked as Government Exhibit 12c. When the jury was returned, the Government moved the admission of the exhibit after Mr. Truman had identified the writing thereon as that of Pinkey by expert comparison. Pinkey did not object to the admission of Exhibit 12c. Furthermore, he did not cross-examine Truman relative to the identification, even though the court specifically inquired of Pinkey whether he wished to object or cross-examine. After the aforesaid re-direct examination of Truman was completed, the Government rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Pinkey voluntarily testified in his own defense. He insisted that even though he wrote the letters to the widows with the \u201cidea\u201d of deceiving them in order to obtain some money that he placed each of the letters in a box in his cell, and that he did not mail them. He contended \u201cthe officers mailed them ... It was all a set-up, and I\u2019m just an innocent victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">During oral arguments on appeal, counsel for Pinkey contended that the trial court\u2019s suggestion that the prosecutor examine the Government\u2019s handwriting expert with regard to comparison analysis of the writings on documents then in evidence (and with regard to which the expert had already testified) and the hand printed voir dire questions written by Pinkey thereafter handed to the judge, constituted plain error because (a) it denied Pinkey a fair trial by displaying the bias and prejudice of the trial judge toward Pinkey and (b) it compelled Pinkey to testify in his own defense as a result of the expert witness\u2019 testimony on re-direct examination. We find no merit in either contention. The record reflects that the trial court was concerned for and steadfast in protecting Pinkey\u2019s rights at all stages of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">In the administration of the criminal justice system, the trial judge has the obligation of safeguarding the rights of the accused while at the same time protecting the interests of society. The adversary nature of criminal proceedings does not prohibit the trial judge from taking proper steps to aid and assist the jury in the truth finding quest leading to the proper determination of guilt or innocence. In the promotion of this goal, the trial judge has an obligation, on his own initiative, at proper times and in a dignified, and impartial manner, to inject certain matters into the trial which he deems important in the search for truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">In <em>Quercia v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933), the trial judge instructed the jury relative to the rules of innocence and reasonable doubt; and he instructed that expressions of opinion on the evidence by the court are not binding on the jury and should be disregarded if the jury believes the evidence indicates otherwise. The judge then expressed his opinion that \u201cI think that every single word that man said, except when he agreed with the Government\u2019s testimony, was a lie.\u201d The judge\u2019s opinion was attrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>uted primarily to the defendant\u2019s mannerism of wiping his hands as he testified. Following the above observation, the court again instructed the jury that his opinion was not binding and that if the jury should not agree \u201c. . . it is your duty to find him not guilty.\u201d The defendant\u2019was convicted. The Supreme Court reversed, based primarily upon the trial judge\u2019s statement of the defendant\u2019s lack of credibility predicated upon his mannerisms rather than any analysis of the evidence. For purposes here, however, this language from the opinion is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">In a trial by jury in a federal court, the judge is not a mere moderator, but is the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct and of determining questions of law. <em>Herron v. Southern Pacific Co., </em>283 U.S. 91, 95, 51 S.Ct. 383, 75 L.Ed. 857. In charging the jury, the trial judge is not limited to instructions of an abstract sort. It is within his province, whenever he thinks it necessary, to assist the jury in arriving at a just conclusion by explaining and commenting upon the evidence, by drawing their attention to the parts of it which he thinks important; and he may express his opinion upon the facts, provided he makes it clear to the jury that all matters of fact are submitted to their determination. 289 U.S., at 469, 53 S.Ct. at 698.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In <em>Massey v. United States, </em>358 F.2d 782 (10th Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 878, 87 S.Ct. 159, 17 L.Ed.2d 105 (1966), this Court said, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">The appellant contends that the trial judge participated too actively in the conduct of the trial, <em>especially in suggesting necessary proof to the prosecuting attorney. </em>This court has recently stated, in <em>Ayash v. United States, </em>352 F.2d 1009 (10th Cir. 1965) that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az_\">. . The trial Judge is not a mere moderator or umpire in the trial of a case in federal court, and, within reasonable bounds, he has the right to participate in eliciting the truth. He should, however, be careful not to become an advocate for any of the parties, (p. 1010.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">358 F.2d, at pp. 786, 787.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">Analogous to the above decisions is this statement from <em>Gardner v. United States, </em>283 F.2d 580 (10th Cir. 1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-13\">. appellants point to several incidents where the court ruled out questions without first having an objection from the prosecution. But the circumstances were such that the questions were argumentative, repetitious in the extreme, or subject to an earlier considered ruling by the court. We believe that the control used by the trial court was not only justified but, indeed, was dictated by the duty of the moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-14\">283 F.2d, at 581.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">In <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>444 F.2d 385 (10th Cir. 1971), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-16\">The trial judge is allowed to participate in a trial and ask questions of witnesses in order to ascertain the facts. He cannot show hostility toward one side or become an advocate for one side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-17\">444 F.2d, at p. 390.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-18\">In <em>McBride v. United States, </em>409 F.2d 1046 (10th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 938, 90 S.Ct. 282, 24 L.Ed.2d 240 (1969), the trial judge questioned a witness who had given conflicting answers in response to questions asked on cross-examination. The judge premised his questioning with the explanation that he wanted the witness to clarify his answers. On appeal this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-19\">the Court\u2019s interrogations were for the purpose of clarifying the facts in the case and were not advocacy. The questions asked were within the range of the judge\u2019s authority and did not prejudice in any way the rights of the defendant .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-20\">409 F.2d, at 1049.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-21\">The general rule is that a federal judge has the right to examine witnesses. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, Criminal, Vol. 2, \u00a7 415, pp. 176-178; <em>Barba-Reyes v. United States, </em>387 F.2d 91 (9th Cir. 1967); <em>United States v. Ostendorff, </em>371 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>F.2d 729 (4th Cir. 1967); <em>United States v. Rosenberg, </em>195 F.2d 583 (2nd Cir. 1952), <em>cert. denied, </em>344 U.S. 838, 73 S.Ct. 20, 97 L.Ed. 652 (1952); <em>United States v. Amorosa, </em>167 F.2d 596 (3rd Cir. 1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The power of the court to call witnesses on its own motion in criminal cases, while seldom used, is recognized by both state and federal courts. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>331 F.2d 265 (8th Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 824, 85 S.Ct. 49, 13 L.Ed.2d 34 (1964); <em>United States v. Lutwak, </em>195 F.2d 748 (7th Cir. 1952), affirmed 344 U.S. 604, 73 S.Ct. 481, 97 L.Ed. 593 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In <em>Cooper v. United States, </em>403 F.2d 71 (10th Cir. 1968), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">. While indications in the presence of the jury [by the judge] that statements of the defense counsel are <em>ridiculous, </em>are not to be encouraged, such conduct certainly does not constitute reversible error. <em>Petersen v. United States, </em>268 F.2d 87, 88 (10th Cir. 1959). Indeed, that incident and the others discussed above, were no more than displays indicative of a firm control of the proceedings and fall well within the reasonable bounds within which a trial judge may act. <em>Inland Freight Lines v. United States, </em>191 F.2d 313 (10th Cir. 1951). [Emphasis supplied.] 403 F.2d, at 73.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Measured by the above cited rules and evidence in the record before us, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Pinkey\u2019s rights were not prejudiced. Even had we found prejudice, however, it would most certainly be harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Pinkey\u2019s guilt. Thus, any prejudicial effect of the trial court\u2019s alleged \u201cadvocacy\u201d on behalf of the Government could rise no higher than harmless error. <em>Schneble v. Florida, </em>405 U.S. 427, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 31 L.Ed.2d 340 (1972); <em>Chase v. Crisp, </em>523 F.2d 595 (10th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 947, 96 S.Ct. 1418, 47 L.Ed.2d 354 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Finally, we note that Pinkey failed to object to the trial court\u2019s action in regard to the court\u2019s suggestion that the Government conduct further examination of its handwriting expert. Pinkey elected to proceed with the trial of this case on a <em>pro se </em>basis, with court appointed counsel on hand for \u201cstand-by\u201d or \u201cadvisory\u201d purposes whenever Pinkey <em>wished to seek legal assistance. </em>This, of course, was Pinkey\u2019s right. <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>529 F.2d 1404 (10th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 908, 96 S.Ct. 2231, 48 L.Ed.2d 833. And the \u201chybrid\u201d arrangement [self-representation with \u201cstand-by\u201d counsel] was within the discretion of the trial court to allow. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>526 F.2d 1019 (10th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied </em>425 U.S. 940, 96 S.Ct. 1676, 48 L.Ed.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Our review of the record in the present case convinces us that the trial judge did everything possible to inform Pin-key of the risks he was assuming by proceeding <em>pro se </em>at trial, particularly in light of the complicated aspects of a mail fraud case. When Pinkey insisted on proceeding <em>pro se, </em>the trial judge encouraged and requested that he seek the advice of his \u201cstand-by\u201d counsel. The trial court carefully and adequately pointed out to Pinkey the magnitude of the undertaking and the risks involved in self-representation. Under these circumstances, Pinkey nevertheless proceeded <em>pro se. </em>When he did so, he assumed the obligation of abiding the technical rules governing the conduct of a trial. Pinkey\u2019s failure to object to the alleged prejudicial action of the trial court works to estop him from raising the objection for the first time on appeal, absent plain error. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>536 F.2d 1343 (10th Cir. 1976); <em>Warden </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 F.2d 747 (10th Cir. 1968); Fed.Rules Crim. Proc., Rules 30 and 52(a), 18 U.S.C.A. This rule is the more applicable in light of the fact that Pinkey had available competent counsel to represent him at trial, but which he [Pinkey] elected to place on a \u201cstand-by\u201d basis simply to advise and counsel him upon his request. The trial court carefully and meticulously informed Pinkey of the nature of the charges, the complexity of the trial and of the issues involved. The trial court attempted to convince Pinkey that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>should not run the risks of proceeding <em>pro se. </em>Pinkey nevertheless intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily made the choice to do so with full understanding of the risks involved. Under these circumstances the Constitution does not force a lawyer on an accused. <em>Moore v. Michigan, </em>355 U.S. 155, 78 S.Ct. 191, 2 L.Ed.2d 167 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Pinkey intelligently and voluntarily waived his Sixth Amendment right of active participation and assistance of trial counsel. <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). Having done so, he acquiesced in and subjected himself to the established rules of practice and procedure in federal criminal trials. <em>Carnley v. Cochran, </em>369 U.S. 506, 82 S.Ct. 884, 8 L.Ed.2d 70 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The hazards which beset a layman when he seeks to represent himself are obvious. He who proceeds <em>pro se </em>with full knowledge and understanding of the risks does so with no greater rights than a litigant represented by a lawyer, and the trial court is under -no obligation to become an \u201cadvocate\u201d for or to assist and guide the <em>pro se </em>layman through the trial thicket. <em>Garrison v. Lacey, </em>362 F.2d 798 (10th Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>387 U.S. 911, 87 S.Ct. 1696, 18 L.Ed.2d 630 (1967); <em>Murphy v.
