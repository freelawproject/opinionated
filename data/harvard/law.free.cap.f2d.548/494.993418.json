Because of its substantial impact on the employment of ILA labor, containerization, which first appeared in the Hampton Roads area in 1965, has been the subject of rules set forth in collective bargaining agree- \u2019 merits between the ILA and representatives of the steamship carriers for the periods 1968-1971 (the 1968 contract), 1971-1974 (the 1971 contract) and 1974-1977 (the 1974 contract).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The rules set forth in the 1974 contract provide, <em>inter alia, </em>that if \u201cfull shipper\u2019s loads\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are \u201cstripped\u201d or \u201cstuffed\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> within a fifty-mile radius of the port\u2019s center other than by employees of the consignee (in the case of import goods) or the shipper (in the case of export goods), such work must be performed by ILA longshoremen or the offending carrier must pay $1,000 in \u201cliquidated damages\u201d per container which should have been loaded or discharged to the ILA joint Container Royalty Fund.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Following the adoption of these provisions, United States Lines, Inc., a member of HRSA, cancelled the Equipment Interchange Agreements <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> between it and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>several motor carriers who refused to reimburse it for liquidated damages which it had to pay when they \u201cstripped\u201d full shipper\u2019s loads within the fifty-mile zone. Such cancellations effectively precluded the affected motor carriers from handling future United States Lines container cargo. The General Counsel contends, therefore that the rules and the conduct of the appellees in enforcing them create, in effect, an unlawful boycott of motor carriers who \u201cstrip\u201d full shipper\u2019s loads within fifty miles of the port\u2019s center.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The district court, however, concluded that the challenged provisions are valid work preservation measures under the doctrine of <em>Woodwork Manufacturers v. NLRB </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 612, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 18 L.Ed.2d 357, <em>reh. denied </em>387 U.S- 926, 87 S.Ct. 2026, 18 L.Ed.2d 985 and denied injunctive relief.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Our analysis begins with the rule of substantive law which will govern the Board\u2019s ultimate resolution of this controversy: regardless of the impact on other persons, union action and collective bargaining agreements which are intended to preserve work traditionally done by members of the bargaining unit do not contravene Sections 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) and 8(e) of the Act, <em>Woodwork Manufacturers v. NLRB, supra; </em>but labor contracts which are designed to acquire for members of the union work which they have not previously performed are unlawful if they expressly or impliedly require the employer to cease doing business with another person, <em>see, e.g., Local Union No. 98 of Sheet Metal Wkrs. In. Ass\u2019n v. N.L.R.B. </em>(1970) 140 U.S.App.D.C. 83, 433 F.2d 1189, 1195 and <em>N.L.R.B. v. Local U. No. 141 of Sheet Metal Wkrs.' Int. Ass\u2019n. </em>(6th Cir. 1970) 425 F.2d 730. From this statement of the rule, it is obvious that the primary question to be answered by the Board is whether the challenged rules are \u201cwork preservation\u201d provisions of \u201cwork acquisition\u201d measures.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">It is, however, neither necessary nor proper to resolve that issue finally at this preliminary stage. When considering a petition for temporary relief under Section 10(1), the function of the district court is not to decide the merits of the case but to determine whether the Regional Director has reasonable cause to believe that the respondents are violating the Act. <em>Sachs v. Local U. No. 48, United Ass\u2019n. of J. &amp; A. of Plumb., Etc. </em>(4th Cir. 1972) 454 F.2d 879, 882. Of course, this does not mean, as appellant argues and some courts have apparently held,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that even if the district court is convinced that the General Counsel\u2019s legal position is wrong, it must nevertheless grant the requested injunction so long as that position cannot be characterized as frivolous. <em>See </em>Judge Friendly\u2019s well-reasoned opinion in <em>Danielson v. Joint Bd. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>of Coat, Suit &amp; Allied Gar. Wkrs. U. </em>(2d Cir. 1974) 494 F.2d 1230, 1239-1245, holding that adoption of the \u201cinsubstantial and frivolous\u201d standard urged by some courts would be an abandonment of traditional equitable discretion unwarranted by either the language or the legislative history of Section 10(7). However, while a temporary injunction should not issue unless there is some reasonable possibility that the Board will ultimately enter an enforceable order, the General Counsel\u2019s resolution of disputed issues of law and fact should be accorded considerable deference in determining whether such possibility exists. <em>Danielson v. Joint Bd. of Coat, Suit &amp; Allied Gar. Wkrs. U., supra, </em>494 F.2d at 1245, and <em>Danielson v. International Or. of Mast., M. &amp; P., AFL-CIO, supra, </em>521 F.2d at 751. Where, as here, the Board\u2019s expertise in labor matters may be particularly useful because the case presents a difficult question as to the proper application of a legal standard to a complex industrial situation, the district court, acting without the benefit of full consideration of the issue by the Board, should be especially reluctant to conclude that the General Counsel\u2019s contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Bearing these standards in mind, we conclude that the district court erred in finding that the Regional Director lacked reasonable cause to believe that the rules with respect to the \u201cstripping\u201d and \u201cstuffing\u201d of full shipper\u2019s loads within the fifty-mile zone are unlawful \u201cwork acquisition\u201d measures. The reasons for this conclusion are apparent from a review of the role of longshoremen on the docks of the Hampton Roads area.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-17\">As established by the record, the traditional function of longshoremen is to load and unload the solid cargo of ocean-going ships at piers in the port area. Prior to the mid-1960\u2019s, most of this freight was \u201cbreak bulk cargo\u201d \u2014 loose boxes and bundles handled piece by piece. When loading ships, the longshoremen would unload such cargo from the trucks which brought it to the dock, prepare it for loading by stacking it on pallets and hoist it aboard ship. During off-loading, the longshoremen would re-, move the cargo-bearing pallets from the ship, sort the goods according to consignee and type and transport them to the end of the pier for loading onto trucks. Insofar as the record shows, the work of the longshoremen with respect to import cargo ended at the tailgate of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-18\">Containerized cargo first appeared in the Hampton Roads port area in 1965.6 *********<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> During the period 1965-1967, when there was no collective. bargaining agreement covering containerization, ILA longshoremen \u201cstripped\u201d containers holding goods destined for more than one \"consignee (consolidated container loads).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> During the same period, however, the general practice with regard to full shipper\u2019s loads was for longshoremen merely to remove the container from the ship and place it on the pier where it was picked up by a motor carrier. Occasionally, longshoremen would \u201cstrip\u201d such containers at the stevedore\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-19\">Since 1968, the collective bargaining agreements between the ILA and the steamship carriers have provided that certain consolidated container loads must be \u201cstripped\u201d and \u201cstuffed\u201d by ILA longshoremen or the offending shipping line must pay liquidated damages to the joint Container Royalty Fund.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Until 1974, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>ever, there was no express provision giving ILA labor the right to \u201cstrip\u201d or \u201cstuff\u201d any full shipper\u2019s loads.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">From the inception of containerization in the Port of Hampton Roads, motor carriers picking up unstripped full shipper\u2019s loads at the docks have often taken them to their port area terminals, stripped the cargo from the container and loaded it into their own trailers. A trucking firm may follow this practice in a particular instance for any of several reasons: to comply with ICC or state highway weight limits and weight distribution regulations, to eliminate safety problems,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to avoid per diem charges on containers owned by shipping companies by hauling the cargo in the motor carrier\u2019s own equipment which might otherwise be idle, or to use the motor carrier\u2019s tractors more efficiently by consolidating two or more container loads into a single trailer.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">From this brief summary of the factual background, it would seem evident that the \u201cstripping\u201d of these full shipper\u2019s loads by the truckers is not part of the process of loading and unloading the cargo of ships; rather it is done to facilitate and as part of the motor carrier\u2019s task of transporting the goods from the pier to the consignee.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Consequently (and not surprisingly), this work has traditionally been performed by employees of the motor carrier. It follows that such \u201cstripping\u201d does not fall within the bounds of the longshoremen\u2019s traditional role and that the challenged rules are unlawful \u201cwork acquisition\u201d measures, <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass'n v. NLRB </em>(2d Cir. 1976) 537 F.2d 706, <em>enforcing, International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n (Consolidated Express, Inc.), </em>221 NLRB No. 144 (1975).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">Thus, if this matter were before us for final decision, we would be inclined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>hold that the rules with respect to the \u201cstuffing\u201d and \u201cstripping\u201d of full shipper\u2019s loads constitute a \u201chot cargo agreement\u201d in violation of Section 8(e). Consequently, we conclude that appellant has ample reasonable cause to believe that appellees are violating the Act.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Appellant should, therefore, have been granted a temporary injunction prohibiting appellees from enforcing the challenged rules until this controversy has been finally resolved by the Board.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">For the reasons stated, the order below is vacated and the case is remanded for entry of an appropriate injunction<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> pursuant to Section 10(7) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-15\">.

Since this appeal was argued before us, an Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision finding that appellees have, in fact, violated Sections 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) and 8(e) has issued in the case. Therefore, the matter before us is almost moot, <em>Sears, Roebuck v.

The 1968 contract was negotiated by HRSA\u2019s predecessor, the Hampton Roads Maritime Association.

The General Counsel also contends that the ILA\u2019s exercise of its right, under the 1974 contract, to suspend the rules on containers on April 28, 1975, was a violation of Section - 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) in that it was designed to place additional pressure on members of HRSA to cease doing business with motor carriers who insisted on stripping full shipper\u2019s loads within the fifty-mile zone. This suspension lasted until May 30, 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\">. With respect to the contention that the suspension of the rules on containers by the ILA constituted unlawful coercion under Section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) (see note 12, supra), the district court concluded that injunctive relief was inappropriate because the issue was moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b597-9\">. Appellees make no contention that because the rules on containers do not expressly prohibit HRSA members from dealing with motor carriers who \u201cstrip\u201d full shipper\u2019s loads within the fifty-mile area, they cannot constitute a \u201chot cargo agreement.\u201d Because of the onerous conditions placed on transactions with such carriers by the rules, such a contention would be untenable, <em>Danielson v.

A precursor of containerization, Conex boxes, appeared in the port area during World War II and the Korean War. These were military boxes not owned by the steamship lines. They were loaded by the government with ammunition, household goods, electronic equipment, <em>etc. </em>and were not \u201cstripped\u201d by ILA labor. Under the current rules, containers bearing military goods continue to be exempt from ILA stripping and stuffing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b598-20\">. Industry terminology uses several terms such as Iess-than-trailer load (LTL) cargo, less-than-container load (LCL) cargo and consolidated full container load (CFCL) cargo to describe various types of container loads other than full shipper\u2019s loads. However, for convenience, we will use the phrase \u201cconsolidated container load\u201d to refer to all such container loads.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b598-21\">. The consolidated container loads to which these provisions apply are those destined for or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>coming from any person within the fifty-mile zone who is not the beneficial owner of the cargo.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\">. Appellees contend, however, that this right was impliedly protected by the 1968 and 1971 contracts. In support of this position, they point to evidence that, on some occasions during the 1968-1974 period, liquidated damages were assessed against shipping lines by the ILA and HRSA because full shipper\u2019s loads had been \u201cstripped\u201d by truckers. The court below rejected appellees\u2019 contention and concluded that such \u201cfines\u201d had been imposed \u201cerroneously.\u201d (We note that appellees\u2019 position is also rejected by the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision in the case [see note 6 <em>supra </em>] which finds that, at most, only one of the occasions on which appellees rely occurred prior to the September, 1972 meeting at which the provisions now under challenge were first proposed.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\">. For example, in the case of a load bound for West Virginia, a container packed to its roof might be too susceptible to turning over on narrow mountain roads. In such event, the goods might be transferred from the container to the trucker\u2019s trailer in order to lower the load\u2019s center of gravity.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">As another example, there was evidence that the tires on container chassis tend to blow out more often than those on trucker-owned trailers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">. A container might also be \u201cstripped\u201d in order to consolidate its cargo with non-containerized freight (e. <em>g. </em>goods not originating overseas and never handled by a shipping line) bound for the same destination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b599-12\">. It is of interest that, under the 1974 contract, a shipping line is not subject to fine if a trucker \u201cstrips\u201d a full shipper\u2019s load outside the fifty-mile area (except where existing patterns of consolidation are changed in order to evade the rules). If the act of \u201cstripping\u201d the cargo from a container and loading it into other equipment, done to meet the motor carrier\u2019s convenience or necessity, is not part of the process of loading or unloading ships when it is carried out at the motor carrier\u2019s terminal in Richmond or Durham, then it is difficult, on the record before us, to understand why the same act, performed for the same purpose, is a part of that process when accomplished at the carrier\u2019s Norfolk terminal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b599-13\">. The Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Consolidated Express </em>sustaining the Board\u2019s finding that the rules with respect to \u201cstripping\u201d and \u201cstuffing\u201d consolidated container loads (see note 18 and accompanying text supra) as applied in the Port of New York violated Sections 8(e) and 8(b)(4)(ii)(B), is particularly persuasive in support of appellant\u2019s position in this case. It is difficult to perceive any rational basis for concluding that the rules with respect to full shipper\u2019s loads are more directed at \u201cwork preservation\u201d within the meaning of the <em>National Woodwork </em>doctrine than those concerning consolidated container loads. Therefore, in order to prevail in this controversy, appellees would have to convince the Board \u2014 or this court on appeal from an adverse final decision of the Board \u2014 that <em>Consolidated Express </em>was wrongly decided or demonstrate the existence of some controlling factual distinction which is not apparent on the record now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>In fairness to the court below, we note that neither the Board\u2019s decision nor the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion had issued in <em>Consolidated Express </em>when the order denying appellant\u2019s petition for temporary relief under Section 10(7) was entered in this case. The only opinion then extant was that of the Administrative Law Judge (subsequently reversed), concluding that there had been no violation of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\">. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision (see note 6 supra) sustains the General Counsel\u2019s position. We note also that, in a substantially similar case arising from the Port of Baltimore, another district court has concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that the challenged rules violate the Act, <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>ILA </em>(D.Md. No. Y-75-1395, decided March 25, 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">Other circuits have disagreed as to whether the determination that reasonable cause exists or does not exist is a finding of fact to be reversed only if clearly erroneous or a conclusion of law subject to full appellate review, <em>compare Squillacote v. Graphic Arts Int. U. (GAIU) Local 277 </em>(7th Cir. 1975) 513 F.2d 1017, 1021 <em>with Danielson v. Joint Bd. of Coat, Suit &amp; Allied Gar. Wkrs. U., supra, </em>494 F.2d at 1244. Because we conclude that appellant would be entitled to reversal under either standard, we need not address that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b600-15\">. The record shows that those motor carriers whose Equipment Interchange Agreements have been cancelled stand to lose substantial business so long as those cancellations remain in effect. They have, therefore, demonstrated sufficient likelihood of harm pending final adjudication to warrant interim relief under Section 10(1). <em>See Humphrey v. Drivers, Chauffeurs &amp; Helpers Local 639 </em>(D.Md.1974) 369 F.Supp. 730, 739-740.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b600-16\">. Examination of the record reveals reasonable cause to believe that the ILA\u2019s suspension of the rules on containers in April, 1975 (see notes 12 and 13 supra) was intended to pressure members of HRSA into cancelling the Equipment Interchange Agreements of motor carriers who \u201cstripped\u201d full shipper\u2019s loads and that the suspension was, therefore, in violation of Section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B). Such conduct being obviously capable of repetition, it would be appropriate for the injunction entered on remand to prohibit future suspension for similar purposes, <em>see Squillacote v. Graphic Arts Int. U. (GAIU) Local 277, supra, </em>513 F.2d at 1023, n. 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b600-6\">CRAVEN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AAk\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Without so much as a wasted word, my brother Russell has accurately and fairly recited the evidentiary facts, correctly framed the question, and exposited the law to be applied to the facts to determine whether the district judge abused his discretion in denying a temporary injunction sought by the Regional Director. I agree especially with Judge Russell that the primary question is \u201cwhether the challenged rules are \u2018work preservation\u2019 provisions or \u2018work acquisition\u2019 measures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">In order to answer that question, it is essential to define precisely the work in controversy. My brothers fall into the same error that occasioned an erroneous decision, it seems to me, in <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s Assoc, v. NLRB, </em>537 F.2d 706 (2d Cir. 1976). In that case the Board, and later a majority of the court, treated the \u201cwork in controversy\u201d as \u201cthe LCL and LTL container work performed by [trucking companies] at their own off-pier premises.\u201d In the course of dissenting, Judge Feinberg pointed out that the definition was incorrect because it focused on work done in the relatively recent past by trucking companies rather than on the work done traditionally and over a longer period of years by the longshoremen.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">Containerization is relatively new. The loading and unloading of ships outruns history. The work to be preserved is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>loading and unloading of ships. To focus entirely upon stripping and stuffing containers is to utterly ignore the traditional work of seamen and longshoremen, for there can be nothing traditional nor even long-established about containerization practice. Judge Merhige recognized the distinction clearly when he quoted from the parties\u2019 agreement of October 1, 1974:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">The provisions are intended to protect and preserve the work jurisdiction of the longshoremen and all other ILA crafts which was performed at deep-sea waterfront facilities. The rules do not have any effect on work which historically was not performed at a waterfront facility by deep-sea ILA labor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">As Judge Feinberg said, \u201cif the work is defined as the work the ILA members used to do on the pier before containerization moved most of it off the pier, the case takes on a different cast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">I am respectfully of the opinion that my brothers commit an error of law by focusing on the wrong \u201cwork\u201d in deciding whether the longshoremen are protected by <em>National Woodwork </em>and its doctrine permitting work preservation. Looking at the work the longshoremen seek to preserve, their traditional work of loading and unloading ships, I think it becomes apparent that the Regional Director lacked reasonable cause to believe that rules with respect to the stripping and stuffing of containers within the 50-mile zone are unlawful \u201cwork acquisition\u201d measures. Twenty years ago the longshoremen had it all. Now they seek only to retain a part of it. This is not to me \u201cwork acquisition.\u201d I think Judge Merhige wisely considered all of the factors and did not abuse his discretion in denying the prayer for preliminary injunction. I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
