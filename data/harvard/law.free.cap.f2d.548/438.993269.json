(\u201cJacobson\u201d) is a contractor in the business of furnishing and installing acoustical ceiling systems, interior partitions, and other interior building products. Defendant-appellant Armstrong Cork Company (\u201cArmstrong\u201d) is the largest manufacturer of acoustical and non-acoustical ceiling products in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">In March, 1968 Jacobson was designated an authorized distributor of Armstrong products in New York City, Long Island, Westchester and Rockland Counties (New York State), in Fairfield County, Connecticut, and in northern New Jersey. This relationship continued until March 19, 1976, when Armstrong notified Jacobson that its distributorship was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">In a complaint filed May 26, 1976, Jacobson charged Armstrong with combining, conspiring, and attempting to monopolize and restrain trade, in violation of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 14, and the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 13. Essentially, Jacobson alleged that Armstrong had allocated territories among its distributors and had engaged in certain vertical restraints. Jacobson claimed that Armstrong had terminated the distributorship in retaliation for Jacobson\u2019s refusal to adhere to these alleged unlawful practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">Jacobson, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that it required access to Armstrong products in order to remain competitive as a ceiling contractor, sought a preliminary and permanent injunction restraining Armstrong from terminating plaintiff as an authorized distributor of Armstrong products and directing Armstrong to sell its products to plaintiff on nondiscriminatory terms. Jacobson also sought treble damages plus costs and attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">On July 13, 1976, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Weinfeld, J., entered an order granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, pending resolution of the merits of this controversy at trial. It is from this decision that defendant now appeals. We affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b540-16\">The district court recognized that the merits of this case turn entirely on factual determinations. Thus, the central issue presented is whether or not' Armstrong terminated the distributorship because of Jacobson\u2019s resistance to Armstrong\u2019s alleged territorial allocations and resale, restrictions. If this factual issue is resolved against Armstrong, then plaintiff will almost certainly be entitled to judgment, under the rule of <em>United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co., </em>388 U.S. 365, 379, 87 S.Ct. 1856, 18 L.Ed.2d 1249 (1967). If, however, the termination was for legitimate business purposes, then Armstrong will prevail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-17\">Judge Weinfeld, applying the familiar standard set forth in <em>Sonesta International </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>Hotels Corp. v. Willington Associates, </em>483 F.2d 247 (2d Cir. 1973),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held that while plaintiff had not made a compelling case of probable success on the merits, it had shown sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation. This, coupled with the court\u2019s finding that the potential hardship to Jacobson outweighed any inconvenience that Armstrong might suffer as a result of an injunction, led the court to conclude that plaintiff had satisfied the second alternative of the <em>Sonesta </em>test, and was thus entitled to a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Defendant now attacks this decision on two grounds. First, defendant argues that the district court misconstrued the standard to be applied in deciding preliminary injunction motions. Second, defendant claims that, in any event, the record does not support the district court\u2019s action. We reject both of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Armstrong contends that a greater showing is required for the grant of a preliminary injunction which is mandatory rather than prohibitory in form, and that therefore the district court erred by failing to require a showing of \u201cextreme or very serious damage.\u201d <em>Clune v. Publishers\u2019 Association of New York City, </em>214 F.Supp. 520, 531 (S.D. N.Y.), <em>aff\u2019d on the opinion below, </em>314 F.2d 343 (2d Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">We agree that a different standard applies to mandatory injunctions. Indeed, Judge Weinfeld recognized as much when he referred to \u201c[t]he court\u2019s usual reluctance\u201d to grant such relief. <em>Jacobson &amp; Company, Inc. v. Armstrong Cork Company, </em>416 F.Supp. 564 at 570 (S.D.N.Y.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">Nevertheless, issuance of a preliminary injunction, whatever its form, is in the district court\u2019s discretion and will not be overturned absent a showing of abuse of mistake. <em>Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., </em>422 U.S. 922, 931-32, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975); <em>Triebwasser &amp; Katz v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra </em>at 1358; <em>S.C.M. Corp. v. Xerox Corp., </em>507 F.2d 358, 360 (2d Cir. 1974); 7 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 65.-04[2] at 65-47-49 (2d ed. 1975). We are not convinced that by failing to articulate the \u201cextreme or very serious damage\u201d formula of <em>Clune </em>the district court abused its discretion. Judge Weinfeld was aware that mandatory injunctions present a special case, but nonetheless held that plaintiff had made a sufficient showing to justify preliminary injunctive relief. We decline to disturb that decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">Nor are we persuaded by Armstrong\u2019s argument that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>misapplied the <em>Sonesta </em>test by granting the injunction without holding an evidentiary hearing. Defendant did not request an evidentiary hearing below and therefore \u201ccannot be heard to complain\u201d that a hearing was not conducted. <em>Semmes Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>429 F.2d 1197, 1205 (2d Cir. 1970). As we said in <em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Frank, </em>388 F.2d 486, 493 n. 6 (2d Cir. 1968),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">\u201cif a party is unwilling to have the issuance of a temporary injunction decided on affidavits, he must make his objection known; he may not gamble on the judge\u2019s accepting his affidavits rather than his adversary\u2019s and then seek a reversal if the result is disappointing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\"><em>See also Dopp v. Franklin National Bank, </em>461 F.2d 873, 879 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Judge Weinfeld had before him not only the pleadings and affidavits of the parties, but also the transcripts of three depositions and a number of exhibits. Where the district court has the benefit of so complete a record, and the parties themselves fail to request a hearing, no evidentiary hearing is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Appellant also claims that in order to satisfy <em>either </em>prong of the <em>Sonesta </em>test, the movant must demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits. Essentially, appellant argues that neither <em>Sonesta </em>nor any of the decisions from which the second branch of the <em>Sonesta </em>test is derived, <em>see Gulf &amp; Western Industries, Inc. v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>476 F.2d 687, 692-93 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>Checker Motors Corp. v. Chrysler Corp., </em>405 F.2d 319, 323 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 999, 89 S.Ct. 1595, 22 L.Ed.2d 777 (1969); <em>Dino DeLaurentiis Cinematografica, S.p.A. v. D-150, Inc., 866 </em>F.2d 373, 374-75 (2d Cir. 1966); <em>Unicon Management Corp. v. Koppers Company, Inc., </em>366 F.2d 199, 204-05 (2d Cir. 1966); <em>Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., </em>206 F.2d 738 (2d Cir. 1953), abandoned the \u201clikelihood of success\u201d requirement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">In <em>Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., supra, </em>Judge Frank declared that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agu\">\u201c[t]o justify a temporary injunction it is not necessary that the plaintiff\u2019s right to a final decision, after a trial, be absolutely certain, wholly without doubt; if the other elements are present <em>(i. e., </em>the balance of hardships tips decidedly toward plaintiff), it will ordinarily be enough that the plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them a fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">206 F.2d at 740 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">We elaborated upon <em>Hamilton Watch </em>in <em>Unicon Management Corp. v. Koppers Company, Inc., supra </em>at 204-05, and <em>Dino DeLaurentiis Cinematografica, S.p.A. v. D\u2014150, Inc., supra </em>at 375, where we held that a showing of probable success on the merits was required only where the movant has failed to show either a threat of irreparable harm or a balance of hardships in his favor. Accordingly, in <em>Checker Motors Corp. v. Chrysler Corp., supra, </em>we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial-of a preliminary injunction because \u201ca review of the involved hardships and equities did not disclose a balance favoring injunctive relief . . . .\u201d 405 F.2d at 323. <em>See also Gulf &amp; Western Industries, Inc. v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., supra </em>at 692-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">Against this background, it simply cannot be maintained that a temporary injunction will not be granted except on a showing of a likelihood of success. <em>Chicago, Rock Island &amp; P.R. Co. v. Switchmen\u2019s Union of North America, </em>292 F.2d 61 (2d Cir. 1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>370 U.S. 936, 82 S.Ct. 1578, 8 L.Ed.2d 806 (1962), and <em>Hoh v. Pepsico, Inc., </em>491 F.2d 556 (2d Cir. 1974), cited by appellant, are not to the contrary. In <em>Switch-men\u2019s Union </em>we reversed a preliminary injunction order not for want of a showing of probable success, but because we held clearly erroneous a finding of fact relied on by the district court in granting the injunction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>292 F.2d at 70-71. Furthermore, that case is inapposite insofar as our decision there was mandated by section 4 of the Norris LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 104. <em>Id. </em>at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We therefore reaffirm that the second branch of the <em>Sonesta </em>test requires no more than a showing of \u201csufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation.\u201d 483 F.2d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In <em>Hoh, </em>we stated that \u201csome likelihood of success\" was required, 491 F.2d at 561, only <em>after </em>finding that the hardships did not tip decisively in the movants\u2019 favor, <em>id. </em>at 560. Clearly, <em>Hoh </em>was not a departure from <em>Hamilton Watch </em>and its progeny.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The only remaining question is whether the record supports the district court\u2019s findings that Jacobson raised substantial questions regarding the existence of antitrust violations and made a sufficient showing of irreparable injury. We hold that it does.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">A. <em>The Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Jacobson cites three separate episodes in support of its charge that Armstrong terminated the distributorship because of Jacobson\u2019s refusal to adhere to unlawful trade restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">First, plaintiff claims that its attempts to penetrate the Philadelphia market in 1970-72 were stymied by Armstrong\u2019s refusal to quote prices or provide technical assistance from its local office. By requiring Jacobson to obtain pricing information and servicing from Armstrong\u2019s New Jersey office, plaintiff charges, defendant sought to protect the Berger Acoustical Company (\u201cBerger\u201d), its principal Philadelphia distributor. While Jacobson asserts no direct relationship between this episode and the 1976 termination, it does argue that these events illustrate Armstrong\u2019s desire to protect the alleged division of territories \u201cand provide a backdrop against which to view later events.\u201d 416 F.Supp. at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">In rebuttal, Armstrong contends that it was for purely administrative reasons that Jacobson was required to resort to the New Jersey office. This refusal to deal with Jacobson through offices located in other areas, appellant argues, does not rise to the level of an allocation of territories. <em>See GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Continental T.V., Inc., </em>537 F.2d 980 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>World of Sleep, Inc. v. Stearns &amp; Foster Co., </em>525 F.2d 40 (10th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">Jacobson also contends that the termination was at least partly a reaction to the aggressive sales activities employed at its Elizabeth, New Jersey \u201csupply center\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Jacobson supports this claim with evidence of (1) complaints by Berger to Armstrong about the supply center\u2019s discount offers and promotional mailings, and (2) an interoffice memo by Armstrong\u2019s general sales manager taking note of the supply center advertisements and expressing the view that Jacobson\u2019s activities would create problems for Armstrong with its other distributors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Armstrong replies that its concern was not with the sales themselves but with the disclosure in these advertisements of its confidential price list, and the tendency of the flyers to create the impression that Jacobson was receiving special price reductions from Armstrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Finally, Jacobson cites the circumstances surrounding its February, 1976 bid for a ceiling installation contract in Atlanta, Georgia. Armstrong agreed to provide Jacobson with pricing information and other technical data only after Jacobson objected that the refusal to render these services would be \u201canticompetitive.\u201d Armstrong had initially indicated its disapproval of Jacobson\u2019s bidding on Atlanta jobs, in light of Armstrong\u2019s \u201cadequate coverage\u201d there from local distributors. Jacobson won that contract, without bidding Armstrong products, and three weeks later was terminated as an Armstrong distributor.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Armstrong claims that there was no antitrust significance to this termination, which it characterizes as a justifiable reaction to Jacobson\u2019s alleged practice of using Armstrong\u2019s price quotations to predict and undercut the bids of other Armstrong distributors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">On this record, it is questionable whether Jacobson has shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits at trial. However, we think it plain that plaintiff has sustained its burden of raising serious questions going to the merits which make them a fair ground for litigation. The affidavits, depositions, and various exhibits raise at least the inference that Jacobson was terminated because of its extraterritorial sales activities. Although this issue cannot be finally decided until discovery is completed and the court has the benefit of a full factual presentation, Jacobson has satisfied the first half of the alternative <em>Sonesta </em>test.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">B. <em>The Balance of Hardships</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">Judge Weinfeld found that loss of the Armstrong line would jeopardize Jacobson\u2019s good will and create a risk of \u201cimmeasurable harm\u201d should Jacobson\u2019s customers and potential customers turn to competitors who do sell Armstrong products. 416 F.Supp. at 570. He also concluded that the competitive disadvantage at which Jacob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>son would be placed were it unable to bid Armstrong products was neither calculable nor compensable in dollars and cents. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We agree that Jacobson presented ample evidence to show a threatened loss of good will and customers, both present and potential, neither of which could be rectified by monetary damages. Furthermore, it is clear that continuation of the injunction will cause Armstrong less harm than would be caused Jacobson were the injunction dissolved. Defendant concedes that it will suffer no financial loss as a result of continued dealings with plaintiff; indeed, the only injury claimed by Armstrong is that which arises from being compelled to sell to a distributor against its will. We find this to be insignificant, particularly in light of Armstrong\u2019s agreement, despite the termination notice, to sell Jacobson sufficient additional materials to fulfill obligations which existed at the termination date.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In sum, defendant has. been unable to show that it will suffer any real harm if forced to continue selling to plaintiff pending the outcome of this action. Under these circumstances, there has been a clear showing of \u201ca balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary relief.\u201d <em>Sonesta International Hotels Corp. v. Wellington Associates, supra </em>at 250. <em>See generally Interphoto Corp. v. Minolta Corp., </em>417 F.2d 621 (2d Cir. 1969); <em>Bergen Drug Co. v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co., </em>307 F.2d 725 (3d Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-11\">. Armstrong contends that Jacobson was terminated because it made severe cutbacks in its sales organization and adopted a policy of bidding only on very large jobs, which are less profitable to Armstrong. Furthermore, Armstrong claims that as a result of other differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>enees between the parties, their business relationship had deteriorated. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 5-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Of course, at this stage we express no opinion as to the merits of the substantive antitrust and factual issues involved in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-11\">. We held in <em>Sonesta </em>that a preliminary injunction should issue on a showing of either</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1S\">\u201c(1) probable success on the merits <em>and </em>possible irreparable injury, <em>or </em>(2) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation <em>and </em>a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abq\">483 F.2d at 250 (emphasis in original). <em>Accord: Triebwasser &amp; Katz v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>535 F.2d 1356 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>American Brands, Inc. v. Playgirl, Inc., </em>498 F.2d 947 (2d Cir. 1974); <em>Gulf &amp; Western Industries, Inc. v.

Chrysler Corp., </em>405 F.2d 319 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 999, 89 S.Ct. 1595, 22 L.Ed.2d 777 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b541-16\">. This court has implicitly recognized that satisfaction of the <em>Clune </em>standard is not a <em>sine qua non </em>for obtaining a mandatory preliminary injunction. For example, in <em>Interphoto Corp. v. Minolta Corp., </em>417 F.2d 621 (2d Cir. 1969) and <em>Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>429 F.2d 1197 (2d Cir. 1970), we upheld preliminary injunctions directing manufacturers to continue selling products to distributors, without requiring a showing of \u201cextreme or very serious damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-17\">Appellant\u2019s argument, stripped to its essentials, is that the <em>Clune </em>standard <em>replaces </em>the <em>Sonesta </em>test in mandatory injunction cases. Both alternatives of <em>Sonesta, </em>however, require that the movant show a threat of irreparable harm. <em>See Triebwasser &amp; Katz v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra, </em>at 1359 (\u201c[The] language of the second prong of the <em>Sonesta </em>test does not eliminate the basic obligation ... to make a clear showing of the threat of irreparable harm.\u201d) Since it seems to us that \u201cirreparable harm\u201d is indistinguishable from \u201cextreme or very serious damage,\u201d we read <em>Clune </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>merely a reaffirmation of the traditional reluctance to issue mandatory injunctions \u201cin doubtful cases or where the injury complained of is capable of compensation in damages.\u201d <em>Clune v. Publishers\u2019 Association of New York City, supra </em>at 531.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b543-14\">. Similarly, despite our statement in <em>Dopp v. Franklin National Bank, supra </em>at 878, that \u201ca preliminary injunction will not be granted unless the plaintiff can make a clear showing of probable success,\u201d we recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-16\">\u201cif there is an imbalance of hardships and the equities weigh heavily in favor of the movant, an injunction will issue ... if \u2018the plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them a fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.\u2019 <em>Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., </em>206 F.2d 738, 740 (2d Cir. 1953).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIJ\"><em>Id. </em>at 881. Accordingly, it was only in the light of Dopp\u2019s inability to prove irreparable injury that we reversed the district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction. Since the showing of irreparable harm is required under <em>both </em>branches of the <em>Sonesta </em>test, <em>see </em>note 3 <em>supra, Dopp </em>does not support appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b543-17\">. We are aware that the standard for reviewing factual determinations where no evidence was taken in open court below is not whether the district court has abused its discretion. Rather, \u201cthis Court is able to exercise its discretion and review the papers <em>de novo.\u201d San Filippo v.
