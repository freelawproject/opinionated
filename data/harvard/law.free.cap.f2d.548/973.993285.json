The trial judge subsequently refused to grant her request for a preliminary injunction and ruled that she would \u201cbe required to exhaust her administrative remedies within the [Department]\u201d before proceeding further in District Court. In <em>Grubbs v. Butz, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. 82, 514 F.2d 1323 (1975), we affirmed the denial of the injunction, but ruled that no further exhaustion should have been required, that the court and the Department could exercise concurrent jurisdiction, and that the court could not rely on the record of administrative proceedings that were not completed prior to the filing of the civil action without giving Ms. Grubbs a full opportunity to present her own evidence in court. The effect of our decision was to allow Ms. Grubbs to \u201csafely elect to concentrate her entire resources on the judicial proceedmgs. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-16\">Ms. Grubbs now asserts that she is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under \u00a7 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which was rendered applicable to employment discrimination actions against the federal government by \u00a7 717(d) of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finding her claim premature, we deny it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-17\">Most courts that have been called upon to construe the \u201cprevailing party\u201d provision have done so in cases in which the focus was on the propriety of awards to parties who had demonstrated discrimination by the defendant but were unable to prove that they were victims of it, or to parties who have sustained some but not all of their claims. Awards have been upheld in both of these situations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For the purposes of this motion, we assume that despite her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>failure to obtain injunctive relief, Ms. Grubbs \u201cprevailed\u201d on the interlocutory appeal. The more troubling question remains \u2014 whether her success on that interlocutory appeal qualifies her as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">The statute, however, does not define \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Scant attention was focused on the attorney\u2019s fee provision amid the sound and fury of the extended debates on the 1964 Civil Rights Act. No counsel fee provision was included in the version of Title VII reported out of the House Judiciary Committee,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or that initially approved by the House of Representatives and submitted to the Senate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The provision first appeared in Title VII as part of a comprehensive amendment in the nature of a substitute, submitted by Senators Mansfield and Dirksen.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That comprehensive amendment was approved by the Senate<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and later adopted in toto by the House.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-13\">From the Senate debate on the Mansfield-Dirksen amendment, however, two purposes for \u00a7 706(k) emerge. First, Congress desired to \u201cmake it easier for a plaintiff of limited means to bring a meritorious suit,\u201d as Senator Humphrey stated in explaining the changes made by the amendment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, the attorneys\u2019 fee provision was an integral part of the Senate\u2019s effort to shift primary responsibility for enforcing Title VII from the EEOC to aggrieved individuals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But second, and equally important, Congress intended to \u201cdeter the bringing of lawsuits without foundation\u201d by providing that the \u201cprevailing party\u201d \u2014 be it plaintiff or defendant\u2014 could obtain legal fees.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Were this not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>Congress\u2019 intent, it would have authorized fees only to prevailing plaintiffs, or to \u201cany party\u201d as it has done in many other instances.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">Since Congress was solicitous enough of the rights of innocent Title VII defendants to authorize awards of attorneys\u2019 fees in their favor, we cannot believe Congress would have countenanced assessing fees against a-defendant absent any showing of discrimination.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For all we now know, the defendants in this case may be entirely blameless. If attorneys\u2019 fees were assessed against them at this point in the litigation, the ultimately successful party might end up having subsidized a large segment of the losing party\u2019s suit against him. While that prospect might be consonant with the goals of a statute authorizing fee awards to any party,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we find it contrary to the purposes of one that provides for awards only to the party who prevails.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It follows that since Ms. Grubbs has yet to demonstrate discrimination, an award of counsel fees would be inappropriate at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">In reaching this conclusion, we in no way imply that an interim fee award would be inappropriate if the losing party had \u201cacted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons . . ..\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Nor do we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>denigrate the propriety of an interim award once discrimination has been established. As Justice Blackmun wrote for a unanimous Court in <em>Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, </em>courts \u201cmust have discretion to award fees and costs incident to the final disposition of interim matters.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">Ms. Grubbs has won a significant procedural victory, simplifying the path that victims of discrimination by Government agencies must follow to vindicate their Title VII rights. If Ms. Grubbs succeeds in proving discrimination, the work for which she now claims fees would then be compensable and the magnitude of the procedural victory would be a factor in determining the extent of that compensation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> She must, however, move closer to the end of this litigation before an award is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">\n<em>Motion denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1074-10\">.

Lynn, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 504 F.2d 267 (1974), this court, in an unpublished order, directed the district court to award attorney\u2019s fees to a plaintiff who, on appeal, had won the right to amend his complaint to add a Title VII claim and had won reversal of a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">We have found only one case in which the propriety of an award of fees prior to a decision on the merits has been discussed. In <em>Van Hoomisen v. Xerox Corp., </em>503 F.2d 1131 (9th Cir. 1974), the defendant was awarded attorney\u2019s fees after the EEOC appealed unsuccessfully from an order granting it leave to intervene in support of plaintiffs claim of discriminatory firing, but denying it permission to add to the case a claim of discriminatory hiring practices. Read broadly, <em>Van Hoomisen </em>approves fee awards in connection with \u201csignificant and discrete\u201d interlocutory appeals, see <em>id. </em>at 1133; read narrowly, it approves awards only when an interlocutory appeal results in a final resolution of a separable dispute (the claim of discriminatory hiring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">.

The Committee version, however, was replaced on the House floor by a comprehensive amendment in the nature of a substitute that made no change in \u00a7 706(k), 117 Cong.Rec. 31979-80, 32110-13 (1971), and the House did not debate this difference between the Committee and substitute bills.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">. It might be argued that since \u00a7 706(k) precludes the United States from recovering attorneys\u2019 fees, Congress\u2019 concern for innocent defendants extended only to private companies and unions. However, the provision barring fee awards to the United States was adopted in 1964 when the United States could be only a plaintiff in a Title VII case, and it is at least uncertain whether \u00a7 706(k) bars an award in favor of a head of an agency, department or unit, the only proper defendant in a Title VII action brought by a federal employee, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (Supp. IV 1974). Nor is there anything else in the language of the statute or in the legislative history that indicates that Congress was unconcerned with deterring nonmeritorious suits against federal defendants, although the history of the 1972 Act, <em>see </em>note 13 <em>supra, </em>indicates that the Senate was more concerned with protecting small employees and unions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1076-12\">. <em>See </em>note 14 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1076-13\">.

This well-established exception to the traditional rule barring attorneys\u2019 fees has been liberally construed in civil rights cases. <em>See </em>Dawson, <em>Lawyers and Involuntary Clients in Public Interest Litigation, </em>88 Harv.L.Rev. 849, 893-94 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1077-10\">. 416 U.S. 696, 723, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2022, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974); see <em>Patterson v.
