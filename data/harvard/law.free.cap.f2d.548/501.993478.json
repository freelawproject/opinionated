The Commissioner determined that the two corporations were a brother-sister control group under \u00a7 1563(a)(2), and assessed deficiencies against both corporations for the years 1971 and 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-18\">Both parties concede that the control of the two corporations satisfies the 50 percent test of \u00a7 1563(a)(2)(B). The issue is whether the 80 percent test of \u00a7 1563(a)(2)(A) has also been satisfied. In effect, the dispute comes down to whether Mr. Ofano had to own at least one share of the stock in Fairfax Auto Parts, Inc., in order for the two corporations to satisfy the 80 percent test of \u00a7 1563(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-19\">A majority of the Tax Court held that \u201cone must own stock in each corporation before his stock can be taken into account for purposes of the 80 percent test.\u201d Accordingly, it invalidated the regulation upon which the Commissioner had relied in assessing the deficiency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-20\">The dissenting members of the court concluded that \u201cstock owned by any or all of the five persons may be taken into consideration in determining whether the 80-per-cent test has been satisfied. . . . \u201d Under this interpretation, the deficiency was lawfully assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The majority and the dissenting opinions fully set out the arguments supporting both interpretations of the statute, and there is no need to repeat them here. We conclude that the dissent\u2019s interpretation of the statute accords with the text of the statute and its legislative history. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the dissenting opinion, we reverse the Tax Court, uphold the validity of the regulation, and remand the case for entry of judgment in favor of the Commissioner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-11\">. <em>Fairfax Auto Parts of Northern Virginia, Inc. v.
