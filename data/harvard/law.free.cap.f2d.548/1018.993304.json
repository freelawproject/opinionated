Edward Day brought suit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia against Sidley &amp; Austin (S&amp;A), a prominent Chicago law firm, and the partners composing its executive committee, as the upshot of a dispute engendered by S&amp;A\u2019s merger with another law firm in 1972. In separate counts of his complaint, appellant alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>breach of contract and misrepresentation. Service of process on the partnership was quashed and the case was thereafter removed to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which entered summary judgment for the individual defendants on all counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That judgment is now appealed on the merits of each claim for relief, as well as the propriety of the removal. We affirm the judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-18\">I. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AB7\">In 1963, appellant and S&amp;A agreed that appellant would, upon his resignation as Postmaster General of the United States, establish an office of S&amp;A in Washington, D.C. He did so, securing office space and supporting personnel for himself and for the small group of S&amp;A attorneys who staffed the office. At the same time, appellant became an underwriting partner in the firm and chairman of its Washington office committee. He did not, however, become a member of the firm\u2019s executive committee, which under S&amp;A\u2019s partnership agreement had plenary control over most of the firm\u2019s affairs calling for policy- or decision-making.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s role as chairman of the Washington office committee was principally that of liaison with and agent for the executive committee, rather than that of independent decision-maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>Early in 1972, S&amp;A\u2019s executive committee was approached by partners of another law firm \u2014 Liebman, Williams, Bennett, Baird &amp; Minow (Liebman) \u2014 with an eye toward merger. Like S&amp;A, Liebman was Chicago-based but maintained an office in Washington. Without then notifying other partners,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> representatives of Liebman and S&amp;A\u2019s executive committee explored the idea and thrashed out a tentative proposal. The possibility of merger was first broached to appellant and the other underwriting partners at a meeting on July 17, 1972, when the proposal was presented to them for consideration. In the course of the discussions, according to appellant, the executive committee made a series of statements to the underwriting partners about the contemplated merger, including a representation that no one of them would be \u201cworse off\u201d in any way as a result.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\">Each underwriting partner, including appellant, voiced approval of the project, and commissioned the executive committee to devise a final-form merger agreement and submit it to the partners for adoption. Several other meetings were held to resolve merger issues during September and, although appellant found himself unable to attend any of them, one clause of the agreement was revised at his suggestion. A memorandum purporting to summarize the benefits of the merger was circulated under the aegis of the executive committee to all S&amp;A partners on September 26, and that memorandum contained the statement that no partner would be \u201cworse off\u201d financially \u201csolely as a result of the consolidation, than he or she was before the event.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After circulation and approval of a memorandum of understanding incorporating the details of the merger, a final amended partnership agreement consummating the merger was executed on October 16, 1972, by all partners of S&amp;A, including appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">That same day, the executive committee of the new firm \u2014 which took the name of \u201cSidley &amp; Austin\u201d \u2014 decided to consolidate the Washington offices of its predecessors. To this end, appellant and the head of the premerger Liebman Washington office committee, who was also a member of the post-merger executive committee, were named co-chairmen of the consolidated Washington office committee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was at this point that trouble began. Members of the post-merger Washington office committee, in combination with appellant\u2019s co-head, took actions that seemed to appellant to be in disregard of his role as co-chairman and in studied neglect of his wishes. The principal step was the relocation of the consolidated offices to another building in Washington, a move to which appellant was opposed. Appellant considered this course contumelious and alleges that it was motivated by opposition to his political leanings. These events, as well as the appointment of co-chairmen <em>simpliciter, </em>made continued service with the firm distasteful to appellant, who resigned and instituted the instant litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">II. REMOVAL OF THE ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">Appellant first challenges the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Removal of the case from the Superior Court of the District of Columbia rested on the theory that the S&amp;A firm was not suable as an entity in the District of Columbia; that there was complete diversity of citizenship between appellant on the one hand and the defendant partners on the other; that the amount in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, exceeded $10,000; and that since appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>lant\u2019s action might originally have been brought in the District Court,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it was properly removable thereto.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since, however, an action involving no federal question cannot be removed to a federal court if any defendant is a resident of the forum state,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> appellant contends that removal in this instance was improper. His premise is that even though none of the partners sued individually resides in the District of Columbia, S&amp;A, <em>qua </em>partnership, does so reside by virtue of its business activity here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-9\">Federal Civil Rule 17(b)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides that in cases not seeking enforcement of a substantive right<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> existing under the constitution or a federal law, capacity of a partnership to sue or be sued is determined by reference to the law of the forum state \u2014 in this case, the District.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since there is no statute in the District permitting suit by or against a partnership in its common name, and since by the common law of the District a partnership is not a jural entity capable of suing or being sued,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> this argument would appear to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>foreclosed. Appellant maintains, however, that Section 13-421 of the District of Columbia Code impliedly overrules the case law on this point by conferring personal jurisdiction over partnerships and other unincorporated associations meeting certain minimum contacts requirements.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">We note initially that the fact of personal jurisdiction does not ineluctably bestow legal capacity to be sued; infants and incompetents, for instance, were at common law incapacitated from suing or being sued,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the fact that they were subject to personal jurisdiction did not alter the necessity of appointing a guardian ad litem.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> More importantly, the genealogy of the District of Columbia\u2019s long-arm statute gives no indication that it was intended to do anything but \u201ccodify recent case law with respect to extraterritorial jurisdiction over and service upon persons in civil litigation.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It was adapted by Congress from the Uniform Interstate and International Procedure Act,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> which in its pertinent comments assures that its adoption effects \u201cno change\u201d of rules \u201cstating which persons have to be served in order to acquire jurisdiction,\u201d and that \u201cthus, local law that all members of an unincorporated association must be joined and served . \u25a0. . remains unchanged.\"<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Since both the Uniform Act and its District of Columbia counterpart accord identical treatment to partnerships and unincorporated associations,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the law governing service on partnerships remains unchanged: the partnership entity is never to be served; rather, service must be made on all partners.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-12\"><em>A fortiori, </em>then, the District\u2019s preexisting rules of suability are unaltered by the enactment of Section 13-421. In this connection, it is worth noting that one of Congress\u2019 purposes in adopting its provisions was closely to assimilate District law on jurisdiction to that of the neighboring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>states of Virginia and Maryland.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Virginia, though it has a nearly identical statute, denies partnerships capacity to sue or be sued,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> as does at least one other state that has adopted the Uniform Act.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We conclude, then, that appellant\u2019s contention must be rejected and that removal was proper in the circumstances.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">III. THE BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Appellant disputes the District Court\u2019s finding, on which the breach-of-contract count of his complaint was held wanting, that he had no contractual right \u201cto maintain his authority over the Washington office.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> That effort, too, must fail. Neither S&amp;A\u2019s pre-merger partnership agreement nor the amended partnership agreement governing post-merger operations refers to the Washington office committee or to appellant\u2019s position thereon. The premerger agreement, however, does provide that \u201c[a]ll questions of Firm policy,\u201d except for certain enumerated matters not here relevant, shall be decided by the executive committee, which \u201cshall advise and consult with other Partners to such an extent as the Committee may deem advisable.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Clearly the establishment of the Washington office committee, its staffing and tenure upon it all fell under the rubric \u201cfirm policy,\u201d and as such were committed to the discretion of the executive committee. And insofar as there were techniques for \u201cadvising and consulting\u201d with other partners, recourse to them was expressly left to the committee\u2019s own good sense and no abuse here is apparent. That agreement, moreover, specifically incorporated special agreements with several other partners but omitted reference to any idiosyncratic arrangement with appellant that might limit the executive committee\u2019s prerogative in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-11\">Beyond these considerations, both the pre- and post-merger partnership agreements empowered the executive committee to establish, determine the chairmanship and composition of and abolish at will, any subordinate committee of the firm.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We are unable to perceive any basis upon which it might soundly be concluded that the appointment of two chairmen for the firm\u2019s new Washington office committee was not well within the committee\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>It is well settled<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> that where, as here, a written agreement purportedly represents the parties\u2019 complete expression of their relationship, neither is at liberty to modify any of its terms by parol evidence.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> This wholesome principle safeguards the integrity of partnership agreements no less than others.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> And quite apart from the parol evidence questions raised by appellant\u2019s attempt to supply an additional unwritten term to his relations with S&amp;A,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> its absence from an otherwise carefully drawn document covering the complex operations of a large law firm requires, as the District Court noted, \u201ca measured explanation which [appellant] does not supply.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We sustain the court\u2019s finding that no foundation for appellant\u2019s breach-of-contract claim was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">IV. THE MISREPRESENTATION CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Count three of appellant\u2019s complaint alleges, and seeks damages for, several misrepresentations made by members of S&amp;A\u2019s executive committee to the underwriting partners assembled in the pre-merger meeting of July 17, 1972. The District Court gave summary judgment against appellant on this count on the theory that he was deprived of no legal right as a consequence of his reliance on any misrepresentation charged.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We reach the same result, though on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-12\">Of the misrepresentations alleged, the only one that need concern us<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> is the observation by one of the members of the executive committee that \u201cno Sidley partner would be worse off as a result of the merger.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Since an action for misrepresentation<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> generally will lie only if there has been a conscious misrepresentation of a material fact,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> a statement that one would or would not be worse off in the future\u2014 whether characterized as a prediction, opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>ion or promise<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> \u2014 ordinarily would not be a sufficient predicate for such an action as between parties truly dealing at arms\u2019 length.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">Where circumstances indicate that the parties did not stand in a position of parity and normal wariness with respect to the subject of the representation, however, exceptions have been carved out of the general rule.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Most of these exceptions derive their legitimacy from circumstances that would lead the reasonable person to believe that implicit in the prediction or opinion is an assertion of fact upon which the recipient of the representation might prudently rely. Where the person making the representation occupies a fiduciary or other position of trust for the recipient of his remarks, for instance, the recipient may be justified in assuming the correctness not only of factual representations but also of opinions.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The intuitive basis for this result may be the thought that a fiduciary voicing an opinion on which he knew his beneficiary might depend would be understood as having investigated the facts underlying it; thus, the expression of the opinion carried an implicit representation of those facts. Since partners as to partnership matters are fiduciaries <em>inter se,</em><footnotemark><em>43</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is often found that partners were entitled to rely on the opinions of their colleagues.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-11\">Another exception to the general requirement that the misrepresentation be one of existing fact appears in the situation where the speaker may reasonably be understood as having based an opinion or prediction on facts that are unavailable to the listener either because he does not have access to them or because he is obviously incapable of interpreting them.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Still a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>third exception is based upon the logical assumption that one who asserts that a future event will come to pass impliedly warrants that he knows of no fact that will prevent its occurrence.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">We need not decide whether any of these circumstances, standing alone, would support an action for misrepresentation based on opinion or prediction for, taking appellant\u2019s averments to be true, all these factors are present in this case. Both sides agree that although appellant was an underwriting partner, the structure of the firm was such that in many ways he was never master of his own ship. When the executive committee member asserted that no one, including appellant, would be worse off as a result of the merger, appellant was entitled to rely on that opinion \u2014 the opinion of one who not only was his partner and hence a fiduciary but who also occupied a special position of trust and confidence by virtue of the control<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> he wielded over appellant\u2019s fortunes with S&amp;A.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Furthermore, the speaker might well have been understood by appellant as having based his statement on a great deal of information to which, as both sides agree, appellant did not have access; appellant\u2019s ascertainment of the past and present prospects not only of the Liebman firm but also of his own was hampered by the secrecy surrounding the internal dealings on the merger proposal, to which all of the defendants were admittedly privy<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Certainly appellant was justified in accepting the conclusion of a partner armed with superior knowledge of the underlying facts, at least to the extent of assuming that the partner knew of no facts that would prevent his own prophecy from being fulfilled. And finally, the prediction in question was of a state of affairs the occurrence of which was partly in the hands of the declarant and his compatriots on the executive committee. Appellant might reasonably presume that the committee would not forecast one future and then work actively to bring about quite a different one.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1127-12\">Taking, then \u2014 as we are required, for purposes of evaluating the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to do \u2014 all facts averred by appellant as true and indulging all reasonable inferences from his averments, we must view the situation as though the defendant partners made or caused to be made a material misrepresentation in the form of an opinion on which appellant might justifiably accept. We must also assume arguendo that the inaccuracy of the assertion was known to the defendants at the time it was made, that they intended that appellant rely upon it, and that in fact he did rely upon it.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Still, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>we find, appellant did not establish all of the essential elements of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">A necessary ingredient of the tort of misrepresentation \u2014 as, in olden times, of any action on the case<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> \u2014 is that the claimant suffer harm by reason of the tortious conduct.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Appellant has demonstrated no ability to prove, in the event of a trial, any causal connection between the misrepresentation and the injury which he charges. The only damage to which he points was his outraged sensibilities, which assertedly flowed not from the pre-merger prediction that no one would be worse off, but from the executive committee\u2019s action in regard to stewardship of the post-merger Washington office. The legal immateriality of the alleged misrepresentation \u2014 in effect, the concealment of a plan to depose appellant as head of the Washington office after the merger \u2014 becomes apparent when it is recognized that the same result would almost certainly have obtained had appellant been fully informed of every intention he avers the executive committee harbored. If appellant had known that the merger was to be a springboard for lowering his status in the Washington office, as he now claims it was, he could not alone have prevented consummation of the merger. In any determination of the relations of partners <em>inter se, </em>the primary reference is to the terms of the partnership agreement;<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and under S&amp;A\u2019s pre-merger partnership agreement, appellant\u2019s vote was not necessary to effect the merger nor sufficient to defeat it.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Although it is not absolutely inconceivable that he could have persuaded his colleagues to preserve his authority over the Washington office by rejecting the merger, he avers no facts from which such a probability might realistically be inferred. Had the putative design of the executive committee surfaced earlier,- it is not impossible that appellant could by force of moral suasion have prevented its fulfillment, but this too is a matter of sheer speculation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>Nor can injured feelings attendant upon the executive committee\u2019s appointment of co-chairmen for the Washington office committee and its disregard of appellant\u2019s views on relocation of the office be said to derive an actionable character from any concealment of purpose as charged by appellant. Those actions were, as we have seen, exertions of contractual prerogatives which could have been exercised with equal facility either way.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">Without a doubt, appellant felt gravely offended by what he deems wrongdoing by the executive committee, but a <em>sine qua non </em>of any recovery for misrepresentation is a showing of pecuniary loss proximately caused by reliance on the misrepresentation.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Save for appellant\u2019s inability to survive this requirement, he would be entitled to a trial on his misrepresentation count and, if proven circumstances warranted, to the jury\u2019s consideration of an award of punitive as well as compensatory damages.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> But, as a leading commentator in the torts field explains, \u201c[s]ince the modern action of deceit<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> is a descendant of the older action on the case, it carries over the requirement that the plaintiff must have suffered substantial damage before the cause of action can arise. Nominal damages are not awarded in deceit, and there can be no recovery if the plaintiff is none the worse off for the misrepresentation, however flagrant it may have been,\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> and that is precisely the situation here. We are mindful of the so-called federal rule, which obtains in the District of Columbia, that punitive damages are allowable even in the absence of compensatory damages,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> but we think the rule is inapplicable here. Almost all of the decisions applying that principle have dealt either with trespass to the person or property<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> or with libel or slander <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>per se<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> \u2014 all of which were actionable at common law without specific proof of resulting damages.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> To action on the case\u2014 the common law remedy for misrepresentation <footnotemark>65</footnotemark> \u2014 developed later in history, and from the beginning its emphasis was on compensation for injuries actually sustained rather than on redress of symbolic grievances.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> In any event, since appellant has not contended that he is entitled to punitive damages without a concomitant recovery of compensatory damages <footnotemark>67</footnotemark> we do not pursue the point further.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">We conclude, then, that no compensable harm to appellant from the conduct complained of has been indicated. It follows that as a matter of law the defendant partners could not be held on the misrepresentation count and that summary judgment thereon was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-12\">The judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"AS-\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1120-15\">. <em>Day v.

These statutes subject all \u201cpersons\u201d meeting certain minimum contacts requirements to the jurisdiction of the local courts and, in \u00a7 13 \u2014 421, defines \u201cpersons\u201d as including partnerships and other sorts of unincorporated associations. Appellant\u2019s claim, then, is that the long-arm statute gave him a \u201csubstantive right\u201d to subject partnerships to personal jurisdiction in litigation in the District of Columbia. That deviation from the general rule of Rule 17(b), see note 10 <em>supra, </em>lacks the content and broad scope which the term \u201csubstance\u201d possesses when it is juxtaposed to \u201cprocedure\u201d in the argot of <em>Erie v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). Rather, it represents an amplification of the doctrine of <em>UMW v. Coronado Coal Co., </em>259 U.S. 344, 42 S.Ct. 570, 66 L.Ed. 975 (1922), as interpreted by <em>Brown v. United States, </em>276 U.S. 134, 141-142, 48 S.Ct. 288, 289-290, 72 L.Ed. 500, 503-504 (1928), that unincorporated associations might be sued on federal causes of action where the federal claims imply such a capacity to be sued, <em>e.g., </em>antitrust actions. While the term \u201csubstantive rights\u201d has been interpreted to embrace every manner of claim for relief \u2014 whether constitutional, <em>e.g., Council No. 34, AFSCME v. Ogilvie, </em>465 F.2d 221 (7th Cir. 1972); statutory, <em>e.g., Petrol Shipping Corp. v. Kingdom of Greece, </em>2 Cir., 360 F.2d 103, <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 931, 87 S.Ct. 291, 17 L.Ed.2d 213 (1966) (suit to compel arbitration under Federal Arbitration Act); <em>Price v.

Keets, </em>80 U.S.App.D.C. 327, 328-329, 153 F.2d 132, 133-134 (1946); see <em>Liechty v. Liechty, </em>231 N.W.2d 729, 731 (N.D.1975), quoting A. Bromberg, J. Crane &amp; A. Bromberg, Partnership \u00a7 5 at 43 (1968). The Uniform Partnership Act, in force in both Illinois and the District of Columbia, provides for the operation of statutory rules prescribing the rights and duties of partners <em>inter se </em>\u201csubject to any agreement\u201d between them. D.C.Code \u00a7 41-317 (1973); Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. IO6V2, \u00a7 1 et seq. (1973). Several courts have assumed in dicta that this provision means that statutory requirements for the admission of partners may be overridden by an agreement providing otherwise, although no court seems to have specifically decided the question. See, e. <em>g., Johnson v. Hill, </em>1 Ariz.App. 290, 402 P.2d 225, 226 (1965), quoted in <em>Troupe v. Seby, </em>416 F.2d 514, 519 (9th Cir. 1969); <em>Polikoff v. Levy, </em>55 Ill.App.2d 229, 204 N.E.2d 807, <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 903, 86 S.Ct. 237, 15 L.Ed.2d 156 (1965); <em>Rapoport v. 55 Perry Co., </em>50 A.D.2d 54, 376 N.Y.S.2d 147, 149 (1975). This construction is buttressed by holdings that an agreement in abrogation of the statutory provisions on dissolution of partnerships is valid under the Uniform Partnership Act. <em>Stuart v. Overland Medical Center, </em>510 S.W.2d 494, 498-499 (Mo.App.1974); <em>Gibson v. Angros, </em>30 Colo.App. 95, 491 P.2d 87, 90-91 (1971); see <em>Johnson v. Hill, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b1128-11\">. The agreement provided that admission of new partners could be effected only by assent of partners holding the majority of all voting percentages. Appellant held only a minority of those percentages, and all other underwriting partners voted to approve the merger, so even if his vote was vitiated by misrepresentation, an ample majority continued to exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">. Since the breach of a fiduciary relationship is not actionable unless injury accrues to the beneficiary or the fiduciary profits thereby, see, e. <em>g., </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 205 (1959), and since neither injury to appellant nor profit to any appellee can be shown to flow from any nondisclosure complained of, appellant\u2019s allegation of breach of a fiduciary duty by nondisclosure must also fail. Thus we need not reach the question whether the partnership agreement reposes such authority in the executive committee that it might be said to amount to a waiver of disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">.
