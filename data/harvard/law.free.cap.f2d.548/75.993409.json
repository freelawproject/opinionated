Slawik appeals from a judgment of sentence imposed pursuant to a jury verdict finding him guilty on three counts of making false declarations before a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>grand jury in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Slawik, at the time of trial, was the elected County Executive of New Castle County, Delaware. His indictment grew out of a federal investigation of the relationship between contractors and various New Castle County public officials.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the course of that investigation the United States Attorney became aware that one Bayard Austin, a former political associate of Slawik, might have relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Austin, then living in Orlando, Florida, was interviewed there by F.B.I. Agents on August 4, 1974. Austin asserted the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. On August 8, 1974, the agents advised Austin they were authorized to grant him immunity from prosecution. With this assurance, he gave the agents a statement about various matters in New Castle County. They discussed installing a recording device on Austin\u2019s telephone and Austin\u2019s using a concealed recording device on his person, in order to record conversation between Austin and his former New Castle County associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>On October 9, 1974, a recording device was placed on Austin\u2019s telephone. Austin then called Slawik who eventually returned his call. Other telephone conversations followed. On October 14, 1974, Austin, Slawik, and three other New Castle County associates met in Florida. Austin\u2019s concealed recording device was running. Throughout the telephone conversations and the meeting, Austin maintained the pretense that he was not yet cooperating with the F.B.I. He did not disclose that he had been granted immunity. On October 23, 1974 one additional call between Austin and Slawik was recorded. The United States Attorney\u2019s office promptly obtained all of the recordings described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Slawick was subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury in Wilmington, Delaware on December 11, 1974. The Assistant United States Attorney who conducted the examination had already studied the tapes. However, he disclosed to Slawik neither their existence nor the fact of Austin\u2019s cooperation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The December 11 examination of Slawik covers more than 200 pages of transcript. The charges of making false declarations presently before us arise from that testimony. The principal evidence the government relied on to prove its case is the recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Each of the three counts set forth in identical terms the subject matter of the grand jury\u2019s investigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each count set forth in identical terms that which the government contended was material to the investigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the third paragraph of each count, the indictment set forth a specific material matter as to which Slawik allegedly gave false testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The indictment did not state why or how these three areas of inquiry were matters material to the grand jury\u2019s investigation. In a motion for a bill of particulars, Slawik sought to learn, with respect to paragraph three of each count, the material matter which the government did not believe to be true, the reason it was material, and the particularized facts on which the government relied in support of the allegations that the specified testimony was false. The district court sustained the government\u2019s refusal to answer those questions. The government did answer, however, a question with respect to the factual basis of the materiality allegations in paragraph 2 of each count:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">\u201cThe factual basis for the materiality allegations is based upon the fact that the testimony was capable of influencing the tribunal in its investigation and had the natural effect or tendency to influence, impede, hamper, or dissuade the Grand Jury from pursuing its investigation.\u201d United States Response to Defendant Melvin A: Slawik\u2019s Motion for a Bill of Particulars, Counts 7, 8, and 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Materiality is an essential element of a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 and a question of law, decision upon which is reserved to the court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Slawik\u2019s statements are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Count </em>7</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">To appreciate answer number five,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it m'\u2019it be read in context. The examiner\u2019s prior questions elicited the answers, not claimed to be false, that Slawik went to Florida to talk to Austin about getting an attorney, and about coming to Wilmington to testify before the grand jury. Answer number five is in response to a paraphrase by the government attorney of this prior testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">Q: So you went there and said you got a subpoena. You got to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">A: Can I explain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">Q: Sure. Go right ahead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Answer number six,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> too, was in response to the government attorney\u2019s paraphrase of the prior answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">It is the government\u2019s position that the answers to questions five and six, both referring to a conversation in Florida on October 14, 1974, were understood by the questioner, by Slawik, and by the grand jury to convey:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-18\">(1) That Slawik advised Austin to get <em>independent </em>legal counsel, as opposed to using counsel provided by a co-conspirator;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-19\">(2) That he urged Austin <em>to testify </em>before the grand jury and to testify <em>truthfully, </em>rather than merely to appear and plead the fifth amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-20\">The tape recording of the October 14, 1974 conversation, in the government\u2019s possession at the time of Slawik\u2019s grand jury appearance, reveals that Slawik certainly was not enthusiastically urging that Austin appear before the grand jury and incriminate Slawik. Nonetheless, answers five and six may be said to paraphrase substantial portions of the transcript of the October 14, 1974 recording, quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>The transcript of the tape of the October 14, 1974 meeting is 65 pages long. In the course of the conversation, Austin did tell Slawik he did not want to go back to Delaware, and Slawik did tell Austin that he would have to return to Delaware whether he liked it or not, and that he should not go before the grand jury without a lawyer. He told Austin it might be advisable to resort to a claim of the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and also told him he would arrange to get him a lawyer. It cannot fairly be said that there was any specific reference to <em>independent </em>legal counsel, nor did Slawik tell Austin to testify truthfully and waive his fifth amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-22\">But Slawik was never asked, before the grand jury, whether he advised Austin to assert the privilege against self-incrimination, nor was he asked if he suggested independent legal counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Instead, he was asked no question at all, and simply responded to the prosecutor\u2019s paraphrase \u2014 a paraphrase which would trap an unwary, assenting witness in perjury. The paraphrase was \u201cSo you went there and said you got a subpoena. You got to testify.\u201d Slawik \u201cexplained\u201d by enlarging:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-23\">\u201cLook Barney [sic] you will probably only be there a day. Get yourself legal counsel, <em>tell them the truth. </em>They are not going to hold you. You can go back to Florida.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>It is the government\u2019s position that the italicized language was understood by the grand jury to mean \u201ctell the grand jury the truth.\u201d But in the context of the sentence in which the words were used they could just as well have meant \u201ctell legal counsel the truth.\u201d Neither the indictment nor the bill of particulars sets forth the grand jury\u2019s understanding of these words. The government contends that an exculpatory construction is barred by the examiner\u2019s second paraphrase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">So, basically your trip down there revolved around a discussion with him to convince him to come up here and testify, get it over with, <em>and be truthful. </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Aside from the fact that even the paraphrase is ambiguous, it is clear that Slawik did not accept it as his own. He replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">Get the damn thing over with and nobody is going to hold you, nobody is going to do anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">He did not accept the paraphrase, if it was intended to mean \u201ctestify truthfully before the grand jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The ambiguity is critical. For Slawik\u2019s reply to have been a violation of \u00a7 1623, it must have been both false and material. If literally true, there was no offense, even if Slawik\u2019s answer was deliberately misleading. <em>Bronston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973). And a false answer, if immaterial was similarly inoffensive under federal law. Nothing in the record before us gives any indication <em>what </em>the jury thought was false: we cannot say whether the trial jury found that Slawik had failed actually to advise Austin: (1) to tell <em>counsel </em>the truth, or (2) to tell <em>the grand jury </em>the truth. And nothing in the indictment or the bill of particulars tells us which construction the grand jury placed on its charge.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Thus, the trial jury might have found either of two possible falsehoods, only one of which was material, in Slawik\u2019s grand jury testimony. Although materiality is a question of law over which we exercise plenary review,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the imprecision of the allegations contained in the indictment and bill of particulars renders meaningful review of materiality impossible. Our decision is not based on a slavish acceptance of appellant\u2019s construction of his statements. Indeed, this would be an easy case if the meaning of Slawik\u2019s statement was clear. Rather, we hold that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 may not stand where the indictment fails to set forth the precise falsehood alleged and the factual basis of its falsity with sufficient clarity to permit a jury to determine its verity and to allow meaningful judicial review of the materiality of those falsehoods. To hold otherwise would permit the trial jury to inject its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>inferences into the grand jury\u2019s indictment, and would allow defendants to be convicted for immaterial falsehoods or for \u201cintent to mislead\u201d or \u201cperjury by implication\u201d\u2014 which <em>Bronston </em>specifically prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">We emphasize that the government knew, in this case, the precise content of each of Slawik\u2019s statements to Austin. It was free, in its evident determination to trap appellant in perjury, to ask more pointed questions. And it was free, in its indictment and its bill of particulars to set forth with crystal clarity its allegations of falsehood and materiality. This court cannot and will not affirm a criminal conviction on so nebulous a legal and factual matrix. The district court denied Slawik\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on Count 7.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We are reinforced in our determination that the conviction on Count 7 may not stand by the holding of the Supreme Court in <em>Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973) that if the prosecutor never asks the critical question and never presses for an unequivocal answer the defendant may not be convicted of false swearing. In the words of Chief Justice Burger:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">Under the pressures and tensions of interrogation, it is not uncommon for the most earnest witnesses to give answers that are not entirely responsive. Sometimes the witness does not understand the question, or may in an excess of caution or apprehension read too much or too little into it. . . It is the responsibility of the lawyer to probe; testimonial interrogation, and cross-examination in particular, is a probing, prying, pressing form of inquiry. If a witness evades, it is the. lawyer\u2019s responsibility to recognize the evasion and to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth with the tools of adversary examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">It is no answer to say that here the jury found that petitioner intended to mislead his examiner. A jury should not be permitted to engage in conjecture whether an unresponsive answer, true and complete on its face, was intended to mislead or divert the examiner; the state of mind of the witness is relevant only to the extent that it bears on whether \u201che does not believe [his answer] to be true.\u201d To hold otherwise would be to inject a new and confusing element into the adversary testimonial system we know. Witnesses would be unsure of the extent of their responsibility for the misunderstandings and inadequacies of examiners, and might well fear having that responsibility tested by a jury under the vague rubric of \u201cintent to mislead\u201d or \u201cperjury by implication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">409 U.S. at 358-59, 93 S.Ct. at 600.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">What the Chief Justice said in the context of an adversarial proceeding, in which lawyers for other interested parties participated and might have eliminated the ambiguities, applies a <em>fortiori </em>to uncounseled appearances before a grand jury. Indeed the grand jury context adds a new element of speculation to the petit jury\u2019s role if, as in this case, it is permitted to resolve not only the ambiguity of the interrogator\u2019s question and the defendant\u2019s response, but also the ambiguity of the grand jury\u2019s understanding of both question and response. <em>See United States v. Razzaia, </em>370 F.Supp. 577, 579 (D.Conn.1973). Especially where, as here, the interrogator had the clear option of resorting to references to a transcription of the October 14, 1974 conversation in order to insist upon precision, no sound public policy is advanced by a conviction for false swearing under Count 7. The false swearing statute is a potent prosecutorial tool, allowing convictions on a significantly lower standard of proof than the perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621. But Congress in its wisdom chose not to eliminate the requirements that an indictment be based only on a knowingly false, material misstatement. It would be judicial legislation of the most pernicious order to read those requirements out of the statute. At best the petit jury, on the evidence present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ed, was allowed to convict for \u201cintent to mislead\u201d or for \u201cperjury by implication.\u201d Such a verdict may not stand, and the judgment of conviction on Count 7 must be set aside, for indictment insufficiency and failure of proof of an offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\n<em>Count 8</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The testimony set forth in Count 8 is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Count 8, like Count 7, was narrowed by the bill of particulars. As with the answers claimed to be false in Count 7, these answers must be read in the context of the examiner\u2019s interrogation. Although in defending the sufficiency of Count 7 the government urged that Slawik conveyed the misleading impression that he was advising Austin to obtain independent counsel,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the interrogation quoted in Count 8 commences with the question, \u201cDid you contact a lawyer down there\u201d and the answer that \u201c. . . the lawyer that was contacted was Arthur Inden and the suggestion came from Danny Rappa. I think Inden is Rappa\u2019s lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">Q: So then you must have discussed Austin\u2019s situation with Rappa?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">Q: Anybody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-11\">A: Well I might have mentioned it to Pete Ross, you know. I mention everything to him. I think I even talked to Tom Luce about it because of the relevance of the Plumeo situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">Immediately following the answer about speaking to Pete Ross and Tom Luce came the series of questions to which the answers are claimed to be materially false. The government, in order to establish their materiality and falsity reconstructs them in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-13\">Q: What did Rappa have to do with this? [the fact the FBI was interrogating Austin]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">A: Nothing, only in so far as suggesting a lawyer his lawyer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-16\">Q: How did <em>it </em>[the fact the FBI was interrogating Austin] come up, just in <em>casual </em>conversation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">A: Yes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-18\">Q: Was he [Daniel Rappa] involved in <em>this thing </em>[the fact that the FBI was interrogating Austin]?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-19\">A: Directly, no.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-20\">Q: So you just mentioned <em>it </em>[the fact that the FBI was interrogating Austin] to him [Daniel Rappa] <em>casually </em>?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-21\">A: Yes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-22\">Government brief p. 26 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-23\">By inserting the bracketed matter the government insists that the answers were understood to be in response to questions in the expanded form, and that those answers conveyed the false impression that Rappa\u2019s only involvement in the conversations between Slawik and Austin was to suggest an attorney. But the prosecutor knew, from the tapes, the precise extent of Rappa\u2019s participation in conversations with Austin. It never pressed the point by asking a more direct question.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-24\">We have the same difficulty with the attempted reconstruction of Count 8 as with Count 7. The initial question in the series referred to obtaining counsel for Austin. So did the next one. The third question, referred ambiguously to \u201cAustin\u2019s situation.\u201d The answer respecting conversations with Ross and Luce refer to \u201cit,\u201d and the question about Danny Rappa asks what he had to do with \u201cthis.\u201d The government would have us assume that the grand jury understood the reference to \u201cAustin\u2019s situation,\u201d to \u201cit\u201d and to \u201cthis\u201d to be a reference, not to Austin\u2019s need for a lawyer \u2014 the subject matter of the initial interrogation \u2014 but to Rappa\u2019s interest in the broader subject of the FBI interrogation of Austin. It urges that the reconstruction is the only reasonable interpretation of the questions posed. We cannot so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-25\">Our disposition of the appeal from Slawik\u2019s Count 8 conviction requires a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>struction of the rule of <em>Chapin </em>and <em>Long, supra. </em>Although inapposite to Count 7, they present a close question here, where Slawik\u2019s statements were plainly material and were offered in response to questions by the government. We begin by accepting the government\u2019s position that <em>Bronston, supra, </em>does not hold ambiguous questioning to be a safe conduct for perjury. <em>Bronston </em>involved <em>literally true </em>but misleading answers. <em>See United States v. Corr, </em>543 F.2d 1042, 1048, 1049 (2d Cir. 1976). <em>Long </em>and <em>Chapin </em>address the question that necessarily arises when an answer would be true on one construction of an arguably ambiguous question but false on another: who decides which construction the defendant placed on the question? The solution offered by <em>Long </em>and <em>Chapin, </em>and by which we are bound, is that the petit jury decides.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">But even as we eschew a broad reading of <em>Bronston, </em>so we decline to apply <em>Long </em>and <em>Chapin </em>in an overbroad fashion. <em>Chapin </em>involved an \u201canswer [that] was knowingly false under the only reasonable interpretation of the question . . . .\u201d 515 F.2d at 1283. <em>Long </em>involved alleged ambiguity in the terms \u201cbribes,\u201d \u201ckickbacks\u201d and \u201cpayoffs,\u201d terms which we held \u201care not terms of art, they are words of common currency which form part of the vocabulary of almost any American in his teens or older.\u201d 534 F.2d at 1100. But the questions asked to Slawik were not nearly as clear. In reversing the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the indictment in <em>Long, </em>we said that a charge of perjury may not be dismissed \u201cwhen it is entirely reasonable to expect a defendant to have understood the terms used in the questions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1101. In this case, defendant unsuccessfully moved the court for dismissal of the indictment on Count 8. We hold that this count, premised as it is on questions that were deliberately artless and vague, should have been dismissed, for it was entirely unreasonable to expect that the defendant understood the questions posed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Given the narrow scope of review of jury verdicts under <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), this count should never have gone to a jury. <em>Glasser </em>and <em>Long </em>have the capacity for totally insulating convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 from judicial review, and thus totally eviscerating <em>Bronston\u2019s </em>clear warning against the use of imprecise questioning as a predicate for a perjury conviction. The conviction on Count 8 must be reversed for the insufficiency of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\n<em>Count 9</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">The testimony set forth in Count 9 is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Like the others, it, too, was narrowed by the bill of particulars. From a colloquy extending for eighteen questions, the government extracted two answers which were allegedly false \u201c. as it relates to his knowledge of the financing of a house purchased by Bayard Austin and any benefits derived from Bayard Austin.\u201d The other sixteen questions and answers revealed to the grand jury: that in May of 1974, Mario Capano and Slawik were anxious to have Austin remain a resident of Florida; that Austin\u2019s wife preferred to return to Delaware; that Austin located a house in Florida, and needed help in financing it; that Capano took steps to obtain a loan for Austin secured by a mortgage; that Slawik was aware that Capano helped Austin secure a mortgage; that one purpose of an April 1974 trip to Florida was for Slawik to find out what system was involved in obtaining the loan, \u201chow much the house cost, this kind of stuff\u201d; that the acknowledged purpose was so that Austin would not come back to Delaware; but that Slawik did not <em>give </em>Austin any money.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">It is the government\u2019s position that answers No. 15 and 18 <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> were knowingly false in that they were unequivocal denials of knowledge of Capano\u2019s participation in the arrangement to make a \u201chush money\u201d loan to Austin, and that the answers, so construed, had the natural effect or tendency to influence, impede or dissuade the grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>jury from pursuing its investigation of obstruction of justice or subornation of perjury. The ultimate issue, then is materiality. We must decide whether, after Slawik <em>admitted </em>that he was interested in keeping Austin from returning to Delaware, that he went to Florida \u201cto find out what system was involved, how much the house cost, this kind of stuff,\u201d and that Capano was helping finance the house purchase, his unresponsive answers to questions No. 15 and 18 were such as to impede or dissuade the grand jury from its investigation. We hold that in the context of the overall line of questioning, these answers, even if not literally true, could not have had such an effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">It is not a federal offense to help a friend or business associate finance a new house. If Slawik\u2019s allegedly false statements merely concealed such innocent aid, they could not possibly have been material. The real question before the grand jury was whether Slawik obstructed or conspired to obstruct justice, by buying Austin\u2019s silence. Slawik\u2019s admissions were nearly enough to indict him. He admitted numerous overt acts of aid for and involvement with Austin. He did not concede a motivation of obstructing justice. If Slawik had obtained financing for Austin and had denied it before the grand jury, that denial might have been a material misstatement. But in light of his admissions concerning his own conduct, we do not see how Slawik\u2019s failure to volunteer the details of Capano\u2019s financial arrangement with Austin could have had any material effect on the grand jury\u2019s investigation. Slawik did not conceal that there was a financial arrangement. We simply do not think it material whether Capano held a first mortgage or a second mortgage, or which banks, if any, were involved. Such information would be surplusage of the most trivial order, wholly beside the point of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Moreover, the prosecuting attorney, having full knowledge from the tape recordings of Capano\u2019s participation and Slawik\u2019s awareness of that participation, made no effort to ask a more specific question, or to demand a more responsive answer. Since the materiality of the question is a matter for the Court, and we have concluded that the equivocations in questions 15 and 18 were not material, we need not consider Slawik\u2019s further contention that the answers, even though equivocal, were literally true. The conviction on Count 9 must also be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">It is appropriate to add that the case illustrates the danger inherent in the use by government prosecutors of Title IV of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, P.L. 91-452. That title reduces the standard of proof required for a conviction for perjury under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621. But as the legislative history makes clear, knowledge, falsity and materiality are distinct elements of the offense which must still be proved by the prosecution. <em>See </em>House Report No. 91-1549, 91st Cong. 2d Sess., 1970 U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News, p. 4023. If two contradictory material declarations are made under oath before a court or grand jury within the period of the statute of limitations, it may suffice that an indictment recite merely the materiality of each and their irreconcilability. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623(c). But a tape recording of extra-judicial conversations does not serve the same purpose. In cases where the government is relying upon extra-judicial prior inconsistent statements to establish falsity, proof of mere inconsistency is not enough. The grand jury must charge specifically what it believes are the true facts. Moreover if the courts are to discharge their obligation of determining materiality they should be informed in the indictment in what manner the falsity alleged affected the grand jury\u2019s deliberations. Finally, without attempting to lay down any standard of prosecutorial conduct before the grand jury for all cases, we think it fair to say that if transcriptions of electronic interceptions are to be the basis for false swearing prosecutions we will insist that the government\u2019s interrogation be far more precise than in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">The judgment appealed from will be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">.

The remaining counts were severed for trial into three groups: (1) Counts 1, 2, and 3; (2) Counts 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13; and (3) Counts 10 and 11. The government elected to try the second group first.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-19\">Counts 10, 11, 12 and 13 were dismissed on the first day of trial, with prejudice, on the government\u2019s motion. Counsel have advised the court that Counts 1, 2, and 3 were disposed of by a plea bargain in which Slawik pleaded guilty to a single count and received a one-year sentence.

And I paid for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-15\">Q: To what, just tell him to get an attorney? Why didn\u2019t you tell him that over the phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-16\">A: Because I wanted to talk to him. You know, he is not a guy you can talk to over the phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-17\">Q: You wanted to talk to him and tell him what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-18\">A: I wanted to talk the situation over with him. First of all, I wanted to appraise him that, you know, look, in my opinion, you don\u2019t really have a problem here. First of all, I tried to convince him to come up and testify before the Federal Grand Jury. This is what I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-19\">Q: So you went there and said you got a subpoena. You got to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-20\">A: Can I explain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-21\">Q: Sure. Go right ahead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-22\">A; <em>He said to me, Tf I come up there I will never go back home again. \u2019 In his mind, he was done. He was going to be put in jail and that was it. He would never get back to Florida. Those are exactly what his words were.

I mention everything to him. I think I even talked to Tom Luce about it because of the relevance of the Plumeo situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">Q: What did Danny Rappa have to do with this?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">A: <em>Nothing; only insofar as suggesting a lawyer, his lawyer.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">Q; How did it come up, just in casual conversation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">A: <em>Yes.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-14\">Q: Was he involved in this thing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">A: <em>Directly, no.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-16\">Q: So you just mentioned it to him casually?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-17\">A: <em>Yes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-18\">\n<em>Count 9:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-19\">Q: Why should you want to go to Orlando, Florida for 24 hours when Mario was going to discuss a house with Barty Austin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-20\">A: Well, originally, another employee was supposed to go with him who was supposed to make the arrangements. And, kind of, at the last minute Mario said, \u2018Look, do you want to come with me to see Barty?\u2019 I said \u2018Okay. Basically, I went along for the ride.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-21\">Q: I am having a little trouble understanding why Mario would want to help, in May this year, Barty Austin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-22\">A; One of the reasons is that Barty wanted to get a house and get located and didn\u2019t want to come back to Delaware. Where, his wife, on the other hand, wanted to come back to Delaware. And Mario was not anxious to have him come back to Delaware and neither was I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-23\">Q: For reasons you have already talked about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-24\">A: That is exactly right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-25\">Q: Did you get a house for him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-26\">A: He already made arrangements. He had the house he wanted and everything. What he needed was for Mario to help him finance it in some way. That was not done at that time. It was done later. I think Mario went back himself to handle that for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-27\">Q: You mean, the financing was done later?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-28\">A; Yes. I think Mario wanted to look at the house to see if his interest was secure, and so on. And Barty got a good deal on the house, you know. It was the kind of thing I think he could protect his money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-29\">Q; So Mario took steps to secure the money that he intends to borrow?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-30\">A: Yes. But there, I could not tell you the details. But I do know he assisted him in getting the house. And then he got some power of mortgage on it, or something, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-31\">Q: Were you aware of the details of the financing of any sort; were you aware, in fact, that Mario even helped him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-32\">A: Yes, I was aware that Mario helped him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-33\">Q: He just helped him, that is all you know about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-34\">A: Well, I mean, he helped him secure a mortgage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-35\">Q: Down there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-36\">A: I am not even sure of that by what system he used to secure it. All I went down there that time was to find out what system was involved, how much the house cost, this kind of stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-37\">Q: Well, did Mario help him to get the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-38\">A: Yes, he helped him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-39\">Q: So that Barty would not come back to Delaware?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-40\">A: Yes, that was certainly one of the motivations. Meanwhile, you know, Barty is working down there in some corporation that has something to do with Mario anyway, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-41\">Q: That seems a little unusual to me for an employer to go down to Florida to make sure that one of his employees secures a house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-42\">A: Well, it might be unusual. It might not be in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-43\">Q; I assume that was occasioned by the fact you wanted to keep him down there in Florida?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-44\">A: Yeah, that was certainly one of the motivations. Secondly, I really did like to see the guy get located, get working, and get a house, you know, take care of his family. That was part of the motivation too, believe it or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-45\">Q: But you are not really aware of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-46\">A: I am not a finance man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-47\">Q: You were not involved in this transaction of the arrangements?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-48\">A: <em>I do not know how he got him the mortgage.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-49\">Q: That was Mario\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-50\">A: Yes. In fact, he did that later. He didn\u2019t do it at that time, I don\u2019t think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-51\">Q: Did you participate in helping Barty directly in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-52\">A: Did I give him any money? No, I did not do anything that way. I looked at the house. I gave him my opinion. It looked like a good deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-53\">Q: Is it fair to say that as far as you are concerned you went down for the ride, and you have no knowledge of the situation of how Mario helped him get the house?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-54\">A; <em>Yes, except basically what he was interested in was for Mario to help him se</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>cure a loan which probably took Mario\u2019s signature which I think is what he did.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Af\">(Bracketed numbers and italics added).

Just take the fucking fifth.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-20\"><em>Id. </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-21\">SLAWIK: Yeah, you know, but, but, you know, if, they haven\u2019t missed, they haven\u2019t missed a fuckin person, Bardy. In fact, it amazes me that it took so long for them to get to you. Because I told you they\u2019d, they would. See everybody knew we were associated. Everybody knew you and Mario were associated. Right? I figured it was inevitable, that they had to come and get you. They don\u2019t have nothin on you. Even that thing that they\u2019re talking about, you know. So what. But by the same token, if you\u2019re called before the Federal Grand Jury, I mean, you know, you don\u2019t want to go up there without a lawyer. Because, you know, just suppose now for a minute, that some builder said well Bardy said to me, you know, you kept (unintelligible) you know. You don\u2019t know, what somebody else will say. So you need, you need to have the fullest legal protection for yourself. Now I want; you don\u2019t know what to say. But I\u2019m pretty well sure that nobody, said anything about you, other than, you know, you were around, and ah, and ah, Bardy was always there, you know, that kind of shit, you know. But, I know what everybody\u2019s said.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-25\"><em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-26\">$ * s}s <em>% </em>sfc \u00a1fe</p>\n<p id=\"b182-27\">SLAWIK: See they\u2019re searching from the word go, Bardy, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re . . I\u2019m not so much worried about, what really happened. I\u2019m worried about what they might try to pin. I know what they, you know. They\u2019ve been very determined about that. Now, ah, again just another reminder. You don\u2019t have to turn in your personal records. You can take the fifth.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-29\"><em>Id. </em>at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-30\">ifc * # # sfc</p>\n<p id=\"b182-31\">SLAWIK: That\u2019s fair. Ok. In that case, I have nothing to say. And then, that, then. Then you call me Tuesday night. Right? Wednesday morning I\u2019ll have a lawyer Well you, you. Did Danny give you the number, that, that guy?</p>\n<p id=\"b182-32\"><em>Id. </em>at 48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b182-33\">. It is evident from Count 8 of the indictment, see note 9, <em>supra </em>that Slawik disclosed to the grand jury that Rappa, an alleged co-conspirator, arranged for Austin to have legal representation. In light of this disclosure, we can hardly agree that Slawik\u2019s \u201cget yourself legal counsel\u201d remark, ambiguous at worst, was a material misstatement capable of impeding or diverting the grand jury from its investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\">. Although Slawik argues on appeal that his statement that he told Austin to \u201ctell them the truth\u201d was literally true, it is plain from the transcripts that he did not say so <em>in haec verba. </em>In light of Slawik\u2019s many other statements to Austin tending to urge \u201cstonewalling,\u201d the jury may well have decided to take a narrow view of several statements, also in the transcripts, urging Austin not to lie. We do not, therefore, disturb the jury\u2019s finding that Slawik never urged Austin to tell \u201cthem\u201d \u2014 whoever \u201cthem\u201d referred to \u2014 the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">But we must address appellee\u2019s contention, raised in its brief, that under <em>United States v. Chapin, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. 303, 515 F.2d 1274, <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1015, 96 S.Ct. 449, 46 L.Ed.2d 387 (1975), and <em>United States v. Long, </em>534 F.2d 1097 (3d Cir. 1976), the ambiguity of Slawik\u2019s statement is unavailing as a ground for reversal. <em>Chapin </em>stands for the proposition that a witness\u2019s understanding of a question propounded to him while under oath is an issue of fact for the jury. Thus, it permits the jury to find that the defendant understood a question such that his answer to it was perjurious. <em>Long </em>indicates that the <em>Chapin </em>rule has been adopted by this court. But our holding is consistent with <em>Chapin </em>and <em>Long.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">Slawik was not responding to a direct question, when he made his \u201ctell them the truth\u201d response. There was no ambiguity of the type addressed by <em>Chapin </em>or <em>Long </em>simply because there was no question requiring construction. And the government\u2019s follow-up question, an inculpatory paraphrase, was rejected by Slawik, and cannot be imputed to him. As noted above, we do not cavil with the finding of falsity. But <em>Chapin </em>and <em>Long </em>both address the jury\u2019s power of construction with respect to the fact of truth or falsity, and not with respect to materiality, a legal question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b183-15\">.
