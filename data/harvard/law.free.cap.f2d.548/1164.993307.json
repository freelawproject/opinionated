Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976). Concluding that <em>Stone v. Powell </em>precludes habeas corpus relief in this case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reverse the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-23\">Appellee was convicted of robbery by assault in Texas state court. Before his trial the court held a hearing on his motion to suppress a shotgun and shotgun shells seized by a police officer upon appellee\u2019s arrest. That court held the evidence admissible and it was used against appellee at trial. On appeal the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that evidence inadmissible because it was not seized incident to a valid arrest, but nonetheless affirmed the conviction on the ground that admission of the evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cole v. State, </em>484 S.W.2d 779, 784 (Tex.Cr.App.1972). After exhausting state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>remedies appellee petitioned the federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus. Adopting the magistrate\u2019s findings and conclusions, the district court held that appellee had been improperly convicted because the admission of illegally seized evidence was not harmless error. This court affirmed the judgment of the district court pursuant to Local Rule 21 on April 1, 1976, 530 F.2d 973, several months before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stone v. Powell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-4\">We are faced with the question: Does <em>Stone v. Powell </em>preclude assertion of a claim that admission of evidence held by the state appellate court to have been illegally seized was not harmless error?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have no doubt that <em>Stone v. Powell </em>does preclude such an assertion, for the Court in that case did not simply hold that the illegality of a search and seizure cannot be asserted in a federal habeas proceeding. Rather, the Court held that \u201cwhere the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim, a state prisoner may not be granted habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search or seizure was <em>introduced </em>at his trial. In this context the contribution of the exclusionary rule, if any, to the effectuation of the Fourth Amendment is minimal and the substantial societal costs of application of the rule persist with special force.\u201d 428 U.S. at 494, 96 S.Ct. at 3052, 49 L.Ed.2d at 1088 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added). It is obvious that appellee had an opportunity for full and fair litigation of his Fourth Amendment claim in Texas state courts. <em>See, e. g., O\u2019Berry v. Wainwright, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 546 F.2d 1204; <em>George v. Blackwell, supra, </em>n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court is reversed and this ease is remanded for entry of an order dismissing appellee\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1264-15\">. This court has applied <em>Stone v. Powell </em>to all cases still pending final adjudication at the time that decision was announced. <em>See, e, g., Caver v. Alabama, </em>537 F.2d 1333, 1335-36 (5 Cir. 1976); <em>George v. Blackwell, </em>537 F.2d 833, 834 (5 Cir. 1976); <em>Wright v. Wainwright, </em>537 F.2d 224, 226 &amp; n. 4 (5 Cir. 1976). Accordingly, we apply the rule of <em>Stone v. Powell </em>in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-25\">It is rather obvious that the Supreme Court would not have vacated our judgment and remanded this cause for further consideration in light of <em>Stone v. Powell, supra, </em>if that decision did not apply to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">. In <em>O\u2019Berry v. Wainwright, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 546 F.2d 1204, we were faced with a somewhat similar issue. There, we held that where a \u201cstate court is squarely faced with Petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim, but chooses to resolve that claim on an independent, adequate, non-federal state ground, at least where that state ground does not unduly burden federal rights,\u201d then the <em>Stone v. Powell </em>\u201copportunity for full and fair consideration\u201d requirement is satisfied. <em>Id., </em>at 1216.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
