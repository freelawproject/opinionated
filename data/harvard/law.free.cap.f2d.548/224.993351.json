On April 8, 1976, appellant entered a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to this charge, which plea was accepted by the district court (Judge Albert G. Schatz, D.Neb.). On June 22, 1976, the court sentenced appellant to be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for imprisonment for a period of one year and one day. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXO\">(a) Whoever conducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an illegal gambling business shall be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Auu\">In this appeal, Womochil argues that his sentence is excessive and that it is excessive in comparison to sentences imposed on appellant\u2019s codefendants. We have reviewed the sentencing record in this case, including the transcript of appellant\u2019s plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>and the presentence report on appellant. We cannot say that Judge Schatz abused his discretion in sentencing appellant to a year and a day. We note that the district court has the power to reduce Womochil\u2019s sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35, if it deems such reduction proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
