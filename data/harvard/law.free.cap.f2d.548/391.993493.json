CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">The Trustees of Boston University (\u201cBU\u201d) have petitioned to set aside, and the National Labor Relations Board has cross-applied to enforce, a Board order finding that BU violated section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>when it discharged Patti Schiffer from clerical employment at BU\u2019s Student Health Center and ordering her reinstatement. 224 NLRB No. 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">We have examined the record and, more particularly, the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s subsidiary findings in light of BU\u2019s contention that there are inadequate grounds to conclude that the principal reason for Ms. Schiffer\u2019s discharge was her participation in concerted activity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> BU stresses that the Administrative Law Judge explicitly found a bad personal relationship between Ms. Schiffer and her supervisor, Irro Stephanou, and that Ms. Schiffer had been offensive on a number of occasions in dealings with supervisors and fellow employees, including on August 20 when she brandished a pair of scissors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree that these matters were not insignificant, and could even have been found to explain and justify Ms. Schiffer\u2019s dismissal. But the ALJ and the Board were instead persuaded that Ms. Schiffer\u2019s misconduct was stimulated by the employer\u2019s own wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>conduct, and that her firing was motivated not by legitimate considerations but by the illegal considerations that had earlier prompted BU to fire other clinic employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As this interpretation is supportable on this record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">A case of this nature requires balancing the employer\u2019s right to run its office as it pleases against the employees\u2019 right to act in concert without fear of retaliation. <em>Compare Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation, </em>545 F.2d 222 (1st Cir. 1976). On the one hand, section 7 rights are \u201cnot a sword with which one may threaten or curse supervisors\u201d, <em>Florida Steel Corp. v. NLRB, </em>529 F.2d 1225, 1234 (5th Cir. 1976). <em>See Corriveau &amp; Routhier Cement Block, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>410 F.2d 347, 350 (1st Cir. 1969). On the other hand, if an employee\u2019s conduct is not egregious there is \u201csome leeway for impulsive behavior\u201d, <em>NLRB v. Thor Power Tool Co., </em>351 F.2d 584, 586-87 (7th Cir. 1965). <em>Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp. v. NLRB, </em>430 F.2d 724, 730 (5th Cir. 1970); <em>see Hugh H. Wilson Corp. v. NLRB, </em>414 F.2d 1345, 1356 (3d Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 935, 90 S.Ct. 943, 25 L.Ed.2d 115 (1970). And the leeway is greater when the employee\u2019s behavior takes place in response to the employer\u2019s wrongful provocation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201cAn employer cannot provoke an employee to the point where she commits such an indiscretion as is shown here and then rely on this to terminate her employment. [Citation omitted.] The more extreme an employer\u2019s wrongful provocation the greater would be the employee\u2019s justified sense of indignation and the more likely its excessive expression.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\"><em>NLRB v. M &amp; B Headwear Co., </em>349 F.2d 170, 174 (4th Cir. 1965). Further, at least so long as the employee\u2019s indiscretions are not major,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is immaterial that the employee\u2019s misconduct would constitute a sufficient reason for discharge if the actual reason for discharge is the employee\u2019s participation in concerted activity. <em>Hugh H. Wilson Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>414 F.2d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">The ALJ\u2019s decision, adopted by the Board, reflected an awareness of these controlling legal principles and the need to construe them harmoniously. A conscientious effort was made to determine on which side of the line Ms. Schiffer\u2019s conduct fell. Especially in a situation as close and complex as this was, we are not easily tempted to second-guess the ALJ even though the record might equally be capable of supporting a different interpretation. The drawing of inferences as to motivation is best left to the Board, and especially to the ALJ who heard and observed the witnesses. <em>See Editorial \u201cEl Imparcial\u201d, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>278 F.2d 184, 187 (1st Cir. 1960). We affirm the finding that Ms. Schiffer\u2019s discharge violated section 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">BU also contests the Board\u2019s modification of the ALJ\u2019s order with respect to Ms. Schiffer. After finding that the poor relationship between Ms. Schiffer and Stephanou was due in part to \u201cimmutable personality traits, rather than the labor dispute\u201d, he ordered her reinstated to \u201csome position, substantially equivalent to her former one, in another department\u201d. The Board, however, ordered Ms. Schiffer reinstated to her former job.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">The Board recognized the personality clash between Ms. Schiffer and Stephanou but felt that the conflicts between the two were fueled significantly by Ms. Schiffer\u2019s participation in protected activities. In the circumstances, its conclusion that denying Ms. Schiffer reinstatement to her former job would not serve the policies of the Act cannot be called unreasonable. The Board may have believed that a less com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>p\u00edete remedy would leave doubt as to whether the Act fully protected the rights of employees to engage in concerted activity, since the employer would have succeeded in forcing Ms. Schiffer\u2019s removal from the Center. We do not necessarily have to share this point of view. It is enough that the Board's remedy was based on a rational judgment as to how effectively to promote the goals of the Act. \u201cIn fashioning its remedies under the broad provisions of \u00a7 10(c) of the Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c)), the Board draws on a fund of knowledge and expertise all its own, and its choice of remedy must therefore be given special respect by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 612 n. 32, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1937, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). The Board\u2019s remedy cannot be characterized as \u201ca patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act\u201d. <em>Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. NLRB, </em>319 U.S. 533, 540, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 1218, 87 L.Ed. 1568 (1943). We will therefore not disturb it, although it of course remains open for Ms. Schiffer voluntarily to accept employment in another department at BU should such a position be offered her. Our affirmance of the Board\u2019s order is not to be taken as an indication of approval of Ms. Schiffer\u2019s conduct, which left much to be desired, and might afford a basis for subsequent discharge if her employer\u2019s conduct improves, and hers does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\n<em>The petition for review is denied, and the cross-application for enforcement is granted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-10\">. Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act gives employees the right to \u201cself-organization . and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of . mutual aid or protection\u201d, and section 8(a)(1) makes it illegal for an employer to interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of such rights. The Student Health Center employees, though not unionized, were entitled to the Act\u2019s protection. <em>NLRB v. Washington Aluminum Co., </em>370 U.S. 9, 82 S.Ct. 1099, 8 L.Ed.2d 298 (1961). See, e. <em>g., NLRB </em>v. <em>KDI Precision Prods., Inc., </em>436 F.2d 385 (6th Cir. 1971); <em>Hugh H. Wilson Corp. v. NLRB, </em>414 F.2d 1345 (3d Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 935, 90 S.Ct. 943, 25 L.Ed.2d 115 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-18\">. The ALJ, in weighing the scissors episode, concluded that, while it occurred, it was not perceived by anyone present at the time as \u201ca serious threat\u201d. We find this a supportable characterization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\">. BU has not objected to the Board\u2019s findings that BU\u2019s acceleration of Smith\u2019s maternity leave, refusal to review Walshe\u2019s contract, discharge of Boudreau and Hirsh, promulgation of a \u201cno-discussion rule\u201d, and issuance of warning letters to Cook and Dershin, were all unfair labor practices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b493-13\">. Courts have been unwilling to overlook blatant misconduct such as physical intimidation. <em>Cf. Florida Steel Corp. v.
