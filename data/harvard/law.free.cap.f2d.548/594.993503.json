MORGAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b695-26\">Plaintiffs Lawrence Moch, Press Robinson, and George Eames appeal the dismissal of their action challenging the apportionment of the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board [hereinafter Board]. After obtaining 1970 federal census figures, on October 14, 1971, the Board voluntarily reapportioned itself in order to comply with \u201cone-man one-vote\u201d requirements articulated in <em>Reynolds v. </em>Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964) and progeny. The Board submitted its reapportionment plan to the United States Attorney General, who interposed no objection. On May 17, 1972, plaintiff Press Robinson and others filed a class action,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2), in which they challenged the constitutionality of the plan. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that the multimember districts provided for in the reapportionment plan diluted the voting strength of black residents of East Baton Rouge in violation of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the United States District Court of the Middle District of Louisiana dismissed the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, without opinion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Plaintiffs instituted the present action on October 10, 1974. Although plaintiffs did not denominate this claim as a class action, the complaint was otherwise almost identical to that filed in 1972. Again, plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the multimember districts in the East Baton Rouge School District. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for dismissal, made pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(6),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the ground that the 1972 judgment rendered the present cause of action res judicata. Plaintiffs appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Plaintiffs make only one meritorious argument:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that a change in this court\u2019s <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court\u2019s <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> opinions regarding the constitutionality of multimember districts has occurred since the 1972 dismissal. Accordingly, plaintiffs argue, had the district court in the 1972 action employed the present constitutional standards of multimember districts, it would not have dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The term \u201cres judicata,\u201d in its broadest sense, covers four distinct types of preclusion: bar, merger, collateral estoppel, and direct estoppel. <em>See </em>Restatement of Judgments \u00a7 45, Comments (a), (b), (c) and (d) at 175-76 (1942). In the present case, we concern ourselves with the application of bar and collateral estoppel. Under the doctrine of bar, a judgment in a prior suit between the same parties bars a second suit on the same cause of action not only as to all matters offered at the first proceeding, but also as to all issues that could have been presented either for or against recovery. <em>Baltimore S.S. Co. v. Phillips, </em>274 U.S. 316, 319, 47 S.Ct. 600, 71 L.Ed. 1069 (1927). <em>See </em>Restatement of Judgments \u00a7 48 (1942). Collateral estoppel, however, precludes re-litigation of only those issues actually litigated in the original action, Whether or not the second suit is based on the same cause of action. <em>Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp., </em>349 U.S. 322, 75 S.Ct. 865, 99 L.Ed. 1122 (1955). <em>See </em>Restatement of Judgments \u00a7 68 (1942). Here, defendants argue primarily that the 1972 judgment bars plaintiffs\u2019 present action in that both suits are based on the same cause of action. Defendants note that because the same issues presented in this suit were argued and determined at the first proceeding, collateral estoppel also precludes litigation of plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">Generally, a postjudgment change of circumstances, either factual or legal, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>not alter that judgment\u2019s effect as a bar to later actions based on the same cause of action. 1B <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>\u00b6 0.415, at p. 2051-52 (2nd ed. 1974).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Yet, courts have occasionally rejected strict application of bar and estoppel principles when their use would violate an overriding public policy or result in manifest injustice. <em>E. g., Dore v. Kleppe, </em>522 F.2d 1369 (5th Cir. 1975) (res judicata is a principle of public policy and should be applied so as to give rather than deny justice); <em>Schlegel Manufacturing Go. v. USM Corp., </em>525 F.2d 775 (6th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 912, 96 S.Ct. 1509, 47 L.Ed.2d 763 (1976); <em>La Societe Anonyme des Parfums Le Galion v. Jean Patou, Inc., </em>495 F.2d 1265 (2nd Cir. 1974); <em>Kinnear-Weed Corp. v. Humble Oil and Refining Co., </em>403 F.2d 437 (5th Cir. 1968) <em>(en </em>banc); <em>Spiller v. Hankin, </em>88 U.S.App.D.C. 206, 188 F.2d 35 (1951). <em>See generally 1</em>B <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>\u00a7 0.405[11]. Courts on some occasions have concluded that a change in the applicable law occurring after the first suit is a circumstance that renders application of bar or estoppel in a second suit inappropriate. <em>E. g., Texaco v. Hickel, </em>141 U.S.App.D.C. 203, 437 F.2d 636 (1970); <em>Griffin v. State Board of Education, </em>296 F.Supp. 1178 (E.D.Va.1969). Although the Supreme Court has not held explicitly that a change in law negates the finality of a prior suit in a context like that in this case, it has indicated some approval for the proposition. In <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Duel, </em>324 U.S. 154, 65 S.Ct. 573, 89 L.Ed. 812 (1945), that Court stated, as an alternate ground for its holding, that \u201cres judicata is no defense where between the time of the first judgment and the second there has been an intervening decision or a change in the law creating an altered situation.\u201d 324 U.S. at 162, 65 S.Ct. at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">This panel has discovered three pertinent cases that involve the effect of a change in law on the conclusiveness of a prior judgment in which constitutional claims are involved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Whitcomb v. Chavis, </em>403 U.S. 124, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971), the Supreme Court, in a suit attacking the apportionment of Indiana\u2019s state legislature, rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that an earlier finding of validity foreclosed a later constitutional attack on the plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">Nor can we accept defendant\u2019s argument that the statutory plan was beyond attack because the District Court had held in 1965 that at that time the plan met the \u2018substantial equality\u2019 test of Reynolds. <em>Stout v. Bottorff, </em>249 F.Supp. 488 (SD Ind.1965). . . . Here, the District Court did not order reapportionment as a result of population shifts since the 1965 Stout decision, but <em>only because the disparities among districts which were thought to be permissible at the time of that decision had been shown by intervening decisions of this Court to be excessive.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 162-63, 91 S.Ct. at 1879, 29 L.Ed.2d at 387 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">In <em>Bronson v. Board of Education, </em>525 F.2d 344 (6th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 934, 96 S.Ct. 1665, 48 L.Ed.2d 175 (1976), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals confronted an allegation of a change in applicable law occurring after a school desegregation decision, <em>Deal v. Board of Education, </em>369 F.2d 55 (6th Cir. 1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 847, 88 S.Ct. 39, 19 L.Ed.2d 114 (1967), to which defendants argued that plaintiffs in a later ease were bound. Ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>amining the appropriateness of applying collateral estoppel to the second action, the court held that the alleged change of law was not sufficient to avoid preclusion of issues litigated in the first action. Implicitly, if a significant change had occurred, public policy would prevent application of traditional estoppel principles, in that \u201cboth [estoppel and bar] are qualified or rejected when their application would contravene an overriding public policy or result in manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Bronson, </em>525 F.2d at 349, citing <em>Tipler </em>v. <em>E. S. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>443 F.2d 125, 128 (6th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Finally, in <em>Griffin v. State Board of Education, </em>296 F.Supp. 1178 (E.D.Va.1969), the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Virginia rejected application of bar and estoppel principles to an action challenging the constitutionality of state support of private schools where two intervening Supreme Court decisions had struck down plans similar to that approved in the prior case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">[The intervening Supreme Court decisions were] a substantial change in the law and ended further viability of our decision. Now to continue its efficacy would be unjust to those initially and now affected by that order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">Again, when as here private litigation has extensive implications of public import, the rule of res judicata or estoppel is not allowed to stultify reassessment of the prior decision. The public interest supersedes the private interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">This court is well aware of the value that the bar and estoppel doctrines serve in achieving a finality to litigation and in preventing harassment of a party and a waste of the court\u2019s resources through multiplicitous law suits. We are unwilling to hold, however, that they constitute an absolute from which we must never stray, even when a mechanical application would result in manifest injustice. Rather, we believe that the occasional adoption of an exception to the finality rule when public policy so demands does not undermine its general effectiveness. In the present case, plaintiffs claim that the state has violated certain fundamental rights by maintaining multimember voting districts that unconstitutionally dilute their vote. The court below granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on the basis of the res judicata effect of a 1972 decision. Now plaintiffs aver that through an intervening change in law in both the Supreme Court and this circuit, present law would obtain a different result than that reached in the 1972 judgment of dismissal. We find merit in plaintiff\u2019s contention that the application of traditional finality principles, after a change in the appropriate law, could contravene public policy, especially in light of the importance of their constitutional claim and of the fact that plaintiffs never really had their day in court in 1972 since that complaint was dismissed merely on a 12(b)(6) motion. To apply such doctrines after a significant change in law governing the issue of multimember districts has occurred could mean that the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board would be allowed to continue <em>ad infinitum </em>a constitutionally infirm system outlawed everywhere else. We do not feel compelled to determine in this case whether a supervening change in the case law renders a subsequent claim a different cause of action, thus making collateral estoppel rather than bar applicable, or whether such a change constitutes an \u201caltered circumstance\u201d that renders bar, itself, inapplicable. If public interest in giving effect to changes in this important area of the law outweighs the Board\u2019s interest in finality under one doctrine, one would logically conclude that it would compel the same result under the other rule of preclusion. Therefore, we direct the district court to determine on remand: (1) whether a change in the applicable law clearly has occurred since 1972, thus rendering incorrect the legal principles under which the district court determined the ease in 1972 and (2) assuming such a change has occurred, whether application of traditional res judicata principles would cause manifest injustice. If it answers both questions in the affirmative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>neither bar nor collateral estoppel should preclude the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-27\">. Plaintiffs invoked federal jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343(3), 2201, 2202 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b696-7\">. <em>Bryant v.

Generally, a party cannot base a 12(b)(6) motion on res judicata. That doctrine must be pleaded as an affirmative defense. 5 Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00b6 1357, at 604-610 (1st ed. 1969). Yet, if the trial court has treated the 12(b)(6) motion as one for summary judgment, its dismissal under 12(b)(6) is not reversible error. <em>Latter and Sons, Inc. v. Dinkler Hotel Co., </em>199 F.2d 854, 855 (5th Cir. 1952). Here, the district court held a hearing and treated defendants\u2019 motion more like a motion for summary judgment than like a 12(b)(6) motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\">. Plaintiffs also argue that a change in fact, sufficient to negate the conclusiveness of the prior judgment, has occurred. That is, they contend that two Board elections, in which six blacks have run and lost, have been held since 1972. Prior to the 1972 action no election under the plan had been held; plaintiffs therefore argue that new evidence \u2014 the inability of blacks to gain seats on the school board \u2014 now exists. This subsequently occurring evidence cannot alter the finality of the 1972 action. 1B Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 0.415, at p. 2052 (2nd ed. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-15\">Plaintiffs do not argue that the technical requirements of res judicata were not met nor do they contend that the class in the first action was not adequately represented so as to prevent the conclusive effect of the first judgment; <em>see, Gonzales v. Cassidy, </em>474 F.2d 67 (5th Cir. 1963). We, therefore, do not consider these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b696-16\">. <em>See, e. g., Zimmer v.
