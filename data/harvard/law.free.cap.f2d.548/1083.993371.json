Appellants \u2014 all of whom are represented by the same attorney, who has unsuccessfully attempted the same course before<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 undertook to remove the divorce actions in which they were involved from the Rhode Island Family Court to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island; that court ruled that the cited removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not give it jurisdiction over this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>type of action, and the cases were remanded to the state court. This appeal followed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">The only conceivably relevant portion of \u00a7 1443 is \u00a7 1443(1), which provides for removal by a person \u201cwho is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of [a] State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States . .\u201d The Supreme Court has construed this statutory language as being limited to \u201cany law providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.\u201d <em>Georgia v. Rachel, </em>384 U.S. 780, 792, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 1790, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966). <em>See Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>421 U.S. 213, 219-20, 95 S.Ct. 1591, 44 L.Ed.2d 121 (1975); <em>Milligan v. Milligan, </em>484 F.2d 446, 447 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>Pennsylvania ex rel. Gittman v. Gittman, </em>451 F.2d 155, 156-57 (3d Cir. 1971). Given this authoritative and binding construction, it is plain that the district court, as it ruled, was without jurisdiction under \u00a7 1443.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">Appellants also challenge the propriety of the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees in appellees\u2019 favor. Although the awarding of attorneys\u2019 fees is not usual, <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 257-59, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975); <em>Diaz Gonzalez v. Colon Gonzalez, </em>536 F.2d 453, 458 n.17 (1st Cir. 1976), they may be awarded in those instances where a party \u201chas acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\u201d <em>F. D. Rich Co. v. Industrial Lumber Co., </em>417 U.S. 116, 129, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 2165, 40 L.Ed.2d 703 (1974). <em>See Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprise, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402 n.4, 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968); <em>Cordeco Development Corp. v. Santiago Vasquez, </em>539 F.2d 256, 262-63 &amp; nn. 10-12 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 97 S.Ct. 488, 50 L.Ed.2d 586 (1976). The district court indicated full awareness that attorneys\u2019 fees should be awarded under the bad faith exception \u201conly in extraordinary circumstances and for dominating reasons of justice.\u201d <em>Cordeco Development Corp. v. Santiago Vasquez, supra </em>at 263 (citations omitted). The court stated that a precondition to such an award is the finding of an \u201cintentional institution of an action which one knows to be fictitious and wholly without merit and which is done for the specific purpose of frustrating and harassing lawfully instituted legal procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Applying this strict standard, the court concluded that it should nonetheless impose attorneys\u2019 fees because of the bad faith of appellants\u2019 attorney. The court stated that \u201c[t]he inescapable conclusion is that Mr. Berberian [the attorney] knew the removals were frivolous and that he instituted them for oppressive reasons\u201d and that \u201cfrivolous and groundless petitions for removal were employed by Mr. Berberian in bad faith with the intent to delay and frustrate the Family Court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-13\">We have carefully reviewed the entire record with particular view to the adequacy of the finding of bad faith,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>are persuaded that the court did not abuse its discretion in making this determination and in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">\n<em>Affirmed. Double costs on appeal to appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1183-20\">. <em>See, e. g., Champion v. Champion, </em>539 F.2d 702 (1st Cir. 1976) (an appeal which we characterized as \u201cfrivolous\u201d); <em>Tetreault v. Tetreault, </em>C.A. 75-0226 (D.R.I.), appeal dismissed on appellant\u2019s motion, No. 75-1326 (1st Cir. Sept. 12, 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1183-32\">. Appellant contends, in essence, that the Rhode Island Family Court discriminates against males in divorce actions and that \u00a7 1443 should be read as permitting removal in cases involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>ing such alleged discrimination. He argues that recent Supreme Court decisions, such as <em>Frontiero v. Richardson, </em>411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973), militate in favor of applying \u00a7 1443 to cases of sexual as well as of racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">Appellant has not asserted \u2014 nor do we know of \u2014 any other statute which is properly available for removal of a divorce action. See <em>Milligan v. Milligan, </em>484 F.2d 446 (8th Cir. 1973). <em>Cf. Armstrong v. Armstrong, </em>508 F.2d 348 (1st Cir. 1974); H. Hart &amp; H. Wechsler, The Federal Courts and The Federal System, 1189-92 (2d ed. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">. The district court quite properly noted the distinction between conduct cognizable under the bad faith exception and \u201ctenacious and persistent litigation of unsettled and novel issues.\u201d <em>See In re Bithoney, </em>486 F.2d 319, 322 (1st Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1184-15\">. Among the reasons cited by the district court for its finding of bad faith was the lack of \u201ceven a modicum of supportive logic\u201d for the proposition that \u00a7 1443 would authorize removal. The court concluded \u201cthat Mr. Berberian knew the removals were frivolous and that he instituted them for oppressive reasons.\u201d The court obviously agreed with the suggestion of the moving spouses that the only purpose of the removals was \u201cto frustrate the Family Court proceedings and hinder the movants in their attempt to acquire relief [viz. temporary support].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
