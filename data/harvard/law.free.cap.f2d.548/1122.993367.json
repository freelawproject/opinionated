The question of law was decided on summary judgment, and is whether sums voluntarily paid by a member of the City Council of Richmond, Virginia, who is under 72 years of age, for office rent and secretarial service, are to be excluded from his gross income received from the City for his services as a council member in determining whether the amount so earned makes applicable the provisions for deductions from Social Security benefits in \u00a7 203(b) and (f) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(b) and (f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court held that such sums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>paid for office and secretarial expenses were excludable, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">In 1968, the Social Security Administration determined that plaintiff and his wife were entitled to retirement benefits since July 1967, under \u00a7 202 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402. In 1970, plaintiff ran for the City Council of Richmond, Virginia and was elected. He took the oath of office July 1, 1970. As part of his campaign, plaintiff promised that, if elected, he would \u201cplow back\u201d enough of his councilmanic income to make himself available to the public. In compliance with this pledge, plaintiff rented an office and employed a part-time secretary. Admittedly, there was no requirement by the City of Richmond that plaintiff do this and no agreement by the City to reimburse him for the expenses entailed thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s salary as a member of the Council is $400 per month, thus, he received $2400 for the balance of 1970 and $4800 a year thereafter. He paid $1284.22 in 1970 and $3918.89 in 1971 for such office rent and stenographic services. He was paid the full amount of Social Security benefits to which he claimed to be entitled until October 19, 1972, when he was notified by letter from the Social Security Administration that he and his wife had received more in social security benefits than they were entitled to. It was indicated in the letter that excess payments would be offset against future payments to which the Thompsons might otherwise be entitled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">Sections 203(b) and (f)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Social Security Act, as applicable to taxable years 1970 and 1971, provided that a beneficiary under age 72 could earn $1680.00 in a 12-month taxable year without suffering a loss of benefits. If the sums plaintiff expended for office rent and stenographic services be excluded from the total received form the City, his earned income for 1970 would be $1,284.22 and for 1971 it would be $881.11, both well within the maximum allowance, so he and his wife should receive their full social security benefits. If such expenditures cannot be excluded, the decision of the Social Security Administration was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">Plaintiff alleges in paragraph 5 of his Complaint that \u201cIn both 1970 and 1971 after extensive discussions plaintiff was advised by the [Social Security] Administration that he could deduct his office expenses from his Councilmanic income for the purpose of computing his retirement insurance benefits.\u201d The allegation is neither expressly admitted nor expressly denied by the Secretary\u2019s answer, but it argumentatively denies the allegation by making reference to the administrative transcript of the ease which defendant attached as an exhibit to the answer. Plaintiff did testify that before renting the office he discussed the situation with both the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. He was informed by both agencies that he might exclude his office expenses from salary. We have no question before us as to whether Thompson legitimately deducted his office rent and secretary\u2019s pay in making his income tax return. Representatives of the Social Security Administration did not refute plaintiff\u2019s testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>and the available records were not sufficiently complete to confirm it clearly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">The Administrative Law Judge of the Social Security Administration ruled that plaintiff should be allowed to exclude office and stenographic expenses from his salary from the City for the purpose of determining whether his earned income was too large to entitle him to full social security benefits. The Appeals Council reached the opposite conclusion; however, in view of plaintiff\u2019s good faith in the matter, all recoupment from the Thompsons for the years 1970 and 1971 was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">The basic issue in this appeal turns upon the validity and applicability of a regulation promulgated by the Social Security Administration pursuant to authority granted by \u00a7 205 of the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The regulation, 20 CFR 404.1026(a)(8), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-8\">\u201c(8) Amounts paid specifically \u2014 either as advances or reimbursements \u2014 for traveling or other bona fide ordinary and necessary expenses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in the business of the employer are not wages. Traveling and <em>other reimbursed expenses must be identified either by making a separate payment or by specifically indicating the separate amounts where both wages and expense allowances are combined in a single payment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-15\">It is uncontested that the payments by the City of Richmond to claimant were not segregated or itemized as between salary and reimbursement for \u201cordinary and necessary expenses\u201d by either of the methods specified in the just-quoted regulation. Thus, if the regulation is valid and applicable, plaintiff\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-16\">Three questions are presented to this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-17\">(1) Is plaintiff self-employed so as to make 20 CFR 404.1026(a)(8) inapplicable to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-18\">(2) Did the Secretary have authority to promulgate the regulation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-19\">(3) Is the limitation in the regulation arbitrary, as held by the district court?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-20\">The first of these questions we answer in the negative; the second in the affirmative; and the third in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-21\">That plaintiff is an employee of the City of Richmond, and is not a self-employed person, results from the fact that he is covered by the Social Security Act by virtue of an agreement between the City of Richmond and the Social Security Administration executed pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 210(a) and 218 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 410(a) and 418.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since wages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 409 are defined as \u201cremuneration paid ... for employment,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the sala<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>ry plaintiff received from the City of Richmond should be included as wages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(f)(5)(A) in determining excess earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">In answer to the second question posed above, we hold that under \u00a7 205 of the Social Security Act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Social Security Administration had authority to promulgate 20 CFR 404.1026(a)(8). It is well established that Congress may empower an administrative agency to issue regulations to implement legislative enactments. The statute itself here is in language too plain to warrant discussion. In most of the cases cited involving the validity of a regulation of a federal administrative agency promulgated pursuant to an Act of Congress, it is the Congressional Act itself that is attacked, as involving too broad a delegation of power. Here, plaintiff does not attack the validity of \u00a7 205, but contends that the administrative regulation is beyond the scope of the power delegated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">Both parties have cited district court decisions as supporting their respective contentions. The cases cited by both sides involve traveling salesmen who were regarded as employees and not as self-employed persons. The question in all cases was whether traveling expenses should be deducted from total compensation received for the purpose of determining whether a claimant for Social Security benefits received sums in excess of the maximum amount allowable. Plaintiff cites <em>Sayer v. Richardson, </em>360 F.Supp. 199 (W.D.La.1973), <em>Joyner v. Ribicoff, </em>206 F.Supp. 874 (W.D.Va.1962), and <em>Miller v. Ribicoff, </em>195 F.Supp. 534 (W.D.S.C.1961), as cases in which traveling expenses were excluded from wages notwithstanding the employer\u2019s failure to segregate or identify reimbursement for expenses from wages. On the other hand, a contrary conclusion is reached in <em>Ruddy </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>CCH, UIR, 110,262.301 (N.D.N.Y.1971), <em>Gillen v. Gardner, </em>CCH, UIR, 110,-262.301 (W.D.Ky.1968), Warren v. <em>Ribicoff, </em>CCH, UIR, 110,262.301 (S.D.Ia.1961), and <em>Dearing v. Flemming, </em>CCH, UIR, 110,262.-301 (W.D.Ia.1959).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-9\">Of course, these cases are persuasive only, and no appellate decision involving this very regulation was cited by either party.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The question presented is one of first instance in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-10\">We are not persuaded by the traveling salesmen cases cited above which have held that travel expenses are excludable in the determination of whether the beneficiary of Social Security benefits has sufficient wages to reduce the benefit payments. All of those cases are based on the practical necessity of a traveling salesman traveling, and the resulting inevitable expense. Indeed, there cannot be other than a practical requirement by the employer that a traveling salesman travel. Here, it is admitted there was no requirement by the City of Richmond that the plaintiff maintain an office and secretarial service. Thompson acknowledges that other members of the council use their business offices and the like for such. It is also noteworthy that the expenses Thompson claims as reimbursed were not treated as such by the City in any way, especially by a book entry, cf. <em>Angell v. Flemming, </em>291 F.2d 72 (4th Cir. 1961), and persuasive to us is the fact that, although the City Charter provides that members of the Council \u201cmay be allowed their actual expenses incurred in representing the city,\u201d none of the money paid to Thompson was even claimed to have been paid under this charter provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-11\">The case before us is not one in which the reimbursed expenses were required by an employer, even as a practical necessity; the case here is one in which the expenses now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>claimed to be reimbursable were not required by the employer, and for which the plaintiff did not even seek reimbursement from the City in addition to his salary, although a specific provision of the City Charter would have allowed him so to do. In these circumstances, we find no reason to apply, and we do not, those traveling salesmen cases which would exclude the expenses. We do not express an opinion as to which group of the traveling salesmen cases is correct. That matter is better left for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Most of the decisions cited by the Secretary to uphold the validity of the regulation promulgating the specific identification requirement do not deal with the validity of regulations as such but with the validity of the statutes which authorize them. The case of <em>Lewis v. Martin, </em>397 U.S. 552, 90 S.Ct. 1282, 25 L.Ed.2d 561 (1970), however, did uphold the validity of a regulation, as against the charge that it was not authorized by the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The provisions of the Social Security Act providing for aid to families with dependent children provide that state agencies, administering the aid \u201cshall, in determining need [of an eligible child], take into consideration any other income and resources [of the child], as well as any expenses reasonably attributed to the earning of any such income.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The statute was implemented by a regulation of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-6\">\u201c(a) A State plan for aid and services to needy families with children . . must provide that the determination whether a child has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent . . . will be made only in relation to the child\u2019s natural or adoptive parent, or in relation to a child\u2019s stepparent who is ceremonially married to the child\u2019s natural or adoptive parent and is legally obligated to support the child under State law of general applicability which requires stepparents to support stepchildren to the same extent that natural or adoptive parents are required to support their children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-11\">\u201c(b) The inclusion in the family, or the presence in the home, of a \u2018substitute parent\u2019 or \u2018man-in-the-house\u2019 or any individual other than one described in paragraph (a) of this section is not an acceptable basis for a finding of ineligibility or for assuming the availability of income by the State . . . [I]n the consideration of all income and resources in establishing financial eligibility and the amount of the assistance payment, <em>only such net income as is actually available for current use on a regular basis will be considered, and the income only of the parent described in paragraph (a) of this section will be considered available for children in the household in absence of proof of actual contributions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1227-13\">A California law provided that \u201cpayments to a \u2018needy child\u2019 who \u2018lives with his mother and a stepfather or an adult male person assuming the role of spouse to the mother although not legally married to her\u2019 . shall be computed after consideration is given to the income of the stepfather [or other person living with the mother].\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The issue in <em>Lewis, </em>then, was whether the California law was valid because in conflict with the HEW regulation. The answer depended upon whether the regulation itself was invalid as going beyond the statutory authorization. In reversing a contrary decision by a three-judge court, the Supreme Court upheld the regulation. In <em>Lewis, </em>as in the case now before us, the regulation gave specific substance to the mandate of the statute. The court held that \u201cHEW <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>might reasonably conclude that only he who is as near as a real or adoptive father would be has that consensual relation to the family which makes it reasonably certain that his income is actually available for support of the children in the household.\u201d 397 U.S. at 558, 90 S.Ct. at 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Remembering that wages are \u201cremuneration paid ... for employment,\u201d and applying the standard from <em>Lewis, </em>the question here, then, is might the Secretary have reasonably concluded that advances or reimbursements for bona fide ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in the business of the employer, are not wages; and, if so, might the Secretary have reasonably concluded that reimbursed expenses should either be paid separately or identified. The answer to the first part of the question is so obviously yes as to warrant no discussion. We are of opinion the answer to the second part is also yes. If for no other reason than Social Security tax is not paid on expenses, but on wages, we think it not unreasonable to conclude that there be identification of the amount of the expenses. It is not reasonable to assume that an employer would pay Social Security tax on expenses rather than identifying the amount paid. This particular aspect of the problem is emphasized here by the facts that the City treated none of the $400 per month salary as expenses, and the plaintiff never claimed payment for expenses under the Charter, if he were in fact \u201cin the business of the employer,\u201d rather than on a project of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">In response to the third question, in reversing the district court, we hold that the Secretary\u2019s refusal to allow plaintiff to deduct the expenses of maintaining an office and secretarial expenses from his gross income for purposes of section 203(b) and (f) of the Act was not arbitrary. While it may seem to follow from our opinion that upholding the specific identification requirements of 20 CFR 404.1026(a)(8) is sufficient unto itself, there are other reasons, and they run as well to our answer to the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">The Secretary, in arguing that the regulation is not arbitrary, says it is sustainable as a prophylactic measure as was the regulation involved (disclosure provided for all installment credit contracts with four or more payments) in <em>Mourning v. Family Publications, </em>411 U.S. 356, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973), and compares the similar statute (to prevent the parties to sham marriages from recovering under the Social Security Act) upheld in <em>Weinberg v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). The argument is persuasive and may be well taken, but we do not find it necessary to rest our decision upon this base. We think it demonstrable that the regulation is \u201creasonably related to the purpose of the enabling legislation,\u201d <em>Mourning, </em>411 U.S. at p. 369, 93 S.Ct. at p. 1661, and thus not arbitrary for at least two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-8\">First. The higher the average monthly wage upon which the claim for benefits is based, the higher the benefit is (up to a maximum). See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 415. If entitlement to benefits were based on wages which included business expenses, then excess earnings should be computed by the same method, as it now is. To hold otherwise would achieve the anomalous result of allowing benefits to be computed using the higher figure and excess computed using the lower. This is precisely the kind of inconsistency condemned by the Court in <em>Lewis, </em>397 U.S. at 559, 90 S.Ct. at p. 1283, where, as a reason for sustaining the regulation, it said: \u201cAny lesser duty of support might merely be a device for lowering welfare benefits without guaranteeing that the child would regularly receive the income on which the reduction is based . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">Second. The City pays the tax and files wage reports on the total wage it pays plaintiff. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 415(f), the Secretary must recompute a beneficiary\u2019s primary insurance amount for any part of a year in which he has wages. This recomputation, of course, would be based on Thompson\u2019s salary of $400 per month. Should the recomputation result in higher benefits, they would go to Thompson, while, at the same time, under Thompson\u2019s theory, he would be able to reduce his excess payments by virtue of his business expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>We think the Secretary\u2019s plan of computing eligibility for benefits and liability for excess on the same standard is a reasonable administration of the Social Security program and that the regulation, 20 CFR 404.1026(a)(8), is reasonably related to it. Accordingly, we are of opinion the regulation is not arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-4\">The judgment of the district court will be vacated and the case remanded with directions to enter judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(b) and (f) provide in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-11\">(b) Deductions, in such amounts and at such time or times as the Secretary shall determine, shall be made from any payment or payments under this title to which an individual is entitled, and from any payment or payments to which any other persons are entitled on the basis of such individual\u2019s wages and self-employment income, until the total of such deductions equals\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-12\">(1) such individual\u2019s benefit or benefits under section 402 for any month, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-13\">(2) if such individual was entitled to old-age insurance benefits under section 402(a) of this title for such month, the benefit or benefits of all other persons for such month, the benefit or benefits of all other persons for such month under section 402 based on such individual\u2019s wages and self-employment income,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-19\">if for such month he is charged with excess earnings, under the provisions of subsection (f) of this section, equal to the total of benefits referred to in clauses (1) and (2).
