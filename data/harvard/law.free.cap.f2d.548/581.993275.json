Ray McDermott &amp; Company, Inc. [McDermott] on September 9, 1970, under which McDermott agreed to construct approximately 11.18 miles of pipeline for Texas Eastern in the Gulf of Mexico. Texas Eastern reserved the right in the agreement to inspect McDermott\u2019s work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> McDermott expressly agreed \u201cto do the work in a workmanlike manner with men skilled in the work assigned to them in strict accordance with the Contract Documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-21\">On October 13, 1970, while the work was in progress, Henry Thibodeaux, a welding inspector for Texas Eastern, was seriously injured when he tripped and fell over welding hoses aboard the McDermott Lay Barge No. 23. The hoses were attached to acetylene and oxygen bottles. Torches at the end of the hoses were used to ignite a \u201cdope pot\u201d (a container holding a protective asphalt substance used on pipe). At the time of the accident the hoses were not in use but nevertheless had been allowed to remain in the passageway between the dope station and the x-ray station (used in making pictures of the pipe welds). Both the hoses and dope pot were McDermott\u2019s equipment and were used by McDermott\u2019s crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-22\">Thibodeaux sued the barge owner, McDermott, alleging that his injury was due to negligence and unseaworthiness, and also sued his employer, Texas Eastern, alleging negligence under the Jones Act (46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688). Texas Eastern and McDermott then filed cross-claims against each other for indemnity. The matter proceeded to trial before a jury. At the end of the second trial day, McDermott settled the claims of Thibodeaux against it for the sum of $100,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Texas Eastern declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>enter into the settlement but approved the sum as reasonable. The indemnity claims between Texas Eastern and McDermott were then submitted to the trial court for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The trial judge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> found that Thibodeaux was entitled to seaman\u2019s status and to the warranty of seaworthiness;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>that the inspection services of Texas Eastern were for the ship\u2019s benefit; that McDermott was entitled to the performance of these services in a workmanlike manner under <em>Ryan </em>;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the negligence of Thibodeaux in failing to watch where he was walking and in failing to see the hoses was the proximate cause of his injury; and that the warranty of workmanlike performance [WWLP] was breached by Thibodeaux\u2019s own act. The trial judge further found that language in the contract between McDermott and Texas Eastern purporting to exonerate Texas Eastern for its own negligence to its employees was ambiguous and therefore must be construed against Texas Eastern, the party which had prepared the instrument. As a result of these findings, the trial court entered judgment dismissing the cross-claim of Texas Eastern, granting the cross-claim of McDermott for the $100,000 paid by it in settlement to Thibodeaux, and also assessing the costs of defense in the sum of $9,290.50 against Texas Eastern. Texas Eastern appeals from the adverse judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">\n<em>A. McDermott\u2019s cross-claim for indemnity against Texas Eastern.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">\n<em>1. Inapplicability of the Ryan theory of indemnity.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">The District Court granted McDermott\u2019s claim solely on the theory of indemnity derived from <em>Ryan Stevedoring Company v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation, </em>350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956), in which a shipowner liable to an injured longshoreman under the nondelegable duty of providing a seaworthy ship, was permitted to recover from the stevedore employer which had breached its WWLP. In <em>Ryan </em>the Supreme Court emphasized that the obligation of the contractor to perform the work properly and safely was of the essence of the \u201cstevedoring contract.\u201d 350 U.S. 124, 133, 76 S.Ct. 232, 237, 100 L.Ed. 133. Although we have extended the doctrine to non-stevedore maritime contractors in limited circumstances,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the reach of that doctrine has never encompassed a situation where no warranty, express or implied, has been given by the alleged indemnitor. That is the situation here. It is implicit in the \u201cwarranty of workmanlike performance\u201d that the warrantor is performing some type of duty for the benefit of the party to whom the warranty is made. There must, of course, be a warranty in order to have a breach thereof. Texas Eastern was engaged in no type of service for McDermott and made no warranty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>its contractor. To the contrary, it was McDermott which, according to the contract and the evidence, was performing a service for Texas Eastern, <em>i. e., </em>construction of a pipeline. It was McDermott, not Texas Eastern, which under the express provisions of the contract warranted that it would \u201cperform the work in a workmanlike manner.\u201d There is nothing in the contract or the evidence to show, or from which we might infer, that Texas Eastern owed any duty to McDermott. It had a right under the contract; but no obligation, to inspect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We have consistently refrained from extending the <em>Ryan </em>-type indemnity \u201cbeyond those controversies involving the \u2018special rules governing the obligations and liability of shipowners\u2019<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which necessitated its formulation and justify its application.\u201d <em>See In re Dearborn Marine Service, Inc., </em>5 Cir., 1974, 499 F.2d 263, 287. <em>See also Delta Engineering Corporation v. Scott, </em>5 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 11; <em>Ocean Drilling &amp; Exp. Co. v. Berry Bros. Oilfield Service, </em>5 Cir., 1967, 377 F.2d 511. The application of the doctrine to the facts of the present ease is clearly improper. Having found that Texas Eastern owed no warranty, it is unnecessary to consider the contention of McDermott that the negligence of Thibodeaux should be imputed to his employer, Texas Eastern, in determining whether the WWLP was breached.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The District Court erred, therefore, as a matter of law in concluding that Texas Eastern owed a warranty of workmanlike performance to McDermott.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">\n<em>2. Tort indemnity.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">The active-passive tort theory of indemnity, whereby an actively negligent tort-feasor is required to indemnify a passively negligent tort-feasor,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is unavailable to McDermott as there was no evidence or finding of negligence on the part of Texas Eastern. The tanks and hoses responsible for Thibodeaux\u2019s fall were owned by McDermott. Neither the contract nor the evidence shows that Texas Eastern\u2019s inspectors had anything to do with the equipment. McDermott does not even so contend. Moreover the District Court\u2019s finding of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>negligence by McDermott was, according to the standards used on appellate review, clearly erroneous. \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Chaney v. City of Galveston, </em>5 Cir., 1966, 368 F.2d 774, 776. <em>See also United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948); <em>McAllister v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed.20 (1954). After thoroughly reviewing the record we are left with such a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">When the jury trial was adjourned because of the settlement, three witnesses, including Thibodeaux, had testified. Their testimony established that it was the McDermott crew which had allowed the hoses to remain across the passageway between the x-ray station and dope station; that there was available an accessible spool in the area on which the hoses could have been placed; that the purpose of the hoses was to ignite the dope pot but which was not being ignited, nor had been, for some time prior to the accident; that the artificial lighting in the passageway was poor and that the injury occurred at approximately daybreak on a cloudy, overcast morning.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under these circumstances we hold that the district judge was clearly erroneous in failing to find McDermott actively negligent in proximately causing the accident. McDermott not only created the foreseeable hazard but had an opportunity to correct it, which it failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">The same facts which support our decision that McDermott was actively negligent are the basis for our further holding that McDermott breached its WWLP to Texas Eastern. The warranty owed by McDermott was not the implied <em>Ryan </em>-type WWLP due by a stevedoring company to a shipowner, but an express agreement con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>tained in Paragraph .051 of the contract which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">Contractor shall do the work in a workmanlike manner with men skilled in the work assigned to them in strict accordance with the Contract Documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The language of the contract in this respect is clear and unequivocal. It is equally apparent that the manner in which McDermott allowed the dimly lighted passageway between the x-ray and dope stations to remain cluttered with the acetylene and oxygen hoses while not in use constituted a breach of its warranty. The finding that Thibodeaux was solely responsible for the accident by failing to observe is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">There is no other reasonable basis for liability of Texas Eastern which would justify recovery over by McDermott. Thibodeaux\u2019s Jones Act suit against Texas Eastern would impose no liability inasmuch as there was not even the slightest evidence of employer negligence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">\n<em>3. The settlement.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Under well-settled principles of maritime law comparative negligence of an injured party requires reduction of any amount recoverable in proportion to that negligence. Considering the serious exposure to liability of McDermott for unseaworthiness and/or negligence and the consequent risk of a jury verdict in excess of the amount paid in settlement, even reduced by the comparative negligence of Thibodeaux, McDermott\u2019s reason for settlement is clear. It then hoped to recoup this amount from Texas Eastern by its indemnity claim. However, since there is no basis for Texas Eastern\u2019s liability, McDermott is bound by its settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-17\">\n<em>B. Texas Eastern\u2019s cross-claim for indemnity against McDermott.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-18\">Texas Eastern contends that it is entitled to recover indemnity from McDermott for the amount paid in settlement of Thibodeaux\u2019s maintenance and cure claim and for its attorney fees and costs, all pursuant to the provisions of its contract with McDermott and, alternatively, under the active-passive tort theory. The indemnity provision is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Texas Eastern contends that the trial court erred in determining that the language was ambiguous and therefore should be construed against Texas Eastern which prepared the instrument. However, our discussion, <em>supra, </em>on tort indemnity and our conclusion of active negligence on the part of McDermott suffice with reference to the agreement to show that Texas Eastern is entitled to indemnity. <em>See </em>n. 10 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-19\">\n<em>C. Attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-20\">The trial court awarded McDermott the sum of $9,290.50 representing the cost of defense. Foreseeable damages recoverable for breach of the WWLP include reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and litigation expenses. <em>Strachan Shipping Co. v. Konink</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>lyke Nederlandsche S.M., N.V., </em>5 Cir., 1963, 324 F.2d 746; <em>McCawley v. Ozeanosun Compania, Maritime, S.

McDermott contends that the inspection services performed by Texas Eastern were more than a \u201clook and see\u201d proposition, and in this respect refers us to Paragraph .124 of the contract which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">Contractor shall perform the work to the satisfaction of the engineer.

Paragraph .125 of the contract substantiates the contention of Texas Eastern and makes it clear that the performance of McDermott was in no way dependent upon Texas Eastern\u2019s right of inspection; it reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">As stated in Paragraph .351 of the General Conditions, the Contractor' is an \u201cIndependent Contractor\u201d who is responsible to the Company for all materials delivered and for the results herein contracted for.

James Lacaze, an employee of Inspection Signal Service, testified that none of his fellow employees nor the Texas Eastern inspectors used the dope pots or the tanks, hoses and torches for lighting the pots. He said that he saw the accident, and at the time acetylene hoses were lying across the 6- to 7-foot opening leading to the x-ray station. He said that the dope crew men were employed by McDermott. He had seen the dope crew \u201cthrow the torch back across the opening where the acetylene bottles were\u201d after using the hose to light the dope pot; that the hose itself \u201cwould lay down on the floor\u201d across the opening.

He was not sure of the artificial lighting conditions in the passageway, but testified that when the accident happened, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t real light, we had been having a storm and all, and it was real cloudy, but it was past daybreak.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-17\">Plaintiff Henry Thibodeaux testified that the doping of the pipe was done by the McDermott dope crew.
