Huyett, 3rd, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b576-22\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b576-23\">ALDISERT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b576-24\">The question for decision is whether Peter Farrell, a clerk in a maritime terminal office whose principal duties in the office require him to examine documents presented by outside truckers, is an employee \u201chandling cargo\u201d as contemplated in <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>540 F.2d 629 (3d Cir. 1976). If so, he is covered by the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901-50, as amended, Pub.L. No. 92-576 (1972). The Benefits Review Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>of the United States Department of Labor found that Farrell was covered under the Act. Farrell\u2019s employer has petitioned for review. We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><em>Sea-Land Service, </em>this court\u2019s definitive interpretation of employee and employer concepts under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3) and (4), held that coverage under the Act was intended by Congress to extend to those employees \u201chandling cargo\u201d (1) after its delivery from another mode of transportation for the purpose of loading it aboard a vessel or (2) while it is in the process of being discharged from a vessel and before its delivery to the place where the next mode of transportation will pick it up. <em>Ibid., </em>540 F.2d at 638. Our present inquiry is, therefore, extremely limited: we are to determine whether it was the congressional intent to place Farrell\u2019s particular occupation within the Act\u2019s orbit of coverage, as delineated in the <em>Sea-Land Service </em>formulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The relevant findings of the administrative law judge include the finding that Farrell \u201cis primarily (if not \u2018purely\u2019) a clerical employee\u201d, as well as the following particulars:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">8. Claimant, a member of Clerks\u2019 and Checkers\u2019 Local No. 1 of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, was engaged on the day of the accident as a temporary delivery clerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">9. As a delivery clerk, Claimant worked in an office in a building which adjoins a container shed and which is situated about 2500 feet from the water\u2019s edge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">10. The function of the delivery clerk is to handle the paper work necessary in the delivery of cargo to truckmen for removal from the terminal. When a truckman presents papers to him, he checks out the documents to see if the cargo is properly released. He also gives out container stripping sheets. Any discrepancies that might appear between markings on the stripping sheet and markings on the actual cargo are customarily resolved by physical examination and comparison performed by checkers or location men in the shed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">11. The temporary delivery clerk\u2019s function is essential to the removal from the terminal of cargo that has been discharged from vessels or stripped from containers, and it is an integral part of stevedoring operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">12. Except for rare occasions, such as personal delivery of a package to the Captain\u2019s cabin, a clerk\u2019s duties would not require him to go aboard any vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-12\">13. Occasionally, a temporary delivery clerk may go to the shed or loading platform to examine markings on cargo which appear to differ from the markings on the delivery order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-13\">14. Claimant had worked for the Employer either in the capacity of temporary clerk or checker, depending upon day-today needs and availability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">We are greatly assisted in our analysis of these findings by the language of both the House and Senate Reports which accompanied the 1972 Amendments to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act: \u201cThe Committee does not intend to cover employees who are not engaged in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel . . .. Thus, . purely clerical employees whose jobs do not require them to participate in the loading or unloading of cargo [would not be covered]. However, checkers, for example, who are directly involved in loading or unloading functions are covered by the new amendment.\u201d S.Rep. No. 92-1125, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1972); H.R.Rep. No. 92-1441, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 1972 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4708 [quoted extensively in <em>Sea-Land Service, supra, </em>540 F.2d at 637-38.]</p>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">Here, the Benefits Review Board reasoned that the intention of Congress was not to exclude all clerical employees from the Act\u2019s coverage, but rather to exclude only those \u201cpurely clerical employees whose jobs do not require them to participate in the loading or unloading of cargo.\u201d <em>Faber v. Maher Terminals, </em>BRB Decision No. 75-183 (Dec. 10, 1975), <em>citing </em>S.Rep. No. 92-1125, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1972); H.R. Rep. No. 92-1441, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>(1972). Under this view, the legislative references to the Act\u2019s coverage of checkers is not to be read as an indication that other clerical employees who are involved in loading or unloading are excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Although we have no quarrel with the Board\u2019s general reasoning, we do fault its application to the facts in this case. If an office worker, or a clerical employee, such as Farrell, is to be included in the Act\u2019s coverage, then it is difficult to conceive of any clerical position in maritime employment that would not be covered. Under the Board\u2019s formulation, a clerical employee who handles documents relating to maritime cargo is \u201cdirectly involved in the loading and unloading functions.\u201d This interpretation, we fear, flies in the face of the clearly stated legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Farrell worked in an office. He did not work on the pier, in the yard, or on the dock as a checker (also referred to as a tally-man). <em>See, e.g., Lind v. Independent Pier Co. </em>(No. 76-1229, 3d Cir. Jan. 3, 1977). He came within the congressional proscription of a purely clerical employee whose job did not require him to participate in the loading or unloading of cargo. That on occasion he left the office to examine markings on cargo, and that in the past he had worked as a checker is not controlling. What is controlling is the nature of his primary duties. As we perceive the congressional intent, that is the sole test. Farrell\u2019s primary duties being that of a clerk and not a checker, he is excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The petition for review will be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
