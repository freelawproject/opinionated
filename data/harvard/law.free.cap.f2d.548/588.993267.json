The caller then stated that if the jury did not return a verdict of \u201cnot guilty\u201d he would be killed by the Mafia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the evidentiary hearing two jurors testified that the prosecutor\u2019s statements, together with these telephone calls, caused them to view the petitioners more severely than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>they would otherwise and as perhaps connected with organized crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The district court granted the petitioners\u2019 application for writ of habeas corpus, specifically finding that the errors complained of gave the jury the impression that petitioners were involved in organized crime. He also found that the errors were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt but that, on the contrary, the errors prejudiced the petitioners by influencing the jury\u2019s decisions on both guilt and punishment. The State of Texas appeals the grant of habeas relief on two main grounds: (1) a juror may not impeach his own verdict; and (2) the errors, if any, were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The state\u2019s invocation of the general rule that a juror may not impeach his verdict, e. g., <em>McDonald v. Pless, </em>238 U.S. 264, 35 S.Ct. 783, 59 L.Ed. 1300 (1915), overlooks the well-established exception which authorizes juror testimony \u201cas to any fact showing the existence of an extraneous influence.\u201d <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>146 U.S. 140, 13 S.Ct. 50, 36 L.Ed. 917 (1892). <em>See also United States v. Howard, </em>506 F.2d 865 (5th Cir. 1975). Thus, the testimony of the jurors in the instant case about facts showing the \u201cextraneous influence\u201d of the caller was properly admitted and considered by the judge below.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The state\u2019s contention that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is also without merit. The district court specifically found that the errors were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the state has failed to show that finding clearly erroneous. It is true that the evidence against petitioners was strong, but it is also true that they were entitled to have it considered by a jury free of such influences as we have set out. These, in combination, may well have produced just such a synergistic effect as the jurors related and the trial court discerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-15\">. The trial court, though instructing the jury to avoid extraneous matter and communications, gave them no clear guidance about what to do in such an event as this, when such matter was thrust upon them. At least one attempted to communicate it to the prosecutor, but whether the message got through is unclear.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
