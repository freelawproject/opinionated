HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">, The plaintiff-appellee, Midland Insurance Company (\u201cMidland\u201d), alleges that the defendant, Markel Service, Inc. (\u201cMarkel\u201d), misrepresented and concealed certain information, thereby causing Midland to incur a loss from its failure to cancel a policy of excess liability insurance. The plaintiff alleged damages in the amount of two hundred sixty thousand dollars ($260,000), the entire amount of a payment made to the insured covered by the liability policy in question. Upon the jury\u2019s finding of liability, however, the district court awarded damages in the amount of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000), which represented the difference between the insured\u2019s actual primary coverage for injury or death to one person ($100,000) and the amount of such coverage which Midland believed to be in effect at the time the loss occurred ($250,000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Markel brings this appeal from the finding of liability and Midland cross appeals, seeking to increase the amount of damages from $150,000 to $260,-000.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">I. <em>The Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">Midland, an insurance company, brought this suit against Markel, an insurance broker, for damages allegedly sustained when Midland made payment for a loss sustained by one of its insureds, a truck line known as Zero Refrigerated Lines (\u201cZero\u201d). Zero initially had in force a policy of automobile liability insurance with prescribed limits of $100,000 for injury or death to one person, $300,000 liability for any one accident, and $50,000 liability limit for property damages (100,000/300,000/50,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">Zero wished to obtain excess liability coverage exceeding these limits and, to that end, it called for bids for such insurance through its agent, Jacob Rubiola &amp; Co. (\u201cRubiola\u201d) of San Antonio. Rubiola contacted, among others, Markel, who apparently submitted the lowest bid for the, insurance and placed the policy with Midland.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-18\">As a result of misinformation conveyed by one of Markel\u2019s employees, Midland erroneously indicated in the policy which it first issued that Zero had underlying primary coverage with limits of 250/500/100, but these figures were corrected by an endorsement showing the actual underlying limits of 100/300/50. At the time the endorsement was issued, Midland and Markel also reached an understanding that Midland would review the policy on its anniversary date, March 20, 1973.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Zero\u2019s policy was in fact \u201creviewed\u201d in early 1973 when an employee of Midland, Michael Corken, sent a letter to Markel on January 18, 1973, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">In reviewing the captioned file, I note that Lou Liggio had various conversations with you in which he advised that we require automobile underlying limits of $250/500,000 \u2014 BI (bodily injury) and $100,000 \u2014 PD. (property damage).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A99\">Please be advised that unless the underlying automobile limits are increased to the above required minimum limits (250/500/100), we will have no other alternative but to allow you ample time to replace us as a carrier for this account or cancel our policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Markel responded to this communication by a letter to Corken, dated January 30, 1973, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">Dear Mike:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\"><em>We have been advised </em>that the Home Insurance Company <em>will be </em>the renewal primary carrier with limits of 250/500/100. <em>As soon as we have confirmed this </em>and have obtained a policy number we will forward to you prior to the March 20 deadline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">Cordially yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-11\">Edward E. Jacke,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-12\">Resident Vice-President</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWC\">(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-15\">The limits of underlying coverage, in fact, had not been raised and Markel was so advised by the insured\u2019s agent, Rubiola, by letter of February 13, 1973.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Markel, however, did not advise Midland that lower limits remained in effect until after a serious accident occurred in California on May 26, 1973, involving a Zero truck and resulting in the death of one person.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The claim against Zero by the decedent\u2019s survivors was compromised and settled by the payment of $100,000 by the primary carrier, and the payment by Midland of an additional $260,000. The total settlement amount ($360,000) was stipulated by the parties to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">Midland presented testimony to the effect that it would have cancelled Zero\u2019s excess liability policy but for the representation in Mr. Jacke\u2019s January 30 letter that the limits of its primary coverage would be raised to 250/500/100. Mr. Corken testified that, if he had been informed that the lower limits were still in effect after his January 18 letter, he would have waited until March 20, the policy anniversary date, to see whether the limits had been increased and, if they had not, he would have cancelled the policy as indicated in his letter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Corken testified that he was aware of the agreement between Liggio and Horvath to \u201creview\u201d the policy on its anniversary date. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Moreover, Corken had written a notation on his copy of Liggio\u2019s letter of April 24, 1972, that \u201cLVL [is] going to cancel unless primary raised to 250/500/100.\u201d \u201cLVL\u201d refers to Mr. Liggio.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">II. <em>Disposition in the District Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AM6\">The district court submitted to the jury ten issues relating to the question of Markers liability. The jury\u2019s responses to the first four issues established that Markel misrepresented the facts to Midland as to the liability limits of Zero\u2019s primary coverage, that such misrepresentations were material and that Midland\u2019s reliance on such misrepresentations resulted in a loss. The jury\u2019s responses to issues five and six established that Markel concealed a material fact from Midland in connection with Zero\u2019s liability policy and that such concealment resulted directly in a loss to Midland. The jury\u2019s responses to issues seven and eight, however, established that Midland had failed to exercise ordinary care in handling Zero\u2019s insurance coverage and that such failure was the proximate cause of its loss.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">After the jury returned its answers to the ten issues submitted by the court, both parties filed motions to disregard certain of the jury\u2019s conclusions. Midland filed a motion to disregard the jury\u2019s answers to issues seven and eight, which concluded that Midland\u2019s failure to use ordinary care was the proximate cause of its loss. Midland contended that contributory negligence could not be raised as a defense to a cause of action based upon misrepresentation, concealment of material facts or breach of agency duty. Midland\u2019s motion also sought judgment awarding damages in the amount of $260,000 plus costs. Markel moved the court to disregard the jury\u2019s answers to issues one through six and for judgment N.O.V. Markel alleged that there was no evidence to support submission to the jury of issue number five, concerning concealment of a material fact. Markel contended that the issue, as presented, did not limit its liability to acts of willful or deliberate concealment, but would have permitted a finding of liability based on an inadvertent or negligent failure to convey information to Midland.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">On March 17,1975, the trial court entered judgment, concluding that the defense of contributory negligence was unavailable to Markel in an action for misrepresentation, concealment of material facts or breach of agency duty and granting Midland\u2019s motion to disregard the jury\u2019s answer to issues seven and eight, concerning contributory negligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the court denied Markel\u2019s motion to disregard the jury\u2019s answers to issues one through six and entered judgment on behalf of Midland in the amount of $150,000 with interest thereon at six (6%) percent until paid. Midland thereafter moved the court to alter its judgment to provide for $260,000 damages, which motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">III. <em>Appellant\u2019s Contentions on Appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Markel\u2019s attack on the jury\u2019s finding of liability has a dual thrust. Predictably, Markel first contends that the jury\u2019s conclusions are unsupported by the evidence presented. Markel next contends that the district court erred in its jury charge and interrogatory concerning concealment of a material fact. Before considering Markel\u2019s claim of insufficient evidence, we note that the trial court was also called upon to weigh the evidence when it considered Markel\u2019s motion for instructed verdict and for judgment N.O.V. In its consideration of these motions, the district court was required to apply a federal, rather than a state, test for the sufficiency of the evidence to create a jury question. <em>Boeing </em>v. <em>Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365 (5th Cir. 1969) (en banc). Thus, contrary to Markel\u2019s position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>that this appeal is governed by the \u201cany evidence\u201d rule applicable in the state of Texas, the standard applicable to this case, both in district court and on appeal, is the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d or \u201creasonable man\u201d standard set forth in <em>Boeing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Viewing the evidence in the manner required by <em>Boeing, </em>we conclude that the facts of record contain substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the jury. The jury could have reasonably concluded from the evidence, although it was disputed, that Markel misrepresented the facts to Midland concerning the limits of Zero\u2019s primary liability coverage, that such misrepresentations were material, and that Midland\u2019s reliance on the misrepresentations resulted directly in the loss to Midland. Similarly, there was ample evidence, although conflicting, from which the jury could have concluded that Markel concealed a material fact which resulted in a direct loss to Midland. Because the evidence presented a jury question, and since our review of the record, even when it is viewed in the light most favorable to Markel, reveals substantial evidence to support the verdict, we conclude that the district court properly overruled the motions for instructed verdict and for judgment N.O.V. Furthermore, since we have concluded that the jury\u2019s finding of liability was based on substantial evidence that Markel misrepresented a material fact, we find it unnecessary to consider Markel\u2019s contention that the district court erred in its jury charge and interrogatory concerning concealment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">IV. <em>Midland\u2019s Cross Appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">In order to obtain recovery of the entire sum that it was required to pay for Zero\u2019s loss, Midland seeks to increase from $150,000 to $260,000 the damages awarded by the district court. Markel, on the other hand, contends that Midland\u2019s damages, if any, should be limited to what Midland\u2019s liability would have been if the primary limits had been increased. Midland predicates its claim for higher damages on the assertion that it would have cancelled Zero\u2019s policy on March 20, 1973, the policy anniversary date, if it had not been informed by Mr. Jacke that the primary limits would be increased and if the limits had not actually been increased by that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">In order to prevail on this argument, Midland must show that at least two facts are established in the record. First, it must show that there was an understanding with Markel to review the policy on its anniversary date. Second, it must prove that such a review would have resulted in cancellation of the policy. With respect to the first of these facts, we are convinced that there was an agreement to review the policy on its anniversary date. That such an understanding existed is abundantly clear from the testimony of Michael Corken, from the testimony of Zero\u2019s agent, Rubiola, and from Corken\u2019s January 18, 1973 letter referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">Markel disputes Midland\u2019s contention that the policy would have been cancelled on March 20, 1973, but for the misrepresentation contained in Jacke\u2019s letter. With regard to the second essential fact, Markel relies on Midland\u2019s letter of January 18, 1973, which contained the warning that \u201c . . . unless the underlying automobile limits are increased to the above required limits, we will have no other alternative but to allow you <em>ample time </em>to replace us as a carrier for this account or cancel our policy.\u201d Noting that \u201cample time\u201d is undefined and that the policy provided for at least thirty days notice before cancellation, Markel argues that the policy might not have been cancelled before the accident occurred in May. Markel bolsters its argument by pointing out that Midland did not actually cancel the policy until October 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>1973, or more than four months after it was informed, sometime in early June, of the lower primary limits. Although Midland made known its intention to cancel the policy of Markel did not meet its terms, we do not believe that Midland has proven to a certainty that Zero\u2019s policy actually would have been cancelled before the accident occurred in May, 1973. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination of Midland\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-12\">. This figure also represents the difference between Midland\u2019s actual excess liability for its insured\u2019s loss ($260,000) and the amount of liability it would have incurred ($110,000) if the primary coverage had been maintained at the $250,000 level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-21\">. An employee of Midland, Louis V. Liggio, stated in his deposition that he had explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>to Tom Horvath, a branch manager of Markel Service, that Midland \u201cwould stay with the \u2022 risk, with the underlying of 100/300 up until the anniversary period which would have been the preceding year (sic) or March 20 and he agreed to this and I went ahead with the issuance of the endorsements.\u201d This statement was made in a telephone conversation which took place on May 10, 1972. Horvath later confirmed this understanding in a letter to Liggio, dated May 17, 1972, in which he stated \u201cI have discussed this risk with Mr. Ed Jacke of our office and have indicated to him that this policy will be reviewed on its anniversary date of March 20, 1973.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b705-14\">. Midland also presented evidence that Jacke may have known that the limits had not been increased even before he wrote the January 30 letter. The agent who placed Zero\u2019s primary liability coverage with Home Insurance Company, Burton Barnes, testified that he informed Mr. Jacke \u201csometime around January 26th or 27th\u201d that the limits of Zero\u2019s primary coverage were 100,000/300,000/50,000. Although Barnes did not unequivocally state that his conversation with Jacke took place before January 30, the credibility of his testimony was a matter for the jury to evaluate during the course of its deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Ayq\">' After the loss, an employee of Midland telephoned Markel to inquire as to the limits applicable to Zero\u2019s primary coverage. In response, on June 15, Markel forwarded to Midland Rubiola\u2019s February 13 letter advising Markel that the Home Insurance Company\u2019s primary coverage had limits of 100/300/50. The record shows that Markel had received Rubiola\u2019s letter on February 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"A8j\"> The existence of an agreement to review the coverage after one year was also confirmed by the insured\u2019s agent, Rubiola, who testified that Midland had the option to review the coverage and cancel the policy after one year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\">. In its responses to issues nine and ten, the jury concluded that Markel had not acted with malice in making the misrepresentation to Midland and that an award of exemplary damages was therefore inappropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b706-12\">. This ruling, which was made in response to Midland\u2019s contention that contributory negligence may not be raised as a defense to a cause of action based upon misrepresentation, concealment of material facts or breach of agency duty, is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\">. In view of the jury\u2019s finding of liability for both misrepresentation and concealment, we are unsure whether Midland is pursuing its claim of concealment on appeal. Midland\u2019s brief contains the following statement: \u201cThe finding of concealment, in view of the jury\u2019s Issues 1 through 4, could be considered moot and superfluous, correctly submitted or not.\u201d Although appellant Markel, in its attack upon the jury\u2019s findings, discussed this issue in its brief, Midland did not. Moreover, neither party discussed the issue during oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
