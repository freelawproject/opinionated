The district court awarded plaintiff restitution of her salary for the 22 days she was absent following childbirth. 396 F.Supp. 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">This court delayed disposition of the case pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>- U.S. -, 97 S.Ct. 401, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976). In that decision the Court held the exclusion of pregnancy-related disabilities from an employer\u2019s comprehensive disability benefits insurance policy, although contrary to the EEOC guidelines, did not violate Title VII. The Court held the EEOC guidelines conflicted with \u201cindicia of the proper interpretation of the sex-discrimination provisions of Title VII.\u201d 97 S.Ct. at 411-12. Applying <em>Geduldig v. Aiello, </em>417 U.S. 484, 94 S.Ct. 2485, 41 L.Ed.2d 256 (1974), the Court concluded that the proper interpretation was that \u201can exclusion of pregnancy from a disability benefits plan providing general coverage is not a gender-based discrimination at all.\u201d 97 S.Ct. at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">However, the Court recognized the fact that there was no sex-based discrimination as such did not end the analysis, if it was shown that the facially neutral distinctions were \u201cmere pretexts designed to effect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex from another.\u201d 97 S.Ct. at 407-08. In determining whether the exclusion of pregnancy from General Electric\u2019s disability benefits policy was pretextual, the court applied the test of mutuality of included risks and concluded that \u201c[tjhere is no risk from which men are protected and women are not. Likewise, there is no risk from which women are protected and men are not.\u201d 97 S.Ct. at 409 (quoting <em>Geduldig v. Aiello, supra, </em>417 U.S. at 496-97, 94 S.Ct. 2485).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">In the present ease the plaintiff seeks reimbursement of her salary only for her disability and illness <em>following </em>childbirth. At issue is the application by the school district of an overall sick leave policy. Unlike the facts in <em>General Electric, </em>the school district\u2019s sick leave policy does not involve an insurance contract which provides risk coverage for specific disabilities. Rather the school district\u2019s sick leave policy excuses absences on an individual basis \u201cdue to personal illness.\u201d The district court found that the school district compensated any teacher who was in fact disabled from performing her duties for <em>any </em>reason except normal pregnancy and childbirth. 396 F.Supp. at 1037. The district court further found that the school district \u201cdoes not contend that there is a reasonable basis for its determination to exclude disabilities resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>childbirth from its otherwise comprehensive disability program.\u201d 396 F.Supp. at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">in view of this finding and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>General Electric, </em>we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand to the district court for reconsideration consistent with the <em>General Electric </em>decision; in doing so, if the parties so choose, there may be further evidence and argument presented to the district court as to whether or not the defendant\u2019s policy is in fact discriminatory under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
