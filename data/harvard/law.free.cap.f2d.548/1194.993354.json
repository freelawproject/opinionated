BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1296-16\">This case, one of the very few<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the recorded annals of the 85 year history of the Fifth Circuit, involves not the trials and tribulations, attempted frauds and other derelictions of taxpayers, which are common grist for our mill. Rather, it involves fraud by a tax preparer, one whose Twentieth Century occupation is now almost indispensable to all save those taxpayers who can use, or risk the use of, a short form with standard deductions. In this Bicentennial foray we see the hazards both to the system and to the protection of rights of the public and the individuals concerned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>To be remembered is that it is the fraud or false misstatement of the preparer, not the taxpayer, which counts. Indeed, the tax properly due may be of no, or only secondary, significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">Defendant-Appellant Amos P. Brown, Sr., a part-time income tax preparer, was convicted by a jury on 12 counts of counseling, procuring and advising the preparation and presentation of fraudulent and false United States Individual Income Tax Returns for others in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7206(2), Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court subsequently denied Brown\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal and for new trial and sentenced Brown to 11 concurrent terms of three years each, followed by three years probation. Brown appealed, asserting insufficiency of the evidence, the improper admission of prejudicial evidence, the Trial Court\u2019s failure to investigate possible jury misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that the Trial Judge committed plain error by improperly admitting certain evidence which was highly prejudicial to the defendant. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">\n<em>In A Nutshell</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">Amos P. Brown, Sr., is a school teacher who has taught in Florida public schools since 1947. His educational background includes a bachelor\u2019s degree in Agricultural Education from Florida A. &amp; M. University and an H. &amp; R. Block course in income tax preparation. Except for the H. &amp; R. Block course, he has had no formal courses in accounting. He has no prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-13\">After taking the H. &amp; R. Block course in 1970, he began helping friends and neighbors, most of whom had low incomes and many of whom had little or no formal education,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> prepare their income tax returns.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In preparing the returns, defendant relied on both written and oral evidence<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of expenses furnished him by the taxpayer. Rarely, if ever, would the defendant double-check the information given him by the taxpayer by seeking information from a bank or other source concerning the proper amount of taxpayer\u2019s deductions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">In 1973, an IRS audit of approximately 163 returns which had been prepared by Brown revealed that many contained substantially over-stated deductions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Of these returns, 17<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> were culled out to serve as the basis of the present case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The evidence does not reveal whether the IRS agent asked for, or received, supporting documents for deductions claimed by <em>both </em>spouses in each case, or by only one taxpayer of the pair. The evidence also does not reveal the grounds on which the IRS agent disallowed deductions. The evidence does disclose that the agent did not ask whether the taxpayer gave the same or different information to defendant before defendant prepared the audited return.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>When the case was tried, the Government primarily based its proof on the testimony of <em>one </em>spouse taxpayer for each of the counts (the count witnesses) and on the testimony of the IRS agent who, prior to trial, conducted an audit of most of the returns prepared by Brown. Almost all of the count witnesses<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> testified that, with respect to challenged items, their true deductions were less than the figures stated on their returns. In addition, some testified that they did not tell or authorize the defendant to put down the higher figure on the return. In only three counts did the prosecutor inquire about deductible expenses incurred by or known to the non-testifying spouse. The evidence in the other counts does not reveal whether the figures given by the taxpayer include other such expenses incurred by or known to the non-testifying spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">The testimony most damaging to the defendant was given by the IRS agent, Adrienne Peacock. Witness Peacock testified that about 160 returns prepared by the defendant had been audited by the IRS and that between 90% and 95% of these returns contained overstated itemized deductions. She did not have a list of the taxpayers, their names, or their records with her, nor did she have access to the documents for the purpose of refreshing her memory before she testified. She did not audit all of the tax returns in question. Because she was testifying solely from her recollection of these audits, the tax returns were not introduced into evidence and the taxpayers concerned (save for the 17 count taxpayers) were not called as witnesses, Peacock was not able to tell why the IRS considered the various deductions to be overstated,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and was further unable to supply direct proof of the overstatements.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-10\">Upon consideration of all the evidence, including Witness Peacock\u2019s testimony, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to Counts 3, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 and 17. The Judge sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of three years each for every count except Count 17. For that count, the Judge sentenced defendant to three years probation, to be served after his prison sentence. After being found guilty and sentenced by the Court, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the jury verdict and for a new tri^l. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>The Judge denied both motions and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">\n<em>The Intent Requirement of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7206(2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">In a prosecution under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7206(2), the element of willfulness or intent is usually the most difficult to prove. In the misdemeanor and felony tax evasion statutes (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 7201 to 7207, inclusive), the word \u201cwillfully\u201d generally connotes a voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty. <em>United States v. Pomponio, </em>1976, - U.S. -, 97 S.Ct. 22, 50 L.Ed.2d 12; <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>1973, 412 U.S. 346, 93 S.Ct. 2008, 36 L.Ed.2d 941. Proof of evil motive or bad intent is <em>not </em>required. <em>Pomponio, supra. </em>This showing of willfulness will most often be made by circumstantial evidence,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> see e. <em>g., Spies v. United States, supra; United States v. Burrell, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 505 F.2d 904; <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>5 Cir., 1969, 411 F.2d 471, since direct proof of willfulness, as that term is defined in <em>Pomponio </em>and in <em>Bishop, </em>may not be readily available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-14\">In this case, proof of defendant\u2019s willfulness in preparing materially false and fraudulent returns proved to be the focus of much of the Government\u2019s proof. In part, proof of willfulness was offered through the testimony of the count witnesses by showing cumulatively a repetitious overstatement of deductions by the defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">\n<em>The Peacock's Tale</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">The Government also introduced the testimony of IRS agent Adrienne Peacock, who testified that between 90% and 95% of about 160 returns prepared by defendant contained overstated itemized deductions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>There could be no doubt that her testimony played a substantial part in the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant possessed the intent required by \u00a7 7206(2). Of the 17 counts originally brought by the Government, five were dismissed for insufficiency of the evidence. Since the remaining counts did not present particularly strong evidence of willfulness on the part of the defendant<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (although sufficient to place the matter before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>the jury), Peacock\u2019s testimony was particularly devastating.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">If Peacock\u2019s testimony was admissible, we might affirm this case. <em>See </em>note 31, <em>infra. </em>If the testimony was not admissible, however, we must vacate the conviction and remand for a new trial, in light of the prejudicial nature of the evidence and especially since it permeated all the counts, both probatively weak and strong, and the cumulative effect of numerous counts of repetitive acts could serve to meet the element of willfulness. <em>See </em>note 26, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">On this appeal, the Government asserts that Peacock\u2019s testimony was admissible under the rule that evidence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-6\">of commission of other crimes closely related in both time and nature to the crime charged may be admitted to establish identity, <em>Halfen v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1963, 321 F.2d 556, 558, cert. denied, 1964, 376 U.S. 934, 84 S.Ct. 704, 11 L.Ed.2d 653, guilty knowledge, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dryden, </em>5 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 1175, 1178, cert. denied, 398 U.S. 950, 90 S.Ct. 1869, 26 L.Ed.2d 290, intent, <em>United States v. Smith, </em>5 Cir. 1970, 433 F.2d 1266, 1270, cert. denied, 1971, 401 U.S. 977, 91 S.Ct. 1206, 28 L.Ed.2d 328, motive, <em>Huff v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1959, 273 F.2d 56, 60, or a common scheme, plan, design or system of criminal activity of which the crime charged is a part, <em>United States v. Sutherland, </em>5 Cir. 1970, 428 F.2d 1152, 1156.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\"><em>United States v. Broadway, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 477 F.2d 991, 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-10\">We conclude, however, that Peacock\u2019s testimony was inadmissible under <em>Broadway </em>(as well as its modern counterpart, F.R. Evid. 403 and 404(b)), and, more important, was independently inadmissible under the hearsay rule. Because the ultimate underlying defect in Peacock\u2019s testimony was its hearsay character, we proceed to a discussion of that issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-11\">\n<em>Hearsay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-12\">This trial, conducted after July 1, 1975, was governed by the federal rules of Evidence. Under F.R.Evid. 801, hearsay is defined as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-13\">In this case, Peacock\u2019s testimony that between 90% and 95% of the returns she audited contained substantially overstated itemized deductions was introduced for the sole purpose of proving, circumstantially, the \u201cwillfulness\u201d requirement of \u00a7 7206(2). In order to arrive at the conclusion that the deductions in these returns were overstated, Peacock\u2019s perusal of the 160 tax returns was not sufficient, since the returns obviously do not show on their face which deductions are overstated. The record shows that Peacock must have gotten her \u201cproof\u201d of the overstatements through conversations with each of the taxpayers audited. Presumably, the proof consisted either of statements by these taxpayers to Peacock that they all gave different information to the defendant tax preparer than defendant put down on their returns, or that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>were unable to substantiate their deductions, because they did not have any (or had inadequate) supporting records. The proof might also have consisted of the fact that the IRS had legitimate disagreements with all or some of the deductions claimed. However, a prerequisite to this form of proof would be the initial conversation between Peacock and each taxpayer, so that Peacock could determine the bases for the deductions claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">The point to be emphasized, therefore, is that the information obtained by Peacock from the out-of-court statements made by the 160 taxpayers whose returns she audited, was absolutely vital to her ultimate in-court conclusion that between 90% and 95% of the 160 returns she audited contained substantially overstated itemized deductions. Because her testimony had to have been based directly on the out-of-court statements of these taxpayers, defendant had no opportunity to test their ultimate assumptions through cross-examination. He obviously could not cross-examine the taxpayers concerned, because they were not in court. He could not even cross-examine Peacock adequately, because she did not have with her any of the records of conversations she had had with these taxpayers, but was testifying solely from memory, in the most general, amorphous terms. Thus, the jury had no way to examine the trustworthiness of Peacock\u2019s testimony, because it could not examine the statements of the declarant taxpayers or others on which Peacock\u2019s testimony was directly and substantially founded. Given the rationale of the hearsay rule,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> a clearer case of hearsay testimony would be difficult to imagine.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-11\">Nor is her testimony admissible under any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. This is not a recorded recollection (F.R.Evid. 803(5)), a record of regularly conducted activity<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (F.R.Evid. 803(6)), or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>public record or report (F.R.Evid. 803(8)). It was the mere unrefreshed, sometimes borrowed, memory of a witness testifying on the basis of what she had been told by others. Furthermore, there can be no doubt that Peacock\u2019s testimony was extremely prejudicial to defendant. <em>See </em>note 17, <em>supra. </em>Thus, because of the hearsay problem raised by Peacock\u2019s testimony, we would reverse and remand this case, even if her testimony was otherwise admissible under the <em>Broadway </em>standard.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">\n<em>\u201cOther Crimes\u201d Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">F.R.Evid. 404(b) provides that \u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-13\">Rule 404(b) is subject, of course, to the strictures of Rule 403, which provides that, \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-14\">We do not today decide the extent to which these new evidentiary rules alter the common law rules set forth in <em>Broadway </em>and its ilk.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> However, giving F.R.Evid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>404(b) its most liberal interpretation, Peacock\u2019s testimony would be inadmissible as \u201cevidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d without, at a minimum, proof that the returns testified to contained substantially overstated itemized deductions, for it is exactly that proof which constitutes the evidence of other crimes. In order to get this proof, Peacock must necessarily<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> have relied upon information given her in out-of-court conversations with the taxpayers whose returns she audited. As we have already shown, her testimony as to these out-of-court statements by out-of-court declarants constituted inadmissible hearsay. Because of its infection as inadmissible hearsay, her testimony was also inadmissible under F.R.Evid. 404(b), because her testimony did not contain admissible evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">\n<em>Plain Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">It is the Government\u2019s position that, even if the District Court erred in admitting Peacock\u2019s testimony, we should not vacate the conviction because defendant failed to object. This Court, however, can recognize plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights even if there is no timely objection at trial. F.R.Crim.P. 52(b). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Morales, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 477 F.2d 1309, 1315; <em>United States v. Collins, </em>5 Cir., 1972, 472 F.2d 1017, <em>1018; United States v. Garber, </em>5 Cir., 1972, 471 F.2d 212, 217; <em>United States v. Jacquillon, </em>5 Cir., 1972, 469 F.2d 380, 386. As the name implies, plain errors \u201care those involving serious deficiencies which affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings or which constitute obvious error.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Collins, supra, </em>at 1018; <em>United States v. Jacquillon, supra, </em>at 386. Such a strict standard \u201cis necessary in order to promote efficient judicial administration and to prevent parties from gambling for favorable verdicts and then resorting to appeal on errors that might have easily been corrected by objection at trial.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number><em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Whether or not we will take notice of an error not raised below ultimately \u201cmust depend on the facts of the particular case.\u201d <em>United States v. Morales, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 477 F.2d 1309, 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">No matter which of the commonly used definitions of plain error is applied, we have no difficulty in finding that the admission of Peacock\u2019s testimony meets the standard required. First, the error of its admission was obvious and manifest in two different ways. First, it was hearsay of the rankest kind and it was independently inadmissible under F.R.Evid. 404(b) and 403. Second, the admission of the testimony that 90% to 95% of the returns prepared by defendant contained substantially overstated deductions was severely prejudicial to the defendant. <em>See </em>note 17, <em>supra. </em>The instruction given by the Trial Judge immediately after Peacock\u2019s testimony <em>(see </em>note 16, supra) could not have removed the prejudice and unfairness resulting from the admission of this testimony. No other instruction was given. <em>See </em>note 16, <em>supra. </em>From our finding that the admission of the testimony was error, that the error was obvious, that it substantially prejudiced the defendant, and that that prejudice was not removed by a cautionary instruction, we conclude that the admission of Peacock\u2019s testimony was plain error necessitating reversal and remand for a new trial. <em>See </em>note 32, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-13\">\n<em>Odds and Ends</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Az_C\">\n<em>Sufficiency of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aqyz\">In reviewing the record in this case, we have determined that, were the trial otherwise free of error, the evidence in at least some of the counts would have been sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty as to those counts,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> under the <em>Glasser</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and Warner<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> standards of review. As a reverse twist of the concurrent sentence doctrine <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the fact that the case has to be retried, we do not further examine the sufficiency as to each count.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Ben</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number><em>ton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>1969, 395 U.S. 784, at 791, 89 S.Ct. 2056, at 2061, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">\n<em>More Hearsay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">Defendant complains of the admission of certain evidence. In response to a request by the prosecutor, one of the count witnesses read from his prior statement, given under oath to an IRS agent: \u201cI went to Mr. Brown because everyone else I knew were [sic] going to him and they were getting big refunds.\u201d R. IV at 122. Defendant complains that this was prejudicial hearsay and violated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation and that the admission of this testimony was plain error. Under the F.R.Evid. 802 definition of hearsay, we agree with defendant\u2019s contention that this statement at least in part was hearsay.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The assertion for which the statement was offered to prove was that the defendant was getting big refunds for other people \u2014 a fact not shown by the statement to have been within the witness\u2019s knowledge. Although defendant did not object to the introduction of this testimony when it was introduced at trial, we have discussed it in the light of a new trial since standing alone this would not elevate to a reversible plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">Defendant also claims that the District Court committed plain error in admitting evidence (without objection) of the fact that defendant refused to give certain information to an IRS Special Agent during an informal, non-custodial visit by the agent.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Hale, </em>1975, 422 U.S. 171, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 and in <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>1976, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91, the Supreme Court labeled as error the prosecution\u2019s comment on defendant\u2019s <em>silence </em>during <em>custodial </em>interrogation, after defendant had been given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Hale </em>grounded its opinion in the supervisory power of the Supreme Court over the lower federal courts. <em>Doyle </em>grounded its opinion in the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Beckwith v. United States, </em>1976, 425 U.S. 341, 96 S.Ct. 1612, 48 L.Ed.2d 1, convinces us that the interrogation conducted in this case should not be considered a custodial interrogation, at least for the purpose of determining whether defendant\u2019s affirmative <em>statements </em>during a criminal tax investigation/interrogation could later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>be introduced into evidence against him. None of the three decisions, however, reveal whether it would be error, constitutional or otherwise, for a District Court to admit evidence of defendant\u2019s <em>silence </em>or express refusal to answer on Fifth Amendment grounds during a non-custodial criminal tax investigation/interrogation. An additional complicating factor is the <em>Miranda </em>-like statement given by the IRS Special Agent prior to the non-custodial interview.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In light of our disposition of this case on other grounds, we need not enter this particular legal thicket. This is especially so in the light of the impending new trial at which this marginally probative testimony with its built-in risks \u2014 constitutional, fairness, prejudice \u2014 will not likely be offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance Of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">Defendant argues that he was denied reasonably effective assistance of counsel and that his conviction should be reversed for that reason. In light of the fact that we are vacating defendant\u2019s conviction and remanding for a new trial on other and ample grounds, we need not and do not pass on this. It is evident from the quality of his performance here and on argument that his present counsel will leave no stone unturned. Indeed he will probably construct some new ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">The judgment of conviction against defendant is reversed, and the case remanded for new trial on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1296-17\">.

The testimony of the count witnesses is summarized, <em>infra, </em>at note 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">. For the sake of illustration only, we point up five of the factors which could have contributed to the overstatements: [i] the inability of the taxpayer to prove his deductions, through the fact that he lost or never had records available to support his claimed expenses, [ii] the fact that the IRS had legitimate arguable disagreements with the deductions claimed, [iii] the supplying of false or incorrect information by the taxpayer to the defendant at the time the defendant prepared the returns, [iv] the taxpayer\u2019s giving to the IRS agent information or data different from that furnished preparer either as to taxpayer or his spouse, [v] a purposeful or even inadvertent inclusion by preparer of an amount or item other than that furnished by taxpayer, spouse or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">. In order to arrive at the conclusion that the deductions in these 160 returns were overstated, Peacock needed (i) each individual tax re-oturn, showing the itemized deductions taken by \u25a0 \".each taxpayer; (ii) and some proof that those \u25a0 \u2022.deductions were materially false. Peacock got this \u201cproof\u201d of the overstatements through conversations with each of the taxpayers audited. Presumably, the proof consisted either of statements by these taxpayers to Peacock that they all gave different information to the defendant tax preparer than was put down in their returns, or that they were unable to substantiate their deductions, because they did not have supporting records. The proof could also have consisted of the fact that the IRS had legitimate arguable disagreements with all or some of the deductions claimed. However, a prerequisite to this form of proof would be the initial conversation by Peacock with each taxpayer, so that Peacock could determine the bases for the deductions taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">The point to be emphasized, therefore, is that the information obtained by Peacock from the 160 taxpayers audited, in out-of-court conversations with each, was absolutely vital to her ultimate in-court conclusion that between 90% and 95% of the 160 returns she audited contained overstated itemized deductions. Without these taxpayers\u2019 out-of-court statements to Peacock, her in-court testimony could have no basis in fact, since she would have no way of knowing that the deductions were overstated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1299-9\"><em>. </em>Circumstantial proof of intent may be made in a variety of ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-10\">By way of illustration, and not by way of limitation, we would think affirmative willful attempt may be inferred from conduct such as keeping a double set of books, making false entries or alterations, or false invoices or documents, destruction of books or records, concealment of assets or covering up sources of income, handling of one\u2019s affairs to avoid making the records usual in transactions of the kind, and any conduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal.

Lipscomb, </em>5 Cir., 435 F.2d 795, 802:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-9\">Business records are admissible in federal court as evidence of a transaction or occurrence if made in the regular course of business and if it was the regular course of business to make such records within a reasonable time of the transaction or occurrence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732(a). The purpose of the federal Business Records Act is to dispense with the necessity of proving each and every book entry by the person actually making it. The theory underlying the Act is that business records in the form regularly kept by the particular company and relied on by that company in the ordinary course of its business have a certain probability of trustworthiness. <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville RR Co. v. Knox Homes Corp., </em>5 Cir. 1965, 343 F.2d 887, 896; <em>Central R. Co. of New Jersey v. Jules S. Sottnek Co., 2 </em>Cir. 1958, 258 F.2d 85, 88. Therefore, \u201cso long as regard is paid to the indispensable fundamental trustworthiness of the proffered record, the statute \u2018 * * * should of course be liberally interpreted so as to do away with the anachronistic rules which gave rise to its need and at which it was aimed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Missouri Pacific RR Co. v. Austin, </em>5 Cir. 1961, 292 F.2d 415, 422. Of course, not all records may be admissible in all cases in a criminal trial; it is the duty of the court to determine in each instance whether the particular record is constitutionally admissible under the Sixth Amendment guarantee of confrontation of witnesses. <em>McDaniel v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1965, 343 F.2d 785.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1305-13\">This analysis was explicitly adopted by this Court in <em>United States v.

Morales, </em>477 F.2d 1309 (5th Cir. 1973). The record before us reveals that the government originally had no intention to call Agent Peacock as a witness or to introduce evidence of erroneous tax returns other than the 17 contained in the indictment. Defense counsel, however, inadvertently opened the door to the challenged evidence by eliciting on cross-examination of IRS Agent Barnett the information that 163 returns prepared by appellant had been audited. As the trial court recognized, this evidence of 163 audited returns \u2014 without explanation of the audit results \u2014 could give rise to the inference and defense argument that out of more than 160 returns prepared by appellant Brown only 17 had contained innocent \u201cerrors\u201d of overstated deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-13\">Defense counsel suggested that the court could \u201cre-bag the cat\u201d let loose by his cross-examination of Agent Barnett by granting an unopposed government motion to strike the testimony concerning the 163 audited returns. The trial judge recognized the futility of instructing the jury to disregard this damaging evidence; and he accepted instead the government\u2019s suggestion, <em>without any objection from appellant, </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>IRS auditor be questioned to determine what percentage of the 163 returns had actually been found to contain overstated deductions. Agent Adrienne Peacock, learning only an hour or two before she was called to the stand that she would testify, had no chance to obtain and review the relevant tax returns. Testifying from her best recollection, Peacock related that she had personally audited all but two or three of the 163 returns prepared by appellant Brown and reviewed by the IRS. Of those returns that she audited, between 90 and 95 percent had contained substantially overstated itemized deductions. As a result of disallowed deductions the IRS had assessed additional taxes totalling $50,856, an average of $312 per taxpayer. At the close of Peacock\u2019s testimony the court instructed the jury to consider it only on the issue of appellant\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">Testifying in his own defense, appellant Brown denied that he had knowingly or willfully prepared any false returns. He did not, however, deny that he had prepared tax returns for others or that many of those tax returns had contained overstated deductions ultimately disallowed by IRS. And neither he nor any other witness challenged the accuracy of Agent Peacock\u2019s testimony concerning the number of audited returns Brown had prepared or the approximate percentage of those returns found to contain overstated, disallowed deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">The majority declares, however, that Peacock\u2019s testimony concerning unindicted tax returns was inadmissible for two reasons: (1) her testimony constituted hearsay, and (2) it failed to meet the requirements of Federal Evidence Rules 403 and 404(b) as \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts ..\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, in spite of the government\u2019s need for the evidence, its clear relevance to establishing appellant\u2019s intent, and the judge\u2019s instruction limiting its admissibility to the intent issue, the majority holds that admitting Peacock\u2019s evidence was a plain error so adversely affecting appellant\u2019s substantial rights that reversal is required even absent a timely objection \u2014 or even an untimely one \u2014 by defendant in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">Because I disagree that Peacock\u2019s testimony constituted hearsay or that it so violated standards of admissibility for other-offense evidence as to amount to plain error, I cannot join in reversing appellant\u2019s conviction on the grounds enunciated by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-12\">\n<em>Hearsay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-13\">The majority\u2019s characterization of Agent Peacock\u2019s testimony as \u201chearsay\u201d represents an unprecedented departure from usual hearsay concepts. F.R.Evid. 801 defines hearsay as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Agent Peacock\u2019s statements at trial were (1) that she personally audited all but two or three of the 163 tax returns prepared by appellant and audited by IRS, and (2) that her audit had determined that 90 to 95 percent of those returns contained overstated itemized deductions disallowed under IRS standards. Agent Peacock obviously testified from her own personal knowledge about the results of tax audits she conducted. In her testimony she neither related nor relied upon out-of-court statements by other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-15\">It is too plain for argument that Peacock\u2019s testimony as to what she knew herself from the returns she individually audited does not fall within Rule 801\u2019s hearsay definition. An examination of the record reveals that <em>all </em>of Peacock\u2019s testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>based on knowledge she personally acquired while auditing the tax returns prepared by Brown. In fact, the majority points to no <em>statement </em>whatever by Agent Peacock which it claims contains hearsay; she mentioned no statements others had made to her during the course of her audit. The majority objects, however, that Agent Peacock\u2019s audit necessarily rested on \u201c \u2018proof\u2019 of the overstatements through conversations with each of the taxpayers audited.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since her testimony had to have been based directly on the out-of-court statements of these taxpayers who could not be cross-examined, it is said that \u201ca clearer case of hearsay testimony would be difficult to imagine.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I find little difficulty in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">In the first place, the taxpayer statements made to Agent Peacock probably were <em>themselves </em>admissible in evidence. A taxpayer declares to a revenue agent that his deductions are overstated (and his tax should therefore be higher). Probably most would agree that this is a declaration against the taxpayer\u2019s interest. As such, it is, if the declarant be \u201cunavailable,\u201d admissible under Federal Evidence Rule 804(b)(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-5\">Statement against interest. A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject him to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by him against another, that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">And in the circumstances of this case, the 150 taxpayer declarants were likely \u201cunavailable,\u201d in any practical sense, within the intendment of Rule 804(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-9\">In the second place, Agent Peacock\u2019s testimony was that of an auditor, an expert in her line of work. If the majority opinion be right, here is an end of such expert testimony by auditors, accountants and similar professionals as to the results of audits, ascertainments of financial conditions, etc. But it is not, for Federal Evidence Rule 703 explicitly treats the matter of opinions based on inadmissible data:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-10\">The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to him at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-11\">And the Advisory Committee\u2019s Note makes plain that Agent Peacock\u2019s testimony is the type which the Rule contemplates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-12\">Facts or data upon which expert opinions are based may, under the rule, be derived from three possible sources. The first is the firsthand observation of the witness, with opinions based thereon traditionally allowed. A treating physician affords an example. . . . The third source contemplated by the rule consists of presentation of data to the expert outside of court and other than by his own perception. In this respect the rule is designed to broaden the basis for expert opinions beyond that current in many jurisdictions and to bring the judicial practice into line with the practice of the experts themselves when not in court. Thus a physician in his own practice bases his diagnosis on information from numerous sources and of considerable variety, including statements by patients and rel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>atives, reports and opinions from nurses, technicians and other doctors, hospital records, and X rays. Most of them are admissible in evidence, but only with the expenditure of substantial time in producing and examining various authenticating witnesses. The physician makes life-and-death decisions in reliance upon them. His validation, expertly performed and subject to cross-examination, ought to suffice for judicial purposes. Rheingold, <em>supra, </em>at 531; McCormick \u00a7 15. A similar provision is California Evidence Code \u00a7 801(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-4\">Writing as though Rule 703 did not exist, the majority today fashions a new category of inadmissible evidence: <em>implied </em>hearsay. I can find no justification for this new creation in either policy or precedent and thus dissent from the finding that Agent Peacock\u2019s testimony constituted hearsay inadmissible at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">\n<em>Broadway and the Rules</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">As an alternative ground for excluding Agent Peacock\u2019s testimony, the majority purports to rely on the new rules of evidence and on this court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Broadway, supra, </em>that proof of other offenses, to be admitted at trial, must be \u201cplain, clear, and conclusive.\u201d In fact, however, the reasoning executes a simple circle: to be admissible as \u201cevidence\u201d of other crimes, wrongs and acts, matter must first be \u201cevidence\u201d; hearsay is not \u201cevidence\u201d; <em>ergo, </em>since Agent Peacock\u2019s testimony is not evidence, it is not evidence of other crimes, etc. Thus, <em>Broadway </em>and the rules are dragged in by the heels; one might as well have said that since courts hear only evidence, and this is not evidence, it will not be heard. As I think the rules have displaced <em>Broadway </em>entirely and that under them the matter is admissible, I take respectful leave briefly to say why.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">Rules 403 and 404(b) deal with the admissibility of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence and the exclusion of otherwise relevant and admissible evidence to avoid undue prejudice. F.R.Evid. 403 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-9\">Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-10\">F.R.Evid. 404(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-11\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-12\">The legislative history of Rule 404(b)\u2019s treatment of other-offense evidence clearly reveals a congressional preference for admitting evidence of other acts, crimes, or wrongs when relevant for one of the listed purposes. In explaining a change in wording for Rule 404(b), the Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-13\">The second sentence of Rule 404(b) as submitted to the Congress began with the words \u201cThis subdivision does not exclude the evidence when offered.\u201d The Committee amended this language to read \u201cIt may, however, be admissible\u201d, the words used in the 1971 Advisory Committee draft, on the ground that this formulation <em>properly placed greater emphasis on admissibility </em>than did the final Court version.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-14\">1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 7075-7081 (emphasis added). The Report of the Senate Committee expresses the view that Rule 404(b) carefully circumscribes the judge\u2019s discretion to <em>exclude </em>relevant other-crimes evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-15\">Although your committee see no necessity in amending the rule itself, it anticipates that the use of the discretionary word \u201cmay\u201d with respect to the admissibility of evidence of crimes, wrongs, or acts is not intended to confer any arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>trary discretion on the trial judges. Rather, it is anticipated that with respect to permissible uses for such evidence, the trial judge may exclude it <em>only </em>on the basis of those considerations set forth in Rule 403, i. e. prejudice, confusion or waste of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 7051, 7071 (emphasis added). Thus, <em>Broadway\u2019s </em>hostility toward admission of such evidence is \u2014 or is supposed to be \u2014 replaced by Congress\u2019 hospitality and receptive view toward it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">The Advisory Committee Note to Rule 404(b) leaves no doubt that the admissibility of other-offense evidence should be determined by reference to Rule 403\u2019s balancing test of prejudice against probativeness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-6\">No mechanical solution is offered. The determination must be made whether the danger of undue prejudice outweighs the probative value of the evidence in view of the availability of other means of proof and other facts appropriate for making decisions of this kind under Rule 403.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">And the language of Rule 403 itself requires tilting the scales in favor of admissibility, sanctioning exclusion only when probativeness is <em>substantially </em>outweighed by prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">Agent Peacock\u2019s testimony that she had found overstated deductions in 90 to 95 percent of the 163 tax returns prepared by appellant was clearly admissible under Rule 404(b) as tending to show appellant\u2019s willful intent and the absence of mistake or accident in his preparation of the indicted returns.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Relevant and admissible under Rule 404(b), the evidence could properly be excluded under Rule 403 only if the trial judge found that \u201cits probative value is <em>substantially </em>outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Even if appellant Brown had objected below to admission of Peacock\u2019s testimony, I would be reluctant to find that the trial judge abused the discretion given him in Rule 403 by finding that the probative value of the Peacock evidence was <em>not </em>substantially outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">Agent Peacock\u2019s evidence was both necessary and highly probative on the crucial disputed issue of appellant\u2019s intent. Her unchallenged testimony that 90 to 95 percent of the more than 160 returns prepared by appellant Brown contained overstated deductions certainly tended to rebut Brown\u2019s defense that he had not intentionally inflated deductions, implying instead that overstatements resulted from mistakes or erroneous information from taxpayers. The government\u2019s acute need for Peacock\u2019s testimony was created entirely by defense counsel when he brought out on cross-examination of a government witness the audit of 163 returns appellant had prepared. Peacock\u2019s explanation of the audit results thus abruptly became necessary to forestall the defense argument that only 17 of 163 returns contained mistakes of overstated deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-11\">The dangers of unfair prejudice to defendant from Peacock\u2019s testimony are minimal. Proof that appellant on other occasions prepared income tax returns with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>overstated deductions is not the type of other-crimes evidence that appeals unduly to the emotions and prejudice of a jury, as would evidence of more opprobrious \u201cother crimes\u201d such as drug trafficking or armed robbery. As noted by the majority, the simple overstatement of allowable deductions on a tax return may occur in several quite innocent ways: misinformation from the taxpayer, an honest dispute with IRS, mistake, or a paucity of records to substantiate the deductions. The degree and possibility of undue prejudice from Peacock\u2019s testimony is thus lessened considerably by the numerous innocent explanations for overstated deductions. Applying Rule 403\u2019s balancing test to the particular facts of this case, I simply cannot conclude that the necessity and probative value of Peacock\u2019s evidence was substantially outweighed by the possibility of unfair prejudice to defendant so as to make admission of her testimony an error \u2014 much less a plain error requiring reversal even without timely objection below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\">Even assuming, as I do not believe, that <em>United States v. Broadway\u2019s </em>\u201cplain, clear, and conclusive\u201d standard retains some vitality as a kind of pre-existing judicial gloss on Rules 403 and 404(b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I am unable to agree with the majority that the Peacock testimony falls so short of the <em>Broadway </em>standard as to make its admission plain error. An examination of the purpose and application of the <em>Broadway </em>rule reveals that it is not designed to exclude credible and undisputed evidence of other similar acts like that given by Agent Peacock in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">The <em>Broadway </em>court, fearful of the possibility of prejudice inherent in allegations that defendant had committed other offenses similar to those charged, established the rule in this circuit that the government could not merely intimate that defendant had committed other similar crimes. Evidence tending to show similar offenses would be excluded unless the government could clearly prove that defendant had committed acts similar to those charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-8\">Our holding is simply that when proof of an assertedly similar offense is tendered to establish necessary intent, the other offense proved must include the essential physical elements of the offense charged, and these physical elements, but not the mental ingredients of the offenses must be clearly shown by competent evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A72\">477 F.2d at 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">The essential physical elements of the offense charged in the instant case are established by showing (1) that Brown assisted in the preparation or presentation of tax returns and (2) that those returns were false as to a material matter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These are exactly the physical elements proved by Agent Peacock\u2019s undisputed testimony: (1) appellant Brown had assisted in the preparation and presentation to IRS of more than 160 tax returns; and (2) 90 to 95 percent of those returns audited by Agent Peacock were determined to be false as to the material matter of allowable deductions. Moreover, I can find nothing in the case law of this circuit to support the majority\u2019s use of <em>Broadway </em>to screen out the kind of evidence Peacock gave. The <em>Broadway </em>opinion itself gives little guidance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>how to apply its \u201cplain, clear and conclusive\u201d standard, because the reversal in <em>Broadway </em>turned on the lack of sufficient <em>similarity </em>between the offense charged and the other acts alleged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> One of the Eighth Circuit cases cited with approval in <em>Broadway, </em>however, sheds some light on the type of other-offense evidence which, under its superceded test, should be excluded as too vague and uncertain. In <em>Kraft v. United States, </em>238 F.2d 794 (8th Cir. 1956), defendant was charged with a scheme to defraud by inducing persons to send him money in anticipation of receiving \u201crare geraniums\u201d as advertised in several newspapers. Kraft defended against the charge by denying that he had possessed the requisite criminal intent to defraud. To help show his fraudulent intentions the government introduced \u2014 and the court admitted over defendant\u2019s objection \u2014 39 letters sent in 1950 from the Minneapolis <em>Tribune </em>to defendant when he had been operating a mail-order tulip venture. The letters intimated that defendant had been dilatory in making refunds or delivering bulbs as advertised in the <em>Tribune. </em>The Eighth Circuit ruled that the letters should have been excluded because they constituted \u201cmere accusations of some other offense,\u201d rather than the kind of \u201cplain, clear, and conclusive\u201d proof requisite for admission of other-offense evidence. 238 F.2d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">Since announcing the <em>Broadway </em>proof standard for other-crimes evidence, this court has only once found challenged evidence to be insufficiently \u201cplain, clear, and convincing.\u201d In <em>United States v. Vosper </em>493 F.2d 433 (5th Cir. 1974), defendant was charged with participating in a bank robbery, which had actually been carried out by another man, Blanton Lynn. To help establish a relationship between Vosper and Lynn, an FBI agent testified that he had seen the two together approximately five weeks before the robbery when he had them under surveillance for <em>suspicion </em>of other robberies. Not surprisingly, the <em>Vosper </em>court held that, if offered to prove similar crimes, the agent\u2019s reference to other robberies was deficient under <em>Broadway\u2019s </em>\u201cplain, clear, and conclusive\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\"><em>Kraft </em>and <em>Vosper </em>contain classic illustrations of the type of unreliable, unsubstantiated intimations or accusations of other crimes that the <em>Broadway </em>rule was designed to exclude. The five-year-old complaint letters in <em>Kraft </em>and the reference to \u201csuspicion\u201d of other robberies in <em>Vosper </em>carried little probative weight, yet injected into the defendants\u2019 trials the highly prejudicial implication of previous similar criminal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">Recent cases in this circuit in which challenged other-offense evidence was admitted despite the <em>Broadway </em>test consult the reliability of the evidence and the certainty that other similar acts have, in fact, been committed by defendant. For example, in <em>United States v. Pollard, </em>509 F.2d 601 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1013, 95 S.Ct. 2419, 44 L.Ed.2d 681 (1976), defendant was charged with robbing an Atlanta bank by \u201ctill tapping.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An FBI agent testified that Pollard said that he had also participated in five or six California larcenies in October and November of 1973 (subsequent to the Atlanta robbery) using the same till tapping technique. The trial judge carefully instructed the jury to consider this testimony only on the issue of defendant\u2019s guilty knowledge or intent. This evidence given by the FBI agent that defendant had participated in \u201cfive or six\u201d California robberies in \u201cOctober and November of 1973\u201d lacked details of the crimes such as the names of the victimized banks, the dates of each robbery, and the exact amounts stolen. Nevertheless, the <em>Pollard </em>court in an opinion by Judge Simpson, who also authored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>the <em>Broadway </em>opinion, found the agent\u2019s testimony to meet all requisites for admission of other-offense evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-4\">In <em>United States v. Bloom, </em>538 F.2d 704 (5th Cir. 1976), defendant was charged with possessing with intent to distribute and with distributing heroin. Over defense objections to evidence of uncharged drug trafficking, government undercover agents testifying about their dealings with defendant indicated that their discussions with defendant had involved cocaine as well as heroin, that defendant had also been engaged in procuring and marketing marijuana, and that defendant had had considerable prior experience in procuring Mexican heroin for prospective buyers. The panel, in an opinion by Judge Ainsworth, specifically held that the undercover agents\u2019 \u201cextrinsic evidence of heroin, cocaine and marijuana dealings was \u2018plain, clear, and convincing.\u2019 \u201d 538 F.2d at 709.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the court\u2019s conclusion that the other-offense evidence met the <em>Broadway </em>standard must have turned upon the credibility of the witnesses, the reliability of the source of their testimony (i. e., the defendant himself), and the clear and convincing nature of their testimony about their dealings with defendant, in which he had revealed his involvement with other drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">The testimony of IRS Agent Peacock in the instant case was at least as detailed as the evidence in <em>Pollard </em>and was far more specific than the testimony in <em>Bloom. </em>Her evidence of tax audit results, undisputed and unimpeached by defendant, clearly established that a number of materially false tax returns had been presented to IRS and that defendant had assisted in the preparation of those returns.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In light of the purpose of the <em>Broadway </em>rule and its previous application by this court, I would hold, if required to do so, that Peacock\u2019s testimony was sufficiently \u201cplain, clear, and conclusive\u201d to be properly admissible at appellant\u2019s trial under the <em>Broadway </em>standard, as well as under the Federal Rules of Evidence balancing test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-10\">\n<em>Plain Error?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-11\">Whether an error rises to the magnitude of plain error, justifying reversal even absent a timely trial objection, calls for subjective judgments on questions of fairness and prejudice which inherently involve considerable latitude for defensible differences of judicial opinion. I have already registered my strong disagreement with my brothers\u2019 conclusion that the error, if any, in admitting Peacock\u2019s testimony was \u201cobvious and manifest\u201d and \u201cseverely prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To further belabor my arguments on these points would profit little. However, beyond my disagreement with the grounds and significance of the errors discovered by the majority, I am gravely disturbed by the application of the plain error rule to the particular facts of this case. A consideration of the practical ramifications of the holding will, I think, illustrate the grounds for my concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-12\">Even the majority\u2019s opinion leaves no doubt that the government may properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>introduce, on the disputed issue of appellant\u2019s intent, evidence of other unindicted tax returns prepared by him which also contain overstated deductions. Apparently, both the hearsay and <em>Broadway </em>defects in Peacock\u2019s testimony could have been cured to the majority\u2019s satisfaction by introducing the unindicted tax returns and by calling each of the 145 taxpayers involved to testify about the amounts of overstated deductions and the reasons for disallowance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is difficult for me to believe that defendant\u2019s case would have been less damaged by the suggested introduction and explanation one by one of more than 145 erroneous tax returns prepared by appellant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although the majority claims to find no evidence of intentional \u201csandbagging\u201d in this case, it seems quite reasonable to me that defense counsel \u2014 if alerted by the court to possible hearsay or <em>Broadway </em>objections \u2014 would probably have chosen to accept the summary of admissible proof given by Agent Peacock, rather than insisting upon the introduction and explication of 145 individual vignettes of damning evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">In cases such as this where defendant\u2019s commission of similar acts is essentially undisputed and easily provable in detail by the government, the accused may understandably wish to <em>avoid, </em>rather than to encourage, the introduction of \u201cplain, clear, and conclusive\u201d proof of the details of all his other \u201ccrimes.\u201d We must bear in mind that <em>Broadway </em>was intended as a shield to protect defendants from vague and unsubstantiated accusations of other offenses. If a defendant chooses (or even neglects) to invoke the shield\u2019s protection at trial, he should not then be allowed to use the <em>Broadway </em>rule as an appellate sword to extract from this court reversal of his conviction for noncompliance with an evidentiary standard he will no doubt decline to enforce on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-8\">For example, if the government in a new trial of appellant attempts to introduce detailed testimony on more than 145 erroneous tax returns, a wise defense counsel will likely interpose an objection to the cumulative and time-consuming nature of the evidence and simply offer to stipulate the number of tax returns prepared by appellant which contained overstated deductions. Thus, if defendant\u2019s objection is sustained, the government\u2019s other-offense evidence at retrial would probably be that appellant Brown prepared 163 tax returns audited by IRS, and 146 of those returns contained substantially overstated deductions. Requiring a retrial of the entire cause in order to obtain such a slight transmogrification in the government\u2019s other-crimes evidence seems a patently unproductive use of judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-9\">Furthermore, this is not a case in which the <em>substance of </em>the government\u2019s chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>lenged evidence was wholly inadmissible under any circumstances. When a defendant\u2019s conviction seems to have been substantially affected by such clearly inappropriate evidence, the plain error rule exists to rescue him from the unfair conviction even absent a proper trial objection. In the instant case, however, the subject and substance of the government\u2019s other-offense evidence was properly admissible on the issue of appellant Brown\u2019s intent; the majority objects only to the <em>form </em>which the evidence took, specifically, its alleged hearsay character. The plain error rule was simply not designed to reverse otherwise proper convictions for mere technical evidentiary defects when no objection to the defects was raised below. A successful objection at trial would not have protected the instant defendant from admission of the highly probative other-offense evidence offered by Agent Peacock; it would have simply required the government to alter slightly its manner of proof. Thus, it is difficult to understand how this easily correctible defect in the form of admissible proof could have so prejudiced defendant as to make his conviction unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-4\">Because the admission of Peacock\u2019s testimony in the form she gave it, if error, was not a plain error substantially prejudicing defendant or leading to his conviction on wholly improper evidence, and because the majority\u2019s rulings in this appeal are unlikely to alter significantly either the conduct or the outcome of another trial, I find application of the plain error rule disturbingly inappropriate to the facts of this case. Thus, I vigorously dissent from the reversal of appellant\u2019s conviction on the ground that 1 admission of the Peacock evidence constituted a plain error.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1311-16\">.

These cases undoubtedly will continue to serve as valuable guides to the factors to be considered in weighing probativeness against prejudice. However, no single factor can be determinative of admissibility; Rule 403 makes clear that all factors are to be thrown into the scales to assist in the decisive test of whether unfair prejudice substantially outweighs probativeness. In fact many recent pre-Rules cases\u2014 though considering particular admissibility criteria for other-offense evidence, such as remoteness in time, need for evidence, and the <em>Broadway </em>rule \u2014 applied a balancing test similar to Rule 403\u2019s to determine admissibility. <em>E. g., United States v.

Majority opinion at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-13\">One of the reasons that the majority gives for finding Peacock\u2019s testimony \u201cseverely prejudicial\u201d is the alleged weakness of other evidence to show appellant\u2019s guilty intent. The majority intimates that the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilty intentions was so weak that he probably would not have been convicted without the testimony of Agent Peacock. On the contrary, the indicted returns themselves established a clear pattern of substantially overstated deductions for medical insurance premiums, interest payments, and church contributions, as well as several instances of apparently purely fabricated casualty losses. <em>See </em>summary of count witnesses\u2019 testimony in note 17 of majority opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>ion. Even more damaging count witnesses for six of the twelve counts on which defendant was convicted testified to particular instances in which they had given defendant specific amounts for deductible expenses which were substantially less than the amounts defendant had recorded on their tax returns. See summary of count witnesses\u2019 testimony under Counts 3, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 15 in note 17 of majority opinion. One of these witnesses (Edward A. Leeks, Count 9) had given defendant a sheet of paper listing the amounts of particular expenses, while another witness (Robert A. Sims, Count 15) had given defendant the receipts for his mortgage interest payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-6\">The consistent pattern of overstatement coupled with direct taxpayer testimony that defendant had entered deductions considerably in excess of the specific amounts given him constitutes, to my mind at least, fairly persuasive and convincing proof of Brown\u2019s guilty intent even absent the Peacock testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1318-11\">. The majority emphasizes the importance of knowing the IRS \u201creason\u201d for disallowance of deductions. As a practical matter, the reason for disallowance will usually be that the taxpayer was simply unable to substantiate the claimed deductions with adequate records. Thus, the reason for disallowance will generally have little probative worth in determining the \u201creason for overstatement,\u201d which is the relevant inquiry in determining appellant\u2019s intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1318-12\">.

I would not, however, deny appellant Brown all relief. His motion for new trial, supported with affidavits, raised serious allegations of jury misconduct. Specifically, he claimed that one of the principal prosecution witnesses had engaged during the trial in a private conversation with one of the jurors (to whom the witness was related by marriage) and that one of the jurors had been subjected to improper pressures to reach a verdict during the deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-22\">The court below failed to conduct a \u201cfull investigation\u201d into the alleged misconduct and its effect as required by <em>United States v.
