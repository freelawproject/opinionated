In 1971 he married an American citizen, whereupon he applied for and received adjustment of status to that of \u201cpermanent resident alien.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 14, 1974, in rescission proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1256<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an immigration judge determined that Bachelier\u2019s marriage was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>\u201ca sham, that he was not entitled to immediate relative status by reason of his marriage\u201d and accordingly the judge rescinded Bachelier\u2019s status as a permanent resident alien. Bachelier\u2019s appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals was dismissed on May 12, 1975. His motion to reopen the section 1256 proceedings on the basis of newly acquired evidence was denied on September 3, 1976;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is from the denial of this motion that Bachelier seeks direct review in the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">The Hobbs Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides for direct review in the court of appeals of certain final administrative actions. The Immigration and Nationality Act adopts this direct review procedure and applies it to \u201cfinal orders of deportation\u201d promulgated pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has held that in immigration matters direct review in the court of appeals is limited to final deportation orders under section 1252(b). <em>Cheng Fan Kwok v. INS, </em>392 U.S. 206, 216, 88 S.Ct. 1970, 1976, 20 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1968).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bachelier concedes that the status rescission of which he seeks direct review was made under section 1256 which pertains to rescission of adjustment of status, and not under section 1252(b) relative to deportability of an alien. He argues, however, that a rescission order \u201cis of necessity the first step in [deportation] proceedings and, therefore, Petitioner maintains that the proceeding is in the nature of a deportation proceeding.\u201d Even if rescission proceedings are \u201cin the nature\u201d of deportation proceedings they are not \u201cfinal orders of deportation\u201d as specified by the statute providing for direct review and by the Supreme Court. We hold, therefore, that direct review in the court of appeals is inappropriate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-12\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1257-14\">. The record indicates that this adjustment was pursuant to section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151, which exempts \u201cimmediate relatives of United States citizens\u201d from yearly numerical limits on aliens admitted to the United States for permanent residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1257-15\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1256, entitled \u201cRescission of adjustment of status; report to Congress; effect upon naturalized citizen\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-16\">If, at any time within five years after the status of a person has been otherwise adjusted under the provisions of section 1255 or 1259 of this title or any other provision of law to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the person was not in fact eligible for such adjustment of status, the Attorney General shall rescind the action taken granting an adjustment of status to such person and cancelling deportation in the case of such person if that occurred and the person shall thereupon be subject to all provisions of this chapter to the same extent as if the adjustment of status had not been made.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">. In denying Bachelier\u2019s motion to reopen the Chairman of the Board of Immigration Appeals wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-6\">The respondent\u2019s personal affidavit, as well as an undated and unsworn, statement submitted by his now estranged wife, do not constitute the evidentiary material contemplated and required by 8 C.F.R. 103.5 and 242.22. It appears that the respondent, now undergoing deportation proceedings, is attempting to engage in piecemeal litigation. Accordingly, the motion to reopen must be denied.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">. 64 Stat. 1129, 68 Stat. 961, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2341-2350, 2352, formerly 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1031-1042.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1258-8\">.
