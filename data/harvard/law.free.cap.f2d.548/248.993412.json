The Commission found Bechtel responsible for the exposure of its employees to five non-serious violations of \u00a7 5(a)(2) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, (OSHA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2), on a construction site at Crystal City, Missouri, where Bechtel was the construction manager for the building of a power plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">On its petition for review Bechtel contends that it is not subject to the construction standards of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1926 <em>et seq. </em>since its employees were not performing the actual work of construction and therefore were not \u201cengaged in construction work\u201d within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.-12(a). Under its contract with the owner Union Electric, Bechtel was responsible for the administration and coordination of all phases of the construction including the safety program. In fulfilling these responsibilities Bechtel\u2019s employees worked in a managerial or supervisory capacity and did not perform the actual ^ work of construction. The Commission held that since Bechtel\u2019s functions as construction manager were \u201can integral part of the total construction,\u201d it was \u201cengaged in construction work\u201d within the meaning of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Bechtel contends that this result is contrary to the definitions of \u201cemployer\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d applicable to the construction standards. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1926.32(a), (i) and (j). The Commission held that the Secretary of Labor\u2019s adoption of the construction standards prescribed in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1926 <em>et seq. </em>as the OSHA standards did not include the definitional sections relied on by Bechtel. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1910.11(b) and 1910.-12(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">In seeking reversal of the Commission\u2019s decision Bechtel further relies upon the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Anning-Johnson Co. v. OSHRC, </em>516 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1975). In <em>Anning-Johnson </em>the court held that subcontractors on a multi-employer construction site were not liable for the exposure of their employees to non-serious violations which the subcontractors \u201cneither created nor were responsible for pursuant to their contractual duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1082. The Commission factually distinguished <em>Anning-Johnson </em>by noting that Bechtel, unlike a subcontractor, was contractually responsible for the construction site\u2019s safety program and thus possessed the power to protect its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">We find the Commission\u2019s application of the Occupational Safety and Health Act correct and its holding otherwise supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. We sustain the Commission\u2019s decision on the basis of its written opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
