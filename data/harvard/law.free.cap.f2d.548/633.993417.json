The sole issue on appeal is whether such deduction is allowable under Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 213. With laudatory motivation, rather than submit their handicapped child to institutional training, they endeavored to have his education proceed under as nearly normal circumstances as possible, and to that end enrolled him in private schools which had smaller classes and more individual attention than in the public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Under Treas.Reg. l-213(e)(v)(b), the cost of a \u201cspecial school . . . designed to compensate for or overcome a physical handicap, in order to qualify the individual for future normal education or for normal living such as a school for the teaching of braille or lipreading\u201d could form the basis of a deduction. However, in the present case the tax court judge has found as a matter of fact that appellants\u2019 son did not receive any special training, such as lipreading, intended to in any way compensate or afford a judgment for his handicap and that the medical training which he did receive in this regard from a therapist and from audiological evaluations and hearing aid management training were provided outside of the school environment. She further found that in school the child followed the same academic curriculum as other students in his class and grade, and received no special medical services in addition to those customarily provided on an emergency basis to all students.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">The record provides no basis for regarding these findings as \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d See <em>Commissioner v. Duberstein, </em>363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960). It must therefore <em>be </em>concluded that appellants have failed to show, as they must to prevail, that any educational program at the schools attended was only incidental to a primary medical care function of mitigating and treating their child\u2019s physical handicap. <em>Greisdorf v. Commissioner, </em>54 T.C. 1684, 1689 (1970); <em>Ripple v. Commissioner, </em>54 T.C. 1442, 1447 (1970); <em>Grunwald v. Commissioner, </em>51 T.C. 108, 112-116 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">For the reasons herein set forth, and for the reasons contained in the opinion of Tax Judge Irene F. Scott, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
