Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b690-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">The petitioner alleges he has been denied his constitutional rights in that (1(a)) the grand jury that indicted him and (1(b)) pet-it jury that convicted him were illegally constituted on the basis of race; (2) his trial attorney was incompetent; (3) he was tried with an individual he had never met.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">These allegations arise out of petitioner\u2019s trial and conviction for armed robbery, indictment No. 6-10108 on April 28, 1969, on which petitioner was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. On .September 24, 1969, the petitioner was sentenced to 15 years for another armed robbery on indictment No. 6-10084, which sentence runs concurrently with the prior sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">The petitioner\u2019s claims \u2014 (1(a)), (2), and (3) \u2014 relate only to his conviction on indictment No. 6-10108. Relief, if warranted, would only affect the petitioner\u2019s conviction under that indictment, and would not affect petitioner\u2019s sentence under indictment No. 6-10084, which runs concurrently with No. 6-10108. Petitioner has shown no specific detriment from No. 6-10108, and we pretermit discussion of issues (1(a)), (2), and (3) by virtue of the concurrent sentence doctrine. <em>U. S. v. Barsaloux, </em>5 Cir. 1969, 419 F.2d 1299; <em>Rogers v. Wainwright, </em>5 Cir. 1968, 394 F.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">Petitioner\u2019s only claim that escapes the pale of the concurrent sentence doctrine is his allegation that the grand jury that indicted him was illegally constituted. Since the same grand jury returned No. 6-10108 and No. 6-10084, it is judicially noted that a finding favorable to the petitioner on this allegation would upset both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-16\">The petitioner baldly avers that Blacks were unconstitutionally excluded from the grand jury that returned the indictment. In the state habeas proceeding petitioner did not establish a prima facie case of an unconstitutionally composed grand jury. Without benefit of a prima facie case, petitioner\u2019s allegation does not warrant habeas relief. See <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>5 Cir. 1970, 434 F.2d 1029, cert. denied 403 U.S. 932, 91 S.Ct. 2261, 29 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-17\">Furthermore, even assuming that petitioner was indicted by a grand jury unconstitutionally composed, habeas relief is not merited.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-18\">Georgia law requires that challenges to grand jury compositions be urged at the earliest available opportunity. <em>Blevins v. State, </em>220 Ga. 720, 141 S.E.2d 426 (1965). Failure to timely challenge the composition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>of a grand jury waives the right to attack the composition collaterally, unless the petitioner can show <em>cause </em>why he did not urge this point and unless the composition produced actual <em>prejudice </em>to his case. <em>Francis v. Henderson, </em>425 U.S. 536, 96 S.Ct. 1708, 48 L.Ed.2d 149 (1976); <em>Smith v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 531 F.2d 260. Petitioner has neither shown cause nor prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court denying relief is</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
