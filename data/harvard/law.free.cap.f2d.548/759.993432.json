The charge arose out of Austin\u2019s attempt to take the exam on behalf of another. He was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment and fined $500.00. Execution of the prison sentence was suspended and Austin was placed on probation for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The sole contention asserted on appeal is that Austin was denied a fair trial by the following portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-6\">* * * He calls Mrs. Webb a liar saying that he pointed to Leeaster Sullivan\u2019s name. He calls Mrs. Sharp a liar when he says that he didn\u2019t tell her his name was Sullivan. And he calls Mr. Field a liar because he said he didn\u2019t go up and say, \u201cYou\u2019re a dead honky.\u201d And he lies to you under oath which, if you will read the statement which was introduced, where it says, \u201cPersonally appeared who first being duly sworn, <em>ft</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-9\">And he is calling all these witnesses liars and would like for you to\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Austin contends that that argument was improper in that he never testified that the witnesses referred to above were lying. Defense counsel objected to the statement at the time it was made, and the court admonished the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-11\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the argument of counsel is not evidence. They are permitted to draw such inferences as they believe the evidence reflects. But, certainly, you are the judges of the fact and you are the ones to remember what the true testimony was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALSH\">Austin contends, however, that the court should have reprimanded the prosecutor and admonished the jury to entirely disregard the argument. The government argues that the statement was a permissible comment on the inferences to be drawn from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">We need not decide the extent to which the prosecutor\u2019s remark was supported by the evidence, for we find that in any case, Austin was not denied a fair trial. The record discloses overwhelming evidence of Austin\u2019s guilt, and the trial court properly admonished the jury as to the weight to be accorded the prosecutor\u2019s argument. Accordingly, the challenged comment affords no basis for reversal. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>547 F.2d 1030 (8th Cir., 1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Matousek, </em>483 F.2d 286, 288 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>Isaacs v. United States, </em>301 F.2d 706, 737 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>371 U.S. 818, 83 S.Ct. 32, 9 L.Ed.2d 58 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
