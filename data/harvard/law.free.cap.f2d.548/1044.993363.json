The ALJ concluded from the extensive evidence introduced during two days of hearings, and from his observations of the various witnesses, that petitioner in fact had never been the common law husband of the decedent and therefore was not entitled to the benefits claimed. Petitioner\u2019s Appendix, Document 2, at 6, 13. This decision was upheld by the Benefits Review Board on appeal, and the petition for review was then filed with this court. Petitioner now argues: (1) that the denial of his claim was arbitrary, capricious and unsupported by substantial evidence; and (2) that the ALJ was biased against him and his counsel and, consequently, should have been disqualified. Finding no merit in either of these contentions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">On the issue concerning petitioner\u2019s entitlement to death benefits as the common law spouse of the decedent, there is little dispute over the applicable law. The Act defines the terms \u201cwidow or widower\u201d to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-7\">only the decedent\u2019s wife or husband living with or dependent for support upon him or her at the time of his or her death; or living apart for justifiable cause or by reason of his or her desertion at such time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(16) (Supp. V, 1975). Since the statute does not further define \u201chusband\u201d for purposes of determining coverage, the local law of domestic relations must supply its meaning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the case before us, both petitioner and decedent were domiciliaries of the District of Columbia, and it was within this particular jurisdiction that a common law marriage<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was supposedly contracted. The full meaning of \u201chusband\u201d, as used in section 902(16), thus should be determined by reference to the local law of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-9\">The District of Columbia by judicial decision continues to recognize common law marriages, as all parties readily agree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Meretricious cohabitation alone, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>has never been sufficient to establish a valid common law marriage either in this or any other jurisdiction still recognizing such a relationship.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the District of Columbia at least, a valid common law marriage only results when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-4\">a man and woman who are legally capable of entering into the marriage relation mutually agree, in words of the present tense, to be husband and wife, and consummate their agreement by cohabiting as husband and wife. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\"><em>U. S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Britton, </em>106 U.S.App.D.C. 58, 269 F.2d 249, 251 (1959).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The parties to this litigation do not dispute that a valid common law marriage cannot exist unless each of the foregoing elements is met; rather they disagree essentially over whether or not the evidence adduced was sufficient to sustain petitioner\u2019s burden of proving that he and the decedent had mutually agreed <em>in words of the present tense</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to enter into a permanent relationship as husband and wife.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-14\">Such an agreement may at times be proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence, but where available,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the testimony of the parties is naturally preferred. <em>Id. </em>at 252. Here petitioner was available and actually did testify, as did various relatives and acquaintances of the two individuals. Petitioner\u2019s testimony, however, even when viewed most favorably, could only be characterized as ambiguous,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the AU spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>cifically found that it was \u201csorely lacking in credibility\u201d and that if any agreement at all \u201ccould possibly be found through his testimony, it would not be worthy of belief.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Appendix, Document 2, at 10. The ALJ observed petitioner\u2019s demeanor at the hearing, as we did not, and it was for him to judge the credibility of any testimony and to weigh the evidence adduced therefrom. <em>See National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Britton, </em>187 F.Supp. 359, 364 (D.D.C.1960), <em>aff\u2019d </em>110 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 289 F.2d 454, <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 832, 82 S.Ct. 54, 7 L.Ed.2d 34 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\">This brings us to the circumstantial evidence adduced by petitioner to establish that the requisite agreement <em>in praesenti </em>had been made. Various documents and the testimony of several witnesses were offered, none of which the ALJ credited with much probative weight.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On the other hand, respondents introduced considerable evidence to rebut any inference that there had been a valid common law marriage, which the ALJ deemed far more reliable and creditable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, carefully weighing all the evidence before him, he concluded that a common law marriage had never been properly contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">It is well established that in such a case as this our scope of review is limited.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We may only assure that the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record and that the decision itself is not inconsistent with applicable law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Since we conclude, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>Board did, that the ALJ\u2019s decision is unassailable in both respects, we may not and do not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">Petitioner also claims that the ALJ \u201cdemonstrated personal bias, religious bias, and bias based upon the nativity of appellant in arriving at his decision,\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 18, specifying fifteen alleged occurrences substantiating his charge. No formal objection to perceived bias or prejudice was ever made during the hearing; the claim was first raised only on appeal to the Benefits Review Board which rejected it as untimely and \u201ctherefore\u201d without merit.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">A party\u2019s claim of bias must not be made lightly. Such a charge, unfairly made, not only impugns without warrant the integrity of the government official publicly entrusted with responsibility for properly deciding a given dispute, but it also unnecessarily tarnishes our beneficent traditions of legal due process. It is especially important, too, that a charge of bias or prejudice be raised at once, whenever a party concludes in good faith that the decision-maker should be disqualified from hearing the case. If the issue of bias is raised in a timely fashion, permitting more prompt attention to the matter, each party\u2019s rights to a fair and impartial tribunal<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> are better protected. On the other hand, when a party voices its misgivings in tardy or dilatory fashion, not only may time and effort be wasted in the event that disqualification is ultimately required, but the good faith of the claimant will quite naturally be placed in some doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-10\">To help preserve the integrity and efficiency of the administrative process, the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551 <em>et seq. </em>(1970) (APA),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfJJ\">A presiding or participating employee may at any time disqualify himself. On the filing in good faith of a timely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or other disqualification of a presiding or participating employee, the agency shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1150-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 556(b). Whereas disqualification is mandatory under section 554(d) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(d) (1970), whenever a government employee or official would otherwise combine both prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions, disqualification under section 556(b) is entirely voluntary, although a decision not to disqualify oneself may be subject to subsequent review by the agency. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 556(b). Compare 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 (1970) (mandatory disqualification of federal district judges upon filing of a time<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>ly and sufficient affidavit of bias or prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\">Petitioner here, however, never filed an affidavit articulating the facts and reasons justifying his charge, but chose instead to wait until after the initial adverse decision to raise these allegations in his briefs to the Board and, subsequently, to this court. Thus, not only did petitioner fail to execute the affidavit required by section 556(b), when from the nature of his allegations he would clearly have had occasion to do so, but his claim of disqualifying prejudice also must fail for want of timeliness. The general rule governing disqualification, normally applicable to the federal judiciary and administrative agencies alike,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> requires that such a claim be raised as soon as practicable after a party has reasonable cause to believe that grounds for disqualification exist.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It will not do for a claimant to suppress his misgivings while waiting anxiously to see whether the decision goes in his favor. A contrary rule would only countenance and encourage unacceptable inefficiency in the administrative process. The APA-mandated procedures afford every party ample opportunity to enforce and preserve its due process rights. Under the present circumstances, however, petitioner must be deemed to have waived his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">In any event, petitioner suffers not at all by his tardiness for our review of the record clearly establishes that his charge of bias is wholly devoid of merit. The mere fact that a decision was reached contrary to a particular party\u2019s interest cannot justify a claim of bias, no matter how tenaciously the loser gropes for ways to reverse his misfortune. While this proposition may appear self-evident, petitioner\u2019s enumerated contentions collapse to little more.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">Administrative Law Judge McGrail showed exemplary fairness and, we might add, considerable patience throughout the hearings. His supervision of the proceedings and his sedulous analysis of the facts and applicable law are to be commended, not impugned. Petitioner\u2019s charge of disqualifying bias is indeed unfortunate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-12\">This reviewing court may not function as a de novo fact-finding tribunal, nor weigh the evidence and substitute its independent judgment. Rather the scope of our review is limited to determining whether the findings of the ALJ are supported by substantial evidence in the record, and to assuring that the decision is not inconsistent with the applicable law. We can find no error in either respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-13\">Petitioner\u2019s claim of disqualifying bias must also fail for want of procedural compliance and merit. The Administrative Procedure Act expressly provides that the functions of an ALJ during a hearing, such as the one in question here, must be conducted in an impartial manner. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556(b) (1970). We find no fault whatsoever with the conduct of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>The decision of the Board is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1146-11\">.

The Act, as amended in 1972, authorizes a three-member Benefits Review Board to hear initial appeals from decisions of the administrative law judges, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b), who now have preliminary adjudicatory authority for claims arising under the Act, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 919(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1146-22\">. <em>Marcus v.

The meaning of a federal statute is a question of federal law, of course. However, where a statute fails to define one of its operative terms, and its legislative history cannot dispel whatever reasonable doubt exists as to the proper meaning of the term, a court must assume, in the absence of any applicable federal common law, that the legislature intended for local law to supply the meaning. Since there is no general federal common law of domestic relations, see <em>De Sylva v. Ballentine, </em>351 U.S. 570, 580, 76 S.Ct. 974, 100 L.Ed. 1415 (1956), the meaning of the term \u201chusband\u201d as used in the Act must be derived from the meaning commonly given it by local law. <em>See Powell v. Rogers, </em>496 F.2d 1248, 1250 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1032, 95 S.Ct. 514, 42 L.Ed.2d 307 (1974); <em>Albina Engine &amp; Machine Works v.

The term common law marriage is something of a misnomer. The legal concept was adopted from England where it originated in the ecclesiastical rather than common law courts. See H. Clark, Law of Domestic Relations 45 (1968), <em>citing </em>II Pollock &amp; Maitland, History of English Law 364-99 (1898). This peculiar matrimonial status has been recognized in numerous American jurisdictions from colonial times. See, e. <em>g., Fenton v. Reed, 4 </em>Johns 52, 4 Am.Dec. 244 (N.Y.1809); <em>Londonderry v. Chester, </em>2 N.H. 268, 9 Am.Dec. 61 (1820). Only a dwindling minority of states, however, still recognizes its legal validity. <em>See </em>Clark, <em>supra, </em>at 45-46 nn. 9-11. Some states have specifically abolished common law marriages by statute. <em>See, e. g., </em>31 Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 517.01 (1969). Attempts to abolish common law marriage in the District of Columbia by statute have, thus far, proved unsuccessful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1147-14\">.

Murch Bros. Const.

The existence of an agreement may be inferred from the character and duration of cohabitation, or from other circumstantial evidence such as testimony by relatives and acquaintances as to the general reputation regarding the parties\u2019 relationship. <em>See id. </em>at 363. Any inference that might arise may nevertheless be rebutted by direct evidence that, in fact, there was no present agreement. <em>See U. S.

It appears that both petitioner and decedent were legally capable of becoming husband and wife (Tr. 102, 194, 280, 369-71), and neither respondent has claimed otherwise. Since both parties, too, undeniably cohabited for approximately eighteen months after the alleged marital agreement (Tr. 206, 470-71; Petitioner\u2019s App., Doc. 2, at 4), the essential issue litigated before the ALJ was whether or not they had agreed to become husband and wife <em>in praesenti.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1148-17\">. <em>See generally </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 14-302 (1973) (D.C. \u201cDead Man\u2019s Statute\u201d), which only prohibits a judgment based on uncorroborated testimony in suits against persons legally representing a decedent or incompetent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1148-18\">.

It should be noted that contracting a valid common law marriage <em>per verba de praesenti </em>is not at all inconsistent with a further agreement to solemnize that marriage relation in the future by undergoing a public ceremony. Distinguishing the two agreements frequently presents intractable problems of proof, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">. The ALJ discussed each of petitioner\u2019s exhibits cogently and in great detail. These ranged from a \u201ccongratulations card\u201d sent to friends and signed only as \u201cJoan and Fonso\u201d, and unsolicited letters addressed to decedent as \u201cJoan Marcus\u201d, referred to by counsel for petitioner as \u201cjunk mail\u201d (Tr. 222), to a promissory note showing \u201cJoan Hawker Marcus\u201d as a signatory. Petitioner\u2019s App., Doc. 2, at 7-10. The ALJ\u2019s findings that each of these exhibits was of dubious reliability and, therefore, entitled to little weight cannot be faulted. The same must be said of his finding that the testimony of other witnesses presented on behalf of petitioner failed to substantiate petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">. For example, certain witnesses testified that decedent only referred to petitioner as her \u201cboyfriend\u201d (Tr. 194, 196-97, 291-92), that she never acknowledged her marriage to relatives or employers (Tr. 141, 168, 434-35, 465-67), that she continued to date other men while living with petitioner (Tr. 172-73, 178, 186-87, 229-30), and that she even contemplated marriage to another man (Tr. 200). Likewise, all of decedent\u2019s employment records refer only to her maiden name (Hawker Ex. 9-11), as did her INS card, which had been revised months after she began living with petitioner (Resp.
