These were also three mortgages against complainant at that date \u2014 one for $117 due to L. D. Watkins, one to Charles Wells on which there was to become due $2245, with interest from 1868, but which was not payable for some time thereafter, and a smaller mortgage to Wells which covered only a small part of these premises with adjacent lands, which had been originally for $375, but on which the principal had been due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>several years, and with interest amounted to something more than $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Complainant claims that defendant purchased subject to all three of these mortgages, and was to pay and did pay the remainder of the $5400 partly in cash, and partly in a mortgage on lands in Jackson county of $900.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Defendant admits that he agreed to pay the two mortgages which covered his farm, but denies that he agreed to except the wheat, or to pay the smaller Wells mortgage, and insists that he paid the full balance above the $900, in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The deed given by complainant was an ordinary warranty deed with no exceptions. In 1876 this bill was filed to correct this deed by excepting the wheat and making the grant subject to all the mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The $900 had been paid, as well as the Watkins mortgage add most of the large Wells mortgage, which it was understood between Wells and defendant the latter was to pay in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Defendant gathered the wheat. He also from the beginning refused to recognize the smaller Wells mortgage as binding on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The court below decreed for complainant for the wheat and all the mortgages. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">In this case the testimony of the parties and of their wives is positively contradictory, upon all of the points involved. The outside testimony does not appear at all conclusive. There are many circumstances which in our view rather tend to confirm the statements of the defendant. But it is enough to say that without a very convincing preponderance of evidence in favor of complainant no relief can be granted. We do not think there is such a preponderance or any preponderance and therefore no decree should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The answer is sufficient to determine, in any future controversy, the liability of defendant to pay what is left of the large Wells mortgage. It is not clear that any further relief could have been granted in any case, and nothing is shown to indicate that defendant would ever have objected to sign any proper instrument to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>The decree must be reversed and the bill dismissed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-4\">Marston, C. J. concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b548-5\">Graves, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_i\">concurring. How far soever this case may be thought to go in breeding suspicion that it was part of the agreement that defendant should assume and pay the small mortgage given to Wells, and'which amounted to more than $600 at the time of the bargain, yet the showing is obviously not so clear and positive as to warrant a finding to that effect and a consequent change in the operation of the deed. <em>Vanderkarr v. Thompson </em>19 Mich. 82; <em>Martin v. Hamlin </em>18 Mich. 354; <em>Tripp v. Hasceig </em>20 Mich. 254 ; <em>Case v. Peters </em>id. 298; <em>Ivinson v. Hutton </em>98 U. S. 79, 82, 83 ; <em>Mead v. Westchester F. Ins. Co. </em>64 N. Y. 453; <em>Ford v. Joyce </em>78 N. Y. 618; <em>Stockbridge Iron Co. v. Hudson Iron Co. </em>107 Mass. 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The elements of proof are unwritten, conflicting and uncertain. The failure of that part of the bill relating to the. right to retain the thirteen and one-half acres of wheat is still more conspicuous. In giving the opinion of the Court in <em>Case v. </em>Peters, supra, Mr. Justice Christiancy observed as follows: \u2018\u2018It would, we think, be exceedingly dangerous, and tend to weaken confidence in titles generally, if the effect of deeds of conveyance, leases or other written evidences of title could be thus changed by a verbal agreement, except in very clear cases, where the contract is proved to the entire satisfaction of the court. It should never be done upon a slight preponderance'of evidence. The court should be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Hunter v. Hopkins </em>12 Mich. 229; and see <em>Jones v. Tyler </em>6 Mich. 368.\u201d Page 303.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b548-7\">Cooley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Air\">dissenting. I do not concur in the foregoing opinion, but think the decree appealed from was correct.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
