The circuit court held that they could not, and dismissed the appeal which, in due form, they had attempted to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The circuit judge was quite right in saying that litigation \u2022over estates is a great and growing evil, and that parties should be encouraged to avoid it by voluntary arrangements, instead of being prevented. But it becomes important in any case to make sure that all persons who are or may be interested join in the settlement, and also, in the case of wills, that no declared policy of the testator in putting his property or any portion of it beyond the control of those concerned in \u25a0the settlement, is defeated thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">A reference to the will, a copy of which is given in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>margin,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> will make it clear that purposes are expressed therein which were to be accomplished irrespective of the desires of the heirs, distributees or beneficiaries. One of these was the erection of a monument to the decedent; and it is a noticeable fact which may assist in the explanation of some other provisions of the will, that the executors, and not the family, were to decide upon this, and to determine upon the inscriptions and the headstones. In respect to this monument the executors alone can represent the testator\u2019s will,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>and no settlement can deprive .them of their discretionary authority. The decedent trusted to them, and to no others.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">But it is equally manifest that the decedent had beneficiaries in view who could not possibly be represented in any settlement. The gift to Escalala N. Green is of a life estate only, and on her decease her share is to pass to her children and grandchildren, share and share alike. We do not understand that she then had any grandchildren, and the will must have intended the children and grandchildren who should be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>being at tbe death of Mrs. Green. The gift to Eugene B. Arnold is also for life only, and after his death his heirs become the beneficiaries. We do not know why these gifts to the daughter and son were thus restricted, but it is plain that the decedent intended that the descendants of his children should succeed to the property beyond a peradventure, and that it should not be in the power of the children themselves to prevent it. We need not inquire into the reasons ; being sufficient to the decedent they are for legal purposes sufficient to all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">To guard against his purposes being defeated the persons named as executors were made trustees with very extensive powers. They were given full discretion to sell real and personal estate without taking the advice of the probate court, they were to keep all funds invested, and upon them he relied to save the contingent interests for those who were in mind as future beneficiaries. When the living children and grandchildren undertake by agreement between themselves to appropriate the whole property, they attempt to make a new will for the testator ; to take to themselves the fee when he gave life estates only; to relieve themselves from trusts which he deemed essential; to cut off after-born children who were plainly the special objects of his bounty. But it is plain that this cannot be done without an equal disregard of the will of and the law. The trustees are the representatives of the dead donor in his wishes, and they represent also the future beneficiaries, who, being as yet unknown, can have no other representatives or protectors.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The will was assailed on the ground of mental incompetency. Had the issue been fully and fairly tried in the probate court and decided on the merits, and had the appeal been taken on technical grounds, we should agree that the relators ought not to press it. It would be inexcusable in them to make costs for the estate which they at the outset must know would be incurred in a vain attempt to support a nullity. But there is every reason to believe from this record that the case has not been fully heard, and that the decision went as it did because of the compromise. Under such cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>cumstances the executors have an undoubted right to appeal, for they have substantial interests to protect. Whether they might appeal for the mere purpose of protecting the decedent\u2019s reputation, if they believed his competency unjustly assailed, we need not discuss, for in this case such a question does not and cannot arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">It is urged that the <em>mamdamus </em>which is applied for is not a proper remedy. But the purpose is merely to set the court in motion that the appeal may be heard <em>(Comstock v. Wayne Circuit Judge </em>30 Mich. 98); and it must issue as prayed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b27-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b24-4\">The Last Will and Testament of Hiram Arnold, of Scio, in Washtenaw County, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">I, Hiram Arnold, being of full age and sound mind, do hereby make and execute this my last will and testament, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\"><em>First </em>\u2014 I hereby appoint Edward Treadwell and Noah W.
