(\u201cCredit Builders\u201d). The district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-26\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-27\">From December 1990 through September 1991, MCI provided telecommunications services to Credit Builders in both Texas and Missouri. All services were provided in accordance with the terms of MCI\u2019s F.C.C. Tariff No. 1 (the \u201cTariff\u201d), filed with the Federal Communications Commission. After allegedly not receiving any payment for services rendered, MCI terminated all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>telecommunication services to Credit Builders. In October 1991,. MCI brought this action to recover $38,897.00 for amounts due from Credit Builders under the terms and conditions set forth in the Tariff, plus attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. MCI moved for summary judgment and the district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">MCI contends that the United States District Courts have independent federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and jurisdiction over matters arising out of the Communications Act under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MCI argues that the district court's dismissal of this case should be reversed based on <em>Ivy Broadcasting Co. v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>391 F.2d 486 (2d Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">In general, to determine whether a cause of action \u201carises under\u201d federal law for purposes of federal question jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has stated that a case arises under federal law if \u201cit really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction, or effect of such a law, upon the determination of which the result depends.\u201d <em>Gully v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>299 U.S. 109, 114, 57 S.Ct. 96, 98, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936). And it has been held that \u201cfederal common law,\u201d when it exists, is among the \u201claws of the United States\u201d referred to in the jurisdictional statute, thus conferring federal question jurisdiction. <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee, </em>406 U.S. 91, 92 S.Ct. 1385, 31 L.Ed.2d 712 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">The Second Circuit in <em>Ivy </em>held that \u201cquestions concerning the duties, charges, and liabilities\u201d of carriers are to be governed solely by federal law. <em>Ivy, </em>391 F.2d at 491. The court in <em>Ivy </em>concluded the federal interest in telephone companies is so strong and the legislation regulating such companies is so comprehensive that federal common law gives a remedy for tort or breach of contract even though the statutes provide no such remedy, either expressly or impliedly. <em>Id. </em>at 491. We are not persuaded by the reasoning in <em>Ivy. </em>In fact, the decision in <em>Ivy </em>has received much criticism. The decision has been referred to as \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cquestionable.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-12\">MCI cites to our decision in <em>Pennzoil Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Com., </em>645 F.2d 360, 385 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1142, 102 S.Ct. 1000, 71 L.Ed.2d 293 (1982), as following the <em>Ivy </em>case. <em>Pennzoil, </em>however,- cites to <em>Ivy </em>for the proposition that in order for all aspects of a contract subject to federal regulation to be governed by federal rather than state law, an independent indication of congressional policy indicating that the contract be ruled by federal common law must be present. <em>Pennzoil, </em>645 F.2d at 385. The Court then goes on to distinguish the case at bar from the <em>Ivy </em>case. MCI\u2019s reliance on <em>Pennzoil </em>is misplaced. While we agree with the general proposition stated in <em>Ivy, </em>we believe that the <em>Ivy </em>court has gone too far in making \u201cfurther inroads ... upon the clear provisions of the Rules of Decision Act on the vague grounds of federal interest.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We prefer instead to take a more cautious approach with respect to the recognition of federal common law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has emphasized, the federal common law is appropriate in only a \u201cfew and restricted\u201d circumstances. <em>Milwaukee v. Illinois, </em>451 U.S. 304, 313, 101 S.Ct. 1784, 1790, 68 L.Ed.2d 114 (1981). In <em>Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., </em>451 U.S. 630, 641, 101 S.Ct. 2061, 2067, 68 L.Ed.2d 500 (1981), the Supreme Court went on to state that \u201cabsent some congressional authorization to formulate sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>stantive rules of decision, federal common law exists only in such narrow areas as those concerned with the rights and obligations of the United States, interstate and international disputes implicating the conflicting rights of States or our relations with foreign nations, and admiralty cases.\u201d We do not believe that this case to collect a delinquent telephone bill falls within these limited instances.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\">This case involves MCI\u2019s ability to recover on a contract or its ability to recover in quantum meruit. It does not involve the validity, construction, or effect of the Communications Act or any other federal statute. Actions for breach of contract and recovery in quantum meruit have their source in state law, and are consequently not entitled to federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">. Section 1331 states: \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">. Section 1337 states: \"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress-\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1106-13\">.

For the same reasons, we do not believe that Section 1337 confers federal question jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
