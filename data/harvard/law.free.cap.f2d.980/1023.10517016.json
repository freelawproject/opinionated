Parker\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendants violated his constitutional rights by subjecting him to false arrest and unlawful detention. The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Parker\u2019s action without requiring the defendants to answer, concluding that the claim is frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). Parker appeals the district court's dismissal. We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-13\">\n<em>Facts and Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-14\">Parker was arrested and indicted in May 1990 for burglary of a vehicle. Parker\u2019s complaint alleges that the arresting officers had no evidence linking Parker to the burglary. Parker asserts that despite a total lack of evidence, he was incarcerated for nine months before the charges against him were dropped and he was released from jail. Parker also alleges that while detained pursuant to the May 1990 arrest he suffered severe injuries. Parker is currently incarcerated on a separate and unrelated charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-19\">The district court dismissed Parker\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), noting that Parker is currently in custody and that \u201chabeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or length of their confinement.\u201d The court concluded that Parker \u201cshould present his claims as a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>and must exhaust state ha-beas remedies before bringing his \u00a7 1983 claim into federal court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-20\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-21\">Section 1915(d) authorizes federal courts to dismiss a claim filed <em>in forma pauperis </em>\u201cif satisfied that the action is frivolous.\u201d A claim is frivolous under \u00a7 1915(d) only if \u201cit lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 1733, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). Even if the complaint fails to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the Court has held that it may nonetheless have an arguable basis in law and hence not be frivolous under \u00a7 1915(d). <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-24\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal under \u00a7 1915(d) only for abuse of discretion. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 1733-34. In the context of \u00a7 1915(d), the Court has given substance to the usually vague abuse of discretion standard, stating that \u201cit would be appropriate for the court of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>peals to consider among other things, whether the plaintiff was proceeding <em>pro se, </em>(citation omitted) ... [and] whether the court applied erroneous legal conclusions <em>...\u201d Id. </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 1734. <em>See Moore v. Mabus </em>976 F.2d 268, 271 (5th Cir.1992) (applying the <em>Denton </em>analysis and finding abuse of discretion.) We hold that the district court abused its discretion in the instant case because its dismissal of Parker\u2019s complaint was based on an erroneous legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">The district court dismissed Parker\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint, concluding that since Parker is challenging the validity of his confinement, Parker\u2019s claim should be presented as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court\u2019s reasoning would be correct if Parker\u2019s claims of false arrest and illegal detention challenged the validity or length of his <em>current </em>confinement. We have held that \u201cthe civil rights claims for such damages must first be subject to the exhaustion of state remedies because the challenge amounts to a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Texas, </em>878 F.2d 904, 906 (5th Cir.1989) (citing <em>Fulford v. Kline, </em>529 F.2d 377 (5th Cir.1976) <em>adhered to en banc, </em>550 F.2d 342 (1977)). However, Parker\u2019s complaint does not challenge his present confinement, rather the complaint challenges his confinement subsequent to the May 1990 arrest which ended when the charges against Parker were dismissed and Parker was released. Because Parker does not challenge his present confinement, the district court erred in holding that Parker should have brought his claim as petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">The habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c), provides that \u201cthe writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless ... [h]e is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d The Court has explained that \u201cthe essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of <em>that </em>custody ...\u201d <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 484, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1833, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">In <em>Maleng v. Cook </em>the Supreme Court interpreted language of the habeas corpus statute \u201cas requiring that the habeas petitioner be \u2018in custody\u2019 under the conviction or sentence under attack at the time his petition is filed.\u201d 490 U.S. 488, 490-91, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 1925, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989). The Court affirmed the district court\u2019s holding that \u201crespondent was not \u2018in custody\u2019 for the purposes of a habeas attack on [a prior] conviction because the sentence imposed for that conviction had already expired.\u201d <em>Id. See also Hendrix v. Lynaugh, </em>888 F.2d 336 (5th Cir.1989) (\u201cFederal district courts do not have jurisdiction to entertain [habeas corpus] actions if, at the time the petition is filed, the petitioner is not \u2018in custody\u2019 under the conviction or sentence which the petition attacks\u201d); <em>Ali v. Higgs, </em>892 F.2d 438, 439 (5th Cir.1990) (question whether petitioner exhausted state remedies need not be addressed because petitioner\u2019s current confinement resulted from a conviction unrelated to the arrest that formed the basis of his \u00a7 1983 claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">As Parker is not in custody for the offense he challenges in his complaint, i.e., his May 1990 arrest and detention, a district court would not have jurisdiction to review Parker\u2019s .complaint under the habe-as corpus statute. In <em>Conner v. Pickett, </em>552 F.2d 585, 587 (1977), we explained that while \u201c \u2018habeas corpus is the exclusive initial cause of action where the basis of the claim goes to the constitutionality of the state court conviction\u2019 ... (citation omitted), [o]f course this bow to the integrity of the state judicial administration is unnecessary where a section 1983 plaintiff is ineligible for habeas corpus relief.\u201d Parker is ineligible for habeas corpus relief and properly challenged his May 1990 arrest and detention under \u00a7 1983. Because the district court dismissed Parker\u2019s complaint on the basis of an erroneous legal conclusion, i.e., that Parker\u2019s claim should be brought under habeas corpus rather than \u00a7 1983, we hold that the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\">The district court also dismissed Parker\u2019s complaint because the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>named the Forth Worth police department as a defendant and the department \u201cis not a proper party defendant in this civil rights suit arising from the purported actions of the City\u2019s police officers.\u201d (citing <em>Darby v. Pasadena Police Dep\u2019t, </em>939 F.2d 311, 313-314 (5th Cir.1991)). Though the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion may be correct, this conclusion does not constitute a proper ground for dismissing Parker\u2019s claim. In <em>Darby </em>we held that leave to amend, rather than dismissal, was the appropriate disposition because there was no showing that the city would be prejudiced by the amendment. <em>Id. See Denton v. Hernandez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 1734, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992) (\u201ca court of appeals reviewing a \u00a7 1915(d) disposition should consider whether the District Court abused its discretion by dismissing the complaint ... without leave to amend.\u201d) The district court below made no findings of prejudice. Moreover, Parker is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>and as we have repeatedly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-6\">An opportunity should be provided the prisoner to develop his case at least to the point where any merit it contains is brought to light ... <em>Pro se </em>prisoner complaints must be read in a liberal fashion and should not be dismissed unless it appears beyond all doubt that the prisoner could prove no set of facts under which he would be entitled to relief. <em>Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1241 (5th Cir.1989) (quoting <em>Taylor v. Gibson, </em>529 F.2d 709, 713-14 (5th Cir.1976)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">We also note that the complaint was filed on August 27, 1992, and the judgment and order of dismissal were signed August 31, 1992. There was no hearing under <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), no interrogatories to Parker and no supplemental filing by him, no magistrate\u2019s report, and nothing to alert Parker to the deficiency in this respect in his complaint or the prospect of such imminent dismissal; and the allegations of the complaint do not indicate that affording leave to amend would in all likelihood be futile. Nor did the district court address the matter of possible amendment. We hold that under these facts the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Parker\u2019s complaint, rather than granting Parker leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">Parker\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim alleges that Parker was falsely arrested and illegally detained for nine months. In <em>Duckett v. City of City Park </em>we held that \u201c[a]n individual has a federally protected right to be free from unlawful arrest and detention resulting in a significant restraint in liberty and violation of this right may be grounds for suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d 950 F.2d 272, 278 (5th Cir.1992). <em>See also Dennis v. Warren, 779 </em>F.2d 245, 247 (5th Cir.1985) (\u201cAn individual's right to be free from such unlawful arrest and detention is a federally protected right, the violation of which may be grounds for a suit under section 1983\u201d). In light of the factual allegations made by Parker in his complaint and the legal standard outlined by this court in <em>Duckett, </em>it cannot be said that Parker\u2019s unlawful arrest and detention claim lack an \u201carguable basis in law.\u201d Significantly, the district court never exercised its discretion to determine whether the false arrest and illegal detention claims against the individual officers lacked an arguable basis in law or fact, as it dismissed these claims solely on the erroneous basis that Parker was required to exhaust habeas corpus remedies. As the district court\u2019s dismissal of Parker\u2019s complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(d) was based on an error of law this portion of the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-10\">Finally, the district court correctly dismissed Parker\u2019s claims regarding injuries Parker suffered while in detention. This allegation has been raised by Parker in a previous \u00a7 1983 action and cannot be relitigated. <em>Wilson v. Lynaugh, </em>878 F.2d 846, 850 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 969, 110 S.Ct. 417, 107 L.Ed.2d 382 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-11\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-12\">For the foregoing reasons the district court\u2019s dismissal of Parker\u2019s complaint alleging false arrest and illegal detention is REVERSED. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Parker\u2019s claim alleging injuries suffered while in custody is AFFIRMED, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>REMAND the case for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1108-15\">. These are the facts as presented by Parker in his complaint. The Supreme Court has stated that the \"initial assessment of the <em>in forma pau-peris </em>plaintiff's factual allegations must be weighted in favor of the plaintiff.\" <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 1733, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). Dismissing the complaint as frivolous on the basis of factual allegations \"is appropriate when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible.\" <em>Id. </em>As these facts are clearly plausible we assume their accuracy in the analysis that follows.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
