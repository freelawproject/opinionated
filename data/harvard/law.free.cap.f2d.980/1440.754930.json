Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>24 Cl.Ct. 635 (1991), denying its motion for summary judgment and granting Du Pont\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. The Claims Court held that the contract between the government and Du Pont required the government to reimburse Du Pont for severance payments to its employees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">The Claims Court fully and carefully considered all of the government\u2019s arguments except one. The government contends that Du Pont engaged in \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d in making the severance payments to its employees after it received a letter from the Secretary of Energy warning that the government would not reimburse such costs. There is no merit to this argument. The Secretary\u2019s warning letter did not cite or rely on any provision of the contract or other legal authority; it merely reflected the government\u2019s dissatisfaction with the payment of severance to employees who would be rehired by Du Pont\u2019s successor. In the absence of any contractual or legal basis for the Secretary\u2019s position, Du Pont was not guilty of willful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">All of the government\u2019s other arguments were properly rejected by the Claims Court and, accordingly, we adopt its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
