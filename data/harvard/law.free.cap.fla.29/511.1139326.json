An indictment charging the utterance and publishing of a forged instrument, should state the name of the person, firm, corporation or company to or upon whom the same was uttered, published or passed ; or else it should account for the omission by a statement in the indictment that such person, etc., is to the jurors unknown ; if it fails to do either it is fatally defective.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>2. An indictment charging the procurement of property by falsely personating another, under section 41, page 364, McClellan\u2019s Digest, should allege that the property fraudulently obtained by the defendant was intended by the party from whom he got it to be delivered to the party alleged to have been' falsely personated ; and should further allege that the defendant received the property with intent to convert the same to his own use.

There is a general allegation in said count that the defendant knew the order was false, forged and counterfeited, and that he uttered and published the same as true with the intent thereby to injure and defraud, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-6\">Now my position is this, that this count should have charged such facts as would show that the defendant knew the order to be false, forged and counterfeited, and such facts as would show who he intended to defraud, if any one, and that he passed or attempted to pass the same. 8th vol. Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, secs. 6, 1, p. 489-494; People vs. Ah Woo, 28 Cal., 205 ; Commonwealth vs. Searl, 4 Am. Dec., 446.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-7\">2. I contend that the count should show affirmatively on whom (naming the party) he passed or attempted to pass the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-8\">The charge in the count that the defendant feloniously uttered and published the same as true with intent thereby then and there to injure and defraud one B. C. Horne, is not a charge that he attempted to pass the same upon B. C. Horne or that he did pass it upon him. Why not just as well to have charged and alleged that he, the defendant, uttered and published the same as true with intent thereby then and there to injure and defraud George Everett. There is no allegation in said count that he, defendant, made any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>effort to pass it upon R. C. Horne. Now, to my mind there can be no plainer proposition than this : That a count in an indictment of this character must show who the defendant passed the order upon or attempted to pass it upon. There must be some overt act charged and alleged to constitute the crime.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-5\">There can be no crime of this character charged and alleged until some overt act is committed and charged. There can be no uttering or publishing until the party having in his possession a false, forged and counterfeited order passes or attempts to pass the same or commits some other overt act indicating his purpose, and these attempts or acts must be alleged and the party\u2019s name given upon whom it is alleged he attempts to defraud or does defraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-6\">Now none of these allegations having been charged in said count, I contend that it is wholly defective and charges no offense known to the law or statute under which this count in the indictment is brought. McClellan\u2019s Digest, sec. 2, p. 377; 2d Bishop on Crim. Procedure, 3d Ed., sec. 425, p. 425 ; State vs. Witt, 39 Ark., 216; McClellan vs. State, 32 Ark., 609; Stearn vs. State, 20 Ala., 43 ; Scoles vs. State, 58 Am.

Ency. of Law, sec. 6, p. 566-567.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-5\">Now we have no statute that makes it a crime for a party to have in his possession a forged or counterfeited order. This count in this indictment was brought under section 2 of McClellan\u2019s Digest, page 377.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-6\">Before a party can be charged and convicted under this statute he must not only be charged with having a forged or counterfeit order or paper in his possession, knowing the same to be forged, counterfeited, etc., but he must be charged with some overt act therewith in the count to make the crime complete. Hutchinson vs. State, 13 Ohio, 198 ; Vanvalkenburg vs. State, 11 Ohio, 404 ; 4th vol. Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, sec. 8, pages 339-340 ; 8th vol. Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law. sec. 6, 1-2-3, pages 489-496 ; United States vs. Albert, 45 Federal Rep., 552.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-7\">Now as to the second' count in the indictment I do \u2022 not think any argument will be necessary, or any references to any authorities are necessary to convince the minds of this honorable court that the court below committed a very grave error in not sustaining the defendant\u2019s motion to quash this count in the indictment. The statute under which this count was brought, sec. 41, page 364, of McClellan\u2019s Digest, says: Whosoever feloniously personates or represents another and in such assumed character receives any property in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>tended to be delivered to the party so personated with intent to convert the same to his own use, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-5\">Now there is no charge or allegation in skid count that the defendant personated Joseph Gfoodson with intent to convert the property to his own use. I contend that this allegation is as essential as any other allegation in the statute to constitute the crime, and unless the party falsely personated another with this intent, and unless the indictment charges him with this intent, then there can be no crime or offense' commitied known to our statute law.

The records do not disclose that the defendant was indicted by the grand jury for the offense charged in the two counts of the indictment. The records disclose that at that term of the court the grand jury returned and presented into court an indictment against the defendant for forgery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-9\">Now this court will note that there is a vast differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ence between the offense charged in the indictment against the defendant and that of forgery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-5\">The crime charged to the defendant, that of uttering and publishing a forged order is a separate and distinct offense from that of forgery. 8 Vol. Am. &amp; Eng.

D. 1889, with force and arms at and in the county of Washington, had in his custody and possession a certain false, forged and counterfeit order for the payment of money, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the said William Goodson then and there knowing the same to be false, forged and counterfeited. The order was of the tenor following :</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u201c Chipley, Fla., January the 14th, \u201989.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u201cMr. Horn (meaning one R. C.

C. Horn, the said William Goodson then and there knowing the said order to be false, forged and counterfeited, against the form of the statute in such cases made, etc. The grand jurors of the State of Florida, inquiring in and for the body of the county of Washington, upon their oaths present that one William Goodson, of the county of Washington, on the 14th day of January, 1889, in the county of Washington aforesaid, feloniously, unlawfully, knowingly and designedly did falsely pretend to oneR. C. Horn that the said William Goodson was one Joseph Goodson, and that he had an order to pay money, to-wit: Twenty-five dollars, sent and signed by one George Everett, in writing, and the said order -was in the words and figures as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">\u201cChipley, Fla., January the 14th, \u201989.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">\u201cMr. Horn (meaningR.

C. Horn believing the said William Goodson to be Joseph Goodson, and that said order was signed by one George Everett, as represented by William Goodson, for said'twenty-five dollars, by means of which said false pretenses the said William Goodson did then and there- unlawfully, knowingly and. designedly fraudulently obtain from the said R. C. Horn twenty-five dollars, of the value of twenty-five dollars of-the property, money, goods and chattels of the said R. C. Horn, with intent then and there to cheat and defraud the said R. C. Horn, whereas, in truth and in fact, the said William Goodson was not Joseph Goodson, neither was the order for twenty-five dollars, signed by George Everett, or sent by George Everett, for twenty-five dollars, so the said William Goodson then and there well knew, against the form of the statute in such cases made,\u201d etc. On this indictment the defendant was tried on the 14th day of November, 1891, the jury finding a general verdict of guilty, without any specification as to which one of the two offenses charged in the indictment their verdict should apply. The defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial being denied, he brings the case here upon writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Before pleading to the indictment, the defendant moved the court to quash it upon the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u201c 1st. The first count in the indictment is vague and indefinite, and charges no offense known to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">2d. The second count in the indictment charges no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>offense known -to the law, and is vague, indefinite and uncertain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">This motion was overruled, and this ruling is assigned as the first error. While this motion to quash does not point out with any definiteness the particulars wherein the two counts of the indictment are vague, indefinite and uncertain, still we think that the motion should have been sustained, and the indictment quashed. The first count attempts to charge the defendant with uttering, publishing and passing a false, forged and counterfeit order for money, but does not allege any person, firm, corporation or company to, or upon, whom the same was uttered, published or passed; neither does the indictment excuse this omission with any statement that the person to, or upon, whom it was uttered, published and passed was to the jurors unknown. The reason for naming in the indictment the person upon whom the forged instrument was passed, consist in the fact that it enters into and becomes a part of the description of the offense, which should be \u2022 certain ; not only that the defendant may accurately know who his accusers are, but that, in case of a second prosecution for the same utterance and passing, he may be able accurately to plead <em>autrefois </em>acquit, or convict, as the case- may be. In 1 Chitty\u2019s Criminal Law, m. p. 211, we find the rule thus expressed: \u201cBut it is, in general, necessary to set-forth the names of third persons with sufficient cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>tainty ; and, therefore, it seems to be generally agreed at this day, that an indictment for suffering divers bakers to bake, etc., against the assize, when that offense was indictable, or for distraining divers persons without just cause, or for taking divers sums of money of' divers persons for toll, can not be supported.\u201d The same rule applies in larceny in indictments for which the name of the owner of the stolen goods must be set out as a part of the <em>description </em>or <em>identification </em>of the property alleged to have been stolen, or else its omission must be excused by a state ment in the indictment \u2018 \u2018 that the owner is to the jurors unknown.\u201d The correctness of this rule was recognized at an early date' in the history of this court, in Groner vs. State, 6 Fla., 39, and has been adhered to ever since. Sharp vs. State, 28 Fla., 359; 9 South. Rep.; 651. As applied to indictments for uttering a forged instrument, the rule has been recognized and enforced in Buckley vs. State, 2 G. Green (Iowa), 162. In that case the allegation of the indictment as to the utterance and passing of forged and counterfeit coin was exactly like the one under consideration, and the indictment was held bad. In McClellan vs. State, 32 Ark., 609, the indictment in this respect was exactly like the one here, and was held bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The second count in this indictment is also fatally defective. It seems to be predicated upon section 41, p. 364, McClellan\u2019s Digest, that provides as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u201cWhoever falsely personates or represents another, and in such assumed character receives any property <em>intended to be delivered to the party so </em>personated, <em>with intent to convert the same to his own </em>tose, shall be deemed to have committed larceny, and be punished accordingly.\u201d Comment seems hardly necessary. In this second count there is no allegation that the property alleged to have been fraudulently obtained by the defendant was \u201cintended by the party from whom he got it to be delivered to the party alleged to have been falsely personated ;\u201d neither is there any allegation that the defendant received the property \u201c with intent to convert the same to his own use.\u201d All of which is fatal to its validity ; and the omission of these essential allegations makes it fall short of charging any offense provided for bylaw. Jones vs. State, 22 Fla., 532. The defendant\u2019s motion to quash should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">After the overruling of his motion to quash, the defendant entered a plea in abatement, the substance of which is, that there was no evidence upon the records of the court to show that the indictment was ever returned or presented in open court by any grand jury. This plea was overruled, and such ruling is also assigned as error. The ruling of the court below upon this plea is in the following words: \u201cHe (the court) was of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence before the court to sustain the indictment, said entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>of the finding and return into court of May the 17th, 1889, being in the following words and figures, namely: \u2018 State of Florida vs. William Goodson \u2014 forgery.\u2019 \u201d We do not think that this was sufficient evidence, or, in fact, any evidence at all of the essential fact that such an indictment, or that any indictment, had been \u2018 \u2018 presented or returned into open court by a grand jury.\u201d The bare style of a case, accompanied with the technical name of a crime, appearing by itself in the minutes of the court, without any explanation or other statement, cannot be said to prove anything. Had this styling of the cause been preceded with the customary statement: The grand jury came into court, or into open court, and presented the following indictment, then the evidence would have been sufficient and complete. Turning to the indictment itself, we find the file-marks to be as follows: \u201cFiled May 17th, 1889, W. B. Lassiter, Clerk, by J. R. Wells, D. C.\u201d There is nothing in this to indicate that it was filed or presented in open court. At the beginning of the record before us we find the following statement made by the same clerk who filled that office at the time this indictment purports to have been found: \u201cBe it remembered, that on the 9th day of November, A. D. 1891, came the State of Florida, the plaintiff in the case aforesaid, and by an indictment filed with the Clerk of the Circuit Court <em>in Ms said office </em>on the 17th day of May, A. D. 1891, called upon the defendant to answer,\u201d etc. While this preliminary statement by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the clerk in the record may' be regarded as affirmative proof that the indictment was filed <em>in his office, </em>as therein asserted, instead of in open court, still it falls far short of affirmatively showing that the paper was presented and filed in open court by the grand jury. This being all there is in the record upon this subject, we do not think that there is sufficient evidence, or any evidence, that this indictment was presented in open court by a grand jury, that being the only recognized manner in which the findings of a grand jury can be authoritatively presented. Collins vs. State, 13 Fla., 651. Were the rule Otherwise, it would render it possible for a designing or revengeful foreman of a grand jury to ruin any citizen by surreptitiously filing with the clerk in his office an indictment manufactured by himself alone, upon which his fellow-jurors had taken no action. With the light before us, we think the defendant\u2019s plea in abatement should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">It is unnecessary,-after what has been said, to notice any other questions raised. '</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The judgment of the court below is reversed,' with directions to quash the indictment, and to discharge the defendant from further custody or detention thereunder.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
