Tried to a jury with co-defendant Baloca, defendant was convicted on both charges. The trial judge merged the conviction for possession into the conviction for possession with intent to distribute and sentenced the defendant to the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections for 15 years. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">On this appeal, defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">POINT I THE COURT\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JURY RESPECTING THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF POSSESSION WAS ERRONEOUS AND DENIED APPELLANT A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">POINT II THE STATE DID NOT ADDUCE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF POSSESSION TO UNDERPIN THE CONVICTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION FOR A JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">POINT III EXPERT TESTIMONY ADMITTED BY THE COURT DENIED APPELLANT A FAIR TRIAL (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">POINT IV THE COURT\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JURY RESPECTING THE TRACE OF COCAINE FOUND ON THE SCALE VIOLATED APPELLANT\u2019S RIGHT TO INDICTMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">POINT V THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S COMMENTS DURING DEFENSE COUNSEL\u2019S OPENING STATEMENT DENIED APPELLANT A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">Our careful review of the record convinces us that these arguments are without merit and do not warrant extended discussion, except to the extent noted herein. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). We agree with defendant that status as a mere guest in an apartment where drugs are located or possessed, without more, is not sufficient evidence to convict and that a mere guest is not guilty of possession of CDS. However, in light of the evidence, summations and jury charge, we conclude that the jury understood the mere guest argument and the fact that defendant had to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of actual or constructive possession. The judge instructed the jury about actual and constructive possession and accomplice liability. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>advised the jury that \u201cmere presence at or near the scene does not make one a participant or accomplice in the crime ...\u201d and that \u201cmere presence at the scene of the perpetration of a crime does not render a person an accomplice to it____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The investigation leading to execution of the warrant and discovery of cocaine in the bathroom centered around another man, William Vieco, who had been staying at the Baloca apartment. Defendant had $1,023 in his wallet and had a beeper (similar to one found in the kitchen) attached to his pants at the time of the raid when he was found sleeping in the bedroom where the scale and cocaine residue were found. Defendant was not observed during the investigation which resulted in the warrant. Ms. Baloca testified that the drugs and scale belonged to Vieco who had been staying in her apartment and living in her bedroom for two or three days, that defendant \u201cpassed out\u201d while visiting Baloca and was moved to the bedroom where he slept until the next afternoon when the raid occurred. Baloca further testified that she hadn\u2019t seen defendant for \u201cmaybe a month\u201d before his visit the night before the warrant was executed. Defendant also presented his employer who testified that defendant had a beeper and the money for business reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Admittedly there was no direct proof that defendant had previously been at the apartment before, that he was observed during the investigation or that defendant actually possessed the substance. Moreover, as noted above, the jury heard the testimony that the money and beeper were used for business purposes and that the cocaine and scale belonged to co-defendant William Vieco who was not present at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">We nevertheless conclude, given the scale and traces of substance in a metal dish in the bedroom where defendant was found sleeping,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and given the money and beeper on defendant\u2019s person, that a jury could find that defendant was one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the people who possessed the CDS in the apartment. The jury understood the issues and did not have to accept the defense version. There was sufficient circumstantial evidence to warrant the convictions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Brown, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>587 (1979); <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 458-459 (1967); <em>State v. Smith, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48, 49 (App.Div.1986), certif. den. 105 <em>N.J. </em>582 (1986); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-5b; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-1c.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Defendant contends that a new trial is required as a result of a prejudicial comment made by the trial judge during defendant\u2019s opening statement. The following occurred as defense counsel was making his presentation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">This is my opening statement. [The prosecutor] in his opening statement told you about what he intended to prove. He told you about this indictment. I show you why it\u2019s one-sided. We were not allowed to be at that Grand Jury presentation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">THE COURT: Now, please. Number one, this is not an argument, Mr. Hobbie. Number two, that\u2019s not so; a defendant can go if he requests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">MR. HOBBIE [defense counsel]: Your Honor, we were not requested and I was not permitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">THE COURT: You were refused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">MR. HOBBIE: I was never given\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-12\">THE COURT: Please don\u2019t argue with me. Proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">A similar comment, made by the prosecuting attorney, was the subject of consideration by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Spano, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>566 (1974). During his opening in that case, defense counsel stated, \u201cAnd this today is the first time that the defendant, under our system, has an opportunity to enter a defense.\u201d 64 <em>N.J. </em>at 567. The assistant prosecutor interrupted defense counsel and stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-14\">Excuse me, your Honor. I apologize for objecting during the opening of counsel, but that\u2019s not correct. <em>Mr. Spano had the opportunity, if he so desired, to appear before the Grand Jury and give testimony. [Id. </em>emphasis added by (Supreme Court)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">Defense counsel responded by saying,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-16\">Well, that\u2019s true, I stand corrected. He could have appeared before a Grand Jury. But that\u2019s not a trial. And that\u2019s not a defense. And you only appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>before a Grand Jury by the consent and invitation of the Prosecutor. If he doesn\u2019t want you to testify, you don\u2019t testify. He controls who testifies before the Grand Jury. But, be that as it may, what I said is today, under our wonderful system of justice, this is the trial, [/&amp;]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Of significance, the Supreme Court in <em>Spano </em>unanimously stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">The jury was receiving its first impression of the case and therefore it was strongly influenced by what transpired. The court did not interfere, nor were corrective or cautionary words forthcoming. The assistant prosecutor in effect said that the defendant, a police officer, could have come forward if he were innocent, but he was guilty since he failed to clear himself by appearing before the Grand Jury. The assistant prosecutor\u2019s contention is tantamount to a denial of the right of a defendant to remain silent. <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>609, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106, <em>reh. den. </em>381 <em>U.S. </em>957, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1797, 14 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>730 (1965). <em>Cf. State v. D\u2019Ippolito, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>540 (1955). [64 <em>N.J. </em>at 567-568]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In <em>Spano </em>the Appellate Division had reversed defendant\u2019s conviction on other grounds and the Supreme Court affirmed the reversal. However, the Supreme Court made clear that the above-quoted statement of the prosecutor \u201calone\u201d required reversal of the conviction and the granting of a new trial. 64 <em>N.J. </em>at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">We agree with defendant that <em>Spano </em>cannot be distinguished based on the fact that the judge, not the prosecutor, made the objectionable comment. As our Supreme Court has previously said, <em>Griffin </em>\u201cforbids comment by the judge and prosecutor on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d <em>State v. DiRienzo, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>360, 379 (1969). <em>See also e.g., Carter v. Kentucky, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>288, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1112, 67 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>241 (1981); <em>State v. Lynch, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>107, 114-115 (App.Div.1981), certif. den. 87 <em>N.J. </em>347 (1981). Hence, an unwarranted comment by the judge can be as prejudicial, or more harmful, than one by the prosecutor. After all, the judge is a \u201cneutral magistrate,\u201d and not a mere adversary making a presentation to the jury. The jury looks to the judge for guidance and advice and for instructions as to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The Supreme Court opinion in <em>Spano </em>indicates that there were no \u201ccorrective or cautionary words forthcoming,\u201d 64 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>N.J. </em>at 567, and we presume that this may have referred only to an immediate response from the judge. The judge in this case advised the jury, as part of his instructions at the end of the case, to disregard any comments the court addressed to counsel. It is not clear in <em>Spano </em>whether or not a similar instruction was given as is the general practice, but in any event we are satisfied that the exchange quoted above cannot itself require reversal or that the Supreme Court intended the \u201charmless error\u201d analysis not to apply in this context. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Spano,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\"><em>... </em>All concerned knew that no one appears before the Grand Jury unless he is subpoenaed or invited to testify in which event he must give his consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">Despite defense counsel\u2019s failure to move for a mistrial, the prejudice flowing from the comment was definitely of such constitutional dimension as to rise to the level of plain error. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. [64 <em>N.J. </em>at 568].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">However, not every constitutional violation warrants reversal, <em>R. </em>2:10-2, and the Supreme Court in <em>Spano </em>was concerned with improper remarks by the prosecutor and the issue of prosecutorial excess in the trial of criminal cases. We do not read <em>Spano </em>to be a decision which adopted a <em>per se </em>rule irrespective of impact, nor a prophylactic holding as a matter of \u201csupervisory authority\u201d over the conduct of State court proceedings. <em>Compare United States v. Hasting, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>499, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">In the context of the evidence against defendant, the improper remarks cannot be said to be so inflammatory as to warrant reversal. Even in situations where there have been direct comments on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify, reviewing courts have been admonished to consider such errors in the context of the trial as a whole. In <em>United States v. Hasting, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>499, 509, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1974, 1980, 76 L.Ed.2d 96, 106 (1983) the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">Since <em>Chapman [Chapman v. California, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>18, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>824,17 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>705 (1967)], the Court has consistently made clear that it is the duty of a reviewing court to consider the trial record as a whole and to ignore errors that are harmless, including most constitutional violations____ The goal, as Chief Justice Traynor has noted, is \u2018to conserve judicial resources by enabling appellate courts to cleanse the judicial process of prejudicial error without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>becoming mired in harmless error.\u2019 <em>Traynor, supra, </em>[R. Traynor, <em>The Riddle of Harmless Error </em>14 (1970)] at 81.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><em>Accord, State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325 (1971). <em>See also State v. Nittolo, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 348 (App.Div.1984); <em>State v. Lynch, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 115-116; <em>State v. Gould, </em>123 <em>N.J.Super. </em>444 (App.Div.1973), certif. den. 64 <em>N.J. </em>312 (1973) (applying harmless error analysis in similar contexts). We are satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the judge\u2019s improper comments at the outset of the trial did not affect the result or lead \u201cthe jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\"> Given the conviction for possession with intent to distribute, we do not have to consider whether the indictment alleged possession of the traces or whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the substances found in the bedroom where defendant was sleeping was included within the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
