By amended complaint plaintiff added Pittman-Moore as a defendant. National Drug Company, an additional manufacturer of the drug in question, was not joined, since plaintiffs contended that as a result of their discovery they found no basis to determine that the drug actually administered was manufactured by National Drug Company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The claims in this case arose out of an administration of the pertussis (whooping cough) antigen component of a pharmaceutical product known as the diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus toxoid (DPT) vaccine. The DPT vaccine is not a formularized synthetic chemical substance, but rather a licensed prescription biological product subject to the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act, 21 <em>U.S. C.A. </em>\u00a7 301 <em>et seq. </em>(1972), and the Public Health Service Act, 42 <em>U.S. C.A. </em>\u00a7 262 <em>et seq. </em>(1982). Each manufacturer of a DPT vaccine has its own proprietary process for creating the vaccine, protected either by trade secret or patent, and often marketed under trade names. Some of the characteristics of the biological products may vary with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the processes used. Immunization with the vaccine is required by law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:lA-7, 30:5B-5; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:57-4.10, and the beneficial effect of the vaccine is generally acknowledged. The immunization program has reduced and in some areas virtually eliminated diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus in young children.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Plaintiffs, however, contend that the product was defective in that it contained toxins which could have been eliminated by the use of the technology existing at the time the infant plaintiff, Deanna Marrero, was inoculated. Further, plaintiffs assert that the inoculations administered by the defendant physician caused Deanna to suffer a seizure disorder, resulting in chronic encephalopathy and severe retardation, and changing an otherwise normal two-year old into a mental incompetent requiring institutionalization.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Deanna\u2019s mother first noted the problem immediately following the booster shot, but was told by defendant physician that Deanna\u2019s conduct might well be indicative of her entering the \u201cterrible twos.\u201d Thereafter, as Deanna\u2019s condition steadily worsened, her mother claims she had no indication of the relationship between the DPT injections and her daughter\u2019s condition. She testified in a deposition that in June 1984 she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">... read an article that was in the Boston paper about the side effects of the D.P.T., well, mainly of the pertussis, and that it could cause brain damage and when I read it, it was like a light went off in my head and I finally saw something in black and white that I had suspected for many years but was never\u2014no one ever really acknowledged that that was what it was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">She also described the regression in her daughter\u2019s development:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Her eyes were crossing, her speech regressed and she would not get up when lying down or sitting. She was no longer interested at looking at pictures in a book. She began negative self-stimulation behavior such as compulsively twisting her hands. She began seizure activity. At approximately 4 years she began to grit her teeth, hold her breath and contort her face. She did not reach many of her developmental milestones. At six years she began episodes of hysterical uncontrollable crying. Today as a result of the inoculations, Deanna is severely retarded and requires constant care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">This suit was filed April 12, 1985 when Deanna was 14 years old, nearly 13 years after the administration of the last injection. By that time records were unavailable to the parties as to the identity of the manufacturer of the particular DPT vaccine used by the treating physician. Plaintiffs, therefore, instituted this action against all manufacturers whose products had been used by the treating physician during the period in question, asserting a theory of collective responsibility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Although the defendant manufacturers have raised various other defenses, treated later in this opinion, the trial judge correctly determined that he was bound by <em>Namm v. Charles E. Frosst &amp; Co., </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19 (App.Div.1981), which rejected all theories of collective responsibility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While in no way impugning the decision of the trial judge who was bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>by existing appellate authority to dismiss the complaint against the drug manufacturers, we now reconsider the <em>Namm </em>holding. Defendants have raised several bases upon which they claim the DPT cases differ from those in which any theory of collective responsibility has been applied. While they disagree that any such theory should apply, they contend that the theories are limited in application to generic or truly fungible products and to factual settings that differ from the one before this court. We will briefly treat these arguments before approaching the central issue of whether New Jersey should adopt one or more of the recognized theories or some modification thereof. These arguments, however, point out some flaws in the recognized theories of responsibility in non-identification cases, primarily in the failure of these rules to adapt to the specific factual settings of individual cases and to coordinate with other recognized tort principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">I. <em>Preliminary Considerations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">First, defendants claim that they are without fault in plaintiffs being denied access to information concerning the identity of the manufacturer. This was not a case where there is a recognized long latency period and pharmaceutical records were destroyed in the interim, such as in the DES cases. <em>See, e.g., Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories, </em>26 <em>Cal.</em>3d 588, 163 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>132, 607 P.2d 924, <em>cert. </em>den. 449 <em>US. </em>912, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>285, 66 L.Ed.2d 140 (1980); and the other DES cases cited <em>infra. </em>The Federal Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has formulated rules and regulations which encompass the licensing, testing, production, distribution, review and approval of each DPT vaccine. One such requirement is that each manufacturer must make a written record of the name and address of each person to whom a specific lot of the vaccine has been distributed and that record must be retained for no less than five years after the date of manufacture or six months after the expiration date for that product, whichever is later. 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 73.502(b)(1) (1971); 21 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 600.12(a)(b)(l) (1986). Likewise, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>the doctor and his drug distributor had retained their records for several years, they then destroyed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Defendants, however, mispereeive the element of superior access to information discussed in some cases. It is not an element of a cause of action; rather, it is a consideration to be weighed in a balancing process to determine whether some form of collective responsibility should fairly be applied. In the case before us, there is no question that the applicable statute of limitations has not run since this action was filed during the infant plaintiffs minority. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-21. Even if there had been no tolling statute, the cause of action may well have been preserved under New Jersey\u2019s discovery rule. <em>Vispisiano v. Ashland Chemical Company, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>416, 437 (1987); <em>Lopez v. </em>Swyer, 62 <em>N.J. </em>267 (1973); <em>cf. Hadden v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>716 (App.Div.1986), certif. den. 104 <em>N.J. </em>441 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">While the cause of action itself is not barred, a court might nevertheless consider that the imposition of a theory of collective responsibility should be governed by considerations of laches, <em>i.e., </em>an unexplained or inexcusable delay in enforcing a known right resulting in prejudice to the other party. <em>See Gladden v. Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System Trustee Board, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 370-371 (App.Div.1979). But, based upon the limited information before us, it appears that plaintiffs here are without fault in making a late, but not time-barred, claim. There was no showing that the child\u2019s mother knew or should have known that encephalitis was a recognized side effect of the DPT vaccine and that she consequently should have made the connection between the vaccination and her daughter\u2019s condition, especially since she was reassured of the lack of connection by the treating physician. <em>Cf. Vispisiano v. Ashland Chemical Company, supra; Lopez v. Swyer, supra. </em>If there is a serious factual dispute as to this point and a trial judge determines that it would be equitably inappropriate to apply a doctrine of collective responsibility under particular facts, the issue should be resolved on remand. <em>Abel v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>418 <em>Mich. </em>311, 343 <em>N.W.2d </em>164, 173 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>(1984), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Abel, </em>469 <em>US. </em>833, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>123, 83 L.Ed.2d 65 (1984). Such a future resolution does not affect the underlying ruling here <em>on </em>appeal that no cause of action exists under any theory of collective responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">This \u201claches\u201d consideration does not directly meet defendants\u2019 allegation that they are not in a superior position to plaintiff to determine which manufacturer\u2019s product affected the infant plaintiff, and that their inability to identify which of them was the manufacturer was due to plaintiffs\u2019 failure to assert their claim promptly. Although the federal requirements mandate only a five year retention of drug records, defendants knew that their drugs were being administered to young children and that a devastating and disabling illness might be caused in a small but acknowledged percentage of cases. Recognizing that statutes of limitation have infancy and incompetency tolling provisions, the drug companies could have chosen to retain their records for a longer period of time, thus obviating the identification problem now before the court. Plaintiffs had no similar ability to resolve the identification problem. This issue, therefore, presents no bar to our determining whether a collective responsibility doctrine is viable in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Defendants next claim that their products are not generic or fungible, and, therefore, all doctrines of collective responsibility are inapplicable. Even acknowledging that defendants\u2019 products are protected by patents or trade secrets and differ from each other, we must focus upon the fact that each of the products subjected the user to a similar recognized danger of encephalitis. It makes little difference to a consumer what the internal biological or chemical nature of a product may be if it might cause a specific common health problem. Since there is then no way to determine the particular manufacturer\u2019s product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>on the basis of the result for the purpose of applying a doctrine of collective responsibility, the products must be considered virtually identical. The differences in their composition, except as such differences might affect the frequency of the adverse result, must be considered as irrelevant as the color of the label on the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">There are, however, differences alleged by defendants in the products insofar as the frequency of encephalopathic disorder caused by each defendant\u2019s vaccine. In particular, Eli Lilly asserts that its DPT product, Tri-Solgen, was fundamentally different from that marketed by the other manufacturers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Each manufacturer, however, has records concerning the incidence of chronic encephalitis resulting from the administration of its vaccine. We see no impediment to a defendant introducing such evidence insofar as it affects the probability that its vaccine caused the injury. Since, as noted <em>infra, </em>we have directed the trial judge to proceed applying a risk-modified market share analysis, with several, as opposed to joint and several, responsibility, proof by a defendant of the reduced incidence of encephalitis would result in a proportional lowering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>of the percentage responsibility for such defendant. This factor, therefore, is relevant, but not exculpating, so long as there is a discernible and quantifiable incidence of the disease from the administration of the product.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Defendants also assert that their vaccines are not a suitable subject for collective responsibility since the toxicity which could cause encephalitis varies not only from manufacturer but also from batch to batch. Were this a true \u201cbad batch\u201d case, <em>i.e., </em>a claim concerning a product which ordinarily created no problems but due to some error in manufacture became toxic, identification of the particular defendant would be mandatory. <em>See, e.g., Centrone v. C. Schmidt &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>114 <em>Misc.2d </em>840, 452 N.Y.S.2d 299, 304 (Sup.Ct.1982); <em>Sheffield v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>144 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>583, 192 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>870 (Ct.App.1983). If defendants advance this \u201cbad batch\u201d defense, it would be incumbent upon plaintiff to prove which manufacturer put the defective product on the market. Plaintiffs, however, have asserted that the product was defective in that it could have been supplied under then-existing technology in a form untainted by the toxins which caused the encephalitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Defendants next urge that the product was so inherently beneficial and the incidence of problems was so low that the public interest demands a freedom from liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record is replete with defendants\u2019 praise of the DPT vaccine and the devastating consequences to the contrary if these vaccines are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>be removed from the market. We recognize the benefits of defendants\u2019 products. Indeed, in parallel situations where potential liability might have removed similar pharmaceutical products from the market place, Congress has recognized the problem by enacting immunity legislation. <em>See e.g., National Swine Flu Immunization Program of 1976, </em>Pub.L. No. 94-380, 90 <em>Stat. </em>1113 (1976). Also compare recently enacted New Jersey legislation, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-4, absolving a manufacturer from liability for harm caused by a failure to warn.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">[i]f the warning or instruction given in connection with a drug ... has been approved or prescribed by the federal Food and Drug Administration under the \u2018Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 52 <em>Stat. </em>1040, 21 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 301 <em>et seq.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">in which case there is a rebuttable presumption \u201cthat the warning or instruction is adequate.\u201d In short, if it is legislatively determined that the social utility of producing the product, even if defective, far outweighs the risk to the few individuals who may be harmed, either Congress or the State Legislature may grant an appropriate immunity. But no such immunity now exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Compliance with even existing federal regulations might well, upon proper proof, be found to bar plaintiffs\u2019 claims insofar as they are based upon a failure to warn. <em>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>789 <em>F.2d </em>181 (3d Cir.1986), <em>cert. </em>den. \u2014 U.S.-, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>907, 93 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 857 (1987) (involving adequacy of cigarette labelling and advertising); <em>McQuaid v. Burlington County Memorial Hospital, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 475-476 (App. Div.1986) (raising the question whether FDA action dictating the warning to be given \u201cdoes not indeed provide [the drug manufacturer] with an absolute defense\u201d); and compare <em>Feldman v. Lederle Laboratories Inc., </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>429, 446 (1984), which left open the issue whether compliance with FDA warnings absolved defendants from strict liability and which found the record in that case insufficient.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">to analyze fully the risk and benefits of prescription drugs and to conclude that drug manufacturers should be immune from strict liability for failure to produce drugs that are safe, suitable and fit for their intended purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Unlike the complete product immunity in the cases involving swine flu vaccine, section 4 of the New Jersey statute<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the cited cases all involve warning immunities, and thus are limited to failure to warn cases. This, however, is a design defect case, and the warning preemption cases are inapposite. Yet there are also design defect preemption considerations, not yet treated in New Jersey law, but cogently explored in the DPT cases of <em>Toner v. Lederle Laboratories, </em>112 <em>Idaho </em>328, 343 n.12, 732 P.2d 297, 311 n.12 (1987), and <em>Hurley v. Lederle Lab., Div. of Am. Cyanamid, </em>651 <em>F.Supp. </em>993, 1003-1006 (E.D.Tex.1986). We express no opinion as to this issue which also should be fully explored by the trial judge on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">A related question involves the defense to a product claim involving a pharmaceutical product envisioned by comment k to <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 402A at 353-354. The comment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">There are some products which, in the present state of human knowledge, are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use. These are especially common in the field of drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The comment then gives as an example the Pasteur treatment of rabies and notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">The same is true of many other drugs, vaccines and the like, many of which for this very reason cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the prescription of a physician. ... The seller of such products, again with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed and proper warning is given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely because he has under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>taken to supply the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended with a known but apparently reasonable risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><em>See Calabrese v. Trenton State College, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145 (App.Div.1978), aff\u2019d on other grounds 82 <em>N.J. </em>321 (1980) (affirming summary judgment for manufacturer, distributor and retailer of drug, and classifying anti-rabies vaccine as an \u201cunavoidably unsafe\u201d product as defined by comment k of <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 402A); <em>Brody v. Overlook Hospital, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331 (App.Div.1974), aff'd 66 <em>N.J. </em>448 (1975) (finding blood, contaminated by hepatitis antibodies not then discoverable, as falling within the \u201cunavoidably unsafe\u201d product definition of comment k of \u00a7 402A). But we note from the discussion in <em>Feldman v. Lederle Laboratories, supra, </em>of comment k to <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 402A, that New Jersey does not read comment k as granting immunity from responsibility upon all makers of prescription drugs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">Comment k immunizes from strict liability the manufacturers of some products, including certain drugs, that are unavoidably unsafe. However, we see no reason to hold as a matter of law and policy that all prescription drugs that are unsafe are unavoidably so. Drugs, like any other products, may contain defects that could have been avoided by better manufacturing or design. Whether a drug is unavoidably unsafe should be decided on a case-by-case basis; we perceive no justification for giving all prescription drug manufacturers a blanket immunity from strict liability manufacturing and design defect claims under comment k. [97 <em>N.J. </em>at 447].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Plaintiffs have here assumed the burden of showing that all of the DPT vaccines manufactured by all of the defendants were in fact defective, in that by defendants\u2019 applying the existing scientific knowledge and technology available at the time of manufacture and distribution, the contaminating toxins need not have been present in the serum. The products were not, they claim, \u201cunavoidably\u201d unsafe. But defendants have the burden of proving their affirmative defense under comment k. <em>See Toner v. Lederle Laboratories, supra, </em>112 <em>Idaho </em>at 339-340, 732 P.2d at 308-309 (applying New Jersey and California authorities). This factual issue in a DPT case, if a viable cause of action exists under one or more of the theories of collective responsibility, must be resolved at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>F.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Next, defendants allege that plaintiffs have not eliminated other possible causes for Deanna\u2019s tragic condition. This also was a factual issue which properly was not reached by the trial judge, since he determined the matter on the basis of the lack of a viable legal theory upon which liability could have been imposed. This, as well as the other fact-sensitive matters urged by defendants but not passed upon by the Law Division, are not before us on this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Many, if not all, of these issues would have required time-consuming and expensive proof on the part of both plaintiffs and defendants, and the trial judge was correct in disposing of this case on the basis of the underlying legal issue where there was controlling appellate precedent. Since many of the factual issues also would have been raised with respect to the remaining defendant, the treating physician who prescribed the vaccine, we granted leave to appeal this interlocutory determination. Also, this case provides a vehicle for reviewing the decision in <em>Namm, </em>unfettered by the factual analysis which would have been required if the trial judge had disposed of each of these issues. We recognize that in similar situations the Supreme Court has remanded matters to the Law Division for expansion of the factual records. <em>See Wolfsbruck v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>252 (1985), and <em>Salomon v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>58, 59-60 (1984). Although the <em>Salomon </em>case, after expansion of the record, apparently is to be reheard by the Supreme Court at some future time, it appears unfair to require both plaintiffs and defendants in this case to expend tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in trial costs without knowing whether a viable theory of collective responsibility exists in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">II. <em>Theories of Collective Responsibility.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">This court in <em>Namm, </em>citing <em>Gray v. U.S., </em>445 <em>F.Supp. </em>337, 338 (S.D.Tex.1978), and textual sources, stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u2018it is a fundamental principle of products liability law that a plaintiff must prove, as an essential element of his case, that the defendant manufacturer actually made the particular product which caused the injury.\u2019 [178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 27].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The <em>Namm </em>court also cited <em>Scanlon v. General Motors Corp., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>582, 590 (1974) for this principle. An examination of <em>Scanlon, </em>however, shows that the Supreme Court focused upon the condition of the product when it left the manufacturer\u2019s hands, as the identity of the manufacturer was not in dispute. We find no Supreme Court authority in New Jersey imposing an absolute requirement of identification of a manufacturer. In the usual case it is only \u201cone who sells <em>\\i.e., </em>a manufacturer, distributor or a retailer] any product in a defective condition\u201d who is subject to strict liability under <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 402A, and there is an extensive series of Supreme Court cases adopting this general principle. We disagree, however, with <em>Namm\u2019s </em>finding that any Supreme Court case prohibits our holding each of those who sell substantially similar products (the effects of which after the passage of time cannot readily be distingished from one another) collectively as \u201csellers\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 402A.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The <em>Namm </em>court next determined, and our dissenting colleague agrees, that \u201ctraditional concepts and basic principles would of necessity be either distorted or abandoned altogether\u201d if any theory of alternative liability was adopted. 178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 34. Further, the court found, quoting a workers\u2019 compensation case, that an intermediate appellate court should \u201cadhere to existing laws of the State and in the absence of appropriate amendatory legislation\u201d should defer to the Supreme Court. <em>Ibid. </em>We fully subscribe to this principle where there is Supreme Court precedent or even dictum to the contrary, or where the Legislature has spoken and the matter is thus taken from the purview of the common law. The majority and dissent welcome the Legislature\u2019s entrance into this field, demonstrated by the legislation cited above. But we note that the specific problem before us has not been addressed in the new Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>If an intermediate appellate or trial court must decide an issue where there is no binding appellate authority or legislation, then it is within the authority of that court, and even its duty, to resolve the issue before it consistent with the court\u2019s understanding of the governing law. Here, where there is no indication of the Supreme Court\u2019s antipathy to collective responsibility, we perceive our role as one to determine what the Supreme Court would do if faced with the problem before us. <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>471, 475 (1967), app. dism. 390 <em>US. </em>745, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1443, 20 L.Ed.2d 276 (1968); <em>State v. Dolton, </em>146 <em>N.J.Super. </em>111, 115 (App.Div.), certif. den. 74 <em>N.J. </em>252 (1977). The denial of potential liability by <em>Namm </em>was as much a policy statement as our recognition, refinement and application of the recognized tort principles discussed herein. The rejection of these theories which have been developed in states with views of tort law similar to our own would be an unwarranted deviation from what we perceive to be a course already charted by our Supreme Court. Not to follow this course would constitute the very \u201cpolicy shift\u201d decried both in <em>Namm, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 35, and the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Insofar as the central issue of collective responsibility is concerned, the Supreme Court stated in <em>Salomon v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">... we neither approve nor disapprove of <em>Namm v. Charles E. Frosst &amp; Co., supra. </em>In light of our decision to remand the matter to the trial court, we need not pass on validity of any of the potential causes of action or defenses. [98 <em>N.J. </em>at 61].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Such a statement cannot be read as precluding our disagreement with our brethren in <em>Namm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">We look to the past decisions of our Supreme Court to determine whether some form of collective responsibility would be antithetical to principles applied in related fields. We note first that where the issue is not the identity of the manufacturer of a product, but rather the identity of the defendant which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>caused a particular injury, the Supreme Court has not hesitated to shift the burden of proof to defendants to exculpate themselves. <em>Anderson v. Somberg, </em>134 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1 (App.Div. 1973), aff\u2019d 67 <em>N.J. </em>291 (1975), <em>cert. </em>den. 423 <em>U.S. </em>929, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>279, 46 L.Ed.2d 258 (1975). Similarly, where a plaintiff is unable to identify which of several successive carriers damaged plaintiffs property, the Supreme Court placed the burden upon the carriers to come forward and exculpate themselves. <em>NOPCO v. Blaw-Knox Co., </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>274 (1971). Also, in a recent toxic tort case, the Supreme Court in <em>Ayers v. Jackson Tp., </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 585-586 (1987), noted in dictum that in mass exposure litigation where identification of the culpable defendant presents a causation problem, resort might be had to the alternative liability theory expressed in <em>Summers v. Tice, </em>33 <em>Cal.2d </em>80, 199 P.2d 1 (1948), a case in which plaintiff could not prove which defendant was responsible for his injury, and under those special facts the burden of proof was placed upon defendants to disprove causation. Indeed, our Supreme Court has been in the forefront of jurisdictions to recognize and to protect those injured by the wrongful acts of others. <em>See, e.g., Kelly v. Gwinnell, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>538 (1984); <em>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>358 (1960). We, therefore, have no reason to suppose that the Supreme Court would reject all theories of collective responsibility, provided the rights of the defendant manufacturers to exculpate themselves are scrupulously protected. <em>Cf. Ferrigno v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">There are four basic theories upon which some measure of industry-wide responsibility has been based: (1) concert of action, (2) alternative liability, (3) enterprise or industry-wide liability, and (4) the market-share modification of enterprise or alternative liability. We will briefly examine each theory, citing some relevant cases expounding the principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The concert of action theory is premised upon the substantial assistance of various producers of a product to each other to accomplish a tortious result. The parties</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">in pursuance of a common plan or design to commit a tortious act, actively take part in it, or further it by cooperation or request, or ... lend aid or encouragement to the wrongdoer, or ratify and adopt the wrongdoer\u2019s acts done for their benefit____ [W. Keaton, D. Dobbs, R. Keaton &amp; D. Owen, <em>Prosser &amp; Keaton on the Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 46 at 323 (5th ed. 1984) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">The concert of action theory is codified in <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 876 at 315, and was applied in <em>Abel v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra, </em>418 <em>Mich, </em>at 336-339, 343 N.W.2d at 176, and in <em>Bichler v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>55 N.Y.2d 571, 436 N.E.2d 182, 450 N.Y.S.2d 776 (1982). The \u201cconcert of action\u201d is akin to a conspiracy, a label placed upon the misrepresentation and suppression of health hazard information concerning asbestos in <em>Nicolet v. Nutt, </em>525 A.2d 146, 150 (Del.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">The alternative liability theory is applied where one of a group of tortfeasors is responsible, in which case the burden shifts to the other defendants to exculpate themselves. If they fail to do so, they are liable. <em>See Anderson v. Somberg, supra. </em>This theory is supported by <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 433B(3) at 441-442:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-13\">Where the conduct of two or more actors is tortious, and it is proved that harm has been caused to the plaintiff by only one of them, but there is uncertainty as to which one has caused it, the burden is upon each such actor to prove that he has not caused the harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-14\">Comments g and h elaborate upon the theory.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-15\">g. The rule stated in Subsection (3) applies only where it is proved that each of two or more actors has acted tortiously, and that the harm has resulted from the conduct of some one of them. On these issues the plaintiff has still the burden of proof. The rule stated has no application to cases of alternative liability, where there is no proof that the conduct of more than one actor has been tortious at all. In such a case the plaintiff has the burden of proof both as to the tortious conduct and as to the causal relation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-16\">h. The cases thus far decided in which the rule stated in Subsection (3) has been applied all have been cases in which all of the actors involved have been joined as defendants. All of these cases have involved conduct simultaneous in time, or substantially so, and all of them have involved conduct of substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the same character, creating substantially the same risk of harm, on the part of each actor. It is possible that cases may arise in which some modification of the rule stated may be necessary because of complications arising from the fact that one of the actors involved is not or cannot be joined as a defendant, or because of the effect of lapse of time, or because of substantial differences in the character of the conduct of the actors or the risks which they have created. Since such cases have not arisen, and the situations which might arise are difficult to forecast, no attempt is made to deal with such problems in this Section. The rule stated in Subsection (3) is not intended to preclude possible modifications if such situations call for it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><em>See Minnich v. Ashland Oil Co., Inc., </em>15 <em>Ohio St.Bd </em>396, 397, 473 N.E.2d 1199, 1200-1201 (1984); <em>Bottazzi v. Petroleum Helicopters, Inc., </em>664 <em>F.2d </em>49 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Abel v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra; </em>and <em>Summers v. Tice, supra, </em>(applying the theory in a pure negligence action).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The enterprise or industry-wide liability theory imposes liability on all members of an industry which has produced a product causing the particular harm. The defendants then have the opportunity to exculpate themselves. This theory has been described as a hybrid of the concert of action and alternative liability theories. <em>See </em>Comment, \u201cDES and A Proposed Theory of Enterprise Liability,\u201d 46 <em>Fordham L.Rev. </em>963, 974 (1978). The theory was described as one which imposes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">... the industrywide standard ... [as] the cause of the plaintiffs injury, just as defendants\u2019 joint plan is the cause of injury in the traditional concert of action plea. Each defendant\u2019s adherence perpetuates this standard, which results in the manufacture of the particular unidentifiable injury-producing product. Therefore, each industry member has contributed to plaintiff\u2019s injury. <em>[Id. </em>at 997].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-8\"><em>See Hall v. E.I. DuPont DeNemours &amp; Co., Inc., </em>345 <em>F.Supp. </em>353 (E.D.N.Y.1972) (children injured by exploding blasting caps; defendants through their common trade association chose not to place warnings directly on each blasting cap and neglected to utilize other safety measures).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">The last recognized theory is a \u201cmarket-share\u201d modification of the enterprise or alternative liability theory. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>responsibility imposed on each defendant, rather than being equally liable for the damages caused by the product, is limited to the percentage share which that defendant held of the relative market. This theory was propounded in <em>Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories, supra, </em>where the court ruled that all of the defendants who manufactured DES</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">... will be held liable for the proportion of the judgment represented by its share of that market unless it demonstrates that it could not have made the product which caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries. [26 <em>Cal.3d </em>at 612, 607 P.2d at 937, 163 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 145].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">In explaining the fairness of the doctrine, the <em>Sindell </em>court quoted the <em>Fordham Law Review </em>article and explained that if all of the products were identifiable, each defendant would in the aggregate be responsible for its product and the damages caused thereby in the same proportion as the share of the relevant market it held. Therefore, a market share theory permits the approximation on a case-by-case basis of the same responsibility that each defendant would have borne had the identification problem not been present. The theory permits injured plaintiffs to recover from responsible parties in cases where identification of the particular manufacturer is difficult if not impossible. 26 <em>Cal.3d </em>at 613, 607 <em>P. </em>2d at 937-938, 163 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 145. This theory, also rejected in <em>Namm, </em>had been accepted in <em>Ferrigno v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">We perceive some problems even with the apparently fair principles of <em>Sindell, </em>which have been both praised and criticized, and both followed and rejected, in the seven years since the decision. But, contrary to defendants\u2019 criticism of <em>Sindell, </em>the opinion imposes no liability upon innocent manufacturers. As stated in <em>Sheffield v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra, </em>the rule of <em>Summers v. Tice, </em>followed in <em>Sindell, </em>\u201conly applies where it is proven that each of two or more actors has acted tortiously.\u201d 144 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>at 878, 192 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 878. As in <em>Sheffield, </em>the <em>Sindell </em>approach may be distinguished here if a similar defect is not common to the products of all of the defendants; but the \u201cbad batch\u201d theory applied in <em>Sheffield </em>appears unavail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>able to defendants in our case. We have before us a case alleging a design defect, rather than a manufacturing flaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Some courts outside California have expressed support for or directly followed the <em>Sindell </em>principles. <em>George v. Parke-Davis, </em>107 <em>Wash.2d </em>584, 733 P.2d 507 (1987); <em>Goldman v.

Similarly, in <em>Martin v. Abbott Laboratories, </em>102 <em>Wash.2d </em>581, 689 P.2d 368 (1984), the Washington court, as explained <em>infra, </em>expanded the California market share approach, but utilized the theory in part to establish liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Other courts have been equivocal. In <em>Celotex Corp. v. Copeland, </em>471 So.2d 533 (Fla.1985), the Florida Supreme Court determined that an asbestos worker was able to identify at least a majority of the manufacturers which supplied the asbestos that had allegedly injured him. While recognizing the market share theory as the majority view, the court determined the approach adopted by the intermediate appellate court, 447 So.2d 908 (Fla.Ct.App.1984), to be inappropriate to the facts of its case and found it unnecessary \u201cto accept or reject the market theory approach.\u201d 471 So.2d at 539. Similarly, in <em>Bixler by Bixler v. Avondale Mills, </em>405 <em>N W. </em>2d 428 (Minn.App. 1987) , the Minnesota Court of Appeals found the facts of the case to be inappropriate for the adoption of a theory of collective responsibility. The Minnesota Supreme Court, in remand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>ing the matter in an earlier phase of the litigation, had expressed \u201cno opinion as to whether we would adopt\u201d a rule of market share liability. <em>Bixler by Bixler v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., </em>376 <em>N.W.2d </em>209, 214 (Minn.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In <em>Payton v. Abbott Labs, </em>386 <em>Mass. </em>540, 437 <em>N.E.2d </em>171 (1982) the plaintiffs were a class alleging injury as a result of DES ingestion by their mothers. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court chose not to follow <em>Sindell </em>because of the court\u2019s concern with the inability of a non-negligent defendant or one who could prove a lack of causation to exculpate itself. 386 <em>Mass, </em>at 572-573, 437 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 189. On the basis of the record before it, the court indicated that it would not create a theory under which plaintiffs could recover without meeting the requirement of identification of the manufacturer, especially since the matter was brought to it merely on a certification of a question from the Federal District Court. It stated, however</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqz\">That is not to say that on an adequate record this court would not recognize some relaxation of the traditional identification requirement in appropriate circumstances so as to allow recovery against a negligent defendant of that portion of a plaintiff\u2019s damages which is represented by that defendant\u2019s contribution of DES to the market in the relevant period of time. [386 <em>Mass, </em>at 574, 437 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 190],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">We have indicated, however, the view that we might permit recovery from those defendants shown to be negligent to the extent of their participation in the DES market, even though the plaintiffs cannot identify the particular source of DES which their mothers ingested. [386 <em>Mass, </em>at 575, 437 N.E.2d at 190],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The case of <em>McCormack v. Abbott Laboratories, </em>617 <em>F.Supp. </em>1521 (D.Mass.1985) provided the Federal District Court in Massachusetts with the factual scenario envisioned in the <em>Payton </em>dictum. In <em>McCormick, </em>the court utilized a market share theory, presuming that all of the named defendants held equal shares of the market. However, the court gave the defendants an opportunity to prove their actual market share. <em>Id. </em>at 1526-1527.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The federal courts generally have split on whether to adopt any of the four recognized theories. Some have accepted one or more of the theories. <em>See, e.g., Bottazzi v. Petroleum Helicopters, Inc., supra, </em>(alternative liability theory); <em>Borel v. Fibreboard Paper Prod. Corp., </em>493 FI 2d 1076 (5th Cir.1973), <em>cert. </em>den. 419 <em>U.S. </em>869, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>127, 42 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>107 (1974) (enterprise liability theory); <em>McCormack v. Abbott Laboratories, supra, </em>(market share theory); <em>McElhaney v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra, </em>(alternative liability theory); <em>Hardy v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., supra, </em>(market share theory); <em>Morris v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co., </em>573 <em>F.Supp. </em>1324, 1326-1330 (C.D.Cal. 1983) (DPT case applying a market share theory); <em>Hall v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., supra, </em>(enterprise liability theory). Other federal courts have rejected the theories, generally for the reason that the states in which they sit have not yet adopted any of the theories. <em>See, e.g., Thompson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>714 F.2d 581, 583 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. </em>den. 465 <em>U.S. </em>1102,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1598, 80 L.Ed.2d 129 (1984); <em>Morton v. Abbott Laboratories, </em>538 <em>F.Supp. </em>593, 599 (M.D.Fla.1982); <em>Mizell v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. </em>526 <em>F.Supp. </em>589, 596 (D.S.C.1981); <em>Ryan v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>514 <em>F.Supp. </em>1004, 1018-1019 (D.S.C. 1981). Still other federal courts have rejected the theories on the basis that the product involved did not lend itself to a market share or any other collective responsibility analysis. <em>See, e.g., Hurley v. Lederle Labs., supra, </em>(also finding federal preemption in case involving DPT serum); <em>Hannon v. Waterman S.S. Corp., </em>567 <em>F.Supp. </em>90 (E.D.La.1983) (noting also that plaintiff had identified some asbestos suppliers but failed to join the country\u2019s largest supplier); <em>In re Related Asbestos Cases, </em>543 <em>F.Supp. </em>1152,1158 (N.D.Cal.1982). In the last-cited case, the court held that the market share theory cannot be applied in all contexts and that asbestos fibers, being of several varieties and used in varying quantities by the defendants in their products, had differing harmful effects. Also, there were significant difficulties in the case defining what constituted the, relevant product market and which defendants manufactured or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>distributed the products over the extended period during which plaintiffs were exposed to asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Apparently, the highest courts of only two states, Missouri and Iowa, have unqualifiedly rejected all theories of collective responsibility. In <em>Zafft v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>676 <em>S.W.</em>2d 241 (Mo.1984), a DES case, the Missouri Supreme Court on a public policy basis rejected all theories of collective responsibility. The court stated that a contrary decision would \u201cdiscourage desired pharmaceutical research and development while adding little incentive to production of safe products.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247. In <em>Mulcahy v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>386 <em>N.W.2d </em>67 (Iowa 1986), another DES case, the Iowa Supreme Court on a certified question noted the inapplicability of the alternative liability and enterprise liability theories to DES cases. It rejected the market share theory on policy grounds, calling it \u201csocial engineering more appropriately within the legislative domain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76. <em>And see Burnside v. Abbott Laboratories, </em>351 <em>Pa.Super. </em>264, 505 A.2d 973, 986-987 (Sup.Ct.1985) (where an intermediate appellate court expressed antipathy to all theories; but further noted that all defendants before the court could have exculpated themselves under the market share theory on the facts of the case).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Another state had extended the <em>Sindell </em>rationale. The Wisconsin Supreme Court in <em>Collins v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra, </em>expanded market share responsibility under the <em>Sindell </em>rationale to require suit against merely one supplier<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> who then could reduce its liability by joining other manufacturers. A judgment against multiple defendants would be based upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>\u201ccomparative negligence scheme\u201d one factor of which is the extent of the defendants\u2019 market. 342 <em>N.W.2d </em>at 50-54.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Similarly, in <em>Martin v. Abbott Laboratories, supra, </em>the Supreme Court of Washington, rather than recognizing any of the established theories, independently adopted a modified market share theory. Like the <em>Collins </em>court, the Washington court expanded liability by permitting a plaintiff to join but one manufacturer and prove that the defendant manufactured or marketed the product (there DES) which caused the injury. The burden then would be shifted to the defendant to prove its percentage share of the market and to implead other potential defendants to reduce its presumptive equal share of the market. The court imposed an added stipulation that those defendants remaining in the case were presumed to have produced the entire market upon which the final percentages of liability were to be based unless they proved that they had a smaller portion of the total market by reason of the participation of other unjoined manufacturers. 689 P.2d at 382-383.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Recognizing these different available theories of collective responsibility and mindful of some jurisdictions\u2019 rejection of all such theories, we now also adopt a modified market share approach. Our analysis differs somewhat from that of Wisconsin in <em>Collins </em>or Washington in <em>Martin </em>in that it gives each defendant a fuller opportunity for exculpation. We find such an approach in keeping with the guiding principles of <em>Anderson v. Somberg, supra, </em>67 <em>N.J </em>at 298-303 (plurality opinion). A plaintiff should first demonstrate that the specific manufacturer of a defective product proven to have caused the injury cannot be identified, and join the manufacturers of a substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>tial share of the relevant market, defined as all who could have distributed the product to the plaintiff. Once this has been accomplished, the burden is placed upon the defendants to exculpate themselves by proving either non-participation, possession of reduced market share or that their product engendered a lower risk. Our aim should be to determine the percentage of the potential risk to the plaintiff caused by each manufacturer of the product, and in this respect our resolution of this issue departs somewhat from a pure market share analysis. As we see our risk-modified market share liability, it most closely defines responsibility as proportional to the potential danger to the public created by the risk of each defendant\u2019s product as that risk specifically affected the injured plaintiff.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Probably the best foundation for the application of this modified market share theory is the seminal decision of <em>Summers v. Tice, supra. </em>There, plaintiff went hunting with the two defendants who were cautioned to stay in line and be careful. However, when a bird was flushed, both defendants fired, even though plaintiff was directly in the line of fire and clearly visible. The one pellet struck plaintiff in his eye and another in his upper lip, but the sources of neither shot could be identified. The defendants were held jointly and severally liable, 199 P.2d at 3-4, and the decision was codified in <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d \u00a7 433B(3), quoted earlier.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Defendants have urged that the case before us is distinguishable from <em>Summers, </em>since in <em>Summers </em>all possible negligent parties were before the court, yet in this case there is an additional supplier of DPT vaccine who was not joined, and now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>since oral argument before us, it appears that another defendant has settled. Is it necessary for all the defendants to be before the court? While we take no issue with the California requirement that defendants representing a substantial portion of the market be joined, we see no basis to require that all defendants be before the court. No defendant will be responsible for a greater portion of the judgment than that attributable to the risk it created. We recognize that some manufacturers in our case, by dint of their larger market shares, supplied many more doses of the vaccine than others. This would be the equivalent in <em>Summers </em>terms of one of the defendants having fired more shots, thereby increasing the likelihood that he was the one who hit the plaintiff. But in our case, Eli Lilly also contends that its product was safer than that of its competitors and that it can quantify this difference. This might be the equivalent in <em>Summers </em>terms of one defendant contending that he used shells with fewer pellets and, therefore, was less likely to have been the one to have hit plaintiff. Again, if the differences can be suitably quantified, there is no reason why the fact finder could not adjust the respective market shares, recognizing the varying risks of harm created by each defendant\u2019s product. <em>See </em>Rosenberg, \u201cThe Causal Connection in Mass Exposure Cases: A \u2018Public Law\u2019 Vision of the Tort System,\u201d 97 <em>Harv.L.Rev. </em>851, 867 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Out of a sense of fairness for defendants, we have recognized in this case a risk-modified market share theory, rather than one imposing equal responsibility or one based solely on the market share of each supplier. This same motive compels us to look further into defendants\u2019 responsibility for the eventual payment of any judgment. <em>Sindell </em>does not specify whether the responsibility of defendants would be joint and several or several. This factor becomes relevant, if in the event of a bankruptcy of a defendant or other inability either to join a defendant or to collect a judgment, any defendant pays more than its allocated share. This issue was considered in <em>Martin v. Abbott Laboratories, supra, </em>689 P.2d at 384-388 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>reconsidered in <em>George v. Parke-Davis, supra, </em>733 P.2d at 513. The premise of the market share theory is that it makes little difference in the aggregate if, for example, a defendant is liable for 100% of the damages on proof of actual manufacture in 30% of the cases or for 30% of the damages where identification cannot be established in 100% of the cases. But it would distort this reasoning if a missing defendant\u2019s responsibility was to be imposed upon one actually joined in the action. Under New Jersey\u2019s liberal long-arm rule, <em>R. </em>4:4-4(c) and (e), all manufacturers and distributors of a product that should be subject to the market share analysis can procedurally be joined by a plaintiff. If a particular potential defendant is defunct or otherwise is not joined, the other defendants should not be penalized. But neither should the missing defendant\u2019s presence or absence in the suit affect the actual defendants\u2019 full exposure to the claims engendered by their percentage of the relevant market. Through discovery, a plaintiff can make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of market and risk percentages, after which defendants can come forward and attempt to reduce these figures; but it does not appear to us to be unfair to place the initial burden of allocation on the plaintiff. Under these special circumstances we further determine that the Comparative Negligence Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.1 <em>et seq., </em>and specifically 2A:15-5.3, would be inapplicable to recoveries under this market share theory where the liability as imposed already takes into account the allocation among or between defendants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In short, the responsibility of defendants should be several, rather than joint and several. <em>Prosser &amp; Keaton, Torts, </em>(4 ed.) \u00a7 103, p. 714 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">We should also briefly discuss the applicable market upon which the trial court must focus. Unlike some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>asbestos cases noted earlier where exposure occurred at different sites over a long period of time, the market in a case such as the one before us is easily defined.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A distributor serviced the prescribing doctor and, therefore, the proper inquiry is the percentages of doses of vaccine supplied to the doctor. If the doctor had preferences concerning one type of vaccine or another and can quantify the percentages used, so much the better; if not, these percentages can be reconstructed by existing sales records. The aim is not certainty but reasonable approximation.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">While we have here endorsed a risk-modified market share theory of manufacturers\u2019 responsibility in non-identification cases, with appropriate safeguards to defendants, we have also recognized that there are many defenses dependent upon the resolution of threshold factual issues. Principal among these are the issues of defect and preemption. Upon remand, the trial court should impose responsibility upon defendants only if the standards to which plaintiffs seek to hold defendants have not been preempted by federal regulation, and if plaintiffs otherwise demonstrate that the product, with its recognized utility, was indeed defective, given the existing technology when it was manufactured and distributed. <em>See Feldman v. Lederle Laboratories, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 452. We neither endorse nor encourage any wholesale liability of the drug industry, but only the imposition of liability insofar as a plaintiff is able to prove that a defendant has distributed a product that is not fit, suitable, and safe for its intended purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>We reiterate that we here determine only the narrow issue for which the interlocutory appeal was granted, namely whether New Jersey rejects all bases for collective responsibility in a case where the specific manufacturers of a proven defective product which was shown to have caused plaintiffs injuries cannot be identified. We have resolved this question, and, therefore, remand this matter to the Law Division for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-9\"> In addition to the named defendants, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Abbott Laboratories and The Upjohn Co. were granted leave to appear as <em>amici curiae.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\"> Deanna was born October 26, 1970.

Second, we see no merit to the theory. Under the logic of this approach, the majority manufacturer of a defective product marketed in a state by an entire industry would assume the responsibility for all injuries caused by the product in situations where the particular manufacturer could not be identified.

Moreover, the statement in <em>Toner </em>that Lederle\u2019s whole-cell vaccine, Tri-Immunol, remained the only licensed DPT vaccine distributed in the American market <em>{Ibid.), </em>also appears incorrect, in that other whole-cell manufacturers were licensed to produce and did produce DPT vaccines during the period in question. 50 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>51003-04 (Dec. 13, 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\"> This matter is further discussed <em>infra </em>as an appropriate modification of the market-share theory of collective responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\"> As noted in <em>Toner for Toner v.

I do so, and depart company with Judge Shebell, because of my reading of the judicial precedents, both inside and outside of New Jersey, and in the absence of controlling legislation. In the only analogous New Jersey cases our Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs whose cases had been dismissed in reliance on <em>Namm v. Charles E. Frosst &amp; Co., </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. 19 </em>(App.Div.1981), and \u201cremanded to the trial court to enable the parties to attempt to develop a more complete record relating to the issue of liability and proximate cause\u201d and to \u201creconsider the evidence to determine whether there are presented triable issues on the merits.\u201d <em>Wolfsbruck v.

Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>I agree with Judge Dreier that reliance upon <em>Namm, </em>a DES case, would be inappropriate in light of those remands. However, I also believe that consideration of the out-of-State DES cases is of limited value because of the differences between DES and DPT.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The text of a recent annotation states that enterprise or industry-wide liability has been imposed in drug cases only with respect to DES. Annotation, \u201c \u2018Concert of Activity,\u2019 \u2018Alternative Liability,\u2019 \u2018Enterprise Liability,\u2019 or similar theory as basis for imposing liability upon one or more manufacturers of defective uniform product, in absence of identification of manufacturer of precise unit or batch causing injury,\u201d 22 <em>A.L.R. </em>4th 183 (1983). After discussing the \u201cconcert of action\u201d and \u201calternative liability\u201d theories, the annotation states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">The third theory upon which recovery has been attempted is enterprise- or industry-wide liability. This theory of liability is a hybrid, derived from concepts of alternative and concurrent liability and the law of products liability to form a type of absolute liability. At the current time, it has been applied to three types of products: (1) diethylstilbesterol, a synthetic estrogen commonly known as DES; (2) blasting caps; and (3) asbestos. Under this theory the plaintiff can recover from all of the manufacturers of the product if he can show that the identity of the precise manufacturer of the injury-causing product cannot be established, and that the manufacturers jointly controlled the risks created by the product. Thus, after the plaintiff proves exposure and injury caused by the product, the burden shifts to the industry defendants to exculpate themselves by proving that an individual manufacturer's product could not have caused the injury. If the defendants cannot isolate causation, then liability is apportioned among the defendants in accordance with a percentage share of relevant sales market. Therefore, market share apportionment is an inherent part of enterprise liability which, at present, does not appear to stand as a viable contribution theory absent its use in the enterprise liability theoretical framework.

Before the introduction of this \u2018whose cell\u2019 vaccine, pertussis crippled and killed thousands of children annually in the United States. In 1934, when this country suffered its worst pertussis epidemic, there were 265,000 reported cases of pertussis per year, and 7500 related deaths. Hinman and Koplan, <em>Pertussis and Pertussis Vaccine: Reanalysis of Benefits, Risks and Costs, </em>Journal of the American Medical Association (June 15, 1984). By the early 1940\u2019s, pertussis was responsible for two and one-half times the number of deaths as all of the following diseases combined: measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, polio, meningitis, chicken pox, and scarlet fever. <em>Id. </em>Although the disease pertussis has been largely brought under control, it remains a leading cause of infant deaths in other countries which lack vaccination programs. Moreover, the bacteria causing pertussis remain persistent, even where the disease is under control, which leads to the substantial probability of epidemics whenever the use of the DPT vaccine declines significantly. For these reasons, federal public health authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institute of Health, and other agencies, have for almost forty years, promoted vaccination of the populace with a diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine containing the so-called 'whole ceil\u2019 pertussis vaccine, licensed by the FDA in 1949.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">However, it is suspected that the pertussis component of DPT can cause adverse reactions such as those listed on the package insert and suffered by plaintiff, since it is not well understood which parts of the organism are responsible for creating immunity. <em>See, </em>50 Fed.Reg. 51,043 (1985)____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">DPT vaccine is a prescription biological product, subject to the provisions of the Pure Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 <em>et seq.), </em>the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262), and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

Abbott Labs, </em>26 <em>Cal.M </em>588, 607 P.2d 924, 163 <em>CalRptr. </em>132 (Sup.Ct. 1980), <em>cert. den. </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>912, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>285-286, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>140 (1980), held that once plaintiff could show that DES caused the injury and that defendants produced a substantial percentage of the DES market, \u201cthe burden of proof would then shift to defendants to prove that they could not have made the substance that injured plaintiff,\u201d 573 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1325, and that \u201ceach defendant unable to sustain that burden would be held liable for the proportion of the judgment represented by its share of the market,\u201d <em>id. </em>The court, applying California law, denied defendants\u2019 motion to strike a claim for punitive damages and held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">[i]f plaintiffs succeed in establishing liability under the market share theory of <em>Sindell, </em>and can further show that one or more of the defendants marketed DPT with conscious disregard for human safety, they will be entitled to recover punitive damages from each such defendant. [573 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1330].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">While the <em>Morris </em>court was bound to follow California law and apply the law as established by the Supreme Court of California, I find significant that <em>Morris </em>upheld market share liability in the only DPT case I can find which directly addresses the issues with which we deal. Moreover, Idaho has declined to bar DPT claims as a matter of law. I am therefore prepared to join Judge Dreier in remanding because I am persuaded that even if we are overstepping prudent exercise of appellate authority and possibly recognizing a new theory of liability in New Jersey, <em>see Namm, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 35, the remand will permit development of an adequate record from which the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Court can review the matter in the context of specific fact finding. <em>Cf. Wolfsbruck v. Dow Chemical Co., supra; Salomon v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra. See also Toner v. Lederle Labs, supra, </em>732 P.2d at 308-309.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, as the manufacturers understood that the vaccine would be given to minors, placing the burden of identification on defendants who did not retain their records would promote existing legislative policy flowing from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 14-21 which tolls the statute of limitations until a minor reaches maturity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">I emphasize that no preemption issue has apparently been raised in the trial court. If one is raised, our remand does not preclude its consideration before trial, <em>cf. Hurley v. Lederle Labs, supra, </em>and the preemption issue should be considered in the context of rules, regulations and processes as they stood at times relevant to this case. <em>See also Feldman v. Lederle Labs, supra, </em>at 458-461.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">I also emphasize that comprehensive legislation in this area is appropriate. <em>Cf. In re Farrell, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>335, 341 (1987). It is particularly necessary to promote \u201cnew or experimental drugs for which \u2018there can be no assurance of safety.\u2019 \u201d <em>Toner v. Lederle Labs., supra, </em>732 P.2d at 307. I agree with much of what Judge Shebell says in dissent, but absent controlling legislation, we are bound to follow the judicial precedents available on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>subject.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, on remand the trial court should consider the impact of recent legislation which could affect the issues in this case as a matter of sound judicial policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">I therefore concur in the reversal of the summary pretrial dismissal and in the remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\"> The court explained that \"comment k excepts unavoidably unsafe products from strict liability only where the plaintiff alleges a design defect, and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>where the plaintiff alleges a manufacturing flaw or an inadequate warning.\u201d The court added that \"comment k intends to shield from strict liability products which cannot be designed more safely; however, if such products are mismanufactured or unaccompanied by adequate warning, then the seller may be liable even if the plaintiff cannot establish the seller\u2019s negligence.\" 732 <em>P.</em>2d at 305.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\"> However, \u201cthe immunity is not perpetual,\u201d 732 <em>P.</em>2d at 307, if new information or developments subsequently tip the balance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b669-11\"> 1 do not address whether or how the new legislation addressing liability, burdens and presumptions might affect this proposition. <em>See L. </em>1987, <em>c. </em>197, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 4, 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\"> In <em>NOPCO Chemical Div. v. Blaw-Knox Co., </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>274 (1971) and <em>Anderson v. Somberg, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>291 (1975), <em>cert. </em>den., 423 <em>U.S. </em>929, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>279, 46 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>258 (1975) one of the defendants had to be responsible for the injury to plaintiff. Here, plaintiffs still must prove causation, and the issue is whether the burden of showing identification should change once causation is proven. <em>NOPCO </em>and <em>Anderson </em>are distinguishable, but indicate the approach our Supreme Court has already taken in analogous situations. In any event, the issues which we address today relate only to whether plaintiffs can make any showing or whether the pretrial dismissal, as a matter of law, was proper irrespective of the proofs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\"> As Judge Dreier implies, slip opinion at 8, the problem in this case arises because defendants did not retain their records beyond the period required by the FDA. No preemption issue has been raised in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b672-10\"> As I have already stated, I do not consider the impact of legislation that has been enacted since oral argument in this case, as the parties do not claim that any such legislation controls. I do not think it appropriate for me to address that subject in the absence of briefing and argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b672-6\">SHEBELL, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-k\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">I fail to see why the principle relied upon in <em>Namm v. Charles E. Frosst &amp; Co., </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19, 33-35 (App.Div. 1981) does not remain viable. In <em>Namm </em>we refused to adopt the proposed theories of liability that would dispense with \u201ctraditional concepts and basic principles\u201d because \u201c[a]s an intermediate appellate court we adhere to existing laws of the State and in the absence of appropriate amendatory legislation \u2018any departure from it should be undertaken by the court of last resort and not by the appellate division.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34 (citing <em>Silagy v. State, </em>105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>507 (App.Div.), certif. den. 54 <em>N.J. </em>506 (1969)). We further stated in <em>Namm </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">Extensive policy shifts of this magnitude should not be initiated by an intermediate appellate court. The appropriate tribunal to accomplish such drastic changes is either the Supreme Court or the Legislature. <em>[Id. </em>at 35 (citations omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Here, not only has the majority permitted a cause of action to proceed against multiple defendants who may have no relationship whatsoever to the product which caused the damage, they have chosen to do so by the creation of a unique mechanism known as \u201ca risk-modified market share theory.\u201d This formula has many facets which could be subject to substantial debate, including whether it is warranted and/or just. I do not believe this court should in such circumstances make the choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Further, I perceive that the creation of the majority may serve to cripple our judicial system\u2019s ability to handle the weight of the litigation it will engender. This will, I fear, add unduly to the cost of the end product and discourage the production of needed drugs and commodities. In <em>Namm </em>there were 300 companies producing the drug and 74 defendants named. It seems apparent that the overall cost of defending such litigation in virtually every case will far exceed the plaintiff\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">We have fortunately reached the point where our Legislature has recognized its obligation to take action in regulating liability in product cases by balancing the interests of the public and the individual with a view towards economic reality. <em>E.g., </em>S. 2805, 202d N.J.Legis., 2d Sess. \u00a7 4 (1987) (signed by the Governor on July 23, 1987). We should neither usurp that function nor put the Legislature in a position of having to react to what may well be unwarranted judicial fiat.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
