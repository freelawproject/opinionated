We decline to order the judgment under review limited to prospective applicability only since it neither announces a new rule of law nor represents a departure from existing law. See <em>State v. Burstein, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>394, 403 (1981). In our view, plaintiffs have demonstrated a sufficient stake and adverse interest as to entitle them to sue under New Jersey\u2019s liberal rules of standing. See <em>Crescent Pk. Tenants Assoc, v. Realty Eq. Corp. of N.Y., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>98, 105-111.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
