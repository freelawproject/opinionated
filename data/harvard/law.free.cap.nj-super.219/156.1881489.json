In his opinion he concluded that the prosecution was barred by federal preemption. Consequently, on July 7, 1986 he entered an order dismissing the complaints. We are in full agreement with Judge Wertheimer and affirm his order substantially for the reasons set forth in his written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">In reaching our result we recognize that we undercut our <em>dictum </em>in <em>Trustees of Local 478 Pension Fund v. Pirozzi, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>318, 320 (App.Div.1984), that a victim of an offense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:170-90.2 may be able to obtain monetary relief by way of restitution as an incident of the disposition of a disorderly persons offense conviction. In this regard, we note that in the <em>Pirozzi </em>case the court did not pass on the preemption question as it appears not to have been raised by the defendants there.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
