Officer Paige of the Plainfield Police Force approached the pair, and inquired of the reasons for their presence in the area. Their response was that they were \u201ctaking a walk.\u201d During the discussion Hurtado dropped \u201ca couple pieces of napkin.\u201d Paige cautioned him about the city ordinance against littering and Hurtado picked up the paper. Again, while Paige was still close to him, Hurtado threw down the napkin paper. At this point, Paige inquired as to his name and address and requested identification inasmuch as he was about to issue a summons for violation of the anti-littering ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">Hurtado was unable to produce identification. The second male produced identification and was not detained, but Hurtado <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>was taken to the police station. At the station, identification procedures were set in motion and it was discovered that Hurtado had a record, including, according to Officer Paige, incidents of failure to answer other municipal summonses. At that time, Hurtado was out on bail awaiting imminent sentence on prior C.D.S. convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">According to Paige, upon learning of the \u201cnumerous of [s\u00edc ] contempt of courts pending in his file,\u201d the Lieutenant in charge of the station house set $100 bail to secure his attendance for the summons under the municipal littering ordinance. Paige testified that initially Hurtado was \u201cjust detained, he wasn\u2019t arrested\u201d for further identification, and that ordinarily he would give a city ordinance summons without taking someone to headquarters if they had an ID., such as a driver\u2019s license. For persons who had no ID, they were taken to headquarters, for identification purposes, before issuing the summons. When Hurtado was taken to the station house, his prior arrest cards, file and picture were located and his identification verified. Paige confirmed on cross-examination that he did not think there were any outstanding warrants at the time bail was set. Because Hurtado did not have the bail, he was placed in a holding cell, and an inventory search was conducted incident thereto. During the inventory a packet of cocaine was uncovered, which was the subject of the suppress motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">When Hurtado was taken to the station, it developed that the name and address which he gave to the police officer on the street was accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The history of Hurtado\u2019s prior failure to comply with summonses, as recounted by Officer Paige, was not disputed at the suppress hearing. His substantial adult record, dating to 1978 appears in the presentence report, now part of the record. That report discloses only one formal contempt of court charge, which had been dismissed. The transcript shows that the trial judge relied on the unrebutted testimony of Officer Paige as to Hurtado\u2019s prior failures to respond to summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The trial judge rejected defense counsel\u2019s argument that Officer Paige had no authority to arrest the defendant for violation of a municipal ordinance without first obtaining a warrant, and dismissed his contention that less intrusive means should have been employed to corroborate the defendant\u2019s identity, such as taking him to his alleged residence. Having determined that it was proper to take-Hurtado to the police station, the trial judge determined that setting bail was also proper. In consequence, the inventory search conducted prior to placing the defendant in a cell was approved, and the suppress motion denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Hurtado contends that his detention at the scene and subsequent conveyance and detention at police headquarters constituted an unreasonable seizure under <em>U.S. Const., </em>Amend. IV and <em>N.J. Const., </em>(1947), Art. I, <em>l\u00ed </em>VII. He argues therefore that the \u201cfruit\u201d uncovered by the subsequent inventory search should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">There is no dispute that Hurtado was involuntarily transported to police headquarters, although the State disputes that he was initially arrested, rather than detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Hurtado contends that even when an offense is committed in the presence of a police officer, the officer does not have power to arrest for violation of any municipal ordinance without first obtaining a warrant. In support, Hurtado cites <em>State v. Scharfstein, </em>73 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 489 (Cty.Ct.1962), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 79 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236 (App.Div.1963), aff\u2019d, 42 <em>N.J. </em>354 (1964). He says that \u201cone is hard pressed to find an offense less innocuous or trivial\u201d than discarding napkins on the street, a transgression for which the only sanction under Sec. 10:5-9 of the Plainfield Municipal Code is a fine not to exceed $250. Thus, he argues, even if temporary detention was appropriate, preliminary to issuing a summons, defendant\u2019s seizure was unreasonable after balancing the degree of intrusion and invasion of personal rights against the justification for initiating the intrusion. See <em>United States v. Hensley, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>221, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985); <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>696, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2637, 77 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>110 (1983); <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 <em>U.S. </em>873, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975). In the same vein, Hurtado also contends that the police had no authority to arrest him without a warrant merely for violation of a municipal ordinance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Inexplicably, Hurtado has failed to cite to this court <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-152, the starting place for the determination of the authority of the arresting officer. That section provides that \u201cthe members and officers of a police department and force, within the territorial limits of the municipality, shall have all the powers of peace officers and upon view may apprehend and arrest any disorderly person or any person committing a breach of the peace.\u201d See also, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:149-1 (Township Police). While the dictum in <em>Scharfstein </em>appears to have addressed the necessity for a warrant in connection with violations of municipal ordinances, its authority is dubious at best. <em>Scharfstein </em>was reversed for other reasons which made it unnecessary to consider the correctness of this dictum. Moreover, the cited dictum relies upon <em>Mayor of Newark v. Murphy, </em>40 <em>N.J.L. </em>145 (Sup.Ct.1878), a case which discussed common law powers of arrest in England but which is not authority to preclude the arrest by a police officer of a person seen by that officer to commit any ordinance violation. The <em>Murphy </em>court construed a specific charter, prior to the express grant of arrest powers to police officers in statutes such as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 14-152. Indeed, as observed in <em>State v. Smith, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>481 (1962), under the common law of arrest, a peace officer could arrest without a warrant, if the offense was committed in his presence, for misdemeanors involving or likely to involve breach of the peace. Misdemeanors, in context, were meant to be petty offenses, not tied to the source of the legislation, but which entailed \u201cbreaches of the peace.\u201d Although the <em>Smith </em>court rejected the words \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d in relation to arrest as \u201cvague and of doubtful utility,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 494, legislative enactment of L.1971, <em>c. </em>197 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-152) statutorily revived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d verbiage. See also <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:149-1. Under these statutes, police power to arrest has been confirmed as to \u201cany disorderly person\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cany person committing a breach of the peace.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) Thus, there is no limitation barring arrests for violations of municipal ordinances provided that such arrests fall within the New Jersey concept of a \u201cbreach of the peace,\u201d and the officer has observed the offense. We note that the Plainfield anti-litter provision is contained under the heading, \u201cMorals and Conduct\u201d in its Municipal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Examples of the type of conduct in the presence of an officer which have specifically been deemed sufficient by the Legislature to render an offender subject to arrest may be found in statutes such as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>23:2-8 (permits \u201csummary arrest in cases of flagrant violation\u201d of fish and game statutes), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 14-158 (authorizes warrantless arrests under municipal ordinances which prohibit litter by boaters affecting beaches, if observed by officers) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>53:2-1 (authorizes state police to arrest without warrant for \u201cviolations of the law committed in their presence ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">As discussed in 3 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>(14th Ed.1981), \u00a7 521 at 174, breach of the peace is a flexible concept encompassing, \u201cthe tranquility enjoyed by citizens of a community where good order reigns among its members.\u201d Whether or not a given act amounts to a breach of the peace is determined by considering the time when, the place where, and the circumstances under which, the act was committed. Violence is not an essential element of the offense. <em>(Wharton, supra, </em>\u00a7 522 at 175-176)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Thus, we reject the general proposition that there can be no lawful arrest in New Jersey for violation of a littering ordinance under the eyes of a police officer. The particular circumstances must be considered, including here, failure to heed the initial warning and absence of identification, which raise legitimate questions about whether the violations will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>continue unless checked and whether a complaint-summons will be honored.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">However, we agree with the State that in the present case, Hurtado\u2019s initial stop and detention fell short of formal \u201carrest.\u201d Having personally observed a violation of municipal ordinance, it was appropriate to warn the offender, and thereafter, to issue a complaint for the second violation. Incident thereto, identification was reasonably required before issuance of a summons-complaint. Absent identification, it is an acceptable and constitutional alternative to transport the offender to a police station for verification of identity. The Constitution does not require choice of a \u201cless intrusive\u201d alternative in such circumstances. <em>Illinois v. Lafayette, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>640, 647, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2605, 2610, 77 L.Ed.2d 65, 72 (1983). We note, as an indication of reasonable police action, that Hurtado\u2019s companion who possessed identification was not detained. We prefer not to second guess the alternative chosen by the police, which was not inherently unreasonable. See, <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>675, 686, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1568, 1575, 84 L.Ed.2d 605, 616 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Once at the police station, it was incumbent upon Officer Paige to comply with <em>R. </em>SA-lfc),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> made applicable by <em>R. </em>7:3-1 to <em>all </em>nonindictable offenses. Under this rule, the officer in charge is required to prepare a complaint-summons after identification procedures have been completed, and to \u201crelease that person in lieu of continued detention\u201d unless it is determined that \u201cany of the conditions set forth in paragraph (d) exist.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:4-l(d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> enumerates six conditions, which include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">\u201c(1) the person has previously failed to respond to a summons; and ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3v\">(6) the officer has reason to believe the person will not appear in response to a summons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Objectively, Hurtado\u2019s prior failures to respond to summons, his lengthy past record, and the imminence of his sentencing in Superior Court for serious crimes, justified the determination by the officer in charge to exercise discretion under <em>R. </em>3:4-l(c) and (d). Inasmuch as it was after 12:30 a.m., Hurtado would obviously then have been temporarily held in jail until he could be taken \u201cwithout unnecessary delay before the nearest available committing judge ...,\u201d and it was reasonable for the officer in charge to set a modest bail pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A-.8-27 as collateral to insure Hurtado\u2019s appearance. The $100 bail was far less than the maximum fine provided by ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\"> Prior to placing a defendant into custody, the police may inventory the personal items in his possession. <em>Cooper v. California, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>58, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>788, 17 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>730 (1967). However, a person arrested for a minor offense must first be informed of his right to post collateral, and given an opportunity to do so prior to conducting an inventory search. <em>U.S. v. Mills, </em>472 A. 2d 1231 (D.C.Cir.1972); see 2 <em>La Fave, Search &amp; Seizure, </em>(1978), \u00a7 5.3(d) at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">We disagree with Hurtado\u2019s argument that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:8-27 must be read to vitiate the powers of detention and arrest above discussed because \u201cminor transgressions\u201d are not \u201cbailable.\u201d This statute deals with the power to set bail, not the power to arrest. Whether Hurtado\u2019s moment of technical arrest occurred on the street, or at the station after his record was disclosed, our Constitution requires that bail promptly be set for \u201c[a]ll persons ...,\u201d except for certain capital offenses. <em>N.J. Const., </em>(1947), Art. 1, par. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">In the circumstances of this case, we hold that the inventory of Hurtado prior to his temporary incarceration pending court appearance was lawful and constitutional. Although it has not been argued, we have also considered carefully, and rejected, the possibility that the stop, detention, bail-set and inventory on the municipal ordinance charge were only a pretext to provide justification for an otherwise unconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>invasion of Hurtado\u2019s personal rights. See, <em>e.g., Gustafson v. Florida, </em>414 <em>US. </em>260, 267, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>488, 492, 38 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>456, 462 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring). Even if the interest of the police was aroused by other suspicious conduct, we are satisfied that the facts objectively justified the actions taken. <em>Cf., State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 219 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-9\">R.3:4\u20141 was amended effective January 1, 1987. We have employed the present rule designations. At the time of Hurtado\u2019s \"arrest,\u201d similar provisions were contained in <em>R. </em>3:4-1(b) and (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b53-7\">SKILLMAN, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ah1\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">I agree with the majority that the initial stop and detention of defendant was not an \u201carrest\u201d and that the police could detain defendant temporarily to verify his identity before issuing a summons-complaint (maj. opinion at 21). However, defendant was not searched until after his identity had been verified, and he had nevertheless been placed under arrest. Therefore, the validity of the inventory search which revealed cocaine in defendant\u2019s possession turns on the validity of his arrest. Because I am unable to find any authority for a warrantless arrest under the circumstances of this case, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">The offense for which defendant was placed under arrest was violation of a municipal ordinance prohibiting littering. The majority relies upon two sources of authority to validate this arrest without a warrant: (1) <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-152; and (2) <em>R. </em>3:4-l(c). In my judgment, neither of these provisions authorizes an arrest without a warrant for violation of a municipal ordinance prohibiting littering, even if the police are purportedly concerned that the violator will not respond to a summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">The majority properly recognizes that the starting point in interpreting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-152 is the common law of arrest. At common law the power of arrest without a warrant did not extend to every offense. A police officer could make an arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor only when the offense involved a breach of the peace and was committed in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>presence. 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure </em>(12th ed. 1974), \u00a7 63 at 168. And absent statutory authorization, an officer could not make an arrest without a warrant for breach of a municipal ordinance, even if committed in his presence. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 68. This common law rule is reflected in <em>Mayor &amp; Common Council of Newark v. Murphy, </em>40 <em>N.J.Law </em>145 (Sup.Ct.1878) and <em>Pell v. Newark, </em>49 <em>N.J.Law </em>594 (Sup.Ct.1887), and is expressly stated in <em>State v. Scharfstein, </em>73 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 489 (Cty.Ct.1962), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 79 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236 (App. Div.1963), aff'd, 42 <em>N.J. </em>354 (1964). <em>See also Delafoile v. State, </em>54 <em>N.J.Law </em>381, 385 (E. &amp; A. 1892). Therefore, if the power of arrest in this State were governed solely by the common law, no arrest without a warrant could be made for the violation of any municipal ordinance. However, the majority correctly concludes that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-152 and certain other legislative enactments authorize arrests without a warrant under circumstances beyond those permitted at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-152 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">The members and officers of a police department and force, within the territorial limits of the municipality, shall have all the powers of peace officers and upon view may apprehend and arrest any disorderly person or any person committing a breach of the peace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">There are two preconditions to exercise of the power of arrest under this section: (1) the offense must have occurred \u201cupon view\u201d of the officer, and (2) the offender must be either a \u201cdisorderly person\u201d or have committed a \u201cbreach of the peace.\u201d Consequently, with respect to disorderly persons offenses, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-4b, the common law requirement of a \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d is not a precondition to an arrest without a warrant under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-152. However, with respect to other offenses, the requirement of a \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d remains in effect. Therefore, while I agree with the majority that <em>N.J. S.A. </em>40A:14-152 may be reasonably interpreted to change the common law and to authorize an arrest without a warrant for a violation of certain municipal ordinances, this authorization is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>limited to violations of municipal ordinances involving a \u201cbreach of the peace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Defendant\u2019s alleged offense did not involve any \u201cbreach of the peace.\u201d He simply dropped a napkin onto the street. There was no physical altercation between defendant and the arresting officer nor any threatening or abusive words. The majority suggests that defendant\u2019s littering offense was transformed into a breach of the peace because he dropped the napkin a second time after being asked by the officer to pick it up. However, the record does not indicate that defendant acted in deliberate defiance of the officer and the trial judge made no such finding. In any event, a simple act of insolence towards authority does not constitute a \u201cbreach of the peace.\u201d <em>Cf. State v. Profaci, </em>56 N. J. 346 (1970) (traffic violator who exited vehicle and said in a loud voice to officer issuing summons, \u201cwhat the f_ are you bothering me for,\u201d did not invite \u201cbreach of the peace.\u201d) A leading commentary on criminal law summarizes the case law construing the term \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">Illustrative of acts amounting to a breach of the peace are: public brawling; challenging or provoking another to fight; engaging in an affray; discharging a firearm on a public street; unlawfully possessing or selling intoxicating liquor; being intoxicated and yelling on a public street; entering the dwelling house of another with weapons in such manner as to cause terror and alarm to the occupants. [4 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>(14 ed. 1981), \u00a7 522 at 176-177].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Defendant\u2019s actions in throwing litter on the street had a much lesser impact on public order than any of these illustrations and in my judgment cannot reasonably be found to have constituted a \u201cbreach of the peace.\u201d Therefore, defendant\u2019s arrest without a warrant was not authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-152.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The second source relied upon by the majority to justify defendant\u2019s arrest without a warrant is <em>R. </em>3:4-1. However, this court rule does not confer any power of arrest without a warrant. Rather, the subject matter of <em>R. </em>3:4-1 is the procedures to be followed after an arrest has been made. Thus, the title of the rule is, \u201cProcedure After Arrest.\u201d On the date defendant was arrested the primary subsection dealing with release of offenders upon issuance of a summons was <em>R. </em>3:4-l(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">Subject to paragraph (c), <em>whenever a law enforcement officer has effected, a lawful arrest without a warrant for any offense </em>except [enumerated serious crimes], the arrested person shall be taken to a police station where the officer in charge shall, after completion of all post arrest identification procedures required by law, issue a summons to him and release him in lieu of continued detention unless he determines that any of the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) hereof exists. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-8\"><em>R. </em>3:4-l(c) qualified <em>R. </em>3:4-l(b) by setting forth specific circumstances under which a person arrested for a minor offense was not required to be released upon issuance of a summons. The parts of this subsection relied upon by the majority stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">The officer in charge of the station house shall have the discretion not to issue a summons to <em>an arrested person </em>when any of the following conditions exists:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">(1) The person has previously failed to respond to a summons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">(6) The officer has reason to believe the person will not appear in response to a summons. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">Thus, <em>R. </em>3:4-1 presupposes that a person has been lawfully arrested and sets forth procedures for the subsequent processing of the arrestee. It does not confer a power of arrest without a warrant in circumstances where that power is otherwise lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s Committee on Criminal Practice\u2019s reports leading up to adoption of the \u201csummons in lieu of warrant\u201d provisions of <em>R. </em>3:4-1 confirm that there was no intent to expand the police\u2019s power of arrest. <em>See </em>99 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>395, 396 (1976); 100 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>441, 442 (1977); 105 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>425, 426 (1980). The first of these reports explicitly states that \u201c... the proposed rule change ... does not affect the power of the police to make arrests.\u201d 99 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>at 426. Indeed, these reports make it clear that the intent of the rule change was to increase the use of summons in place of warrants. The Committee\u2019s first report on that subject stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">[T]he Committee noted various apparent problems caused by the excessive use of warrants. Included are the resulting overcrowded cell blocks and detention facilities, discrimination against the poor who are without ready access to counsel and bail in many cases, and the reduced police resources available on the streets by virtue of the time and effort expended in present arrest and booking procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Therefore, by interpreting a rule designed to reduce pretrial detentions as authorization for expanding the police\u2019s power of arrest, the majority has in effect turned <em>R. </em>3:4-1 on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">I do not question the power of the Legislature to authorize an arrest under the circumstances presented by this case. Indeed, the Legislature has conferred the power of arrest with respect to certain minor offenses. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-158; <em>N.J. S.A. </em>39:5-25. However, there are substantial competing policy considerations which must be weighed in determining whether to authorize arrests without a warrant for minor offenses. On the one hand, there is a public interest in securing the presence at trial of any alleged offender. On the other hand, it may be concluded that some offenses, such as illegal parking, jaywalking, and littering, do not pose a sufficiently grave threat to the public welfare to warrant even the temporary detention of an alleged offender pending the posting of bail. Furthermore, since there inevitably will be some persons who will be unable to post bail, there also are public interests in not incarcerating persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>accused of minor regulatory offenses solely on account of their indigency and in not exacerbating existing problems of prison overcrowding. The Legislature has balanced these competing policy considerations by limiting the power of arrest to violations of municipal ordinances involving a \u201cbreach of the peace.\u201d Since I am unable to find any \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d in defendant\u2019s violation of Plainfield\u2019s antilittering ordinance, I conclude there was no authority to arrest defendant and that the inventory search conducted in connection with his arrest was unlawful. Accordingly, I would reverse the order denying the motion to suppress and remand the matter to permit defendant to retract his guilty plea.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-11\">I note that the two cases cited by Wharton for the conclusion that the possession and sale of alcoholic beverages may amount to a breach of the peace are prohibition era decisions in Tennessee. <em>Hughes v. State, </em>145 Tenn. 544, 238 <em>S.W. </em>588 (Sup.Ct.1922); <em>State v. Reichman, </em>135 <em>Tenn. </em>653, 188 <em>S.W. </em>225 (Sup.Ct.1916). In the latter case the court said: \"The sale of intoxicating liquors has always been recognized as tending to provoke disturbances of good order and breaches of the peace.\" 188 <em>S. W. </em>at 228.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-14\">This subsection was substantially amended and redesignated subsection (c) effective January 1, 1987.
