Following a hearing apparently held on March 21, 1981, petitioner was found guilty of certain charges. Petitioner contested the disposition of the Superintendent\u2019s proceeding and, (by order dated January 7, 1982, Supreme Court annulled the determination of guilt and ordered respondents to \"expunge all entries of the Superintendent\u2019s Proceeding held for Petitioner on March 21, 1981 and the resulting disposition therefrom\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">In January 1986, petitioner commenced the instant CPLR article 78 proceeding. In this proceeding, petitioner alleged that the order of expungement had not been complied with since respondent Commissioner of Correctional Services had not expunged from petitioner\u2019s records all references to the Superintendent\u2019s proceeding and, as a retaliatory measure, had transferred petitioner away from Eastern so as to preclude his participation in an educational program in which he was enrolled. Petitioner also sought the return of personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>In due course and upon respondents\u2019 motion, Supreme Court dismissed the petition on the ground that petitioner\u2019s records had been expunged and, accordingly, petitioner\u2019s request for expungement was moot. Additionally, the court held that petitioner submitted no facts or evidence regarding the loss of personal property and the request for return of the same was dismissed. Finally, Supreme Court refused to disturb the determination to transfer petitioner. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">After reviewing petitioner\u2019s institutional records submitted to this court, we must conclude that Supreme Court\u2019s order of expungement has not been fully complied with. These records reveal numerous references to the charges underlying the Superintendent\u2019s proceeding. Since expungement should serve the purpose of restoring petitioner to the status he enjoyed prior to the commencement of the Superintendent\u2019s proceeding, compliance with the expungement order requires that all references to the proceeding, the disposition and the underlying charges must be vacated from petitioner\u2019s record. We note that the entries pertaining to formal charges are part and parcel of the Superintendent\u2019s proceeding <em>(see, </em>7 NYCRR 254.3, 251-5.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Turning to the issue of petitioner\u2019s transfer, we find that petitioner has shown no circumstances meriting this court\u2019s interference with the broad discretion of the Commissioner to transfer inmates among correctional facilities <em>(see, Matter of Gregg v Scully, </em>108 AD2d 748, <em>lv denied </em>65 NY2d 601; <em>Matter of Sebastiano v Harris, </em>76 AD2d 1004, <em>affd </em>54 NY2d 1014). Finally, we note that petitioner wholly fails to substantiate his claim for the return of personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Judgment modified, on the law, by reversing so much thereof as dismissed as moot petitioner\u2019s request for enforcement of the expungement order; petitioner\u2019s request for an order directing expungement from his record of all formal charges underlying the Superintendent\u2019s proceeding of March 21, 1981, as well as any and all references to said hearing and disposition, granted; and, as so modified, affirmed.
