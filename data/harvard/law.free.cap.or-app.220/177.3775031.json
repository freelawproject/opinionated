ORS 138.060(1)(c). The issue presented to us is whether the police officer\u2019s request for consent to search defendant constituted an unlawful extension of the traffic stop in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant cross-appeals the court\u2019s pretrial ruling that denied his motion to exclude evidence of a field test of drugs that were discovered as a result of the search. We affirm on appeal, <em>State v. Rodgers, </em>219 Or App 366, 182 P3d 209 (2008), and dismiss the cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">We review the lawfulness of searches and seizures for legal error and are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact to the extent that those findings are supported by evidence in the record. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The trial court found the facts to be those to which Deputy Sheriff Steele testified at the suppression hearing. On the afternoon of February 6, 2003, Steele saw defendant driving in downtown Willamina. He knew defendant by sight and also knew that defendant\u2019s driver license had been suspended. Steele contacted his dispatcher who confirmed that defendant had a suspended license. The dispatcher also reported that defendant did not have any outstanding arrest warrants. Based on the driving while suspended violation, ORS 811.175, Steele activated the overhead lights on his patrol car and stopped defendant. The overhead lights remained on throughout the duration of the encounter. Both defendant and Steele got out of their cars and walked toward one another. Steele testified that he was concerned for his safety because defendant had left his vehicle, which raises the risk of danger to an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">When Steele told defendant that he had stopped him for driving while suspended, defendant seemed surprised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>and handed him an Oregon driver license. Defendant was cooperative and \u201cbusinesslike\u201d; he did not act in a threatening or aggressive manner. Steele also indicated that, during his extensive history of prior contacts with defendant, defendant had never acted in a violent or threatening manner and had never pulled a weapon. At that point in the encounter, Steele had defendant\u2019s name, date of birth, and driver license number. He acknowledged that that was all the information that would be contained on a traffic citation; however, he testified that he \u201cprobably\u201d did not have everything he needed to issue the citation, because he had not requested and received from defendant the vehicle registration and proof of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Steele explained to defendant that \u201cthe license that he was handing me was no good\u201d and asked defendant if he had any weapons on him or in the car. Steele explained why he asked about the presence of weapons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201cOnce again he was outside the car and it was pertinent. For officer safety I wanted to know if he had any weapons on him and there was a passenger still in the vehicle and so I was asking if there was any weapons in the vehicle also. Because really now I had two people and they were in different locations and I needed to kind of know what was going on and who had what if anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Defendant stated that he did not have any weapons. Steele then asked defendant for \u201cconsent to a pat search for weapons.\u201d The trial court found that approximately two minutes had elapsed between the initial stop and that request. Steele had not yet written defendant a citation. At some point during the encounter \u2014 although it is unclear precisely when\u2014 two additional officers arrived on the scene. Those officers were \u201cwatching the passenger\u201d for Steele as he talked with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">During the patdown search, Steele felt miscellaneous items in defendant\u2019s pockets. After the patdown, Steele \u201cfelt fairly confident that [defendant] didn\u2019t have any firearms on his person.\u201d He nonetheless asked defendant for consent to look at each of the items that he had felt, because he did not know what they were and \u201cwanted to investigate further.\u201d For each item, consent was granted. Steele testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>that defendant was not free to leave during the encounter; he also did not tell defendant that he was free not to cooperate. One of the items that Steele had felt was a small metal cylindrical container. Steele asked defendant if he could look inside it. Defendant first responded, \u201cI just found that.\u201d Steele again asked for consent to look inside, and defendant agreed. Steele unscrewed the cap and saw two zip lock baggies containing a residual amount of a clear crystalline substance that appeared to be methamphetamine. At that point, Steele concluded that he had probable cause to believe that defendant had committed the crime of possession of a controlled substance, and he arrested defendant for that crime. At that point, approximately four to five minutes had elapsed from the beginning of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Defendant was thereafter charged with possession of a controlled substance, <em>former </em>ORS 475.992 (2003). Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained during the search. He argued that, although questions concerning the presence of weapons may be permitted under ORS 810.410(3)(d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> unless the officer has <em>\u201ca </em>reasonable suspicion of an <em>immediate threat of serious injury\u201d </em>that questioning \u2014 including asking for permission to search for weapons \u2014 constitutes an unlawful seizure in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. (Emphasis in original.) According to defendant, because there was no such threat in this case and because his consent was obtained as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>result of the resulting unlawful seizure, the evidence must be suppressed. The state countered that the officer\u2019s request for consent to search defendant was not unlawful because the officer had legitimate officer safety concerns and because \u201cit [was] a consent search, which the officer [was] authorized [under ORS 810.410(3)(e)] to conduct at that point.\u201d The state also argued that defendant was not unreasonably detained beyond \u201cwhat was necessary\u201d because the search occurred within a few minutes of the stop and during the course of the investigation of the traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The court first concluded that none of the officer\u2019s conduct violated ORS 810.410. However, relying on <em>State v. Amaya, </em>336 Or 616, 89 P3d 1163 (2004), and <em>State v. Ehret, </em>184 Or App 1, 55 P3d 512 (2002), the court further concluded that Steele\u2019s request for consent to frisk defendant was nonetheless unlawful under Article I, section 9, because it amounted to a seizure of defendant without reasonable suspicion that defendant posed a danger to the officer or others or that he had committed a crime. The court reasoned that, although not every question by an officer that is unrelated to the reason for a traffic stop raises constitutional concerns, the request for consent to do a patdown, because it is \u201csignificantly beyond that accepted or ordinary social conduct intercourse\u201d and would not \u201cbe perceived as non-offensive contact if it occurred between two ordinary citizens,\u201d unlawfully extended the duration of the traffic stop in violation of Article I, section 9, because it was not justified by a reasonable suspicion that defendant posed an immediate threat to the officer\u2019s safety. This appeal by the state followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The state does not argue on appeal that Steele had a \u201creasonable suspicion, based upon specific and articulable facts,\u201d that defendant posed \u201can immediate threat of serious physical injury to [him].\u201d <em>State v. Bates, </em>304 Or 519, 524, 747 P2d 991 (1987); <em>see also Amaya, </em>336 Or at 631. Rather, as was clarified at oral argument, the state\u2019s argument is that, at the time that he asked defendant for permission to pat him down, Steele was, in some general sense, \u201cconcerned with his safety\u201d \u2014 a \u201cconcern\u201d that did not rise to the constitutionally independent and sufficient <em>Bates </em>level \u2014 and, because of that concern, was authorized under ORS 810.410(3)(d) to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>inquiries of defendant that were unrelated to the traffic stop, including asking him for consent to search his person. <em>See </em>ORS 810.410(3)(d) (authorizing inquiries, including an inquiry regarding the presence of weapons, to \u201censure the safety of the officer, the person stopped or other persons present\u201d). According to the state, the statute authorizes \u201cofficer safety requests like the one made here,\u201d made during the course of a traffic stop, even though they \u201clikely will have the effect of extending the duration of the stop for some minimal period of time.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the state\u2019s view, as we understand it, any delay caused by the request in this case therefore did not amount to a seizure for purposes of Article I, section 9, but rather was a product of defendant\u2019s valid consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"> We turn to defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal. First, we note that defendant does not argue on appeal, as he did below, that Steele\u2019s initial question about the presence of weapons constituted a seizure under Article I, section 9. <em>See State v. Crampton, </em>176 Or App 62, 72, 31 P3d 430 (2001), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Caldwell, </em>187 Or App 720, 69 P3d 830 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 376 (2004) (holding that an officer\u2019s inquiry into the presence of weapons, as authorized by ORS 810.410(3)(d), does not transform a police-citizen encounter into a separate stop in violation of Article I, section 9). Rather, defendant argues that the unlawful seizure arose when Steele requested permission to frisk him after he said that he did not have any weapons and to examine the items in his pockets after the patdown search yielded no weapons. Defendant contends that, even if those requests for consent to search were authorized under ORS 810.410, they violated his rights under Article I, section 9, because they were not based on a reasonable suspicion that he posed a threat of immediate harm to an officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because his consent was obtained in exploitation of that illegality, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>continues, the evidence obtained during the search is subject to suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">With the parties\u2019 arguments thus framed, the dis-positive question is whether, even assuming that Steele\u2019s actions were permissible under ORS 810.410(3), his requests for permission to search defendant nonetheless amounted to an unlawful seizure under Article I, section 9. We agree with the trial court that they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"> First, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Amaya, </em>ORS 810.410(3)(d) authorizes an officer conducting a lawful traffic stop to make inquiries, including inquiries about the presence of weapons, even if the officer does not reasonably suspect criminal activity or the threat of immediate harm. 336 Or at 625. However, the court also made clear that an officer\u2019s actions, even if authorized by the statute, may in certain circumstances further restrain a person\u2019s liberty such that they effect a \u201cseizure\u201d under Article I, section 9. <em>Id. </em>at 626-27. In those circumstances, the officer\u2019s actions must be supported by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or that \u201c \u2018the citizen might pose an immediate threat of serious physical injury to the officer or to others then present.\u2019 <em>\u201d Id. </em>at 631 (quoting <em>Bates, </em>304 Or at 524).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">After this case was briefed and argued, we decided <em>Rodgers, </em>219 Or App at 366, in which we explored the circumstances under which an officer\u2019s questions may constitute a seizure under Article I, section 9. We explained that a police officer\u2019s questioning of a person unrelated to the initial, legal stop can result in an unlawful restraint of the person\u2019s liberty in violation of Article I, section 9, in two situations: (1) when an officer concludes the lawful stop and then reinitiates a second stop by questioning the person about unrelated matters without reasonable suspicion; and (2) \u201cwhen the officer, without letting the person know expressly or by implication that he or she is free to leave, detains the person beyond the time reasonably required to investigate the traffic infraction and issue a citation.\u201d 219 Or App at 371; <em>see also Ehret, </em>184 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>App at 8-10 (traffic stop was unlawfully extended when officer, after having completed traffic citations, delayed giving them to defendant, and instead questioned him about his criminal history and whether he had any drugs in his car, without reasonable suspicion that defendant had engaged in criminal activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><em>Rodgers </em>presented the second factual scenario. In that case, the defendant was lawfully stopped for the traffic infraction of driving a car with a burned-out license plate light. The officer obtained the defendant\u2019s driver license and vehicle registration and ran a records check, which came back clear. Instead of issuing the defendant a citation, which the officer could have done at that point, he began questioning the defendant about items in the defendant\u2019s car, which the officer believed indicated that the defendant was involved in the manufacturing of methamphetamine. After talking for a few minutes, the officer asked the defendant for consent to search the car. The results of that search led to the defendant\u2019s conviction for unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine. 219 Or App at 368-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We rejected the state\u2019s argument that the reasonableness of the duration of the traffic stop should be measured by the time that it would have taken the officer to process the citation had he or she not engaged in the additional, unrelated questioning. <em>Rodgers, </em>219 Or App at 373. Instead, we determined that prior decisions of this court and the Supreme Court led to the conclusion that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201calthough an officer is free to question a motorist about matters unrelated to the traffic infraction during an unavoidable lull in the investigation, such as while awaiting the results of a records check, that officer is not similarly free to question the motorist about unrelated matters as an alternative to going forward with the next step in processing the infraction, such as the writing or issuing of a citation. When an officer has all of the information necessary to issue a citation but instead delays in processing it or in telling the motorist that he or she is free to go, the stop is no longer lawful unless the officer has reasonable suspicion of further criminal activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 372 (discussing <em>State v. Raney, </em>215 Or App 339, 345, 168 P3d 803 (2007), <em>modified on recons, </em>217 Or App 470, 175 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>P3d 1024 (2008); <em>State v. Boatman, </em>185 Or App 27, 34, 57 P3d 918 (2002); <em>Ehret, </em>184 Or App at 3-5, 10). We therefore held that, because the officer had all of the information that he needed to issue a citation when he began questioning the defendant about things unrelated to the burned-out license plate light, he unlawfully extended the duration of the stop beyond the time reasonably required to investigate and cite defendant for the traffic infraction. <em>Rodgers, </em>219 Or App at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">This case is controlled by <em>Rodgers. </em>At the point at which Steele asked defendant for permission to search him, Steele testified that, although he had defendant\u2019s name, date of birth, and driver license number, he \u201cprobably\u201d did not have everything he needed to issue defendant a citation because he did not have defendant\u2019s proof of insurance and vehicle registration information. However, even if that information was essential for the issuance of a traffic citation, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Steele asked defendant for those items or was waiting for defendant to retrieve them, nor that he was engaged in any other steps related to the investigation of the traffic offense. Thus, the request for consent to search defendant did not occur \u201cduring an unavoidable lull in the investigation.\u201d <em>Rodgers, </em>219 Or App at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Instead of asking defendant for that information \u2014 a logical next step in processing the infraction \u2014 Steele proceeded down an unrelated path, that is, he asked defendant for permission to pat him down.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That, in turn, led Steele to ask defendant for consent to examine the items that Steele felt during the patdown, and, ultimately, for consent to look inside one of those items. Those actions, which were unrelated to the basis for the traffic stop, unlawfully extended the duration of the traffic stop in violation of Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Contrary to the state\u2019s assertion, our decision in <em>Raney, </em>215 Or App at 341, does not compel a different conclusion. In <em>Raney, </em>we concluded that the officer\u2019s request for consent to search defendant\u2019s car during a traffic stop was not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>unlawful extension of the stop. However, in that case, the record supported the trial court\u2019s findings that the officer at the time was still in the process of investigating the traffic violation because he was waiting for the computer to verify the status of defendant\u2019s driver license and was unable to complete the traffic stop until that information came back. <em>Id. </em>at 345. Thus, the request for consent in <em>Raney </em>occurred during an \u201cunavoidable lull\u201d in the investigation. <em>Rodgers, </em>219 Or App at 372. Here, in contrast, at the time that Steele asked for consent to frisk defendant, he was not waiting for further information or in some way \u201cunavoidably\u201d prevented from taking the steps necessary to complete the traffic stop. Under those circumstances, Steele\u2019s requests for consent to search defendant \u2014 without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or that defendant posed an immediate threat of serious physical injury to him or another person \u2014 constituted an unlawful seizure in violation of Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Under <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 115 P3d 908 (2005), evidence derived from a consensual search is subject to suppression if the consent was the product of unlawful police conduct. \u201cAfter a defendant shows a minimal factual nexus between unlawful police conduct and the defendant\u2019s consent, then the state has the burden to prove that the defendant\u2019s consent was independent of, or only tenuously related to, the unlawful police conduct.\u201d Id. at 34-35. Here, defendant has shown the required nexus \u2014 that is, if not for the unlawful seizure, Steele would not have been in a position to request defendant\u2019s consent to the patdown. The state does not advance any argument to satisfy its burden under <em>Hall </em>that there were intervening circumstances or factors that severed the connection between the unlawful stop and defendant\u2019s consent. Therefore, the trial court did not err in suppressing the evidence obtained during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In his cross-appeal, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to exclude evidence of the officer\u2019s field testing of the drugs discovered during the search. Our conclusion on appeal that the drug evidence was properly suppressed obviates any need for us to reach defendant\u2019s cross-appeal. Accordingly, we dismiss the cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Affirmed on appeal; cross-appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-8\"> Article I, section 9, provides, in part, \u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-5\"> ORS 810.410 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u201c(3) A police officer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201c(a) Shall not arrest a person for a traffic violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">\u201c(b) May stop and detain a person for a traffic violation for the purposes of investigation reasonably related to the traffic violation, identification and issuance of citation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">\u201c(c) May make an inquiry into circumstances arising during the course of a detention and investigation under paragraph (b) of this subsection that give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">\u201c(d) May make an inquiry to ensure the safety of the officer, the person stopped or other persons present, including an inquiry regarding the presence of weapons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">\u201c(e) May request consent to search in relation to the circumstances referred to in paragraph (c) of this subsection or to search for items of evidence otherwise subject to search or seizure under ORS 133.535.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b213-5\"> As the state correctly points out, in this case the time between the initial stop and the request for consent to search defendant was only two minutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b213-6\"> As he did in the trial court, defendant also relies on the Fourth Amendment.
