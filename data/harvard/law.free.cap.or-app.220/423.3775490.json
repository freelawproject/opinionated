(employer) petitions for judicial review of a final order of the Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) that found that, by discharging one of its employees (complainant) because of his medical marijuana use, employer failed to reasonably accommodate complainant\u2019s disability as required by Oregon statutes on unlawful discrimination against disabled persons, ORS 659A.110 - 659A.145. On review, employer asserts two assignments of error and argues that BOLI erred (1) in finding that employer was obligated to reasonably accommodate complainant\u2019s marijuana use; and (2) in denying employer the right to a jury trial in violation of Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that employer did not raise any of the issues below that it asserts in its first assignment of error and that employer\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The relevant facts are stated in BOLI\u2019s order and are not challenged on review. Employer is a steel fabricator doing business in Oregon. In 2003, employer used a staffing company to screen prospective employees. The staffing company referred complainant to employer to fill a position as a drill press operator. Complainant was interviewed by employer\u2019s machine shop foreman and was offered the position. Complainant accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Employer\u2019s policy when hiring temporary employees through the staffing company was to evaluate them after a minimum of three months. At that point, if there was enough work to justify hiring the employee on a permanent basis, the employee would be required to undergo a comprehensive drug screen at a local hospital to test for the presence of illegal drugs. In fact, during complainant\u2019s job interview, the machine shop foreman told him that, at the end of 90 days, he would be required to take a drug test before he could be hired as a permanent employee. Employer also had a written drug policy, but complainant was never shown a copy of that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>At the time that complainant interviewed with employer, he was participating in Oregon\u2019s medical marijuana program because of nausea, severe stomach cramps, and vomiting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Complainant did not mention the fact that he possessed an OMMA card because he feared that he would not be hired. When complainant first reported for work at employer\u2019s facility, no one asked him whether he would submit to a drug test or whether he had already submitted to a drug test for the staffing company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Complainant performed satisfactorily as a drill press operator and, on two occasions, told his immediate supervisor, the shop foreman, that he liked the job and wanted to keep it. After a few weeks on the job, the supervisor gave complainant a $1.00 per hour pay raise, which was the supervisor\u2019s general practice with temporary employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">While working for employer, complainant continued to experience nausea and severe stomach cramps. To relieve the nausea and cramps, he used marijuana one to three times per day, depending on his symptoms. Complainant never used marijuana while at work or while on employer\u2019s property, and his supervisor never suspected that complainant was using marijuana or any other drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Nevertheless, in March 2003, complainant told the supervisor that he needed to talk with him about his \u201cmedical problem\u201d to see whether it would affect his chances of being hired as a regular employee. Although he did not explain his specific medical problem, complainant explained to the supervisor that he had an OMMA card, that he had tried other medications, and that marijuana worked best for him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>He showed the supervisor the documentation for his OMMA card, including the paperwork completed by a physician, and told the supervisor that he hoped that the revelation of his marijuana use would not get him fired. The supervisor told complainant that he did not know the answer and that he would talk it over with employer\u2019s owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The supervisor then met with employer\u2019s owner to discuss complainant\u2019s disclosure of his marijuana use and OMMA card. The supervisor explained that complainant had told him that marijuana was the only drug that he could take to alleviate his medical problem and that complainant was doing a \u201creasonably good job\u201d operating the drill press. The supervisor and owner then discussed whether complainant should be hired and decided that there was no need to hire him as a regular employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">A week after disclosing his OMMA card, complainant told the supervisor that he was planning to move to a different residence and needed to know whether employer was going to hire him as a regular employee. The supervisor told him that employer no longer needed his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">In May 2003, complainant filed a complaint with BOLI\u2019s Civil Rights Division, alleging that he was the victim of unlawful employment practices. After investigating the complaint, BOLI issued formal charges against employer on the grounds that employer had (1) discharged complainant because of his disability in violation of ORS 659A.112(2)(c) and (g); and (2) failed to reasonably accommodate complainant\u2019s disability in violation of ORS 659A.112(2)(e) and (f).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>its answer, employer asserted a number of affirmative defenses, four of which are relevant to the issues before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">\u201cFor its Second Affirmative Defense, Respondent alleges as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">\u201cOregon\u2019s Medical Marijuana Law does not require employers to accommodate the use of medical marijuana in the workplace or to accommodate off-duty use of medical marijuana in such a fashion that the employee would or could still be affected by such usage while on duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">\u00ab\u00edji # # \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">\u201cFor its Third Affirmative Defense, Respondent alleges as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">\u201cRespondent is not required to accommodate medical marijuana users by permitting them to work in safety-sensitive positions that would or could endanger the safety of themselves, co-workers or the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">\u201cFor its Fourth Affirmative Defense, Respondent alleges as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">\u201cRespondent is free to require that employees behave in conformance with the Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988. ORS 659A. 127(4). The protections of that Act do not apply to someone illegally using drugs, and marijuana is an illegal drug under Federal Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-12\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u201cFor its Fifth Affirmative Defense, Respondent alleges as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">\u201cOregon law prescribes that ORS 659A.112 be construed to the extent possible in a manner that is consistent with any similar provisions of the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended. ORS 659A.139. That Act does not permit the use of marijuana because marijuana is an illegal drug under Federal Law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">(Paragraph numbers omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">A hearing on the charges was held in late January-2005 \u2014 two weeks after this court issued its decision in <em>Washburn v. Columbia Forest Products, Inc., </em>197 Or App 104, 104 P3d 609 (2005), a case involving disability discrimination claims by an employee who participated in Oregon\u2019s medical marijuana program. Because it affected the way in which the issues in this case were framed below and, consequently, the arguments made on review, we pause briefly to describe <em>Washburn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">In <em>Washburn, </em>the plaintiff suffered from muscle spasms that, left untreated, limited his ability to sleep. He had previously treated the spasms with prescription medicine but obtained a medical marijuana card because the marijuana was a more effective treatment than prescription drugs. The use of marijuana, however, caused the plaintiff to violate his employer\u2019s workplace drug policy. 197 Or App at 106-07. After his employer discharged him as a result of his inability to comply with its drug policy, the plaintiff brought a claim against his employer alleging that it had failed to meet its obligation to reasonably accommodate his disability under ORS 659A.112(2)(e). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In response to the complaint, the employer moved for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) the plaintiff was not a qualified individual with a disability (and therefore was not protected by Oregon disability discrimination law) and (2) the OMMA does not require employers to accommodate medical marijuana users. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer on both grounds. We reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 116-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Our opinion in <em>Washburn </em>touched on three discrete issues. First, we concluded that the plaintiff was, in fact, disabled \u2014 despite the fact that mitigating measures were available that rendered the limitation of his life activities less than substantial. <em>Id. </em>at 111. Second, we rejected the employer\u2019s arguments based on ORS 475.340(2), a statute in the OMMA that provides that nothing in the OMMA shall be construed to require \u201c[a]n employer to accommodate the medical use of marijuana in any workplace.\u201d That statute, we held, was inapplicable because the plaintiff had not \u201cused\u201d marijuana in the workplace; rather, he simply had evidence of marijuana consumption in his bloodstream. Third, we rejected the employer\u2019s argument that the actions that it took were authorized or required by the federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, 41 USC \u00a7\u00a7 701-07.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As in the case of ORS 475.340(2), because the plaintiff did not engage in any prohibited act \u201cin the workplace,\u201d it could not be said that the plaintiff \u201cviolated (or caused [his employer] to violate) the Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act.\u201d <em>Washburn, </em>197 Or App at 115. Moreover, we explained that the federal Drug-Free Workplace Act only prohibited acts that were \u201cunlawful,\u201d and the medical use of marijuana was not \u201cunlawful\u201d under Oregon law. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remanded the case to the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">As noted above, the contested case hearing in this case took place shortly after we issued our opinion in <em>Washburn. </em>At the beginning of the contested case hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) and the parties engaged in a colloquy regarding the effect of that decision on employer\u2019s defenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">\u201c[ALJ]: Yeah. Let\u2019s talk about those affirmative defenses. * * * [I]t wasn\u2019t clear to me whether or not you were actually waiving or withdrawing the other affirmative defenses or simply just stating that you thought that they probably \u2014 you weren\u2019t going to give them a lot of energy. I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>\u201c[Employer\u2019s counsel]: They\u2019re foreclosed by the <em>Washburn </em>decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">\u201c[ALJ]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201c[Employer\u2019s counsel]: I conceded that. <em>And that\u2019s the second, third, fourth and fifth affirmative defenses. I\u2019m not withdrawing them because I need them to be part of my record, but I\u2019m not going to present evidence in support of them.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201c[ALJ]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201c[Employer\u2019s counsel]: And they\u2019re primarily legal issues, in any event. But because of the <em>Washburn </em>decision, that\u2019s really eliminated those for consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201c[ALJ]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201c[BOLI\u2019s representative]: Because they weren\u2019t being brought forth at the hearing, I didn\u2019t prepare anything on them as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">Believing that those four affirmative defenses were foreclosed by <em>Washburn, </em>employer directed its evidence and arguments at the hearing to the theory that complainant was fired because he lied about his drug use and later refused to take a drug test. In March 2005, the ALJ issued a proposed order that rejected that theory and concluded that employer had failed to reasonably accommodate complainant\u2019s disability. With respect to the second, third, fourth, and fifth affirmative defenses, the ALJ stated that the \u201cfour affirmative defenses * * * have been rendered moot by the Oregon Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>[Washburn].\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">In April 2005, employer filed exceptions to the proposed order. Employer stated, in part, that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">\u201cexcepts to the finding that four affirmative defenses raised by it were rendered \u2018moot\u2019 by the <em>Washburn </em>decision. The defenses are not moot because the <em>Washburn </em>case is still in the courts; rather [employer] simply conceded that <em>Washburn, </em>as it stood at the time of hearing, would result in those affirmative defenses being denied as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>(Record citations omitted.) Two months later, and before the agency issued a final order, employer filed a document entitled \u201csupplemental exceptions and motion to reopen contested case record.\u201d That filing provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">\u201cRespondent excepts to the award in favor of [complainant] and excepts to the finding that [c]omplainant\u2019s use of marijuana was legal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u201cRespondent further moves, pursuant to OAR 839-050-0410, that the forum reopen the record to consider the case of <em>Gonzales v. Raich, </em>[545 US 1, 125 S Ct 2195, 162 L Ed 2d 1 (2005)], decided June 6, 2005. In that case the United States Supreme Court held, in a 6-3 decision, that the states may not authorize the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, and that the drug remains illegal by virtue of federal law. The impact of this decision is that [employer] should prevail on its Fourth and Fifth Affirmative Defenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">BOLI, however, opposed the supplemental exceptions and motion to reopen the contested case record. With respect to the exceptions, BOLI argued that they were untimely under OAR 839-050-0380(4), which requires that exceptions be filed within 10 days of the date of the proposed order. BOLI contended that employer had not shown good cause to reopen the record because \u201cthe real issues in the case were whether or not [employer] engaged in the interactive process with [c]omplainant and whether or not [employer] made reasonable accommodations for [c]omplainant\u2019s anxiety and depression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">BOLI further argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">\u201c[Employer] has the burden of proving its affirmative defenses, but failed to do so. The time for proving those affirmative defenses was at the hearing yet [employer] specifically chose not to present any evidence on its defenses other than its first and sixth affirmative defense, thereby effectively waiving the remaining defenses. Assuming for the sake of argument that the forum were to allow [employer\u2019s] motion, there simply was no evidence presented whatsoever that the [c]omplainant engaged in the use of marijuana while on the job. [Employer] never required [c]omplainant to take a drug test, even after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>[cjomplainant told [employer] of his disability and off-duty use of medical marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">\u201cHad the ALJ\u2019s decision been based on a failure to accommodate the use of medical marijuana, the case on which [employer] now relies did not invalidate Oregon\u2019s medical marijuana law. [Employer] would need to successfully argue at rehearing that Oregon\u2019s Medical Marijuana law is preempted by federal law. Respondent could have made that argument at hearing but deliberately chose not to do so. Respondent should have been aware of the federal case at the time of hearing, and, should have made its arguments then. It had the opportunity to do so but simply [chose] not to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The ALJ agreed with BOLI that the supplemental exceptions were untimely; accordingly, it ruled that the supplemental exceptions would not be considered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the ALJ ruled that he would \u201cconsider the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Gonzales </em>to the extent that it is relevant to [employer\u2019s] case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In September 2005, BOLI, through its commissioner, issued a final order that adhered to the proposed finding that employer had failed to reasonably accommodate complainant\u2019s disability. However, in response to employer\u2019s exceptions, the final order deleted any reference to the second, third, fourth, and fifth affirmative defenses being \u201cmoot.\u201d Rather, the order stated that employer had \u201cconceded that <em>Washburn, </em>as it stood at the time of hearing, would result in these four affirmative defenses being denied as a matter of law and did not present any evidence in support of them,\u201d and that, \u201cuntil such time as the [Oregon] Supreme Court reverses the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, this forum is bound by the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">With respect to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gonzales, </em>the final order provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201cIn a supplemental exception, [employer] asked that the forum consider <em>[Gonzales], </em>a medical marijuana case decided after the Proposed Order was issued. [Employer] argued that <em>[Gonzales] </em>supported [its] fourth and fifth affirmative defenses. In <em>[Gonzales], </em>the U.S. Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>held that Congress has the authority to prohibit the wholly local cultivation of marijuana even if it was used for wholly medicinal purposes pursuant to California law. According to the Oregon Attorney General, <em>[Gonzales] </em>does not invalidate the OMMA nor require that Oregon repeal the OMMA, and does not oblige Oregon to follow the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC \u00a7 801 <em>et seq. </em>Accordingly, <em>Gonzales </em>does not affect the outcome of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Employer then sought judicial review of the final order. In the meantime, and while review was pending in this court, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Washburn v. Columbia Forest Products, Inc., </em>340 Or 469, 134 P3d 161 (2006), which reversed our decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In <em>Washburn, </em>the Supreme Court held that this court had erred in concluding that the plaintiff was \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of ORS 659A.100(1)(a). Specifically, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201c[W]ith regard to the substantive provisions set out in ORS 659A.112 to ORS 659A.139, the legislature intended the definition of\u2018disabled person\u2019 to be construed in light of mitigating measures that counteract or ameliorate an individual\u2019s impairment. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">340 Or at 479. Because the plaintiff in that case was able to counteract his physical impairments with prescription medication \u2014 as opposed to marijuana \u2014 his employer had no duty to accommodate his physical limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 480. Given the court\u2019s resolution of the case at that threshold inquiry, it did not address any of the other issues that this court had decided concerning the application of the OMMA or the federal Drug-Free Workplace Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Although a petition for judicial review had been filed in this case, BOLI, through its commissioner, elected to withdraw and reconsider its final order in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Washburn. </em>In its final order on reconsideration, BOLI adhered to the finding that complainant was \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of ORS 659A.100(l)(a), because \u201c[c]omplainant, like the plaintiff in <em>Washburn, </em>tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>to obtain relief from his medical conditions through prescription medications and medical marijuana, but did not achieve the same result.\u201d That is, BOLI concluded that complainant remained substantially limited in a major life activity even with mitigating measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">BOLI also considered the effect of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Washburn </em>on the second, third, fourth, and fifth affirmative defenses. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cAt hearing, [employer] conceded that [the Court of Appeals decision in] <em>Washburn, </em>as it stood at the time of hearing, would result in these four affirmative defenses being denied as a matter of law and did not present any evidence in support of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201cAs noted earlier, the Oregon Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision on May 4,2006. However, the court\u2019s scope of inquiry did not reach to any of these affirmative defenses. As a result, the forum does not consider them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Accordingly, BOLI adhered to its finding that employer had failed to reasonably accommodate defendant\u2019s disability. Employer seeks judicial review of that final order on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"ACy\">A. <em>First Assignment of Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">In its first assignment of error, employer contends that \u201c[t]he Forum erred in finding that [employer] was obligated to reasonably accommodate Complainant\u2019s medical marijuana use.\u201d In support of that assignment of error, employer advances three separate arguments. First, employer argues that, because marijuana is a controlled substance under federal law, the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) \u201cdoes not protect against current marijuana use.\u201d Thus, according to employer, \u201c[i]f the Oregon statutory scheme is construed consistently with the federal statutory scheme then medical marijuana use is not a protected activity under Oregon\u2019s anti-discrimination laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Second, employer argues that ORS 659A.124 \u201cis taken virtually verbatim from 42 USC section 12114(a); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>provides that the protections of ORS 659A.112 (with exceptions not relevant here) do not apply to any job applicant or employee who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs if the employer takes action based on that [conduct].\u201d (Record citation omitted.) According to employer, because complainant \u201cwas currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs [,] [h]e is not within the protection of ORS 659A.112.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Third, employer argues that, \u201c[a]s a constitutional matter, the [S]upremacy [C]lause of the United States Constitution, Article VI, effectively mandates these statutory interpretations.\u201d (Record citations omitted.) That is, he argues that any other interpretation of Oregon\u2019s unlawful discrimination statutes is preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">BOLI, in response, contends that none of those arguments was raised below and, therefore, any error is not preserved for our review. <em>See Marbet v. Portland Gen. Elect., </em>277 Or 447, 456, 561 P2d 154 (1977) (\u201cThe requirement that a party must have objected before the agency to errors he asserts on judicial review is one facet of the general doctrine that a party must exhaust his administrative remedies.\u201d); <em>Larsen v. Board of Parole, </em>206 Or App 353, 366, 138 P3d 16 (2006) (\u201cThe preservation requirements established in ORAP 5.45(1) apply to petitions for review of agency action.\u201d). We agree with BOLI.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">According to employer, the first assignment of error was adequately preserved because it \u201cwas raised as an affirmative defense in the Answer filed by [employer]. In addition, it was raised in [employer\u2019s] Supplemental Exceptions and Motion to Reopen Contested Case Record and Respondent\u2019s Memorandum in Support of Supplemental Exceptions for Untimeliness.\u201d (Record citations omitted.) After reviewing the portions of the record cited by employer, we conclude that none of them supports employer\u2019s contention that the first assignment of error is preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">As explained above, employer did, in fact, assert four affirmative defenses that addressed statutory construction questions similar to those now asserted on judicial review. Nonetheless, employer took the position below that the affirmative defenses were foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Washburn </em>and made no argument and offered no evidence as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>to those affirmative defenses. Instead, employer\u2019s counsel explained that he was asserting the affirmative defenses \u201cto be part of my record\u201d \u2014 that is, for purposes of challenging on review this court\u2019s decision in <em>Washburn. </em>Employer concedes as much on review when it submits that the issues that it now raises on review were not briefed below \u201cbecause the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Washburn </em>held that the issues involving the OMMA and legality of medical marijuana were state law issues. * * * Briefing would have been a waste of time. The forum had no choice but to follow <em>Washburn.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Thus, the only issues that employer raised during the contested case hearing with respect to its affirmative defenses were those issues controlled by <em>Washburn. </em>On review, however, employer does not raise those issues but instead raises new and different issues regarding the construction of Oregon\u2019s unlawful discrimination statutes\u2014 issues that, as discussed above, 220 Or App at 430, were not addressed in <em>Washburn. </em>Thus, we are not persuaded that employer\u2019s affirmative defenses preserved the issues that it now raises on review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">As noted above, employer also contends that it preserved its first assignment of error in its \u201cSupplemental Exceptions and Motion to Reopen Contested Case Record and Respondent\u2019s Memorandum in Support of Supplemental Exceptions for Untimeliness.\u201d The motion and memorandum, based on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Raich, </em>contended that the OMMA was preempted by federal law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the issue that employer raises on review, as best as we can discern, is that the \u201c[S]upremacy [C] lause of the United States Constitution * * * effectively mandates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>these statutory interpretations [of Oregon\u2019s unlawful discrimination statutes].\u201d Thus, the preemption issue that employer raised below (that the OMMA is preempted) was a different preemption question from the one asserted on review (that the Supremacy Clause requires a particular construction and application of Oregon\u2019s unlawful discrimination statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">For the reasons stated above, none of the issues raised by employer\u2019s first assignment of error was raised below in a way that would have provided the ALJ or BOLI\u2019s commissioner with an opportunity to address those issues in the first instance. Accordingly, we will not consider those issues for the first time on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">B. <em>Second Assignment of Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In its second assignment of error, employer argues that \u201c[t]he Forum erred in denying [employer\u2019s] Motion to Dismiss/Altemative Motion to Strike upon the grounds that it was constitutionally entitled to a jury under Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution.\u201d Specifically, employer argues that, because an employee can commence a civil action under ORS 659A.870 (which entitles an employer to a jury trial) or file an administrative complaint with BOLI (which does not include the right to a jury trial), the complainant can \u201carbitrarily select a proceeding when the statutes themselves provide no basis for making such a distinction.\u201d Thus, employer argues that it is \u201ca member of a group that is denied a jury trial and asserts that there is no rational foundation for that in light of the state\u2019s purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o law shall be passed granting to any citizen or class of citizens privileges, or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.\u201d Article I, section 20, affects only laws that regulate on the basis of a \u201ctrue class\u201d rather than a classification made by the law alone. <em>See Hale v. Port of Portland, </em>308 Or 508, 525, 783 P2d 506 (1989) (a \u201ctrue class\u201d is one whose members have in common some \u201cantecedent personal or social characteristics or societal status\u201d); <em>see also MacPherson v. DAS, </em>340 Or 117, 129, 130 P3d 308 (2006) (\u201c[T]his court consistently has held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>that the protection that Article I, section 20, affords is available to only those individuals or groups whom the law classifies according to characteristics that exist apart from the enactment that they challenge.\u201d). Assuming that employer is a \u201ccitizen\u201d under Article I, section 20, employer does not explain, and we do not understand, how it is a member of a \u201ctrue class\u201d that has been denied equal privileges. For that reason, we reject employer\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> The Oregon Medical Marijuana Act (OMMA), ORS 475.300 - 475.346, allows the use of marijuana, under some circumstances, to mitigate the symptoms of a debilitating medical condition.
