J.</author>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Plaintiff, personally and as the personal representative of the estate of Donald Perman,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals, challenging the trial court\u2019s allowance of summary judgment in favor of defendant, Quimby Welding Supplies, Inc.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on claims arising out of decedent\u2019s alleged exposure to asbestos while working as a welder and sheet metal mechanic at American Sheet Metal (ASM) in Tualatin between 1966 and 1978. The trial court granted summary judgment, based on its determination that plaintiff had failed to present evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable trier of fact to find that defendant had supplied asbestos-containing products, including gloves, that decedent and his coworkers used at ASM, causing him to be injuriously exposed to asbestos fibers. For the reasons that follow, we disagree, and, thus, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The pertinent procedural circumstances are undisputed. The complaint, filed in January 2004, alleges that various entities, including defendant, had distributed asbestos-containing products and that, as a result of exposure to those products in workplaces, including at ASM, decedent had suffered asbestos-related injuries and disease. Specifically, with respect to defendant, the complaint alleged that defendant had \u201cengaged in the supply, distribution and sale of hazardous asbestos-containing products, including gloves, mittens, and welding blankets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Defendant subsequently moved for summary judgment, contending that plaintiff had been unable, notwithstanding substantial discovery, to adduce evidence that decedent had been injuriously exposed at ASM to any asbestos-containing products distributed by defendant. In support of that motion, defendant proffered, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaration from one of its former employees, Crowther, stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>defendant had never distributed asbestos-containing products to ASM during the period of decedent\u2019s employment. Defendant also submitted a declaration from Stull, an expert witness, who stated that, based on his research regarding welding gloves and mittens available during decedent\u2019s employment at ASM, he had determined that a variety of entities had produced and distributed gloves and mittens corresponding to decedent\u2019s description of those that he and his coworkers had used and that, \u201c[although some of these contained asbestos,\u201d others included \u201ca number of other fabrics, including but not limited to, fiberglass and flame-retardant treated cotton [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">In opposing summary judgment, plaintiff proffered two submissions that are particularly pertinent to our analysis and disposition. <em>First, </em>plaintiff submitted excerpts of decedent\u2019s deposition testimony. In that testimony, decedent stated that (1) during his employment at ASM, he used both \u201cleather gloves\u201d and \u201csilver gloves\u201d; (2) the \u201csilver gloves\u201d had \u201ca thumb and a-one finger and the rest was like a mitten\u201d and, \u201cwhen it wore through, it had a material in there that appeared to be asbestos\u201d; (3) decedent believed that the material was asbestos because it was \u201ca white material, kind of wool-ish\u201d that \u201clooked similar to the \u2014 the blankets or the insulation [he] had seen\u201d; and (4) defendant supplied \u201cmany boxes\u201d of gloves, including \u201csilver gloves,\u201d to ASM.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><em>Second, </em>plaintiff submitted a declaration from Charles Mariani, a coworker of decedent\u2019s at ASM. Mariani stated that, during their employment, he and decedent were required to wear \u201casbestos gloves\u201d on a \u201cregular basis\u201d to protect their hands, and those \u201casbestos gloves,\u201d which \u201clooked more like mittens,\u201d were a \u201cdirty silver color on the back\u201d and \u201coff white\u201d on the palm side. In paragraph 5 of his declaration, Mariani stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201cDuring the 1960s and early 1970s I became aware that the asbestos gloves/mitts used at American Sheet Metal, that I described above, were supplied by Quimby Welding Supplies, located in Portland, Oregon. This is because we often spoke with the Quimby Welding Supplies sales representative, who I believe was named Mr. Ron Selis. Mr. Selis came to our shop to sell us this protective equipment on a regular basis and met with our purchasing agent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Homer Grote. Mr. Grote told us that these gloves/mitts were supplied by Quimby Welding Supplies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel also submitted, pursuant to ORCP 47 E, a declaration stating that plaintiff had retained a qualified expert witness. That declaration is almost exclusively devoted to describing the expert\u2019s putative testimony regarding the dynamics of the \u201crelease of respirable asbestos fibers into the workplace\u201d and decedent\u2019s consequent injurious exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Defendant subsequently moved to strike those portions of both decedent\u2019s deposition testimony and Mariani\u2019s declaration, in which they either described the \u201csilver gloves\u201d as containing asbestos or characterized those gloves as \u201casbestos gloves,\u201d as being incompetent and without adequate foundation. Defendant further moved to strike paragraph 5 of Mariani\u2019s declaration, describing defendant as the supplier of the \u201casbestos gloves,\u201d as being based on hearsay and without personal knowledge. In addition, by way of reply, defendant submitted a declaration from its former sales manager, Selis, stating that he had \u201cnever sold gloves, asbestos-containing or not, to American Sheet Metal,\u201d and a supplemental declaration from Mariani, stating that he did not \u201cpersonally know\u201d whether defendant had supplied gloves or mitts to ASM and that, dining the time that he had worked at ASM, he \u201cdid not know whether any of the gloves [he] worked with contained asbestos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Finally, plaintiff submitted a second supplemental declaration from Mariani, in which he disavowed and recanted his supplemental declaration and reiterated his statements in his original declaration, specifically including paragraph 5 of the original declaration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The trial court granted summary judgment. Specifically, the court concluded that, even if defendant\u2019s motions to strike portions of decedent\u2019s deposition testimony and Mariani\u2019s declaration were denied, plaintiffs\u2019 submissions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>were still insufficient to raise a disputed issue of fact as to whether defendant distributed asbestos-containing gloves to ASM during decedent\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">On appeal, plaintiff reiterates her fundamental contention that decedent\u2019s deposition testimony and Mariani\u2019s declaration (specifically including paragraph 5) individually and collectively create a triable issue of material fact as to whether defendant distributed asbestos-containing gloves to ASM during decedent\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant, as it did before the trial court, counters that the relevant portions of decedent\u2019s deposition testimony and of Mariani\u2019s declaration are inadmissible \u2014 and that, even if they were admissible, they are insufficient to defeat summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Summary judgment is proper only if the \u201cpleadings, depositions, affidavits, declarations and admissions on file show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact * * * \u201d ORCP 47 C.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201cNo genuine issue as to a material fact exists if, based upon the record before the court viewed in a manner most favorable to the adverse party, no objectively reasonable juror could return a verdict for the adverse party on the matter that is the subject of the motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-7\"><em>Id. </em>When reviewing the allowance of summary judgment, we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff, as the nonmoving party. <em>West v. Allied Signal, </em>Inc., 200 Or App 182, 187, 113 P3d 983 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">We begin by assessing the admissibility of the evidence. Defendant argues that decedent\u2019s statements identifying the gloves defendant supplied to ASM as containing asbestos is inadmissible under OEC 701, because decedent was a lay witness and, consequently, was unqualified to testify about the composition of gloves that he used in the 1960s and 1970s. OEC 701 limits the testimony of nonexperts on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>their \u201copinions or inferences\u201d to those \u201copinions or inferences\u201d that are: \u201c(1) Rationally based on the perception of the witness; and (2) Helpful to a clear understanding of testimony of the witness or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d In defendant\u2019s view, decedent\u2019s testimony that he used gloves that contained asbestos is inadmissible, because he was not an expert at identifying asbestos. We disagree. Although decedent was not an \u201casbestos expert,\u201d his testimony makes clear that, during his employment as a welder and sheet metal worker, he had seen asbestos before and, based on the combination of that experience and his perceptions, had substantial and rational reason to believe that the \u201cwhite material [that was] kind of* * * wool-ish\u201d in the gloves was asbestos. In sum, decedent\u2019s statement was \u201cRationally based on [his] perception\u201d and would be helpful to the trier of fact, OEC 701, and, thus, is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Defendant next argues that paragraph 5 of Mariani\u2019s declaration in which he identified defendant as a supplier of \u201casbestos gloves\u201d to ASM is inadmissible because it is based on hearsay. Again, paragraph 5 of Mariani\u2019s declaration reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201cDuring the 1960s and early 1970s I became aware that the asbestos gloves/mitts used at American Sheet Metal, that I described above, were supplied by Quimby Welding Supplies, located in Portland, Oregon. This is because we often spoke with the Quimby Welding Supplies sales representative, who I believe was named Mr. Ron Selis. Mr. Selis came to our shop to sell us this protective equipment on a regular basis and met with our purchasing agent, Homer Grote. Mr. Grote told us that these gloves/mitts were supplied by Quimby Welding Supplies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Defendant argues that Mariani\u2019s alleged knowledge that defendant had supplied the \u201casbestos gloves\u201d used at ASM was based solely on Mariani\u2019s conversation with ASM\u2019s purchasing agent, Grote, and, thus, was based on inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Plaintiff responds that Mariani\u2019s declaration describes two distinct sources of his asserted knowledge that defendant supplied asbestos gloves to ASM: (1) his conversations with defendant\u2019s sales representative, Selis, and (2) his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>conversations with ASM\u2019s purchasing agent, Grote. Plaintiff further reasons that, even assuming that Mariani\u2019s recitation of the latter was inadmissible hearsay, the former was not, because Selis was <em>defendant\u2019s </em>agent. <em>See </em>OEC 80 l(4)(b)(D) (A statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and is a \u201cstatement by the party\u2019s agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship.\u201d). In all events, plaintiff contends, even if paragraph 5 of Mariani\u2019s declaration could be reasonably read in more than one way, so long as it is reasonably susceptible to the reading that plaintiff posits, that is sufficient to render Mariani\u2019s statement that defendant had supplied asbestos gloves to ASM admissible for purposes of controverting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">We agree with plaintiff. Paragraph 5 of Mariani\u2019s declaration is reasonably susceptible to the inference that Mariani\u2019s belief that defendant had supplied \u201casbestos gloves\u201d to ASM was based on his own conversations with defendant\u2019s agent, Selis: \u201cThis is because <em>we </em>often spoke with the Quimby Welding Supplies sales representative, who I believe was named Mr. Ron Selis.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That is not, of course, the only plausible reading of paragraph 5 \u2014 or even, perhaps, the most plausible reading \u2014 but it is plausible. Consequently, paragraph 5 describes a sufficient and admissible basis for Mariani\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The question thus reduces to whether decedent\u2019s deposition testimony and Mariani\u2019s declaration (omitting the statements pertaining to Grote in paragraph 5) are sufficient, individually or collectively, to raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether defendant supplied asbestos-containing gloves to ASM during decedent\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>We conclude that plaintiffs evidence is sufficient to preclude summary judgment. As noted, decedent testified that defendant had supplied \u201csilver gloves\u201d to ASM and that the \u201csilver gloves\u201d contained a material, which decedent \u2014 a long-time welder and sheet metal worker, who was familiar with other products containing asbestos \u2014 believed to be asbestos. That testimony alone would be sufficient to preclude summary judgment \u2014 and, in all events, it is buttressed and corroborated by Mariani\u2019s declaration, specifically paragraph 5, which, as explained above, can reasonably be understood to state that Mariani knew that defendant had supplied the \u201casbestos gloves\u201d to ASM because defendant\u2019s sales representative, Selis, had told him so.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">To be sure, defendant proffered evidence, including a declaration by Selis, stating that he had never sold any gloves \u2014 much less any asbestos-containing gloves \u2014 to ASM, and a declaration by the expert witness, Stull, that ASM never distributed a \u201cone-fingered mitten\u201d conforming to decedent\u2019s description that contained asbestos. But those statements do not compel the allowance of summary judgment. Rather, in juxtaposition with plaintiffs evidentiary submissions, they disclose a quintessential \u201cjury question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The trial court erred in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\"> Donald Perman died after the trial court granted summary judgment. Thus, we refer to Judy Perman as plaintiff, even though she brings different claims on behalf of herself, and in her capacity as the estate\u2019s representative. We refer to Donald Perman as decedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\"> Plaintiff dismissed claims against other defendants who were named in the action below and are no longer parties to this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\"> Paragraph 11 of Mariani\u2019s second supplemental declaration is identical to paragraph 5 of his original declaration, except the first sentence was slightly modified to read as follows: \u201cI know that the asbestos gloves/mitts used at American Sheet Metal that I described above, were supplied by Quimby Welding Supplies, located in Portland, Oregon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\"> Plaintiff acknowledges that there is no evidence that defendant distributed any other asbestos-containing product, including welding blankets and other protective clothing, to ASM. Accordingly, we limit our analysis to the propriety of summary judgment with respect to defendant\u2019s alleged provision to ASM of asbestos-containing gloves and mittens.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\"> If plaintiff has adduced such evidence, plaintiffs attorney's ORCP 47 E declaration is sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether \u201c \u2018the presence of that asbestos played a role in the occurrence of the plaintiffs injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Purcell v.
