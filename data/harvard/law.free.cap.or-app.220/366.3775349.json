J.</author>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Defendant was convicted of first-degree sodomy, ORS 163.405, and first-degree kidnapping, ORS 163.235. At sentencing, the court determined that, under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), it could not make factual findings in support of consecutive sentences, ORS 137.123, but that it could make factual findings in support of a sexually violent dangerous offender sentence, under ORS 137.767, on the sodomy conviction. Defendant appealed, arguing that the court erred in imposing a sexually violent dangerous offender sentence because <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>required jury findings to support such a sentence; the state cross-appealed, arguing that the court erred in concluding that it could not impose consecutive sentences on the convictions in light of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi. </em>We reversed and remanded for resentencing on cross-appeal in light of our then-recent decision in <em>State v. Tanner, </em>210 Or App 70, 150 P3d 31 (2006), and, consequently, did not reach the issue raised on appeal. <em>State v. Hopson, </em>214 Or App 288, 164 P3d 342 (2007). The Oregon Supreme Court allowed review, vacated our decision, and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), <em>cert </em>granted,_US_, 128 S Ct 1657 (2008). <em>State v. Hopson, </em>343 Or 366, 170 P3d 1064 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In <em>Ice, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court held that judicial factfinding in support of consecutive sentences pursuant to ORS 137.123 violated the rule of law announced in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi. </em>Consequently, and contrary to our original disposition, the trial court in this case was correct in concluding that it lacked the ability to make factual findings in support of a consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Given that conclusion, we must now address defendant\u2019s assignment of error on appeal: Does judicial factfinding in support of a sexually violent dangerous offender sentence pursuant to ORS 137.765 likewise run afoul of <em>Blakely </em>and Apprendi? As explained below, we conclude that the answer is yes. Accordingly, we remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ORS 137.767 allows a sentencing court to impose a sentence that includes a lifetime period of post-prison supervision for certain offenses, but only if the court finds that the \u201cperson is a sexually violent dangerous offender.\u201d ORS 137.765(2)(b). \u201cSexually violent dangerous offender,\u201d in turn, is defined in ORS 137.765(l)(b) as \u201ca person who has psychopathic personality features, sexually deviant arousal patterns or interests and a history of sexual assault and presents a substantial probability of committing a crime listed in subsection (3) of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">In this case, defendant argued at sentencing that judicial factfinding in support of a sexually violent dangerous offender sentence would run afoul of the rule of law announced in <em>Blakely, </em>as interpreted in our then-recent case, <em>State v. Warren, </em>195 Or App 656, 98 P3d 1129 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 201 (2006) (regarding dangerous offender sentences). The sentencing court disagreed, and proceeded to find that defendant displayed psychopathic personality features and sexually deviant arousal patterns of interest, that he had a history of sexual assaults, and that he presented a substantial probability of committing crimes listed in ORS 137.765(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Defendant renews his challenge on appeal, reiterating the basic tenets from <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi: </em>\u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 US at 490. Moreover, a \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d is the \u201cmaximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 US at 303 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The determination that a convicted defendant is a sexually violent dangerous offender has very substantial practical consequences. In this case, for example, but for defendant\u2019s designation as a sexually violent dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>offender, he would have been required to serve only a three-year term of post-prison supervision after his incarceration term. OAR, 213-005-0002(2). As sanction for violation of the terms of post-prison supervision, an offender serving a three-year term of post-prison supervision may be required to serve up to a maximum of 12 months\u2019 incarceration. OAR 213-011-0004(3)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In contrast, as a sexually violent dangerous offender, defendant is required to serve a lifetime term of post-prison supervision after his incarceration. OAR 213-005-0002(2)(b)(B); OAR 213-005-0004(3). Moreover, the limits on sanctions provided in OAR 213-011-0004(3) do not apply. OAR 213-005-0004(4). Rather, for violations of post-prison supervision, defendant \u201cmay be incarcerated up to 180 days for any violation of post-prison supervision. The sanction may be imposed repeatedly during the term of the post-prison supervision for subsequent post-prison supervision violations.\u201d OAR 213-005-0004(5). In addition, as a sexually violent dangerous offender, defendant \u201cshall be subject to intensive supervision for the full period of post-prison supervision[.]\u201d OAR 213-011-0003(2). He \u201cmay not reside near locations where children are the primary occupants or users.\u201d OAR 255-060-0009(1); see <em>also </em>OAR 291-202-0040(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Despite those enhanced aspects of defendant\u2019s sentence, the state argues that the rule of law from <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>should not apply, because that rule should be applicable only when an \u201cenhanced punishment involves a particularly heightened stigma and liberty deprivation\u201d \u2014 and, in the state\u2019s view, lifetime intensive post-prison supervision does not meet that standard. In support of that view, the state relies on <em>United States v. Nachtigal, </em>507 US 1, 113 S Ct 1072, 122 L Ed 2d 374 (1993). As explained below, we do not view <em>Nachtigal </em>as supporting the state\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In <em>Nachtigal, </em>the defendant, who was charged with a misdemeanor offense of driving under the influence, argued that he should be entitled to a jury trial because, even though the offense only carried a maximum term of imprisonment of six months, the court could alternatively impose a five-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>probationary term and could also impose numerous discretionary conditions of probation. 507 US at 2. The Supreme Court rejected that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">In so holding, the Court observed that whether a defendant is entitled under the Sixth Amendment to a jury trial depends on \u201cobjective indications of the seriousness with which society regards the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3 (quoting <em>Blanton v. North Las Vegas, </em>489 US 538, 541, 109 S Ct 1289, 103 L Ed 2d 550 (1989)). The Court then reiterated the analysis that it had employed in <em>Blanton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">\u201cThe best indicator of society\u2019s views is the maximum penalty set by the legislature. <em>Ibid. </em>While the word \u2018penalty\u2019 refers both to the term of imprisonment and other statutory penalties, we stated that \u2018[p] rim ary emphasis * * * must be placed on the maximum authorized period of incarceration.\u2019 <em>[Blanton, </em>489 US] at 542. We therefore held that offenses for which the maximum period of incarceration is six months or less are presumptively \u2018petty.\u2019 A defendant can overcome this presumption, and become entitled to a jury trial, only by showing that the additional penalties, viewed together with the maximum prison term, are so severe that the legislature clearly determined that the offense is a \u2018serious\u2019 one. <em>Id. </em>at 543.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\"><em>Nachtigal, </em>507 US at 3-4 (first brackets and ellipsis in original). Applying that analysis, the Court in <em>Nachtigal </em>concluded that, \u201c[b]ecause the maximum term of imprisonment is six months, [the DUII] is presumptively a petty offense to which no jury trial right attaches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The Court further concluded that the fact that the defendant in <em>Nachtigal </em>was subject to, <em>inter alia, </em>a maximum five-year term of probation as an alternative to incarceration did not overcome the <em>Blanton </em>presumption because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201c[l]ike a monetary penalty, the liberty infringement caused by a term of probation is far less intrusive than incarceration. The discretionary probation conditions do not alter this conclusion; while they obviously entail a greater infringement on liberty than probation without attendant conditions, they do not approximate the severe loss of liberty caused by imprisonment for more than six months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 5 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The state here, <em>invoking Nachtigal, </em>argues that \u201cany liberty deprivation or stigma\u201d associated with the enhanced supervision term resulting from the judicial imposition of a sexually violent dangerous offender designation is more closely analogous to the probationary term and conditions implicated in <em>Nachtigal </em>than to an increased period of incarceration, as in <em>Apprendi and Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">We note, as an initial matter, that <em>Nachtigal </em>does not purport to describe when a defendant who was entitled to a jury trial on a felony charge is entitled to have a jury find sentence enhancement factors. Rather, <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>do that \u2014 and they do it without reference to <em>Nachtigal, Blanton, </em>or any other case about discerning the difference between a \u201cpetty\u201d and a \u201cserious\u201d offense. Moreover, the test announced in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>bears no resemblance to the test described in <em>Nachtigal and Blanton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Further, and in a related sense, the <em>Blanton/ Nachtigal </em>formulation is predicated on an assessment of the maximum <em>totality </em>of punishment to which the defendant is exposed. That inquiry does not purport to permit a court, in a sentencing context, to segregate and remove from the jury\u2019s consideration \u201cnonserious,\u201d as opposed to \u201cserious,\u201d sanctions. Thus, even under its own terms, if we were to apply the <em>Blanton/Nachtigal </em>\u201cseriousness\u201d formulation here, we would be obligated to consider the <em>entire </em>putative sentencing \u201cpackage\u201d \u2014 that is, the <em>combination </em>of the \u201cadditional penalties\u201d attending the sexually violent dangerous offender designation (viz., lifetime intensive post-prison supervision with unlimited incarcerative sanctions) and the \u201cmaximum prison term.\u201d <em>Nachtigal, </em>507 US at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In this case, defendant received a mandatory minimum sentence on his sodomy conviction of 100 months pursuant to ORS 137.700(2)(a)(L) (Measure 11). Because, under ORS 137.700(1), he will not be eligible for any reductions in that term, that is his \u201cprison term\u201d for purposes of the test set forth in <em>Nachtigal. </em>Under Oregon law, there are only a handful of crimes that carry sanctions as severe or more severe. <em>See generally </em>ORS 137.700 (murder, attempted aggravated murder, manslaughter, and certain first-degree sexual offenses); ORS 163.095 (aggravated murder). In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>only crimes for which a defendant must serve lifetime post-prison supervision are aggravated murder and murder, unless the defendant has been found to be a sexually violent dangerous offender. OAR 213-005-0004. Given the seriousness of the offense and the extent of the sanctions involved, the state\u2019s suggestion, under <em>Nachtigal, </em>that the sanctions at issue here are \u201cpetty\u201d rather than \u201cserious\u201d is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Conversely, application of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>here is straightforward. Post-prison supervision is part of a sentence. <em>See, e.g., Haskins v. Palmateer, </em>186 Or App 159, 63 P3d 31, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 510 (2003); OAR 213-005-0001(3); OAR 213-005-0003. A court is limited to the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d sentence that can be imposed based on the facts found by the jury or admitted by defendant, other than prior convictions. In particular, as the Court noted in <em>Blakely, </em>the statutory maximum is the \u201cmaximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely </em>on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d 542 US at 303 (original emphasis omitted; emphasis added). In order to impose post-prison supervision beyond the three-year term otherwise authorized by OAR 213-005-0002(2) (that is, the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d), the sentencing court needed to make additional factual findings \u2014 those required by ORS 137.765(2)(b). Because those facts were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the court erred in imposing a sexually violent dangerous offender sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">On appeal, sentence vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed. On cross-appeal, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> ORS 137.767(6) and (7) currently make provisions for jury determination of facts relevant to sexually violent dangerous offender sentencing, but those provisions were not in place when defendant was sentenced.
