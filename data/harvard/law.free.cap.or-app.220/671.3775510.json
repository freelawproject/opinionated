J.</author>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Respondent Interstate Roofing, Inc., has moved for reconsideration of our decision of January 9, 2008. <em>Interstate Roofing, Inc. v. Springville Corp., </em>217 Or App 412, 177 P3d 1 (2008). Interstate points out certain factual errors in the opinion and contests our ruling that the limited judgment entered by the trial court did not dispose of all three claims mentioned in the judgment. We agree that our decision contains factual errors. One of those leads us to modify the disposition of Interstate\u2019s motion to dismiss (we should have granted the motion in its entirety rather than granting it in part and denying it in part), but, otherwise, none of the misstatements affects our analysis of the issues or disposition of the motions addressed in the opinion. Further, although Interstate has not persuaded us that we reached the wrong conclusion as to the effect of the limited judgment, our own research suggests that we erred in concluding that the trial court did not intend to dispose of Interstate\u2019s lien foreclosure claim. Therefore, we grant reconsideration and modify our prior decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">We briefly recapitulate the procedural posture of the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">\u201cPlaintiff Interstate * * * filed this action to foreclose a construction lien that it had filed on a property development owned and operated by Springville * * *. Interstate pleaded three claims against Springville: foreclosure of a construction lien, breach of contract, and <em>quantum meruit, </em>together with a request for attorney fees. Springville asserted counterclaims for breach of contract and negligence and sought attorney fees in connection with Interstate\u2019s construction lien claim and both parties\u2019 breach of contract claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 415 (footnotes omitted). The trial court entered three judgments. On September 29, 2006, it entered a limited judgment and money award.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">\u201cThe second paragraph of the limited judgment recites that the case was bifurcated for the purpose of trying Interstate\u2019s construction lien claim and Springville\u2019s counterclaims to the court, leaving to a later date a jury trial for Interstate\u2019s remaining claims. The judgment goes on to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>state that the court heard the testimony of the parties, reviewed the parties\u2019 exhibits, and had \u2018recited [its] rulings from the bench, including some findings of fact.\u2019 The limited judgment further states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\">\u201c \u2018In addition to all findings related on the record, the Court found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201c T. Plaintiffs Construction Lien was overstated and thus is invalid as a matter of law. As such, Defendant Springville is the Prevailing Party on that claim and is entitled to an Award of Attorney Fees and Costs to be determined by ORCP 68.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">\u201c \u20182. As to Defendant Springville\u2019s Claim of Breach of Contract, Defendant is entitled to Judgment against Plaintiff and a Money Award in the amount of $346,872.22. Prevailing Party Status has not yet been determined on this claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">\u201c \u20183. The Court finds Defendant\u2019s Claims for Negligence, including Negligence <em>per </em>se[,[ are inapplicable to the subject case. Specifically, the Court finds that, as a matter of law, a remedy in Tort is not available.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">The court subsequently granted plaintiffs motion for voluntary dismissal of its breach of contract and <em>quantum meruit </em>claims. On April 16, 2007, the court entered a supplemental judgment awarding attorney fees and costs. On April 20, 2007, the court entered a general judgment of dismissal without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">On May 16, 2007, Springville filed a notice of appeal from all three judgments, acknowledging that, because eight months had elapsed between entry of the limited judgment and the notice of appeal, jurisdiction was \u201cnot free from doubt,\u201d but that the doubt should be resolved in favor of Springville. According to Springville, its appeal was timely because none of the judgments that would have started the time clock for filing a notice of appeal was valid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Springville <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>urged us to hold its appeal in abeyance and permit the trial court to enter appealable judgments, as permitted by ORS 19.270(4). Interstate, taking the hint, filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction arguing that the appeal from the limited judgment was not timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">In our opinion, we rejected Springville\u2019s contention that the general judgment was not conclusive and appeal-able. 217 Or App at 421-26. We agreed that the supplemental judgment was not appealable when entered, because a supplemental judgment cannot be entered before a general judgment, but we gave the trial court leave to reenter that judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 426-27. Lastly, we agreed with Springville that the limited judgment was not appealable as to two of the three claims mentioned in the judgment \u2014 Springville\u2019s negligence counterclaim and Interstate\u2019s lien foreclosure claim\u2014 but we disagreed with Springville that the limited judgment was not appealable as to Springville\u2019s breach of contract counterclaim. <em>Id. </em>at 416-21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Interstate contends on reconsideration that we erred in determining that the limited judgment was not also conclusive as to Springville\u2019s negligence counterclaim and Interstate\u2019s construction lien foreclosure claim. More specifically, Interstate contends that, in effect, although we gave lip service to the principle that no particular words are required to render a judgment, in fact, we are requiring use of particular words. We disagree. The limited judgment stated that Interstate\u2019s construction lien foreclosure claim was \u201cinvalid as a matter of law\u201d and that Springville\u2019s negligence claim was \u201cinapplicable to the subject case\u201d and that \u201cas a matter of law, a remedy in Tort is not available.\u201d Those are legal determinations, not dispositions of claims. A legal determination that a claim is \u201cinvalid\u201d or \u201cinapplicable\u201d is not the same as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>dismissing the claim or rendering judgment in favor of the party against whom the claim was asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">A judgment is a powerful thing. ORS 18.082 describes the effect of a judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">\u201c(1) Upon entry of a judgment, the judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u201c(a) Becomes the exclusive statement of the court\u2019s decision in the case and governs the rights and obligations of the parties that are subject to the judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">\u201c(b) May be enforced in the manner provided by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">\u201c(c) May be appealed in the manner provided by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">\u201c(d) Acts as official notice of the court\u2019s decision; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">\u201c(e) May be set aside or modified only by the court rendering the judgment or by another court or tribunal with the same or greater authority than the court rendering the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">Thus, a judgment not only becomes the exclusive statement of the court\u2019s decision as between the parties, but it also acts as \u201cofficial notice\u201d of the court\u2019s decision to the rest of the world, including those who otherwise are strangers to the case but who have dealings with the parties or with the subject matter of the action. Persons who are not acquainted with the details of an action should not have to puzzle over ambiguous language in a judgment and guess at what the trial court intended. In this case, although the judgment contains some indicia that the trial court intended to dispose conclusively of Interstate\u2019s construction lien foreclosure claim and Springville\u2019s negligence claim, the judgment does not unambiguously dispose of those claims. Given the critical role of a judgment in conclusively determining the rights and liabilities of parties to controversies, were we writing on a clean slate, we might conclude that, because a reasonable person would not have understood the limited judgment in this case to have unambiguously resolved the claims in question, the judgment was not appealable as to those claims at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">However, we are not writing on a clean slate. In <em>Bennett v. Bennett, </em>208 Or 524, 529, 302 P2d 1019 (1956), the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\u201cIf, however, the judgment is ambiguous or obscure, or a satisfactory interpretation cannot be determined from the judgment itself, the entire judgment roll or record may be looked to, examined, and considered for the purpose of interpreting the judgment and determining its operation and effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">(Internal quotation marks omitted.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><em>Bennett and Neal and Neal, </em>181 Or App 361, 366, 45 P3d 1011 (2002), indicate that the court \u201cmay\u201d look to other parts of the record or extrinsic evidence to determine the trial court\u2019s intent in rendering a judgment. In <em>Gourley v. Towery, </em>82 Or App 32, 35, 727 P2d 144 (1986), we suggested that we might have an \u201cobligation\u201d to consider the trial court record to resolve an ambiguity, but that statement is <em>dictum </em>because the court determined that the judgment at issue in that case was not ambiguous. For the purpose of enforcing a judgment as between the parties to a case, it makes sense to consider the trial court record to determine the trial court\u2019s intent. Procedurally, examining all or a substantial part of the trial court record to determine whether a judgment is appealable at all is awkward, because, typically, we do not have the trial court record before us when an appeal is filed; indeed, typically, when appealability decisions are made at the outset of an appeal, the transcript has not yet been prepared. Nevertheless, particularly given that ORS 18.082(1)(b) and (c) provide that, upon entry of a judgment, a judgment is enforceable and appealable, we perceive no principled basis on which to apply different standards for determining enforceability and appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Having concluded that we may consider the trial court record to determine whether a judgment is conclusive and appealable, the next question we address is how much of the record we should consider. When the judgment in question is a limited judgment, we rely most heavily on the record made before or at the time of entry of the limited judgment. That is so in part because, if an appeal were taken from such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>a limited judgment at the time of its entry, we would be limited to the trial court record in existence at that time. Although we may consider those parts of the trial court record memorializing proceedings that occurred after entry of a limited judgment, we accord less weight to those parts; otherwise, we leave the door open to the parties to salt the record with indications of the trial court\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d that may or may not actually reflect the trial court\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By contrast, it is appropriate to give greater weight to a post-judgment decision regarding costs or attorney fees where the award of either depends on the trial court having conclusively determined the claim or claims to which the matter of costs or attorney fees relates.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">We mention one other limitation of sorts on the record that we will consider; that is, at the outset of an appeal, generally we will confine ourselves to as much of the record as the parties have chosen to provide in support of their respective positions. We are comfortable doing so because the lack of a conclusive judgment from which an appeal may be taken is a matter of jurisdiction that can be raised at any time. <em>See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Black, </em>101 Or App 626, 628 n 1, 792 P2d 1225 (1990) (pre-oral argument determination of appellate jurisdiction may be reconsidered after oral argument). Thus, if we determine that a judgment conclusively disposes of one or more claims and the appeal proceeds as to those claims, the court may revisit the matter of appealability, especially after full briefing of a case and at the point that the court has access to the complete trial court record.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Applying those principles to this case, in addition to the limited judgment itself, we have again reviewed the following parts of the trial court record that accompanied the parties\u2019 filings in this case: the supplemental judgment awarding attorney fees and costs entered April 16, 2007; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>general judgment of dismissal entered April 20, 2007; and four excerpts from transcripts from various hearings that took place between July 18, 2006 and February 16, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">First, with respect to Interstate\u2019s lien foreclosure claim, the part of the limited judgment addressing that claim, in addition to stating that the claim was \u201cinvalid as a matter of law,\u201d also determined that Springville was the prevailing party and entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs \u201cto be determined by ORCP 68.\u201d That is some, but not indisputable, evidence that the trial court intended to dispose conclusively of that claim. In addition, the supplemental judgment adjudicating Springville\u2019s request made pursuant to ORCP 68 for costs and attorney fees contained provisions from which we can infer the trial court\u2019s intent. First (1)(h)(1) and (2) of the trial court\u2019s findings provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\u201cThe Court takes the opportunity to clarify the basis for the above findings, and references findings made at trial, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u201cD Plaintiffs Construction Lien was overstated and thus failed on that basis. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u201c2) Based on unsatisfactory work that <em>was </em>actually performed by Interstate and/or its subcontractors, Plaintiff was in breach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">(Emphasis in original.) Second, evidence of the trial court\u2019s intent is found in the following language in the supplemental judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">\u201cThe Court finds it appropriate to award partial attorney fees that reflect both the fact that Defendant prevailed on the Lien Claim and Breach of Contract <em>and </em>the totality of the evidence, including the findings recited on the record and those reflected above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">(Emphasis in original.) Similarly, and although we accord the following evidence less weight because the proceedings occurred after entry of the limited judgment, the tenor of the transcript excerpts were to the effect that the trial court believed that it had resolved Interstate\u2019s lien foreclosure claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">Taking into account those parts of the record, we determine that, when the trial court entered that judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>it intended to dispose conclusively of Interstate\u2019s lien foreclosure claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">By contrast, there is virtually no indication in the parts of the record before the court that help us resolve in the ambiguity in the limited judgment as to whether the trial court intended to dispose conclusively of Springville\u2019s negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">As applicable to that claim, Interstate contests the significance of a number of other aspects of the limited judgment on which we relied in determining its appealability. Interstate argues that none of them detracts from the determination that the limited judgment was conclusive as to all three claims mentioned therein. The point of our discussion of the various aspects of the judgment is not that any one of them indicates that the trial court did not intend the limited judgment to be conclusive as to all claims mentioned therein. Rather, our point is that those aspects, individually or collectively, do not resolve the ambiguity created in the first instance when the trial court characterized the claim as \u201cnot available,\u201d nor do parts of the trial court record available to us allow us to conclude that the trial court intended to dispose conclusively of Springville\u2019s negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">We acknowledge the apparent inconsistency in treating the limited judgment as having not disposed of the third in a list of three claims that, given the format of the judgment, appear to have been given equal status. Nevertheless, the methodology for interpreting judgments compels that conclusion. A reasonable reading of the trial court\u2019s description of each claim does not lead unambiguously to the conclusion that the trial court intended to resolve conclusively any of the three claims. The limited judgment itself, by including a money award as to Springville\u2019s breach of contract claim, allows us to resolve the ambiguity as to that claim, but the limited judgment does not resolve the ambiguity as to Interstate\u2019s lien foreclosure claim or Springville\u2019s negligence claim. The remainder of the trial court record available to us resolved the ambiguity as to Interstate\u2019s lien foreclosure claim. But neither the limited judgment itself nor the remainder of the trial court record resolves the ambiguity as to Springville\u2019s negligence claim. As a result, Springville\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>negligence claim was not conclusively resolved until entry of the general judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Motion to reconsider granted; opinion modified and adhered to as modified; motion to dismiss the appeal granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-12\"> With respect to the supplemental judgment, Springville argued that, because the general judgment was not appealable, neither was the supplemental judgment. In our original decision, we mistakenly attributed that argument to Interstate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-6\"> The significance of whether the limited judgment disposed of all of the claims mentioned therein is this: Clearly, Springville\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely as to that judgment; therefore, Springville would be barred on appeal from assigning error to any ruling relating to any claim conclusively decided by the judgment. If the limited judgment did not dispose of one or more claims mentioned in the judgment, the claim or claims were not conclusively decided until the trial court entered the general judgment. Because Springville timely appealed from the general judgment, it then could assign error to the trial court\u2019s disposition of any claim not conclusively disposed of in the limited judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\"> <em>Accord Schnitzer Investment Corp. v. Certain Underwriters, </em>341 Or 128, 133, 137 P3d 1282 (2006) (citing <em>Bennett </em>for proposition that court may review agency record to determine meaning of an ambiguous agency decision); <em>Neal and Neal, </em>181 Or App 361, 366, 45 P3d 1011 (2002) (if judgment of dissolution of marriage is ambiguous, court may look to extrinsic evidence to determine trial court\u2019s intent).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\"> For instance, Interstate paid the amount of the limited judgment and Springville filed a satisfaction of judgment that contained this sentence: \u201cThe court will determine at a later date all remaining open issues described in the limited judgment.\u201d That statement is consistent with Springville\u2019s position on appeal but does not necessarily reflect the trial court\u2019s intent. We do not suggest that Springville inserted that sentence to create ambiguity that did not otherwise exist or in an attempt to resolve an ambiguity in the limited judgment. However, it is an example of the kind of self-serving statements that should be given little weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
