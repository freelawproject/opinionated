J.</author>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Defendant was involved in a car accident and was taken to a hospital by ambulance. A police officer went to the hospital and asked defendant for his driver\u2019s license. Defendant refused to present a license, and the officer cited defendant for failure to carry or present a license under ORS SC^^OUXb),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arrested defendant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and took him to the police station. At the police station, the officer learned that defendant had a valid Nevada driver\u2019s license. The state nonetheless charged defendant by information with violating ORS 807.570(lXb) because he \u201coperated] a motor vehicle on a highway in this state and upon being stopped by an officer who was enforcing the motor vehicle laws, failed to present a driver\u2019s license.\u201d Defendant attempted to present his Nevada license to the court both at a hearing on his pretrial motion to dismiss the charge and at trial. In his pretrial motion to dismiss, defendant moved \u201cfor an order dismissing ORS 807.570 from this case in the furtherance of justice, pursuant to ORS 807.020.\u201d Defendant argued that, based on \u201c[ejxemptions from [the] requirement to have [an] Oregon License or permit,\u201d he was not required to have an Oregon driver\u2019s license because he held a valid out-of-state license. The trial court implicitly denied the motion. At trial, the court excluded evidence that, when he was cited, defendant had a valid out-of-state driver\u2019s license. Defendant appeals from the ensuing judgment convicting him of the offense. On appeal, he assigns error to both of the court\u2019s rulings. We reverse with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>respect to defendant\u2019s conviction under ORS 807.570 and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument on appeal is straightforward. He relies on ORS 807.570(3), which provides that, \u201c[e]xcept as provided in ORS 813.110, it is a defense to any charge under this section that the person so charged produce a license, driver\u2019s permit or out-of-state license that had been issued to the person and was valid at the time of violation of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on that provision, defendant\u2019s production at trial of a driver\u2019s license that was valid at the time of his arrest would have been a complete defense to the charge. <em>Hass v. Port of Portland, </em>112 Or App 308, 311, 829 P2d 1008, <em>rev den, </em>314 Or 391 (1992). The state concedes as much. However, the state argues that defendant\u2019s argument is unpreserved because \u201cdefendant never attempted to present that defense [to the trial court] and therefore this court should decline to address his claims of error.\u201d Thus, the dispositive issue is whether defendant adequately preserved his current argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">As noted in his motion to dismiss, defendant moved \u201cfor an order dismissing ORS 807.570 from this case in the furtherance of justice, pursuant to ORS 807.020.\u201d Defendant attached to the motion a copy of his valid Nevada driver\u2019s license. At the motion hearing on the morning of trial, the state conceded that defendant had a valid Nevada license at the time of his arrest. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: The issue there is that I was not a resident. I was raised here, but I was not a resident in the State of Oregon at that time. I\u2019ve resided approximately the last 20 years in Nevada, and I offered the officer my Nevada driver\u2019s license, which they refused, and wrote me down for having no Oregon citation. And I learned that if you have an out-of-state driver\u2019s license that is valid where you live and so forth that you don\u2019t have to have an Oregon driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: So you\u2019re saying that the officer asked for your license, and you handed them your Nevada license, and they cited you because you didn\u2019t give them an Oregon driver\u2019s license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Your honor, that\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s an absolute factual dispute. That\u2019s all we have at trial today. The officer\u2019s allegations, allegations against [defendant], is that a license was requested. He refused to give his license until, finally, after he was booked in the jail and that jail did a search of [defendant\u2019s] person, they found his license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">^ * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: You\u2019re not disputing that he was a Nevada resident and that that Nevada license is okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">\u201c [THE STATE]: * * * I totally would agree with [defendant] that, in fact, he did have a Nevada license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, that takes care of that, then, doesn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: So you can present evidence that you tried to present your Nevada license, I guess, and if the jury buys it, that would suffice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-12\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Fine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">The court then turned to other matters without formally ruling on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">Defendant represented himself at trial. He attempted to elicit testimony from the arresting officer that the officer had cited him for not having an Oregon license:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-15\">\u201c[Defendant] presented you with a valid Nevada driver\u2019s license, and you cite him with no Oregon license. So, therefore, we really don\u2019t have a claim because under Oregon statutes, it states that if a person has an out-of-state driver\u2019s license that\u2019s valid and out-of-state address and so forth, which you people didn\u2019t want to listen to that day, that it constitutes that Oregon cannot prosecute that person for not having a valid Oregon license if they have a valid Nevada driver\u2019s license.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>The state objected, and the court clarified that defendant was not charged with failure to have an <em>Oregon </em>driver\u2019s license. Defendant did not further pursue the line of inquiry with that witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Defendant persisted in his effort to introduce evidence that he had a valid Nevada driver\u2019s license through direct examination of a witness in his case-in-chief. Defendant asked that witness whether the witness knew that defendant had a valid Nevada driver\u2019s license, and the witness agreed that defendant had a Nevada license. The state objected that the evidence was irrelevant, because \u201cwe all agreed he had a driver\u2019s license.\u201d Defendant tried to explain that, in his view, the evidence was relevant because he was charged with not having an Oregon driver\u2019s license, but he did have a valid Nevada driver\u2019s license. The state then remonstrated that \u201ceveryone agrees that [defendant] had a Nevada license; it\u2019s not in dispute. He\u2019s not charged with not having an Oregon driver\u2019s license. It\u2019s not at issue here.\u201d The court agreed, and it foreclosed that line of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Based on the foregoing exchanges, the state argues that defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and his questions of witnesses were all aimed at the issue \u201cwhether or not he was required to have an Oregon \u2014 as opposed to some other state \u2014 driver\u2019s license.\u201d The state observes that \u201c[a]t no time did defendant raise the defense available to him under ORS 807.570(3), either by bringing the statute to the court\u2019s attention or by asking for an appropriate jury instruction.\u201d It follows, the state urges, that we should not consider the claims of error that he raises on appeal, because defendant failed to provide the trial court with an explanation of his objection that was specific enough to ensure that the court could \u201cidentify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately [.]\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Defendant replies that the state\u2019s response to his arguments \u2014 that is, its assertion that the existence of defendant\u2019s Nevada license was irrelevant to a prosecution under ORS 807.570 \u2014 caused the trial court to misinterpret that statute so as to deprive him of the defense available under ORS 807.570(3). Because, defendant posits, courts are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>required to correctly interpret the applicable statutes irrespective of the arguments that the parties make about their meaning, \u201cdefendant\u2019s motion put the meaning of ORS 807.570 [in] question: The court needed to determine whether proof that defendant had a valid driver\u2019s license would give cause to dismiss the charge under the statute.\u201d The state counters that neither the state nor the trial court mischaracterized defendant\u2019s possession of a Nevada driver\u2019s license as irrelevant. Rather, the state asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">\u201c[I]t was the manner in which defendant presented his defense that led the court and the State to note that defendant was not being charged with failing to have an Oregon license. The state\u2019s position in response to defendant\u2019s argument in no way, as defendant seems to suggest, caused the court to misinterpret the relevant statutes or improperly deny defendant\u2019s motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">A number of Oregon appellate opinions describe the rules of preservation in somewhat formalistic terms, requiring as a minimum that parties preserve an \u201cissue,\u201d while relaxing the requirement for a \u201csource\u201d for the claimed position and an \u201cargument\u201d in support of it. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hitz, </em>307 Or 183, 188, 766 P2d 373 (1988) (lead decision). More recently the courts have described the rule of preservation in more functional terms, emphasizing the underlying purposes of preservation \u2014 in particular, fairness and efficiency. <em>See, e.g., Wyatt, </em>331 Or at 343 (lead decision). Complicating things further is the line of cases beginning with <em>Stull v. Hoke, </em>326 Or 72, 77, 948 P2d 722 (1997), which hold courts to a higher standard of engagement when the proper interpretation of a statute is implicated. This case presents yet another illustration of the fault line between the decisions in <em>Wyatt </em>and <em>Stull.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Shortly after deciding <em>Stull, </em>in <em>Miller v. Water Wonderland Improvement District, </em>326 Or 306, 951 P2d 720 (1998), the Supreme Court went even further. In that case, the plaintiff had sought a declaration as to his right under the public records statute to inspect certain records of a water improvement district. This court noted that another statute \u2014 pertaining specifically to water districts \u2014 might otherwise bear on the issue, but we declined to decide the case under that statute because the plaintiff had failed to claim any entitlement under it. <em>Miller v. Water Wonderland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>Improvement District, </em>141 Or App 403, 405 n 1, 918 P2d 849 (1996). The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the fact that the plaintiff had failed to rely on the statute was not dis-positive: \u201c[T]he parties may not prevent a court from noticing and invoking an applicable statute by relying only on other sources of law.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>326 Or at 309 n 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">In <em>State v. Smith, </em>184 Or App 118, 120, 55 P3d 553 (2002), the defendant, who was skateboarding down a sidewalk and into a crosswalk, struck a pedestrian. He was arrested and charged with several offenses, including reckless driving. At trial, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the reckless driving charge. He argued that he could not be convicted of reckless driving because one does not \u201cdrive\u201d a skateboard. According to the defendant, one \u201cdrives\u201d a motor vehicle, and a skateboard is not a motor vehicle within the meaning of ORS 811.140. The trial court suggested that ORS 801.590 defines \u201cvehicle\u201d more broadly than that. The defendant responded that ORS 811.140 and ORS 801.590 cannot be construed to apply to skateboards because that would produce an absurd result not likely intended by the legislature. The trial court denied the motion, and the defendant was convicted of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal, because ORS 801.026(6) expressly exempts from the definition of \u201cvehicle\u201d devices other than bicycles that are exclusively human powered. The state argued that the defendant\u2019s argument was unpreserved because he failed to bring ORS 801.026(6) to the attention of the trial court and that, in any event, the statute does not apply to ORS 811.140. The defendant acknowledged that he had failed to cite ORS 801.026(6). He argued that he still was entitled to raise it, however, because it was necessary \u201ccontext\u201d to the proper interpretation of ORS 811.140. In terms that are instructive here, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">\u201c[I]t is, frankly, not easy to determine whether defendant\u2019s claim of error has been preserved. Arguably, under <em>Hitz, </em>defendant has preserved an \u2018issue,\u2019 namely, whether a skateboard is a \u2018vehicle\u2019 within the meaning of ORS 811.140. His failure to cite ORS 801.026(6) maybe regarded as a failure to cite a specific \u2018source,\u2019 which, under <em>Hitz, </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>not fatal. At the same time, it is arguable that defendant\u2019s objection was not specific enough to ensure that the trial court could identify the alleged error immediately and correct it, as <em>Wyatt </em>requires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">\u201cIn the end, the fact that the matter in contention involves the applicability and construction of a statute leads us to conclude that it was adequately \u2018preserved.\u2019 First, under <em>Stull </em>and <em>Miller, </em>it is apparent that the ordinary rules of preservation are somewhat more lax when the case turns on the applicability and construction of a statute. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Miller, </em>the failure of the parties to cite a statute does not prevent the courts from noticing it and giving it effect. 326 Or at 309 n 3. Second, apart from that, it is at least arguable that, having brought to the court\u2019s attention ORS 811.140 and the question whether a skateboard is a \u2018vehicle\u2019 within the meaning of that statute, defendant fairly may rely on other statutes that bear on the meaning of that statute as \u2018context.\u2019 <em>See State v. Carr, </em>319 Or 408, 412, 877 P2d 1192 (1994) (relying on statutes not cited by either party as context for statutory construction purposes).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\"><em>Smith, </em>184 Or App at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In contrast to <em>Smith, </em>where an appellant\u2019s argument on appeal relates not only to the scope and meaning of statutory language but, even more, to whether particular proof was deficient for reasons never urged to the trial court, it is unpreserved. <em>See, e.g., State v. Shields, </em>184 Or App 505, 509 n 1, 511 n 2, 56 P3d 937 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 355 (2003) (for preservation purposes, motion for judgment of acquittal must identify, with specificity, alleged deficiencies in state\u2019s proof). Thus, for example, in <em>State v. Jackson, </em>212 Or App 51, 54, 157 P3d 239, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 206 (2007), the defendant argued for the first time on appeal that, to prove that an individual is \u201cactually present\u201d to render aid in the commission of second-degree robbery under ORS 164.405(1)(b), the state must establish not only that second person\u2019s physical proximity and capability of intervening but also that his or her \u201cpurpose\u201d for being present at the robbery was to reinforce the use or threatened use of violence against the victim. That is, in the defendant\u2019s view, the statute\u2019s \u201cactually present\u201d element encompassed both objective (proximity and capability) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>subjective (purpose) components. In that respect, the defendant\u2019s argument on appeal implicated the proper construction of the term \u201c[i]s aided by another person actually present\u201d under ORS 164.405(1)(b). However, his argument at trial had been limited to the assertion that, as a matter of law, the enhancement of third-degree robbery to second-degree robbery under ORS 164.405(l)(b) is not triggered when a coperpetrator\u2019s participation (regardless of his or her \u201cpurpose\u201d) is limited to facilitating the principal robber\u2019s escape. We concluded that the defendant\u2019s argument at trial was \u201cqualitatively different\u201d from the \u201csubjective purpose\u201d argument that the defendant had advanced on appeal and, accordingly, the latter was unpreserved. <em>Jackson, </em>212 Or App at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">The question before us in this case reduces to whether, as in <em>Smith, </em>defendant\u2019s reliance on ORS 807.570(3) on appeal is \u201ccontext\u201d for his argument at trial that the court should dismiss the charge under ORS 807.570 or, by contrast, whether, as in <em>Jackson, </em>defendant\u2019s argument on appeal relates not only to the scope and meaning of statutory language but, even more, to whether the state\u2019s proof was deficient for reasons never urged to the trial court. Although the fit is not perfect, we conclude that this case is more like <em>Smith </em>than <em>Jackson </em>and, as a consequence, that defendant adequately preserved his argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In his motion to dismiss, defendant relied on ORS 807.020(1), which provides that \u201c[a] person who is not a resident of this state or who has been a resident of this state for less than 30 days may operate a motor vehicle without an Oregon license or driver\u2019s permit if the person holds a current out-of-state license issued to the person.\u201d The difficulty for defendant was that, by its terms, that exemption applies only to violations of ORS 807.010, which provides, in part, that a person commits the offense of operating a vehicle without driving privileges if the person operates a motor vehicle upon a highway or premises open to the public in this state without Oregon driving privileges. As the trial court and the prosecutor noted, defendant was not charged with operating his vehicle without an Oregon driver\u2019s license. Accordingly, ORS 807.020(1) did not assist him.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Defendant pursued the same mistaken theory at trial, asserting that, because he was a Nevada resident and had a valid Nevada driver\u2019s license, he could not be prosecuted for failing to have an Oregon driver\u2019s license. However, unlike in <em>Jackson, </em>defendant\u2019s argument also was entirely relevant to the issue of the deficiency of the state\u2019s case under ORS 807.570, the statute under which he was prosecuted. In particular, in his motion to dismiss, defendant argued that his possession of a valid Nevada license constituted a complete defense to the charge under ORS 807.570. Although he did not cite subsection (3) of that statute, the facts on which he relied implicated its terms. Thus, unlike in <em>Jackson, </em>except for his reliance on the wrong statute for his defense, defendant\u2019s argument about the deficiency in the state\u2019s case \u2014 the undisputed evidence that he had a valid out-of-state license \u2014 was the same both at trial and on appeal. If anything, the claim of error was better preserved here than in <em>Smith, </em>because the dispositive statutory \u201ccontext\u201d in this case is a provision of the statute under which defendant was charged, not an entirely different statute. Because defendant relies on the statute under which he was charged, he may fairly rely on all of its provisions as context to support the argument that he made at trial concerning the deficiency in the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Moreover, ORS 807.570(3) sets out a \u201cdefense,\u201d but does not label it as an affirmative defense. Under ORS 161.055(1), when a defense other than an affirmative defense is raised at trial, the state has the burden of disproving it beyond a reasonable doubt. ORS 161.055(3) provides: \u201cThe state is not required to negate a defense as defined [at trial] unless it is raised by the defendant. <em>\u2018Raised, by the defendant\u2019 </em>means either notice in writing to the state before commencement of trial or <em>affirmative evidence by a defense witness in the defendant\u2019s case in chief.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In this case, the state asserts that defendant failed to preserve his argument on appeal because he did not \u201craise the defense available to him under ORS 807.570(3), either by bringing the statute to the court\u2019s attention or by asking for an appropriate jury instruction.\u201d That, however, is not what defendant had to do in order to \u201craise\u201d the defense. Defendant persisted in his effort to introduce evidence that he had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>valid Nevada driver\u2019s license throughout the trial, including through direct examination of a witness in his case-in-chief. He was required to do no more in order to raise the defense. ORS 161.055(3). Accordingly, the trial court erred in excluding the proferred evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Because defendant\u2019s argument was adequately preserved and the undisputed evidence established a complete defense to the alleged violation of ORS 807.570, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and in excluding defendant\u2019s proffered evidence that he had a valid Nevada driver\u2019s license at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Conviction under ORS 807.570 reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-5\"> ORS 807.570(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201cA person commits the offense of failure to carry a license or to present a license to a police officer if the person either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">\u201c(a) Drives any motor vehicle upon a highway in this state without a license, driver permit or out-of-state license in the person\u2019s possession; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">\u201c(b) Does not present and deliver such license or permit to a police officer when requested by the police officer under any of the following circumstances: \u201c(A) Upon being lawfully stopped or detained when driving a vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">\u201c(B) When the vehicle that the person was driving is involved in an accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b506-10\"> Defendant also was charged with and eventually convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants.
