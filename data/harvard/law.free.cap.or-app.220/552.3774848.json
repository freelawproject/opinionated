Plaintiffs, planning to develop the parcels and seeking to avoid the road-building and dedication obligation, brought an action seeking a declaration that the agreement was void because it did not comply with statutes establishing requirements for \u201cdevelopment agreements.\u201d ORS 94.504 - 94.528. Plaintiffs and defendant filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion and granted defendant\u2019s, and plaintiffs appeal. Because the material facts are undisputed, we review the trial court\u2019s judgment for errors of law, <em>Oregon Southwest, LLC v. Kvaternik, </em>214 Or App 404, 413, 164 P3d 1226 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 390 (2008), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The statute at the center of this case, ORS 94.504 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201c(1) A city or county may enter into a development agreement as provided in ORS 94.504 to 94.528 with any person having a legal or equitable interest in real property for the development of that property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\u201c(2) A development agreement shall specify:\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The rest of the statute consists of paragraphs (2)(a) through (L) and subsections (3) through (8), all of which deal with the contents, duration, and other characteristics that the agreement \u201cshall\u201d have. The agreement between plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors and defendant does not contain some of those characteristics. Acknowledging the phrase <em>\u201cmay </em>enter into a development agreement\u201d in paragraph (1), the parties agree that local governments and developers do not have any statutory obligation to enter into development agreements. (Emphasis added.) Plaintiffs, however, maintain that, once a local government and a developer do decide to enter into a development agreement, defined as any agreement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>deals in any fashion with anything that could be called the \u201cdevelopment\u201d of real property, the agreement <em>must </em>conform to all of the requirements of ORS 94.504. Defendant argues that the statute creates an optional \u201cplanning tool,\u201d a nonexclusive, statutory mechanism that local governments and private property owners can employ at their discretion \u2014 that is, a \u201cstatutory\u201d development agreement, as distinct from other forms of development agreements not described by statute. The agreement in this case, defendant asserts, is not a statutory development agreement but a valid nonstatutory agreement enforceable according to its terms. As explained below, we agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\">At its most basic level, the disagreement is over the textual interpretation of ORS 94.504(1) and (2), in particular, the interplay between the word \u201cmay\u201d in subsection (1) and \u201cshall\u201d in subsection (2). Plaintiffs paraphrase the subsections as follows: \u201cA city or county <em>may </em>enter into a development agreement <em>only </em>as provided in ORS 94.504 to 94.528. * * * Such a development agreement <em>shall </em>conform to the following requirements.\u201d In defendant\u2019s paraphrase, on the other hand, the word \u201cmay\u201d modifies the entire phrase, \u201center into a development agreement as provided in ORS 94.504 to 94.528.\u201d The statute, in other words, provides that \u201ca city or county may, <em>if it so chooses, </em>enter into an agreement <em>of the type that is described </em>in ORS 94.504 to 94.528, that is, an agreement that conforms to the specified criteria.\u201d The implication, according to defendant, is that there are other types of agreements, and local governments may choose to use those types instead of the type described in ORS 94.504 to 94.528.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Grammatically, either interpretation is plausible. The legislative history, however, demonstrates that, in enacting ORS 94.504 to 94.528, the legislature intended to expand local governments\u2019 and developers\u2019 options, not limit them. According to proponents (and there were no opponents \u2014 at least none who testified or voted), the statutes were designed to create a wholly optional opportunity for local governments to enter into long-term, multiphase land development agreements with property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Jon Chandler, staff attorney for Common Ground, the bill\u2019s primary proponent, testified that the legislation would create \u201ca <em>voluntary </em>system,\u201d stating, <em>\u201cThere\u2019s no requirement that anybody do it. </em>We hope it will be used. We think it will be used.\u201d Tape Recording, House Committee on General Government, Subcommittee on Government, HB 3045, May 5,1993, Tape 66, Side B (\u201cHouse Committee Tape Recording\u201d) (statement of Jon Chandler) (emphases added). He summarized the bill as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">\u201cHB 3045 is designed to give local government and developers a new tool \u2014 development agreements. These agreements will give local governments a new planning mechanism * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201cThere is no burden placed on local governments by this bill, since <em>development agreements would be optional and voluntary. Nothing in this bill requires local governments to change existing systems. </em>HB 3045 simply provides a means for local governments and developers to work together * * *. We believe that this tool will be used frequently * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Testimony, House Committee on General Government, Subcommittee on Government, HB 3045, May 5, 1993, Ex F (statement of Jon Chandler) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">In arguing that statutory compliance is mandatory, plaintiffs focus on a portion of Chandler\u2019s testimony in which he stated that what is now codified as ORS 94.504(2) contains \u201ca list of things the development agreement <em>has to specify in order for it to be enforceable at the outset.\u201d </em>Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Labor and Government Operations, HB 3045, July 19, 1993, Tape 185, Side A (statement of Jon Chandler) (emphasis added). Considered together with Chandler\u2019s other remarks, however, it is clear that he was referring not to the enforceability of all agreements concerning the development of land but to the enforceability of that unique statutory development agreement authorized by ORS 94.504 to 94.528.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Most significantly, the legislative history demonstrates that proponents believed that statutory development agreements were necessary in order to reassure skittish city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>attorneys and developers. The members of the House Committee on General Government, Subcommittee on Government, heard the committee administrator explain that \u201c[t]he intent [of the bill] is to allow an agreement on the standards that will be in place during the development so the developers can proceed without wondering whether the rules are going to change part way through.\u201d House Committee Tape Recording. Chandler testified before that subcommittee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">\u201cThere\u2019s been some question raised as to whether or not this [legislation] is actually necessary * * *. I believe it is. A lot of city attorneys and county counsel believe that you cannot legally bind successor commissions or councils, consequently they\u2019re unwilling to enter into long-term agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">\u201cWhat this bill will do is allow the city or the county and the developer to sit down on the front end of a multi-phase project and decide how it\u2019s going to run. Where the parks are going to go, for example, what kind of sidewalk standards are going to be in place, what sort of pedestrian linkages are going to occur. Not just for the first phase that\u2019s in front of them but for phase 6 or 7 or 10 that may not happen for three or four years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">\u201cAnd to give the legal authority to the city, making it very clear that they can in fact enter into these sorts of agreements [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-7\"><em>Id. </em>(statement of Jon Chandler). As the full committee\u2019s clerk later summarized the subcommittee testimony: \u201cWitnesses testify that city attorneys are unwilling to bind future councils into any kind of standards like these without such authority in the statute.\u201d Tape Recording, House Committee on General Government, HB 3045, May 13, 1993, Tape 34, Side A. In response, one representative agreed that \u201ccity attorneys are notoriously cautious * * *. I believe that allowing this \u2014 this kind of agreement will help cities be more innovative and collaborative in the way that they work with development issues * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(statement of Rep Sharon Wiley). No contrary or conflicting opinions were expressed on the Senate side.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Thus, the legislative history indicates that the purpose of the bill was to create a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>attorneys and developers who feared that, without such legislation, agreements for future development would be susceptible to attack as unlawful attempts to bind future councils.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nothing in the legislative history indicates that ORS 94.504 to 94.528 was intended to prevent less cautious parties, or parties to agreements that did not invite invalidation based on binding future councils, from entering into agreements that did not meet the requirements of statutory development agreements. The legislation, in other words, was designed to increase options, not to reduce them. Thus, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 contention, ORS 94.504 is not a legal nullity, conformity with which brings no benefits and violation of which brings no consequences. Rather, local governments and developers that choose to enter into statutory development agreements achieve the security of knowing that the agreement cannot successfully be attacked as an unlawful attempt to bind a future lawmaking body. Local governments and developers that choose to use different forms of agreement remain susceptible to such attacks \u2014 which is not to suggest, we add, that such attacks are or could be successful, a question that this case does not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Further, even if the legislative history does not resolve all ambiguity in favor of defendant \u2014 the history is not only sparse, but consists mostly of statements by nonlegislators \u2014 considerations rooted in Oregon\u2019s constitutional home rule provisions militate in favor of the same outcome. If we were to conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation is correct, ORS 94.504 to 94.528 would impose mandatory requirements on all local government development agreements, including the requirement that such agreements be enacted as ordinances. That interpretation would conflict with the local government\u2019s home rule authority to enact nonconforming agreements. In keeping with Oregon\u2019s home rule jurisprudence, we \u201cassume that the legislature does not mean to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>displace local civil or administrative regulation of local conditions by a statewide law unless that intention is apparent.\u201d <em>LaGrande/Astoria v. PERB, </em>281 Or 137, 148-49, 576 P2d 1204, <em>adh\u2019d to on reh\u2019g, </em>284 Or 173, 586 P2d 765 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-5\"> Thus, ORS 94.504(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\u201cA development agreement shall contain a provision that makes all city or county obligations to expend moneys under the development agreement contingent upon future appropriations as part of the local budget process. The development agreement shall further provide that nothing in the agreement requires a city or county to appropriate any such moneys.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
