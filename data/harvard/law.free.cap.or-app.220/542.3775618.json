Petitioner seeks judicial review, arguing that DHS incorrectly construed and applied the rules. We agree with petitioner. We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The WIC Program provides nutrition education and counseling, nutritious supplemental foods, and health screening and referral services for infants, children in certain high-risk categories, and pregnant and breast-feeding women. ORS 409.600; OAR 333-054-0000(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As relevant to this case, the program provides participants with \u201cfood instruments,\u201d which are vouchers on which a specific quantity of a particular authorized product is listed (for example, \u201cFive cans 12.9 oz. Enfamil Lipil with Iron Powder\u201d). <em>See </em>OAR 333-054-0010(13) (defining \u201cfood instruments\u201d). The participant typically takes the voucher to a store that is an authorized vendor and uses it to \u201cpay for\u201d the listed product; the shopper signs the voucher and gives it to the store cashier instead of money, a check, or a credit card. The store, in turn, fills in a box on the voucher specifying how much the product would have cost a non-WIC shopper, sends the voucher to DHS, and receives reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Federal rules require that, in order to continue receiving federal funds to participate in the program, a state must adopt and implement standards and procedures of administration. 7 CFR Part 246; OAR 333-054-0000(2). One such procedure is mandatory monitoring of WIC vendors by the state through \u201ccompliance buys,\u201d that is, \u201ccovert, on-site investigation [s] in which a representative of the [state] Program poses as a participant, parent or caretaker of an infant or child participant, or proxy, transacts one or more food instruments, and does not reveal during the visit that he or she is a program representative.\u201d 7 CFR \u00a7 246.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The WIC Program in Oregon is administered by DHS. OAR 333-054-0000(3). Under ORS 409.600(2), DHS is required to adopt \u201c[standards and procedures to guide administration of the [WIC P]rogram by the state in conformity with federal requirements and to define the rights, responsibilities, and legal procedures of program vendors.\u201d Accordingly, DHS has promulgated rules, violations of which are classified as Type 1, 2, or 3, based on severity. OAR 333-054-0050. As required by federal law, the agency has also adopted rules for \u201ccompliance buys.\u201d OAR 333-054-0010(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">In the present case, petitioner seeks review ofDHS\u2019s order finding two Type 3 violations, the penalty for each of which, if upheld, is petitioner\u2019s disqualification as a WIC provider for a period of three years. Each violation, in turn, involves a \u201cpattern\u201d of offenses, that is, \u201cthree or more of the same rule violation that occurs within a single investigation.\u201d OAR 333-054-0010(18). DHS charged petitioner with, first, engaging in a \u201cpattern of vendor overcharges.\u201d OAR 333-054-0050(3)(b)(C). A \u201cvendor overcharge\u201d occurs when a vendor \u201cintentionally or unintentionally charg[es] DHS more for authorized foods than the actual shelf price or the price they charge other shoppers.\u201d OAR 333-054-0010(28). Second, DHS charged petitioner with \u201ca pattern of charging for authorized foods not received by the authorized shopper.\u201d OAR 333-054-0050(3)(b)(E). \u201cAuthorized food[s]\u201d are \u201cany supplemental foods listed on the WIC Authorized Food List or the food instrument,\u201d OAR 333-054-0010(4), and an \u201cauthorized shopper\u201d is a \u201cparticipant or any person designated by a participant who has been documented as such at the local agency to act on the participant\u2019s behalf and, in the case of an infant or child, the caretaker or the caretaker\u2019s designee.\u201d OAR 333-054-0010(5). OAR 333-054-0010(17) defines \u201cparticipant\u201d as \u201cany pregnant woman, breastfeeding woman, post-partum woman, infant or child who receives authorized foods or food instruments under the WIC Program, and the breast-fed infant of any participating breastfeeding woman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In sum, according to DHS, on three occasions, petitioner sought reimbursement from DHS for the sale of an authorized food, in an amount greater than the shelf price of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>that food; and, on three occasions, petitioner sought reimbursement from DHS for an authorized food not received by the authorized shopper.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Petitioner does not dispute DHS\u2019s account of the events leading to the charges. Petitioner entered into a vendor agreement with DHS on September 25, 2002, under which petitioner was authorized to sell food items in return for Oregon WIC food instruments. In the vendor agreement, petitioner agreed to \u201cwrite the actual purchase price in the designated box on the food instrument before the authorized shopper signs the food instrument.\u201d The agreement also provided, \u201cThe vendor shall be accountable for any intentional or unintentional action of its owners, officers, managers, employees or agents, with or without the knowledge of management, who violate the vendor agreement or federal or state statutes, regulations, policies or procedures governing the Program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Sorenson is a DHS employee whose job duties include posing as an authorized shopper to conduct \u201ccompliance buys\u201d as required under OAR, 333-054-0010(8). Sorenson is not a participant in the program, a designee of such a participant, or the caretaker of an infant or child who is a participant; in other words, he is not an \u201cauthorized shopper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">On July 1,2005, Sorenson purchased from petitioner two cans of Similac, an infant formula, presenting a food instrument authorizing purchase of up to five cans of Enfamil, also an infant formula. Similac is not an authorized food; Enfamil is. Although the listed price of Similac was $12.99 per can for a total purchase price that should have been $25.98, petitioner wrote \u201c$84.95\u201d in the box indicating how much the purchased product sold for and redeemed the food instrument for that full amount from DHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">On August 1, 2005, Sorenson purchased three cans of Enfamil from petitioner. The food instrument allowed for the purchase of up to five cans. Although the total shelf price for the three cans that Sorenson purchased was $50.97, petitioner redeemed the food instrument for $84.95, the price of five cans.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>On August 24, 2005, Sorenson purchased three cans of Enfamil from petitioner. Again, although the total shelf price for the food items actually purchased was $50.97, petitioner redeemed the food instrument for $84.95, the price of five cans.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">DHS initiated the present case by sending petitioner a notice of proposed termination of the vendor agreement. The notice asserted that petitioner (1) committed a pattern of vendor overcharges, in violation of OAR 333-054-0050(3)(b)(C), and (2) committed a pattern of charging for authorized food not received by the authorized shopper, in violation of OAR 333-054-0050(3)(b)(E). An administrative law judge concluded in a proposed final order that petitioner\u2019s actions amounted to a pattern of vendor overcharges but not a pattern of charging for authorized foods not received by the authorized shopper. In its final order, DHS found that petitioner had engaged in a pattern of vendor overcharges and a pattern of charging for authorized foods not received by the authorized shopper. Either violation would suffice to justify the three-year disqualification imposed. Petitioner seeks judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Petitioner contends that DHS erroneously interpreted OAR 333-054-0050(3)(b)(C) by ignoring its plain meaning. The rule provides that a \u201cvendor overcharge\u201d is \u201cintentionally or unintentionally charging DHS more for <em>authorized foods </em>than the actual shelf price or the price they charge other shoppers.\u201d OAR 333-054-0010(28) (emphasis added). According to petitioner, the July 1, 2005, purchase of <em>Similac </em>\u2014 not an authorized food \u2014 cannot serve as the basis for a violation of the rule. Without the July 1, 2005, vendor overcharge, only two overcharges occurred, so there is no \u201cpattern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">DHS responds that OAR 333-054-0050(3)(b)(C) and OAR 333-054-0010(28) can plausibly be interpreted to cover the situation in this case. According to DHS, the definition of \u201cvendor overcharge\u201d can be paraphrased as follows: a \u201cvendor overcharge\u201d is \u201cintentionally or unintentionally charging DHS more for authorized foods than the actual shelf price <em>of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>the authorized foods that the buyer purchased </em>or the price they charge other shoppers.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner charged DHS for five cans of Enfamil, an authorized food. The actual shelf price of the authorized food that Sorenson purchased was therefore zero. Thus, according to DHS, petitioner violated the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"> An agency may determine whether the standard established in a rule has been met in a particular instance by interpreting the rule in the course of applying it. <em>Papas v. OLCC, </em>213 Or App 369, 377, 161 P3d 948 (2007); <em>Goin v. Employment Dept., </em>203 Or App 758, 763-64, 126 P3d 734 (2006). We defer to the agency\u2019s plausible interpretation of its own rule, including an interpretation made in the course of applying the rule, if that interpretation is not inconsistent with the wording of the rule, its context, or any other source of law. <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com. v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>320 Or 132, 142, 881 P2d 119 (1994); <em>Papas, </em>213 Or App at 377; <em>Goin, </em>203 Or App at 763-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Petitioner argues that, because the violation included charging DHS for unauthorized food and two different administrative rules<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> speak more directly to that offense \u2014 and impose only one-year disqualifications \u2014 this administrative rule must be construed to avoid duplication. However, DHS may exercise its discretion in choosing the most appropriate rule violation charges to bring against a noncompliant vendor. At best, petitioner\u2019s argument suggests an alternative, plausible construction of the DHS rule. And it is settled law that a petitioner\u2019s plausible alternative construction of an agency rule does not mean that the agency\u2019s own construction is implausible. <em>Oregon Restaurant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>Services v. Oregon State Lottery, </em>199 Or App 545, 562, 112 P3d 398, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 406 (2005); <em>Purdue Pharma, L.P. v. Dept. of Human Services, </em>199 Or App 199, 209, 110 P3d 657, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 156 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">However, in the present case, the agency\u2019s construction <em>is </em>implausible; it cannot be reconciled with the plain language of the rule. The rule presupposes the purchase of authorized food, and that did not occur here. Contrary to DHS\u2019s theory, nothing in the rule justifies an interpretation that ties the \u201cactual shelf price\u201d to the price paid by a specific purchaser. \u201cActual\u201d denotes an objective standard. The \u201cactual\u201d price of a can of infant formula is the price that exists according to some empirically verifiable measurement unassociated with any particular purchaser. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>22 (unabridged ed 2002) (\u201cactual\u201d means \u201cexisting in fact or reality\u201d). We therefore conclude that, although petitioner may well have violated some other rule, it did not violate OAR 333-054-0050(3)(b)(C) by charging DHS for five cans of Enfamil when the purchaser bought two cans of Similac.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The agency\u2019s interpretation of OAR 333-054-0050(3)(b)(E) presents a similar problem. That rule, as noted above, prohibits vendors from charging DHS for \u201cauthorized foods not received by the authorized shopper.\u201d Petitioner paraphrases the rule as prohibiting a merchant from overcharging DHS <em>with respect to an authorized shopper\u2019s purchase. </em>In other words, according to petitioner, the universe of purchases that can potentially result in violations includes only those in which the purchaser is an authorized shopper, and no such purchase occurred here. The state responds that we must read the rules in context. The WIC Program is a federally funded program, and federal law governing state participation requires \u201ca representative of the [state] Program\u201d to monitor vendors through compliance buys. 7 CFR \u00a7 246.2. Further, Oregon law requires DHS to adopt standards and procedures in order to stay in conformity with federal requirements. ORS 409.600(2). Pursuant to that mandate, DHS has adopted rules authorizing compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>buys through OAR 333-054-0040<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and OAR 333-054-0010(8).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state contends that, because these rules authorize the representative to \u201ctransact\u201d a WIC food instrument, DHS reasonably construes its rules authorizing compliance buys to have the effect of either (1) amending OAR 333-054-0050(3)(b)(E) and OAR 333-054-0010(5) to include state representatives engaged in such transactions in the category of \u201cauthorized shoppers\u201d; or (2) creating an exception to the limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">As stated previously, we defer to the agency\u2019s plausible interpretation of its own rule, including an interpretation made in the course of applying the rule, if that interpretation is not inconsistent with the wording of the rule, its context, or any other source of law. <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com., </em>320 Or at 142; <em>Papas, </em>213 Or App at 377; <em>Goin, </em>203 Or App at 763-64. In determining that petitioner violated OAR 333-054-0050(3)(b)(E), DHS interpreted the rule to mean that an \u201cauthorized shopper\u201d includes a DHS representative posing as a participant or a participant\u2019s designee. That \u201cinterpretation\u201d cannot be reconciled with the text of the rule itself. To reiterate, OAR 333-054-0010(5) defines \u201cauthorized shopper\u201d to mean \u201cthe [WIC Program] participant or any person designated by a participant who has been documented as such at the local agency to act on the participant\u2019s behalf and, in the case of an infant or child, the caretaker or the caretaker\u2019s designee.\u201d And a participant is \u201cany pregnant woman, breastfeeding woman, post-partum woman, infant or child who received authorized foods or food instruments under the WIC Program, and the breastfed infant of any participating woman.\u201d OAR 333-054-0010(17). We agree with petitioner that this language is clear and unequivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Nor are we persuaded by DHS\u2019s argument that the rules requiring the state to undertake compliance buys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>somehow \u201camend\u201d OAR 333-054-0010(5) and OAR 333-054-0010(17) or create an exception to those rules. If DHS wanted to amend the definitions so as to include undercover compliance buyers as \u201cauthorized shoppers,\u201d it could easily do so. In fact, it <em>has </em>done so. OAR 333-054-0010(7) (Dec 27, 2006) now defines \u201cauthorized shopper\u201d to include \u201cany DHS representative posing as a participant or participant designee as authorized by DHS.\u201d We therefore reject DHS\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\"> Citations throughout are to Oregon Administrative Rules promulgated January 5, 2004, in effect at all times relevant to this case.

That interpretation differs from petitioner\u2019s in that it would permit DHS to find a violation whenever the purchaser is an unauthorized shopper, including every compliance buy; petitioner\u2019s interpretation permits DHS to find a violation only when an authorized shopper\u2019s purchases are inflated when presented to DHS.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
