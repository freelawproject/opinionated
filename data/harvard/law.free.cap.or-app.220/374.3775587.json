J.</author>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Defendant petitions for reconsideration in this criminal case, arguing that we erred in affirming without opinion his challenge to consecutive sentences based on the rule of law announced in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), that facts used to enhance a penalty for a crime, other than prior convictions or facts admitted by the defendant, must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Andrews, </em>214 Or App 571, 166 P3d 606 (2007). Defendant notes that, subsequent to our affirmance of his sentence, the Oregon Supreme Court held that the rule of law from <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>applied to facts used to support consecutive sentences. <em>See State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), <em>cert granted, </em>_US_ , 128 S Ct 1657 (2008). The state responds that any error was invited error, because defense counsel specifically stated at sentencing that the court had the ability to impose \u2014 as it ultimately did \u2014 three consecutive 75-month sentences, for a total of 225 months. We agree that any error under these circumstances was far from \u201cplain.\u201d Accordingly, on reconsideration, we adhere to our original decision that defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427, three counts of second-degree rape, ORS 163.365, two counts of second-degree sodomy, ORS 163.395, and one count of second-degree sexual penetration with a foreign object, ORS 163.408. The sentencing court imposed 75-month mandatory minimum sentences for first-degree sexual abuse, second-degree sodomy, and second-degree sexual penetration with a foreign object, with those sentences to be served consecutively to one another. The court imposed concurrent sentences on the remaining convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">At sentencing, the parties and the court were quite aware of <em>Blakely </em>and, in fact, a colloquy occurred concerning its potential application to consecutive sentences. The prosecutor advocated for consecutive sentences. Defense counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\u201cWell, judge, actually, my client will argue that under the <em>Blakely </em>analysis, <em>there was not a jury determination as to more than three incidents, </em>therefore, he would argue that there\u2019s only a maximum of \u2014 what would that be \u2014 225 months available here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">(Emphasis added.) The court agreed with defendant\u2019s analysis, concluding that the jury\u2019s verdict necessarily determined that there had been three separate incidents \u2014 and, thus, three consecutive sentences were possible. The court further concluded that it could <em>not </em>impose consecutive sentences on the remaining convictions because they occurred \u201cduring a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct with the other * * * charges, and because a jury determination was not made as to a consecutive sentence.\u201d As noted, the court imposed sentence consistently with that reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">On appeal, defendant contended that his present Blakely-based challenge to the imposition of consecutive sentences had been preserved. Specifically, defendant\u2019s opening brief relied on the colloquy described above as preserving the issue, and argued that, although counsel had \u201cconceded below that <em>Blakely </em>did not preclude imposition of three consecutive sentences,\u201d counsel \u201cwas incorrect.\u201d Defendant did not contend that the trial court, in imposing consecutive sentences, had committed an \u201cerror of law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">As noted, we affirmed without opinion. On reconsideration, defendant now invokes the \u201cplain error\u201d doctrine, arguing that the error is \u201cobvious\u201d and not reasonably in dispute in light of the <em>Ice </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">In <em>Ice, </em>the court considered whether factual findings in support of consecutive sentences under ORS 137.123(2), (4), and (5) implicated the rule of law from <em>Blakely, </em>and concluded that they did. 343 Or at 265, 265 n 4. That rule of law pertains to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The problem, however, is that in the circumstances of this case, any purported error was far from \u201cplain.\u201d As noted, trial counsel acknowledged to the trial court that the jury\u2019s disposition of various charges supported a conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>that there were three separate incidents. Although defendant now summarily argues that counsel \u201cwas incorrect,\u201d he does not explain why. The offenses for which defendant received consecutive sentences were alleged in the indictment to have occurred in three different date ranges. The jury instructions instructed the jury that the state was required to prove that each of the crimes at issue occurred during the date range alleged. Obviously, at sentencing, both defense counsel and the court <em>first </em>\u2014 and <em>correctly </em>\u2014 concluded that <em>Blakely </em>applied to consecutive sentencing, and further agreed that the jury had, in fact, made determinations sufficient to impose three consecutive sentences pursuant to ORS 137.123(2) (if offenses \u201cdo not arise from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct,\u201d the court may impose consecutive sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Given those circumstances, there is no \u201cplain error\u201d under <em>Ice. </em>The trial court, in imposing consecutive sentences, applied the legal analysis that was subsequently approved in <em>Ice. </em>That is, the court did not itself render findings as to whether the offenses for which consecutive sentences were imposed arose from separate incidents for purposes of ORS 137.123(2) but, instead, relied on what it understood to be the jury\u2019s necessary, albeit implicit, findings in that regard. Whether the trial court was correct in its understanding and characterization of the jury\u2019s determination is a matter that is hardly \u201cobvious.\u201d <em>See State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (\u201cplain error\u201d must, <em>inter alia, </em>be \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute\u201d). That is so, not only given trial counsel\u2019s admission to the trial court, which partakes of \u201cinvited error,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>see generally State v. Maxwell, </em>165 Or App 467, 478, 998 P2d 680 (2000) (invited error provides no basis for reversal on appeal), but also because the Blakely-related effect of the jury\u2019s verdict here is a matter reasonably in dispute. In that regard, we note that defendant cites no case law in support of his assertion that, notwithstanding the different time ranges charged in the indictment and the content of the jury instructions, the jury\u2019s verdict was not properly susceptible to the trial court\u2019s understanding, which defendant\u2019s trial counsel shared.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-5\"> Even assuming there was some error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
