He failed to appear as required by the release agreement and was charged with two counts of first-degree failure to appear, ORS 162.205, and two counts of second-degree failure to appear, ORS 162.195. After a trial to the court, defendant was convicted on all four counts, and the court entered judgment for four separate convictions. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to merge the four convictions into a single conviction for first-degree failure to appear, because defendant violated a single release agreement. The state concedes that, under <em>State v. Camarena-Velasco, </em>207 Or App 19, 139 P3d 979 (2006), the trial court erred in failing to merge the convictions into a single conviction for first-degree failure to appear. We agree and accept the concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Reversed and remanded for entry of a single conviction for first-degree failure to appear and for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
