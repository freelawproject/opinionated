Goodall, </em>219 Or App 325, 183 P3d 199 (2008). Defendant and Goodall resided in the same home; defendant\u2019s and Goodall\u2019s cases were consolidated for trial. Defendant raises two assignments of error. We reverse and remand on the first assignment and, therefore, do not reach the second assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In her first assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence found during a warrantless search of her home. In <em>Goodall, </em>219 Or App at 336, we held that the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. For the reasons expressed in <em>Goodall, </em>the trial court also erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
