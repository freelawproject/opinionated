He argues that, although the court properly admitted evidence that he had sexually abused a child in 1986, the court erred in admitting evidence that he had been convicted of that act. He also contends that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay statements made by the five-year-old victim, T, because the state did not comply with the statutory prerequisites to admissibility of such statements. We conclude that admitting the fact of defendant\u2019s prior conviction was not error, but that (as the state concedes) admitting the hearsay was and that, contrary to the state\u2019s contention, the error was not harmless. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The events leading to defendant\u2019s arrest, described more fully below, occurred during a period when T and her parents were living in defendant\u2019s house. On several occasions, T crawled into defendant\u2019s bed. Although he denied any intentional act of sexual touching, he was convicted on one count of sexual abuse in the first degree, ORS 163.427, for touching T\u2019s vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument regarding evidence of his 1986 sexual abuse conviction requires little discussion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant argues that the fact of his conviction is not relevant under OEC 401, and that, even if it is relevant, it should have been excluded under OEC 403 because its prejudicial impact significantly outweighs its probative value. According to defendant, \u201c[although the 1986 <em>incident </em>might demonstrate something about defendant\u2019s intent in 2003 (one could infer, for example, that he is sexually attracted to young girls), the fact of the <em>conviction </em>adds nothing to our information about his intent.\u201d (Emphases in original.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d OEC 401. As defendant concedes, the 1986 sexual abuse incident is relevant. That incident and the incident in this case were quite similar: both involved young girls, eight and five years old respectively, who alleged that defendant touched them sexually underneath their clothes while they were next to him on a couch or bed and were covered by blankets or a coat. The fact that defendant was convicted of the 1986 incident is independently relevant because, as the state argues, that fact adds</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">\u201csomething that mere claims by the victim that an incident occurred does not provide. Moreover, given that it is incumbent * * * upon the court to determine with certainty that the [earlier] crime was committed and that defendant was the perpetrator, there was no error in allowing the evidence by way of the conviction itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">We also reject defendant\u2019s argument that, even if the conviction is relevant, it is inadmissible under OEC 403 because its probative value is significantly outweighed by its prejudicial value. OEC 404(4) provides that, \u201c[i]n criminal actions, evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts by the defendant is admissible if relevant except as otherwise provided by\u201d the state or federal constitutions, or by statutes that do not apply in this case. In criminal cases, that rule precludes the balancing of probative value against, among other things, the danger of undue prejudice, which is normally required by OEC 403. <em>State v. Phillips, </em>217 Or App 93, 98, 174 P3d 1032 (2007). Thus, the court did not err in admitting defendant\u2019s 1986 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The hearsay evidence presents a more difficult question. Defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting several of T\u2019s hearsay statements, because the state did not notify defendant of the particulars of the statements as required by OEC 803(18a)(b). That statute provides generally for the admissibility of statements made by a person concerning an act of abuse, but it also provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">\u201c[n]o statement may be admitted under this paragraph unless the proponent of the statement makes known to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>adverse party the proponent\u2019s intention to offer the statement and the particulars of the statement no later than 15 days before trial, except for good cause shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The notice that the state provided to defendant in this case did not provide any details about the evidence the state sought to admit. It simply stated that the state intended \u201cto offer child hearsay evidence pursuant to OEC 803(18a) and (24) at the trial.\u201d Defendant objected that the notice was insufficient because \u201cit fails to [list] the particular statement and/or which child we\u2019re talking about.\u201d The state concedes that the objection had merit and the trial court erred in admitting the evidence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The state also contends, however, that admitting the evidence was harmless. If that is the case, we will not reverse the conviction; we will affirm a judgment despite evidentiary error if there is \u201clittle likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict[.]\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). In determining whether an error is harmless, we focus on the \u201cpossible influence of the error on the verdict rendered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To gauge that influence, we begin with a consideration of the evidence that was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In large part, that evidence consisted of conflicting accounts rendered by defendant and T. According to defendant, in July 2003, he agreed to allow A. C., S. C., and their three children to move into his home. During the four months that the Cs lived with defendant, he slept on a hide-a-bed in his living room, A. C. and S. C. slept in one bedroom, and the children slept in the other bedroom. Because the children\u2019s father did not spend much time with the children, defendant gave them considerable attention. Occasionally, T would awaken in the morning and crawl on top of the hide-a-bed; defendant, under the blanket, would be wearing shorts. On two occasions when this occurred, defendant experienced an erection. T, wearing a nightgown, would sometimes remain on top of the blanket and sometimes crawl under it. On these occasions, she would sometimes try to pull defendant\u2019s shorts down; she also did that when he would get up and walk toward the bathroom. On more than one occasion, she touched defendant\u2019s penis, despite his attempt to prevent that from happening. Once, T followed defendant into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>bathroom and \u201ccame in through the door while [defendant] was ejaculating.\u201d Although defendant never touched T\u2019s vagina while she was in the hide-a-bed, he admitted, in response to an interviewer\u2019s question, that there \u201cmight have been a time\u201d that he touched her vagina while \u201cpicking her up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">T\u2019s testimony, given at trial two years after the alleged events, related the following account. Her description of the living arrangements matched defendant\u2019s. She related that defendant touched her in her \u201cprivate place,\u201d more than once, underneath her nightgown. She also related that defendant showed her his \u201cprivate parts\u201d in the bathroom on one occasion, and that she observed \u201cmilk\u201d coming out of it. Defendant made her promise not to tell anybody about these events. Because of these events, she did not enjoy living at defendant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Additional admissible testimony established the following: First, in 1986, when he was 21, defendant, while lying under a blanket with an eight-year-old girl for whom he was babysitting, moved her hand to his penis and touched her vagina. On a separate occasion, he asked her to suck on his penis, which she did not do. For those acts, he was convicted of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Second, although Dr. Little, the physician who performed a physical examination on T shortly after the events, did not discover any physical evidence that T had been abused, he diagnosed her as having been sexually abused based on his observation of her in an interview. <em>See </em>OEC 703; <em>Kahn v. Pony Express Courier Corp., </em>173 Or App 127, 152-53, 20 P3d 837 (2001) (expert\u2019s conclusion based on inadmissible hearsay is itself admissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Third, defendant presented evidence that the victim\u2019s mother, A. C., was angry at him because he reported to A. C.\u2019s mother that A. C. had been arrested for driving under the influence of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Fourth, T disclosed sexual abuse. The fact of the disclosure, apart from its contents, was admissible under OEC 803(18a)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The foregoing facts are clearly sufficient to support a guilty verdict; from them, a reasonable juror could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of touching T\u2019s vagina. That, however, is not our inquiry; our inquiry is whether there is little likelihood that the following, inadmissible, facts affected the verdict. <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 32. Put another way: Can we conclude that the foregoing facts present such convincing evidence of guilt that it is highly unlikely that there were wavering jurors who would have voted for acquittal but for the following, inadmissible, facts?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">At the end of September, while T\u2019s mother, A. C., was drying T off after a bath, A. C. noticed T fondling her own vagina. A. C. moved T\u2019s hand away and said, \u201cWhy are you doing that? You\u2019ve never seen mommy or daddy do that. You know, people don\u2019t do that.\u201d T responded, \u201cSome people do.\u201d Her mother asked, \u2018What do you mean?\u201d T then disclosed that defendant had touched her.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Shortly after the disclosure, A. C. notified the police, and the C family moved out of defendant\u2019s home. After they moved out, T also made a spontaneous disclosure to her father, S. C. Without being questioned about it, T told her father that defendant had touched her \u201cdown there,\u201d and she pointed to her genital area.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The Cs then decided to take T to a child abuse evaluation clinic, the Lighthouse Assessment Center. There, T was first examined by Little, who discovered no physical evidence that T had been sexually abused. T was then interviewed by Bouton, a licensed clinical social worker, and the interview was videotaped. Little observed the interview through a one-way mirror, and Bouton periodically consulted with him during the interview. T disclosed to Bouton that defendant had touched her in a \u201cprivate place,\u201d while she was on his bed and wearing her nightclothes. She did not remember if it had happened more than once. When Bouton showed T drawings of young girls and asked T where defendant had touched her, T pointed to the genital area.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Defendant maintains that, without the inadmissible hearsay, the case presents a credibility contest between him and T, and that the only persuasive evidence supporting T\u2019s version is her recollection, at the age of seven, of events that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>transpired two years earlier. Even that testimony, defendant maintains, is sparse and vague; T referred only to being touched on her \u201cprivate place.\u201d During the interval, defendant suggests, T was subject to the influence of several adults, at least one of whom had animus toward him. Without the evidence of T\u2019s contemporary account of events, he argues, including her demonstration to Bouton that she had been touched in her genital area, a reasonable juror could have entertained doubts that were resolved only by the inadmissible hearsay testimony corroborating T\u2019s in-court testimony of distant events and recounting the touching with specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument is not without force. However, it underemphasizes some powerful inculpatory evidence that was properly admitted. Defendant himself admitted that he \u201cmight have\u201d accidently touched T\u2019s vagina while \u201cpicking her up\u201d; the 1986 incident undercuts his assertion that the touching was accidental or against his will. Further, defendant acknowledged that, on more than one occasion, he and T were together under the covers on his hide-a-bed and that, at the time, he had an erection. The physician who examined T testified that, by virtue of his observation of T shortly after the events, he concluded that she had, in fact, been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In the final analysis, we are persuaded that defendant has the better argument. We find it significant that, of the three counts that were submitted to the jury, defendant was found guilty only of one; the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on one count and could not reach a verdict on one count. From that outcome, we infer that at least some jurors were at least somewhat less than completely convinced that T\u2019s account of events was accurate or that defendant\u2019s account was inaccurate. That being the case, we cannot say that there is little likelihood that such jurors were persuaded by the powerful inculpatory hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-7\"> We deal with this assignment of error at this point in the opinion in order to facilitate our determination of whether the erroneous admission of the hearsay evidence was harmless; that determination requires us to gauge the likelihood that the inadmissible evidence affected the verdict and that determination, in turn, requires us to consider the strength of the state\u2019s case based on all of the admissible evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
