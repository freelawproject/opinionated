J.</author>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Appellant seeks reversal of a judgment committing her to the Mental Health Division on the ground that she was a danger to herself. ORS 426.130(1)(b)(C); ORS 426.005(1)(d)(A). The state defends the trial court\u2019s determination and contends, further and alternatively, that appellant was unable to provide for her basic personal needs because of her mental disorder. ORS 426.005(1)(d)(B). On <em>de novo </em>review, <em>State v. O'Neill, 21A </em>Or 59, 61, 545 P2d 97 (1976), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Appellant is a 60-year-old woman, with a schizo-affective disorder. At the time that she was hospitalized in December 2006, appellant was living on her own in an apartment, handled her own shopping, and prepared her own meals. Appellant was overweight and had diabetes, but she had not been prescribed insulin. Appellant had, however, been prescribed Coumadin, an anticoagulant medication, in response to an unspecified history of blood clots.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">On December 8, 2006, appellant was hospitalized and held pursuant to a notice of mental illness after she became agitated and threatened to emasculate one of her neighbors and because she had stopped taking Coumadin. At the time of the commitment hearing several days later, appellant\u2019s Coumadin \u201clevel,\u201d while improved, was not yet restored to a \u201ctherapeutic level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">At the commitment hearing, appellant repeatedly, and cogently, explained that she had stopped taking the Coumadin because it made her urinate \u201call the time,\u201d which was very frustrating and inconvenient. When asked about a comment that she had made to a care provider about not taking her medication because she \u201cwanted to die,\u201d appellant responded, \u2018Yeah, I wanted to die because I [urinated] all over the place. It\u2019s no way to live, and I don\u2019t want to use diapers.\u201d When told by one of the examiners that \u201cwe\u2019re going to probably hear from [your] doctor because she\u2019s real concerned that you may die if you miss a dosage of your Coumadin,\u201d appellant replied, \u201cWell we all die sometime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The only physician who testified at the commitment hearing was Dr. Naimark, a first-year resident in psychiatry. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Although the record does not disclose how long she had been treating appellant, Naimark was familiar with appellant\u2019s use, and nonuse, of Coumadin. When asked to describe the risk to appellant\u2019s health and safety if she did not continue to take Coumadin, Naimark responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\">\u201cThere\u2019s a risk of developing blood clots which could cause stroke. And I believe this is because she has atrial fibrillation. She \u2014 I can\u2019t really comment further on that. I was actually going to ask for a cardiologist to see her which if she \u2014 if she stays that would be a consult.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">When pressed for her opinion as to the risk appellant would face \u201cin the next 36 hours if she was released and didn\u2019t take this medication,\u201d Naimark replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">\u201cWell \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t really predict, but I \u2014 you know, she has been on [sic] her medication for an unknown period of time \u2014 I think a couple months \u2014 and she hasn\u2019t had adverse events during that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Later, Naimark elaborated that her \u201cmain concern\u201d was that appellant \u201cwould return to not taking her medications without getting input from a cardiologist whether or not she needs her medications.\u201d However, when again asked, directly, \u201cDo you believe [appellant is] safe to be released today?\u201d Naimark equivocated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\"><em>\u201cI\u2019m actually kind of on the fence on that. </em>So that\u2019s where I am on that[.] So I\u2019ll leave that to the Court to decide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">Both of the mental health examiners, Mohler and Edelson, rendered the opinion that, because of the risk of not taking Coumadin at prescribed levels upon her release, appellant was a danger to herself. Specifically, Mohler referred to his personal \u201cfamiliar[ity] with the Coumadin issue recently\u2019 and stated that appellant was \u201cplaying Russian roulette.\u201d Edelson characterized appellant as a \u201cwalking time bomb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Neither Edelson nor Mohler is a physician. Edelson is a licensed clinical social worker. The trial court consistently referred to Mohler as \u201cMr. Mohler,\u201d and the record does not disclose his professional status or expertise \u2014 much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>less his (or Edelson\u2019s) competence to render an opinion as to the nature, severity, proximity, and likelihood of medical risks that appellant faced if she discontinued her use of Coumadin upon release.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">In closing argument, appellant\u2019s counsel highlighted the absence of expert medical testimony establishing the requisite risk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\u201c[T]he doctor who has a medical degree doesn\u2019t say she\u2019s at an immediate risk of serious physical injury or death if she doesn\u2019t take the Coumadin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">\u201cShe has concerns that she needs a cardiology consult to see if she needs to keep taking that. But she was off the Coumadin for about a couple months and didn\u2019t have any adverse events which suggests that may be what happens \u2014 we can speculate either way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">\u201cIt\u2019s possible she could have a problem. It\u2019s equally possible or more possible if we look at history that she\u2019s not going to have a problem and that\u2019s the evidence we have today. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">* * :jt \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\">\u201c* * * The doctor also said, T can\u2019t really predict what would happen if she was off of her medications for her heart.\u2019 So we can\u2019t say based on that that there\u2019s clear, convincing evidence that she\u2019s going to die or have serious physical injury if she doesn\u2019t take her medications.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">The trial court rejected that argument, determining that, because of her mental disorder, appellant was a danger to herself. Specifically, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-11\">\u201cI will say that in this situation, both of the examiners who have \u2014 who are examiners of many years\u2019 standing have had a chance to fully review her chart and I believe are, at this point, more fully advised in the premises than our medical doctor.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>On appeal, appellant raises a variety of challenges, but we address only one because it is dispositive: The state did not present clear and convincing evidence that appellant was a danger to herself because of the risk that she would stop taking Coumadin upon her release.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">We briefly reiterate two fundamental principles. First, to prevail on the \u201cdanger to self\u2019 ground for commitment, ORS 426.005(l)(d)(A), the state must prove that ground by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d ORS 426.130(1)(b) \u2014 that is, evidence that is of \u201cextraordinary persuasiveness.\u201d <em>State v. Howell, </em>53 Or App 611, 617, 633 P2d 14 (1981); <em>see also State v. Jayne, </em>174 Or App 74, 77-78, 23 P3d 990, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 316 (2001) (describing \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence as evidence establishing that \u201cthe truth of the facts asserted is highly probable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"> Second, to establish that appellant is dangerous to herself, the state must show that appellant\u2019s mental disorder has \u201cresulted in harm to [her] self * * * or created situations likely to result in harm.\u201d <em>State v. Christofferson, </em>47 Or App 1087, 1090, 615 P2d 1152 (1980); <em>see also State v. Sea, </em>137 Or App 333, 338, 904 P2d 182 (1995). Although \u201cthe danger to self standard does not require a threat of immediate harm[,]\u201d \u201cconsistent with the basic needs standard, the threat must exist in the near future.\u201d <em>State v. Jacobson, </em>142 Or App 371, 377, 922 P2d 670 (1996). Thus, \u201c[ejvidence of general mental and physical deterioration is insufficient to justify a finding of mental illness under the danger to self standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Here, a reasoned determination of the alleged \u201cdanger to self\u2019 presented by appellant\u2019s potential discontinuation of Coumadin required expert medical testimony assessing the nature, severity, proximity, and likelihood of adverse physical consequences based on appellant\u2019s medical history and current condition. The state did not adduce such testimony. As noted, the only physician who testified, Naimark, candidly acknowledged that she was \u201ckind of on the fence\u201d as to whether appellant would be safe if immediately released, largely because Naimark believed that input from a cardiologist was required. Further, nothing in this record established that the mental health examiners were competent to render such a medical opinion. In all events, given Naimark\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>explicit equivocation, even if we were to somehow assume some degree of medical competence on the examiners\u2019 part, we would not find the evidence as a whole to be \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">We thus conclude that the trial court erred in determining that appellant should be involuntarily committed on the ground that, because of her mental disorder, she was a danger to herself. <em>See State v. Nguyen, </em>180 Or App 541, 545, 43 P3d 1218 (2002) (concluding that, because of lack of proof regarding nature and severity of the allegedly mentally ill person\u2019s diabetic condition, person\u2019s failure to take medication for that condition did not support commitment on \u201cdanger to self\u2019 ground); <em>see also State v. Ayala, </em>164 Or App 399, 404, 991 P2d 1100 (1999) (reaching same conclusion on \u201cbasic needs\u201d ground: \u201cApprehensions, speculations and conjecture are not sufficient to prove a need for mental commitment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The state argues, nevertheless, that we should affirm on the alternative \u201cbasic needs\u201d ground. To prevail on that ground, the state must adduce clear and convincing evidence that appellant \u201cprobably would not survive in the near future because [she] is unable to provide for basic personal needs and is not receiving care necessary for health or safety.\u201d <em>State v. Bunting, </em>112 Or App 143, 146, 826 P2d 1060 (1992). <em>See also State v. Cunningham, </em>190 Or App 202, 211, 78 P3d 125 (2003) (holding that \u201c[t]he refusal to take medication is not sufficient, by itself, to prove an inability to provide for basic personal needs\u201d; rather, state must prove that the allegedly mentally ill person \u201ccannot function without medications\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In advancing its \u201cbasic needs\u201d contention, the state (once again) relies primarily on the risk of appellant\u2019s possible discontinuation of the Coumadin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That reliance is unavailing for the reasons just expressed. <em>See, e.g., State v. M. A. B., </em>212 Or App 400, 405, 157 P3d 1256 (2007) (rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>state\u2019s \"basic needs\u201d contention where evidence established that the appellant\u2019s high blood pressure generally elevated his risk of heart disease and stroke but evidence did not establish that those adverse effects were a \u201cnear future thing\u201d or that the appellant would be unable to function if he stopped taking blood pressure medication); <em>State v. Hayes, </em>202 Or App 63, 67, 121 P3d 17 (2005) (\"[T]he record does not disclose the nature or severity of appellant\u2019s diabetes, much less the consequences that she would likely suffer in the near future from her continued refusal to take medication or cooperate in testing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-12\"> In addition to appellant\u2019s possible discontinuation of the Coumadin, the trial court relied on the fact that appellant\u2019s legs and feet were \u201cgrossly swollen\u201d and there was an ulcerating sore on one of her legs. Edelson also noted those conditions in rendering her opinion but did not state that, if -untreated, they presented a risk of serious physical injury in the near future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\"> The state also refers, in passing, to Naimark\u2019s concern that appellant would not obtain input from a cardiologist regarding her heart condition. That concern, however, hardly demonstrates that appellant\u2019s mental disorder \u201cso impairs [her] ability to provide for * * * necessary medical treatment as to jeopardize her probable survival in the near future.\u201d <em>State v. Hayes, </em>202 Or App 63, 68, 121 P3d 17 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
