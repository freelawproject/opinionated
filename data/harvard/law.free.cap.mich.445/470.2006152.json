(Docket No. 90553, March 13, 1990, p 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The tribunal explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">The exemplification of the going concern concept is found in the telephone pole, which is of very little intrinsic worth without the franchise to operate it legally. The value of that franchise, in large part, brings value to that pole, not the pole itself; a so-called \"synergy\u201d occurs. It therefore follows that the franchise and other unquantifiable intangibles are essential and valuable components of certain real- and personal tangible property (e.g., poles/wires) and, unless otherwise prohibited, must be included in the valuation of the tangible property. [Docket No. 90553, March 13, 1990, p 7.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The tribunal concluded that its consideration of \"the intangible elements of the going concern under the unit valuation method [is] consistent with the Michigan constitutional and statutory framework.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Petitioner appealed in the Court of Appeals and argued, inter alia, that the tribunal had improperly included intangible property in its valuations for the three years at issue. Adopting the opinion of the tribunal as its own, the Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished memorandum opinion, issued November 6, 1992 (Docket Nos. 127402, 131780, and 133117).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">We then granted leave to appeal, \"limited to whether the tax provided for under 1905 PA 282, MCL 207.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 7.251 <em>et seq., </em>permits the valuation of intangible personal property for assessment and taxation purposes.\u201d 443 Mich 884 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ii</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">A brief history of Michigan\u2019s taxation of telephone companies was provided by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Citizens\u2019 Telephone Co of Grand Rapids v Fuller, </em>229 US 322, 325; 33 S Ct 833; 57 L Ed 1206 (1913):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">Prior to 1909 telephone companies were taxed under Act No. 179 of the Public Acts of Michigan ... at the rate of 3% on their gross receipts for the year in which the tax was laid. . . . The taxes paid were in lieu of all other taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">Act No. 282 of the Public Acts of 1905 . . . provided for the assessment of the property of railroads and certain other companies and for the levying of taxes thereon by a State Board of Assessors. The act did not include either telephone or telegraph companies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">In 1909 the legislature passed Act No. 49 ..., which amended the title and certain sections of the Act No. 282 and provided for the assessment by the State Board of Assessors of the property of telephone companies on an ad valorem basis instead of a tax on their gross earnings, as provided by the act of 1899.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">As petitioner has correctly explained, most of the property in Michigan that is subject to ad valorem (i.e., value based) taxation is valued and taxed by local units of government pursuant to the General Property Tax Act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 7.1 <em>et seq. </em>However, certain public service businesses, including railroad and telephone companies, which typically have property interests that extend through several taxing districts or states, are taxed separately under Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>282 \"in lieu of all taxes for state and local purposes . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\">Under this statutory arrangement, all of the property of a telephone company \"used in carrying on [its] business\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is assessed each year \u2014 not by a local township supervisor or assessor, but rather\u2014 by a central authority, i.e., the State Board of Assessors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Act 282 requires that such property be assessed at fifty percent of its true cash value, and taxed \"at the average rate of taxes for state, county, township, school, municipal and other purposes levied through this state during the preceding year . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Although petitioner challenges the amount of the assessment for each of the years in question, it does not dispute the tribunal\u2019s use in this case of the \"capitalization of income\u201d method of valuing its property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, petitioner states that the valuation of its real and personal property as a \"unit,\u201d reflecting its use as a \"going concern,\u201d is \"not at issue here.\u201d According to petitioner, the \"sole issue\u201d is the \"incorporation of intangibles\u201d in the determination of the value of its property for Act 282 purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In support of its position that the tribunal improperly included intangible property, rather than valuing and taxing only the real and <em>tangible </em>personal property of the company, petitioner ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>vanees three arguments. It contends, first, that Act 282 does not authorize taxation of intangible personal property; second, that the intangibles tax act<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> exempts its intangibles from Act 282 taxation; and, finally, that taxation of its intangible property is unconstitutional in light of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a75.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Before addressing each of these arguments, we take note of the applicable standard of appellate review. In the absence of fraud, review of a decision by the Tax Tribunal is limited to determining whether the tribunal erred in applying the law or adopted a wrong principle; its factual findings are conclusive if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28. <em>Continental Cablevision v </em>Roseville, 430 Mich 727, 735; 425 NW2d 53 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">According to the petitioner, its \"basic argument\u201d is \"that Act 282 does not authorize the taxation of intangible property . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Section 4 of Act 282 provides in pertinent part that the State Board of Assessors shall \"make an annual assessment ... of the <em>property </em>. . . [of] telephone companies . . . .\u201d Thereafter, \u00a7 5 of the act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">The term property, as used in this act, shall be deemed to include <em>all property, </em>real or personal, belonging to . . . companies . . . subject to taxation under this act, including . . . telephone poles, wires, conduits, switchboards, <em>and all other property </em>used in carrying on their business and owned by them respectively, and <em>all other real and personal property, </em>and all franchises, said franchises not to be directly assessed, but to be taken into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>consideration in determining the value of the other property .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Petitioner argues for its interpretation of the act by pointing to a tenet of statutory construction recently restated by this Court in <em>Molter v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>443 Mich 537, 543; 505 NW2d 244 (1993), i.e., the authority to impose a tax must be expressly authorized by law; it will not be inferred. Moreover, ambiguities in the language of a tax statute are to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. <em>In re Dodge Bros, </em>241 Mich 665, 669; 217 NW 777 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">When the case of <em>In re Brackett Estate, </em>342 Mich 195, 204; 69 NW2d 164 (1955), came before this Court, we were required to consider the meaning of the word \"property\u201d within the context of the inheritance tax act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There, we determined that an employee\u2019s interest in a profit-sharing plan established by his employer fell within the ambit of \"property\u201d as defined by the Legislature. Noting that the language used in the statute was \"broad\u201d and sweeping,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we said, \"It is clearly within the competence of the legislature to sweep within its taxable orbit all kinds of property and any and all kinds of interests therein.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 205. We also observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Nor will it be forgotten, in any question of statutory tax interpretation, that taxing is a practical matter and that the taxing statutes must receive a practical construction. While they will not be extended by implication, . . . neither will the words thereof be so narrowly interpreted as to defeat the purposes of the act. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In construing the meaning of language of Act 282, we are cognizant of the principle that, in the absence of contrary direction by the Legislature, words used in a statute are to be given their ordinary meaning. <em>Sanchick v State Bd of Optometry, </em>342 Mich 555, 559; 70 NW2d 757 (1955). (\"Words will be given their usual and customary meanings, <em>save as otherwise defined . . . </em>.\u201d [Emphasis added.])</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In the course of considering whether the term property is \"otherwise defined\u201d in Act 282, we take note of its usual and customary meaning as reflected in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. There, the word \"property\u201d is defined as denoting \"everything which is the subject of ownership, corporeal or incorporeal, tangible or intangible, visible or invisible, real or personal . . . .\u201d 6th ed, p 1216. Another common definition of property is \"[something tangible or intangible to which its owner has legal title.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>(2d college ed), p 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">As earlier indicated, \u00a7 5 of Act 282 states that the term property \"shall be deemed to <em>include all property, </em>real or personal\u201d belonging to the business service companies subject to taxation under the act. Of course, the statutory definition of a term is controlling, but only to the extent that it provides instruction with regard to proper construction. We note that \u00a7 5 gives guidance regarding what is to be <em>included </em>in the assessment \u2014 but only by referring to \"property\u201d repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>throughout the section without providing a separate definition of the word \"property.\u201d Because \"property\u201d is not <em>\"otherwise </em>defined\u201d in \u00a7 5, we do not find it necessary to discard the usual and customary meaning of the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\">Moreover, as one authority has explained, where a term is defined by declaring what it \"includes,\u201d it is susceptible to extension of meaning by construction. 2A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (5th ed), \u00a7 47.07, pp 151-156. When used in a statutory definition, the word \"includes\u201d is a term of enlargement, not of limitation. It \"conveys the conclusion that there are other items includable, though not specifically enumerated . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 152. Such a definition suggests, if not requires, a construction broad enough to encompass other items not explicitly mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">As we read the language of \u00a7 5 of Act 282, we find that the Legislature left no doubt that it intended a broad construction of the word property. Its definition in the first sentence of that section includes no less than three separate references to <em>all </em>property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">The term property . . . include[s] <em>all property, </em>real or personal . . . <em>and all other property </em>used in carrying on their business . . . <em>and all other real and personal property </em>.... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Given that the usual and customary meaning of property includes intangibles, and noting that the Legislature deliberately chose not to use the limiting term <em>\"tangible </em>personal property\u201d (cf. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 3), we conclude that the Legislature intended intangible as well as tangible property to be covered by its \u00a7 5 definition of \"property.\u201d We find that the Legislature\u2019s use of the words \"all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>property\u201d conveyed a meaning that is unambiguous and provides authority for inclusion of both tangible and intangible property in the valuation and assessment of property for purposes of taxation under Act 282.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\">Our interpretation of the words \"all property\u201d is not only justified by the arrangement and use of language, in Act 282, but we observe that it also comports with the \"unit concept\u201d of valuing utility property used by the Tax Tribunal in this case. This method of valuing utility property has been recognized by courts for more than one hundred years. In <em>Adams Express Co v Ohio State Auditor, </em>165 US 194, 220; 17 S Ct 305; 41 L Ed 683 (1897), the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">As to railroad, telegraph and sleeping car companies, engaged in interstate commerce, it has often been held by this court that their property, in the several States through which their lines extended, might be <em>valued as a unit </em>for purposes of taxation, taking into consideration the uses to which it was put and all the elements making up aggregate value, and that a proportion of the whole fairly and properly ascertained might be taxed by the particular State .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The appropriateness of the unit method of valuing utility property was first recognized by this Court at the turn of the century. <em>Detroit Citizen\u2019s Street-Railway Co v Detroit Common Council, </em>125 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Mich 673; 85 NW 96 [86 NW 809] (1901).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, it has long been established that the assessment of utility property as a unit requires consideration of intangibles. For example, in <em>Adams Express Co v Ohio State Auditor (After Rehearing), </em>166 US 185, 219; 17 S Ct 604; 41 L Ed 965 (1897), the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-3\">Now, whenever separate articles of tangible property are joined together, not simply by a unity of ownership, but in a unity of use, there is not infrequently developed a property, <em>intangible </em>though it may be, which in value exceeds the aggregate of the value of the separate pieces of tangible property. Upon what theory of substantial right can it be adjudged that the value of this <em>intangible </em>property must be excluded from the tax lists, and the only property placed thereon be the separate pieces of tangible property? [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Intangible assets are included in the valuation on the basis of the theory that a total operating system is integrated through a \"unity of use.\u201d See Amdur, <em>Property taxation of regulated industries, </em>40 Tax Lawyer 339, 347 (1987). See also <em>Pullman Co v Richardson, </em>261 US 330; 43 S Ct 366; 67 L Ed 682 (1923); <em>Detroit Citizen\u2019s Street-Railway v Detroit Common Council, supra; ITT World Communication v San Francisco, </em>37 Cal 3d 859; 693 P2d 811 (1985); <em>Michigan Wisconsin Pipe Line Co v Iowa State Bd of Tax Review, </em>368 NW2d 187 (Iowa, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Valuing the company\u2019s property as an integrated system (i.e., \"unity of use\u201d) requires including intangible elements that affect the property\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>value. As one respected authority on Michigan law has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">The value of the tangible property of a telephone company is not, alone, a proper valuation, nor is the cost price of a telegraph company, with deductions for deterioration. A requirement that telegraph lines shall be assessed at their cash value means valuation as a whole, plus the intangible value as a system. <em>[2 </em>Cooley, Taxation (4th ed), \u00a7 965, pp 1945-1946. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">See also <em>Soo Line R Co v Michigan </em>(Docket Nos. 2068, 2069, December 5, 1977), wherein the Tax Tribunal opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">The unitary valuation approach allows a determination of the true cash value of a particular segment of an interstate business by valuation of the entire system with subsequent value allocation to the taxing jurisdiction by a percentage factor representative of the value of the portion of the total system attributable to the taxing jurisdiction. <em>[Id., </em>pp 2-3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">It is noteworthy that use of the unit concept in valuing utility property does not always or necessarily result in an increase in the assessment. The effect of appraising the property as a unit \u2014 including intangibles \u2014 can either enhance or diminish the value of the tangible property.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">In assessing the operating real and personal property of petitioner located in Michigan,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> as required by Act 282, the Tax Tribunal employed the unit method of valuation and determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\"intangibles were properly included as adding value to that property.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 13. We conclude that in doing so the tribunal did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Next, we turn to petitioner\u2019s contention that the state is precluded by the intangibles tax act, 1939 PA 301, MCL 205.131 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 7.556(1) <em>et seq., </em>from including intangibles in the valuation of its property under Act 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Petitioner points to \u00a7 3(b)(10) of the intangibles tax act, which expressly exempts from taxation under that act the intangible personal property of telephone companies and other businesses \"paying the tax assessed and levied under Act No. 282 . . . Petitioner then calls attention to \u00a7 2(e) of the intangibles tax act, which in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">Intangible personal property subject to tax under this \u00e1ct or <em>expressly exempt from the tax hereunder </em>shall be exempt from all <em>general </em>property taxes under the laws of this state. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Upon the basis of the wording of \u00a7\u00a7 2(e) and 3(b)(10) of the intangibles tax act, petitioner advances the circular reasoning that because it is \"paying the tax assessed and levied under Act No. 282,\u201d its intangible personal property is exempt from taxation under \u00a7 3(b)(10) of the intangibles tax act, and because it is \"expressly exempt,\u201d the same intangible property is also rendered exempt by \u00a7 2(e) from taxation under Act 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">We reject this reasoning for two reasons. First, we believe it is clear that the Legislature provided the \u00a7 3(b)(10) exemption for telephone and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>public service companies precisely because their intangible property is subject to taxation under Act 282. The obvious and reasonable purpose was to avoid double taxation of such assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Second, the petitioner\u2019s position has no validity unless the Act 282 tax is a \"general\u201d property tax. We are persuaded by respondents\u2019 argument that the tax assessed under Act 282, unlike the General Property Tax Act, is more appropriately characterized as a selective tax imposed upon a relatively small number of companies whose property is centrally assessed, and whose businesses are public service in nature. Having in mind that the Legislature referred specifically to Act 282 when it granted the exemption in \u00a7 3(b)(10) of the intangibles tax act, we are not convinced that it intended, through the use of general terms in another section of the same act, to turn around and exempt the same intangibles of the same public service companies from any and all taxation under Act 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">We conclude that the intangibles tax act does not preclude consideration of intangibles in valuing and assessing property for purposes of taxation under Act 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Finally, we consider petitioner\u2019s contention that in light of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 5, taxation of its intangible personal property is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">This provision of the constitution specifically refers to those public service businesses that were taxed under Act 282 before the current constitution became effective. It directs the Legislature to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">provide for the assessment by the state of the <em>property </em>of those public service businesses assessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>by the state at the date this constitution becomes effective, and of other property as designated by the legislature, and for the imposition and collection of taxes thereon. [Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">It will be noted that this language recognizes no distinction between tangible and intangible property. Further, a convention comment that accompanied \u00a7 5 suggests that the word \"property\u201d was chosen for reasons rooted in the history of earlier constitutions of this state. The comment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">This is a new section directing the legislature to continue the present system of state assessment and collection of property taxes on the properties of certain utilities (notably telephone companies and railroads) ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In the light of these guideposts, it is instructive to examine and compare pertinent language in \u00a7 3 of the same art 9 of the current constitution. It relates to the subject of general ad valorem taxation of property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">The legislature shall provide for the uniform general ad valorem taxation of real and <em>tangible </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>personal property not exempt by law. [Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-3\">Clearly, \u00a7 3 <em>does </em>distinguish between tangible and intangible property, and it limits the application of the general ad valorem property tax to real and <em>tangible </em>personal property. We are urged by petitioner to construe the meaning of \"property\u201d in \u00a7 5 by reading it as though it were modified by the word \"tangible,\u201d as in \u00a7 3. We reject this suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">When construing a constitution, words are to be given their natural and ordinary meaning. <em>People v Nash, </em>418 Mich 196; 341 NW2d 439 (1983). \"The object of construction, as applied to a written constitution, is to give effect to the intent of the people adopting it.\u201d 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (8th ed), p 124. \"Often, however, '[w]e cannot understand these provisions unless we understand their history ....\u2019\u201d <em>Booth Newspapers, Inc v Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents, </em>444 Mich 211, 253; 507 NW2d 422 (1993) (Riley, J., dissenting), quoting Cooley, <em>supra, </em>p 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">A review of some of the history of the 1850 and 1908 Constitutions throws light on the meaning of words now at issue. In 1900, Governor Pingree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>proposed and successfully pushed to ratification an amendment to the 1850 Constitution. Appearing before a joint session of the houses of the Legislature, he explained the need for such an amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\">Under our Constitution, as construed by the Supreme Court of Michigan, it is practically impossible to frame a law by which property of railroad, telegraph, telephone and express companies can be taxed upon its true value .... [Journal of the House, October 10, 1900, p 10.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">He continued at length, arguing the advantages of taxing the property of these companies, rather than their earnings. He contended that such a change in the method of taxing such companies would greatly benefit the school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Pointing to railroads as an example, Governor Pingree asserted, \"Without franchises to operate their roads in Michigan, they would not enjoy the profits from 'through traffic.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>p 12. Acknowledging concern expressed that \"no valuation has been made of railroad, telegraph, telephone and express companies\u2019 property,\u201d he explained that it would be the duty of the Board of State Tax Commissioners to \"ascertain the valuation of the property of [these] corporations . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Leaving no doubt that his concept of property included intangibles, the Governor noted that the board had employed Prof. Henry C. Adams of the University of Michigan</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">to investigate the subject of franchise values, and to determine the value of immaterial or intangible property, including the franchises, of these corporations. The addition of the value of the tangible property to the value of the intangible property, including franchises, will give the total valuation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>according to one method of appraising the property. <em>[Id., </em>p 13.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">He concluded this portion of his address to the Legislature as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">Many of the statements herein made with reference to railroad, apply with equal force to telegraph, telephone and express companies, which pay taxes upon their earnings. In the case of the latter corporations, it will be found that the properties of greatest value which they possess are their franchises. <em>[Id., </em>p 15.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Although, as adopted, the amendment of the 1850 Constitution (art 14, \u00a7 10) mentioned only corporations to be designated by the Legislature,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> it laid the foundation for the fundamental change in Michigan taxation of public service businesses, such as railroads, telegraph and telephone companies, which occurred with enactment in 1905 of Act 282. Later, when the 1908 Constitution was ratified, art 10, \u00a7 5 specifically referred to public service companies, including those that transmitted \u201cmessages by telephone or telegraph.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>In light of this background, we find it particularly significant that neither the 1850 nor the 1908 Constitutions reflected any intention to distinguish between tangible and intangible property. Indeed, history strongly suggests that the word \"property\u201d was understood to include intangible, as well as tangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\">Not until 1939, when the intangibles tax act was enacted, did intangibles become exempt from taxation under the General Property Tax Act and subject to separate taxation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, when the 1963 Constitution was drafted and ratified, art 9, \u00a7 3 relating to the general ad valorem property tax, recognized in the constitution for the first time a distinction between tangible and intangible property. Application of the general property tax was limited to \"real and <em>tangible </em>personal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">However, similar language was not used by the drafters of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 5, which refers to Act 282 taxation. Because intangibles of the affected public service companies are not, and never have been, exempt from Act 282 taxation, art 9, \u00a7 5 of the current constitution, like its counterpart in the 1908 Constitution, provides for \"assessment by the state of the property\u201d of certain public service companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Obviously, if they had so intended, the framers of the 1963 Constitution could have altered the treatment historically accorded public service companies taxed under Act 282. They could have done so by inserting the modifier \"intangible\u201d in art 9, \u00a7 5, just as they did in art 9, \u00a7 3. That they chose not to do so persuades us that Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 5 is not a bar to the inclusion of intangibles in the assessment of property under Act 282.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">For the reasons set forth, we affirm the decisions of the Michigan Tax Tribunal and the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b622-6\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Boyle, Riley, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\"> The title of Act 282 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">An act to provide for the assessment of the property, by whomsoever owned, operated or conducted, of railroad companies, union station and depot companies, telegraph companies, <em>telephone companies, </em>sleeping car companies, express companies, car loaning companies, stock car companies, refrigerator car companies, and fast freight companies and all other companies owning, leasing, running or operating any freight, stock, refrigerator, or any other cars, not being exclusively the property of any railroad company paying taxes upon its rolling stock under the provisions of this act, over or upon the line or lines of any railroad or railroads in this state, and for the levy of taxes thereon by a state board of assessors, and for the collection of such taxes, and to repeal all acts or parts of acts contravening any of the provisions of this act.
