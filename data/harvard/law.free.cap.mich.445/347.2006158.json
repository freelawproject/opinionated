Such an interpretation is in accordance with the overriding purpose of the section, which is to provide for a computation of an average weekly wage that \"fairly represents\u201d the employee\u2019s earning capacity as fixed at the time of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"A5M\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\">Ted Rowell was hired as a steel worker. He began his employment with defendant Security Steel Processing Company on Tuesday, April 5, 1983. After finishing out the first week, he then worked six full weeks. His last day of work was Tuesday, May 24, 1983, because of a work-related heart attack. The plaintiff earned $292.50 in his first week of employment, $360 regular pay during each of the intervening six weeks, overtime of $54 in each of two weeks, $67.50 in a third week, and $144 in the week in which he was injured, Rowell\u2019s gross wages totaled $2,772.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The hearing referee in <em>Rowell </em>followed the approach suggested by the Court of Appeals in <em>Tagliavia v Barton Malow Co, </em>185 Mich App 556; 463 NW2d 116 (1990). The partially worked weeks were treated as whole weeks and used to divide the total wage earned in the course of employment. The average weekly wage was determined to be $346.50. The Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board ruled that the \"weeks 'actually worked\u2019 \u201d were 7.4 weeks rather than 8 weeks and that the average weekly wage was $375.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Riggs was hired as a construction worker. He began his employment with defendant Mosser Construction, Incorporated on Tuesday, December 8, 1987. After finishing out his first week, he then worked one full week. His last day of work was Monday, December 21, 1987, because of a fall from a ladder and resultant back injury. Plaintiff worked twenty-four hours in his first week of employment and twenty-four hours in the following week, earning $399.36 each week. He was injured in the third week of employment, and was paid $149.76 for that week. Riggs\u2019 gross wages totaled $948.48.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>In <em>Riggs, </em>the hearing referee applied the special circumstances exception provided by MCL 418.371(6); MSA 17.237(371)(6). On the basis of a forty hour week, the average weekly wage was $603.60. The Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission, following <em>Tagliavia, </em>found that the average weekly wage was $316.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Rowell v Security Steel Processing Co, </em>195 Mich App 578; 491 NW2d 265 (1992), adopted as a first-out opinion its earlier decision in <em>Tagliavia. </em>We granted leave to appeal, 442 Mich 861 (1993), limited to the issue of the proper interpretation of subsection 371(3) of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In <em>Riggs v Mosser Construction, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam, decided September 30, 1992 (Docket No. 151717), the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal, citing <em>Tagliavia. </em>We consolidated and granted leave to appeal with <em>Rowell, </em>442 Mich 903 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Resolution of the correct treatment of the week of hiring and the week of injury, in the context of an employee who has worked less than thirty-nine weeks requires application of MCL 418.371(3); MSA 17.237(371)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">When applying any legislation, it must first be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>determined whether the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous. <em>Victorson v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>439 Mich 131, 138; 482 NW2d 685 (1992). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, no judicial interpretation is warranted. <em>Livonia v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>423 Mich 466, 487; 378 NW2d 402 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Contrary to the position taken by the dissent, the language of MCL 418.371(3); MSA 17.237(371)(3) is ambiguous in that the phrase, \"the average weekly wage shall be based upon the total wages earned by the employee divided by the total number of weeks actually worked\u201d is susceptible to several possible meanings. One possibility is that the gross wage is to be divided by a whole number that is rounded up whenever an employee performs any work in a week. Another possibility is that the number of weeks in the denominator only reflects weeks in which an employee has actually worked every day. Under this interpretation, partially worked weeks are to be disregarded in the calculation. Total wages are divided by fully worked weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">A third possible interpretation would not consider partially worked weeks in either the total wage figure or the number of weeks worked figure. Finally, the interpretation advanced by the plaintiffs suggests that when the Legislature employed the phrase \"weeks actually worked,\u201d it intended total wages earned to be divided by the whole number of full weeks worked plus a fractional number representing the partially worked weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Where the language employed by the Legislature is susceptible to more than one interpretation, judicial construction is justified. <em>State Treasurer v Wilson, </em>423 Mich 138, 144; 377 NW2d 703 (1985). The goal of statutory construction is to \"ascertain and give effect to the intent of the Legislature in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>In re Forfeiture of $5,264, </em>432 Mich 242, 248; 439 NW2d 246 (1989). In determining legislative intent, individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>provisions should be considered in conjunction with the entire act. <em>Arrowhead Development Co v Livingston Co Rd Comm, </em>413 Mich 505, 516; 322 NW2d 702 (1982). If the meaning of a statute is unclear, a court must consider the object of the statute and apply a reasonable construction that best accomplishes the Legislature\u2019s purpose. <em>Wilson, supra. </em>Furthermore, literal constructions that produce unreasonable and unjust results that are inconsistent with the purpose of the act should be avoided. <em>Salas v Clements, </em>399 Mich 103, 109; 247 NW2d 889 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Under the interpretation advanced by the dissent and the Court of Appeals in <em>Tagliavia, supra, </em>the gross wage would be divided by a whole number that rounds up whenever an employee performs any work in a week. In <em>Tagliavia, </em>the Court ruled that if wages are earned in any part of a week, that week shall be included as a whole week in determining the average weekly wage. In so concluding, the Court of Appeals reasoned that that result was required by the second sentence of subsection 371(3), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">For purposes of this subsection, only those weeks in which work is performed shall be considered in computing the total wages earned and the number of weeks actually worked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">We disagree with and disapprove of <em>Tagliavia. </em>In directing that only those weeks in which work is performed shall be considered, the Legislature did not direct that every week in which work is performed shall be counted as a whole week without regard to whether the week was fully or partially worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Application of the construction suggested by <em>Tagliavia </em>would create a downward distortion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>the average weekly wage. For example, the employee who began work on a Friday at the end of a work week, worked one full week and was injured on the following Monday, would effectively have little more than a week\u2019s wage divided by three as the basis for compensation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the dissent\u2019s proposed formula, wages for one week and two days would be treated as if they fairly represented three weeks wages. In contrast, the employee who begins a job on a Monday and is injured three weeks later on a Friday, would see the basis for his compensation almost triple. It seems an absurd notion that the Legislature intended to distinguish between the employee injured on a Monday and the employee injured on a Friday. Because the resultant disparity would be irrational, we conclude that such a result was not the intention of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Similarly, we reject any interpretation of the statute that would disregard the partially worked weeks in question when dividing the gross wage. This would cause an upward distortion of the average weekly wage. For example, the employee discussed previously who began employment on a Friday, worked a full week and is injured the following Monday would have his total wages earned divided by one. This skews the average because the total wage figure would be inflated by the inclusion of two days wages. The result would be unfair to employers and would be inconsistent with the general provisions of subsection 1 regarding fair assessment of average weekly earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">While an interpretation of subsection 3 that would totally disregard partially worked weeks in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>either the numerator or the denominator might lead to an equitable solution, the Legislature did not choose the precise words that would lead to that interpretation. The Legislature specifically states that weeks in which work is performed are to be considered. However, the precise words that would lead to the distorted result reached by the dissent are absent. To interpret subsection 3 as rounding partially worked weeks up to the next whole number requires reading the words \"any week in which work did occur is considered a week 'actually worked\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">It is our conclusion that when the Legislature employed the phrase \"weeks actually worked,\u201d it intended total wages earned to be divided by the whole number of full weeks worked plus a fractional number representing the partially worked weeks in question here. Application of this construction leads to a calculation of an employee\u2019s average weekly wage that would most closely parallel a mathematical average. The employee who was hired to start on a Friday, worked one full week, and was injured on a Monday would have his total wages divided by 1.4 if his work week is based on five working days.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">This interpretation is most consistent with the overall legislative intent expressed in \u00a7 371 when read in its entirety. An examination of the other subsections surrounding subsection 3 reveals the Legislature\u2019s overriding desire to have the basis for compensation reflect an accurate measure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>wages. Section 371(2) establishes that wage is to include overtime, premiums, cost of living adjustments, and any fringe or other benefit that does not continue during the disability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 371(2) further provides that where an employee has worked more than thirty-nine weeks before an injury, the highest paid weeks of the fifty-two weeks before the injury are to be the basis for determining wage loss. This reflects a legislative purpose to utilize those weeks that are as fair as possible to the employee when dividing by thirty-nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">While the Legislature did not specifically address the treatment of the partially worked weeks sub judice when an employee works less than thirty-nine weeks, it did specifically address the employee who worked less than one week. Section 371(4) provides that the basis for determining wage loss for the employee injured during the first week of employment will be a determination of the number of hours the worker was to have worked, multiplied by the hourly rate, or simply the weekly salary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">It would be incongruous for the Legislature to have intended more protection for the employee injured in the first week of employment, under the provisions of subsection 4, than it intended for the employee injured in the second week of employment, under the provisions of subsection 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Similarly, \u00a7 371(5) provides that where an hourly earning cannot be computed, the usual wage for similar services shall be considered as the basis for calculating compensation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subsection 6 applies \"[i]f there are special circumstances under which the average weekly wage cannot justly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>determined by applying subsections (2) to (5) . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Where there are special circumstances, the Legislature provided that the average weekly wage could be computed by dividing the aggregate earnings by the number of days worked and then multiplying by the number of days customarily worked, \"not less than 5.\u201d This provision demonstrates that the Legislature was willing to depart from the traditional definition of a work week if necessary to justly determine the basis for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Read together, the provisions of \u00a7 371 illustrate that the Legislature attempted to draft a statute that would be sensitive to accuracy as the basis for the determination of weekly wage loss in a variety of employment situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Treating the partially worked week of hiring and the partially worked week of injury as fractions of a full week comes closest to producing a true average weekly wage. The consideration of these partially worked weeks as fractions in the calculation would be fair to both the employee and the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The treatment of these partially worked weeks as fractions is a rational and reasonable interpretation of the statute. It is also consistent with the expressed legislative desire contained in subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>1 to provide for a fair and accurate representation of an injured worker\u2019s average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Therefore, we conclude that the treatment of the partially worked week of hiring and the partially worked week of injury as fractions of full weeks for the purposes of calculating the average weekly wage of an employee with less than thirty-nine weeks of employment best carries out the Legislature\u2019s overall intentions for calculating the average weekly wage in this situation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in each case, and the cases are remanded to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b491-8\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Boyle, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-10\"> The quoted language is from subsection (3) of \u00a7 371 of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act.

Nor may the Court assume that a mistake was made or that the Legislature inadvertently utilized one word instead of another. <em>Detroit v Redford Twp, </em>253 Mich 453, 456; 235 NW 217 (1931).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, unless the statute or circumstances dictate otherwise, the Court should utilize the common understanding of words and phrases. <em>People ex rel Platt v Oakland Co Bank, </em>1 Doug 282, 287 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>(Mich, 1844).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, \"[a] fundamental principle guiding this Court is that a clear and unambiguous statute leaves no room for judicial construction or interpretation.\u201d <em>Coleman v Gurwin, </em>443 Mich 59, 65; 503 NW2d 435 (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, \"[a] statute is not open to construction as a matter of course, but only where the language used in the statute requires interpretation \u2014 where it is ambiguous or where 2 or more constructions can be placed upon it, where it is of such doubtful or obscure meaning that reasonable minds might be uncertain or disagree as to its meaning.\u201d <em>City of Lansing v Lansing Twp, </em>356 Mich 641, 649; 97 NW2d 804 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">These rules of statutory construction are especially appropriate in the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\"The compensation act is in derogation of the common law and, therefore, its measure of relief may not be extended beyond its express terms; it is a legislative creation permitting no enlargement by principles of equity or common-law adaptations. It is arbitrary and where it speaks nothing can be added nor changed by judicial pronouncement. It imposes liability upon operatives under its provisions and measures exclusive relief in its own terms.\u201d <em>[Solakis v Roberts, </em>395 Mich 13, 20; 233 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>NW2d 1 (1975), quoting Tews <em>v C F Hanks Coal Co, </em>267 Mich 466, 468-469; 255 NW 227 (1934).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Subsection 3 provides that \"the average weekly wage shall be based upon the total wages earned by the employee divided by the total number of weeks actually worked.\u201d The subsection defines, for its purposes only, that \"only those weeks in which work is performed shall be considered in computing the total wages earned and the number of weeks actually worked.\u201d Accordingly, any week in which work did not occur is not considered in the calculation, while any week in which work did occur is considered a week \"actually worked.\u201d There is no exception for the first, last, or any other partially worked week as long as \"work is performed\u201d that week. In the instant case, therefore, each plaintiff\u2019s wages should be divided by the total number of weeks in which at least some work occurred, regardless of the actual hours worked or wages earned each week. This subsection is uncomplicated and provides for a readily determinable weekly wage. The fairness of the provision is not our concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The majority, however, ignores the clear meaning of the statute and substitutes a standard fashioned from whole cloth. Nowhere in the statutory scheme is there reference to the utilization of fractional work weeks. To the contrary, the subsection at issue mandates that the \"total number of weeks actually worked\u201d be utilized to compute a claimant\u2019s benefits. The ordinary meaning of this phrase is to interpret \"week\u201d as seven consecutive days (beginning on Sunday) and \"total number of weeks\u201d to mean the combined or full number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>weeks that work occurred. \"[W]eeks actually worked\u201d is specifically defined as any week in which work is performed. Contrary to the majority\u2019s holding, the subsection does not provide that shortened weeks at the beginning and end of a worker\u2019s employment are to be computed as fractions \u2014 the statutory definition of \"actually worked\u201d does not differentiate between shortened and full work weeks or between the first, middle, and last weeks of employment. In fact, no mention of first or last weeks exists in the section at issue whatsoever. Nor is there a provision for partially worked weeks. The section clearly provides that the total number of weeks in which any work was performed \u2014 regardless of the amount of work performed or when the week was worked \u2014 is to be used in the calculation. In short, there is no provision for the utilization of fractional weeks for the first and last weeks worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The majority, however, posits that the language is ambiguous by proffering four different interpretations of the language at issue, <em>ante </em>at 353, and then chooses the one interpretation it finds the most palatable. Yet, three of these interpretations are simply untenable distortions of language of the statute. The true objection of the majority, is that the clear language of the statute is \"unfair.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 355. This Court, however, may not misinterpret statutes so that they may seem more fair to its individual members.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">If the Legislature wished to ensure that fractional weeks be utilized, it would have clearly expressed that intention. For example, subsection 3 explicitly provides that weeks during which no work occurred are not to be counted as weeks for the purpose of determining compensation. Similarly, subsection 4 provides for special calculations if an employee is injured before completing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>first work week \"by determining the number of hours of work per week contracted for by that employee multiplied by the employee\u2019s hourly rate, or the weekly salary contracted for by the employee.\u201d Similarly, subsection 6 defines a week for its purposes as \"the number of working days customary in the employment . . . .\u201d The Legislature, therefore, has clearly articulated computations that account for the exigencies of employment and the untimely halt of employment due to injury. Nevertheless, the Legislature did not provide for special fractional calculations for incomplete weeks, calculations by multiplying the contracted hours by the hourly wage, or weeks \"customary in the employment\u201d in subsection 3. The majority, however, examines the separate subsections to support its conclusions that the Legislature intended its formula. To the contrary, the Legislature\u2019s purposeful decision not to include such special calculations reveals that it intended otherwise. In short, the length or timing of the work week is irrelevant in the instant case. The language utilized is not so doubtful or obscure that reasonable minds might be uncertain of its meaning. Indeed, the language could not be clearer. The majority simply engrafts on the statute a novel means of computing benefits in contradiction with its plain terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The majority protests that \"[i]n directing that only those weeks in which work is performed shall be considered, the Legislature did not direct that every week in which work is performed shall be counted as a whole week without regard to whether the week was fully or partially worked.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 354. To the contrary, the Legislature clearly provided that any week in which work occurred was to be considered a week \"actually worked.\u201d The majority\u2019s interpretation has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>anomalous result of counting partially worked weeks at the beginning and the end of employment as fractions, but counting weeks partially worked in between the first and last week as a full week. Thus, a week \"actually worked\u201d possesses two entirely different definitions for the same worker at the same job. Such a reading is nothing if not \"incongruous\u201d or \"absurd.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Contrary to the majority, we must assume that the Legislature intended to choose the precise words it utilized, and that it consciously chose not to utilize fractional weeks in the subsection at issue. We must not substitute the Legislature\u2019s words for our preferences. The Legislature enacted this language with the passage of 1980 PA 357. The act completely revised the prior statutorily mandated calculation by eliminating the calculation of wages by \"multiplying the hourly rate or earning by the average number of hours worked . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The extensive alteration engendered by the act, carefully crafted a model for calculating the appropriate benefits to a claimant in the specific circumstances of an employee injured before completing thirty-nine weeks of employment. Like all legislation, the provision at issue was a legislative compromise. The majority undoes that compromise by amending the statute via judicial fiat. The Legislature did not find it fit to modify the statute \u2014 neither should this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A1s7\">When confronted with an unambiguous statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>we are not to find metaphysical and subtle meanings hidden between or behind the language of the statute. This case is not one about the justice or injustice of the statute involved. The majority bases its holding on the possible unfairness that might result from the application of the clear language. Yet, within our system of separate powers, the lawmaking function resides with the Legislature, not this Court. <em>Roosevelt Oil Co v Secretary of State, </em>339 Mich 679, 694; 64 NW2d 582 (1954) (\"it is not the function of the court to legislate\u201d). Thus, unless proven unconstitutional, \"[t]he wisdom of the provision in question in the form in which it was enacted is a matter of legislative responsibility with which courts may not interfere.\u201d <em>Melia v Employment Security Comm, </em>346 Mich 544, 561; 78 NW2d 273 (1956). \"Adherence to the language and legislative intent of a statute is essential to ensure that 'courts . . . declare the sense of the law\u2019 and do not 'exercise will instead of judgment . . . .\u2019 Hamilton, <em>The Federalist Papers, </em>No 78, Kramnick, ed (England: Penguin Books, 1987 [originally published in 1788]), p 440.\u201d <em>Coleman, supra </em>at 65. In other words, as a court of law, we do not create law or base opinions on questions of policy or our personal feelings. To the contrary, when construing a statute, our objective must only be to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent. The majority\u2019s conclusion that fractional weeks may be the basis for the computation of benefits, therefore, is nothing more than the unwarranted usurpation of legislative authority \u2014 the exercise of will instead of judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-5\"> See also <em>People v Crucible Steel Co of America, supra </em>at 567 (\"We cannot assume the legislature made a mistake and used one word when it in fact intended to use another.
