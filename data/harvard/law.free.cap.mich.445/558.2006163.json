Defendants argue that receipt of the notice did not give rise to a duty to defend because the letter did not signal the initiation of a \"suit\u201d within the meaning of the subject insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">We find that the term \"suit,\u201d as used in the insurance policies at issue, is ambiguous and capable of application to legal actions, other than court proceedings, that are the functional equivalent of a suit brought in a court of law. We further hold that the notice of potential liability received by Bronson in this instance, signaled the initiation of a legal proceeding that was the functional equivalent of a traditional court action, and thereby triggered the insurers\u2019 duty to defend. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The pertinent facts of this declaratory judgment action are not in dispute. Since the 1940s, the Bronson Plating Company has engaged in the electroplating of various metal parts at its facility at the North Bronson Industrial Area in Bronson, Michigan. In its electroplating process, Bronson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>has utilized a variety of chemicals and compounds, including nickel, nickel-chrome, lead, caustic soda, sulfuric acid, and hydrochloric acid. The process involved the release of large quantities of waste water, and this waste was identified by the epa and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources as a possible source of environmental contamination of the North Bronson Industrial Area.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Bronson had purchased comprehensive general liability insurance from Michigan Millers Mutual Insurance Company, and three of its policies were in effect consecutively from January 1970 through January 1977. Each of these policies provided that the insurance company shall have the \"duty to defend any <em>suit </em>against the insured seeking damages on account of . . . bodily injury or property damage\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (emphasis added). In addition to its insurance contracts with Michigan Millers, Bronson was insured under several primary and umbrella/ excess policies issued by other insurance compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>nies,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> each of which contained similar language with respect to the insurer\u2019s duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">In April 1986, the epa, acting under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (cercla),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> notified Bronson by letter that it may be liable for contamination of the North Bronson Industrial Area (the \"site\u201d). This communication, frequently referred to as a \"potentially responsible party\u201d (prp) letter, advised Bronson that the epa had \"documented the release ... of hazardous substances ... at the . . . site, and is planning to spend public funds to control and investigate these releases.\u201d In its prp letter, the epa, inter alia, requested Bronson\u2019s voluntary participation in connection with certain studies, and cautioned that Bronson\u2019s failure to do so could result in it being held jointly and severally liable for any costs that were expended. Pursuant to its letter, the epa also demanded that Bronson supply relevant information, it encouraged good-faith negotiations between Bronson and the agency and with other potentially responsible parties, and it explained that failure to comply \"may result in a civil enforcement action being brought against you by epa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Although the prp letter to Bronson was not issued until April 1986, Bronson began notifying its insurers in November 1985 that the epa considered it to be a possible source of groundwater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>contamination at the site.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bronson\u2019s letter to Michigan Millers was dated March 21, 1986, and demanded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-4\">pursuant to the terms of any applicable policies of insurance issued by you, . . . that you undertake your responsibility to defend, indemnify and hold Bronson Plating harmless from and against any and all damages ... or any liability . . . arising out of the listing of the North Bronson Industrial Area on the npl by [the] epa ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">While the other insurers declined to do so, Michigan Millers agreed to provide a defense for Bronson, subject, however, to a reservation of its rights. Michigan Millers then commenced the instant declaratory judgment action, seeking a judicial determination, inter alia, that it was not obligated to defend Bronson because no \"suit\u201d had been commenced. Bronson filed a counterclaim and joined the other named insurance companies as counterdefendants. In its countercomplaint, Bronson sought a declaration that its insurers had a duty both to defend and indemnify Bronson.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The trial court then considered cross-motions for summary disposition and, addressing only the duty to defend issue, ruled that the insurers had no obligation under the insurance policies to provide a defense \"in the absence of a complaint filed in a Court against Bronson by the epa or the dnr.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A1Q\">Thereafter, a divided panel of the Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>peals reversed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The panel majority registered its agreement with the reasoning and result in <em>Polkow v Citizens Ins Co of </em>America, 180 Mich App 651; 447 NW2d 853 (1989), rev\u2019d on other grounds 438 Mich 174; 476 NW2d 382 (1991),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and declared: \"[W]e hold in this case . . . that a 'suit\u2019 has been brought.\u201d 197 Mich App 482, 491; 496 NW2d 373 (1992) .</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">We then granted leave to appeal, limited to the question whether the epa letter notifying Bronson of its potential liability for alleged environmental contamination constitutes a \"suit\u201d that gives rise to the insurers\u2019 duty to defend under the terms of the applicable insurance contracts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 443 Mich 880 (1993) .</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">Defendants argue that the prp letter received by Bronson did not constitute the initiation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>\"suit,\u201d triggering their duty to defend. To resolve defendants\u2019 claim, we must first determine whether \"suit,\u201d as used in the subject insurance policies, is an ambiguous term admitting of more than one construction, i.e., whether the term may refer to some legal action other than a court proceeding initiated by a complaint. Second, if the term is ambiguous and capable of broader definition, whether it may reasonably be understood to encompass the prp letter received by Bronson.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">When interpreting insurance policies under Michigan law, we are guided by a number of well-established principles of construction. Foremost among those is the maxim that an insurance policy must be enforced in accordance with its terms. <em>Upjohn Co v New Hampshire Ins Co, </em>438 Mich 197, 207; 476 NW2d 392 (1991). A court may not read ambiguities into a policy where none exist. <em>Auto-Owners Ins Co v Churchman, </em>440 Mich 560, 567; 489 NW2d 431 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Although the term \"suit\u201d was not defined within the relevant insurance policies, that fact, alone, is not conclusive evidence that ambiguity exists. <em>Group Ins Co of Michigan v Czopek, </em>440 Mich 590, 596; 489 NW2d 444 (1992). Rather, where no definition is provided, the court must interpret the term according to its \"commonly used meaning,\u201d <em>id., </em>taking into account the reasonable expectations of the parties. <em>Vanguard Ins Co v Clarke, </em>438 Mich 463, 472; 475 NW2d 48 (1991). Where ambiguity is found, the court must construe the term in the manner most favorable to the insured. <em>Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n v DeLaGarza, </em>433 Mich 208, 214; 444 NW2d 803 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">There is a division of opinion, both within Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>gan and among other jurisdictions, regarding the definition of the term \"suit,\u201d and its application to nontraditional legal proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Some courts have found that \"suit\u201d must refer unambiguously to a court proceeding initiated by a complaint, while others hold that the term may also encompass some nonjudicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In determining what a typical layperson would understand a particular term to mean, it is customary to turn to dictionary definitions. Having, canvassed a number of lay dictionaries, we note that most definitions of \"suit\u201d do include a reference to some type of court proceeding, e.g., \"the act, the process, or an instance of suing in a court of law.\u201d <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1987). Nevertheless, \"suit\u201d is not defined <em>exclusively </em>in those terms. For instance, <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary of the American Language </em>(2d college ed, 1982), provides the alternative definition, \"attempt to recover a right or claim through legal action,\u201d while <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1964), defines suit as \"the attempt to gain an end by legal process: prosecution of a right before any tribunal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The existence of these alternative and more general definitions of a \"suit\u201d persuasively suggests that a typical layperson might reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>expect the term to apply to legal proceedings other than a court action initiated by a complaint. <em>Morrisville Water &amp; Light Dep\u2019t v United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co, </em>775 F Supp 718, 731-732 (D Vt, 1991). Where the insurers fail to provide otherwise, that commonly understood meaning must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Furthermore, defendants\u2019 suggestion that this Court has previously limited application of the term \"suit\u201d to court proceedings is unconvincing. The only Michigan Supreme Court case law interpreting the term in the context of triggering an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is inconclusive with regard to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In <em>Patterson v Standard Accident Ins Co, </em>178 Mich 288; 144 NW 491 (1913), this Court addressed the question whether a criminal prosecution constitutes a \"suit\u201d against which an insurer is obliged to defend. In its opinion, the <em>Patterson </em>Court explored the definition of \"suit,\u201d observing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">It must be conceded that the word \"suit,\u201d as applied to legal controversies, both by the legal profession and others, is now used and recognized as a generic term of broad significance, often understood and used, even by legislatures and courts, to designate <em>almost any proceeding in a court, </em>even, though rarely, being applied to a criminal prosecution in certain connections, [id. at 292. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Despite this observation, focusing on the use of the term with regard to court actions, when the Court proceeded to set forth a definition of \"suit,\u201d it did so more broadly, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">\"Suit,\u201d in its general unqualified use in legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>documents, such as the one before us, naturally means, and should be construed as intended to include, <em>the mode or manner authorized and adopted by law to redress civil injuries. [Id. </em>Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">On this basis, the <em>Patterson </em>Court determined that criminal prosecutions were not covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The <em>Patterson </em>discussion fails to definitively endorse or reject the application of the term \"suit\u201d to nonjudicial proceedings. However, by defining \"suit\u201d broadly as the \"mode or manner authorized and adopted by law to redress civil injuries,\u201d the Court certainly left open the possibility that proceedings occurring outside the courtroom could be encompassed. Accordingly, defendants\u2019 reliance upon <em>Patterson </em>is misplaced.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">We also note that a broader definition of the term \"suit\u201d reflects more accurately the modern realities of our legal system. As the legal community and state and federal legislatures struggle to relieve the ever-increasing burdens on our courts and the constantly rising costs of litigation, a gravitation is evident toward less formal and more expeditious means of dispute resolution. This movement has manifested itself in the growing use of arbitration, as well as increased authority given to administrative agencies to resolve disputes, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>that the functional equivalents of suits brought in a court of law have developed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As is discussed in more detail below, this point is particularly valid in the context of cercla actions, where the Legislature has deliberately and painstakingly developed a system in which a prp has every incentive to \"voluntarily\u201d cooperate with the epa, before actual litigation,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and where significant legal prejudice may develop if the prp fails to do so.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Therefore, we find the term \"suit\u201d as used in the insurance policies at issue, to be ambiguous and capable of application to legal proceedings initiated in other than a traditional court setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Having determined that the term \"suit\u201d is capable of application to nonjudicial legal proceedings, we must next determine whether the prp letter received by Bronson did, in fact, constitute the initiation of a suit under the subject insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>policies. Once again, the jurisdictions are split on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Some courts have found that a typical prp letter from the epa constitutes the initiation of a suit, thereby giving rise to the duty to defend. Those courts have emphasized the particular nature of CERCLA-related actions, and the unique authority given to the epa to develop an essentially binding record and to design and implement actions that the prps may later be held liable for. See, e.g., <em>Coakley v Maine Bonding &amp; Casualty Co, </em>136 NH 402, 416-419; 618 A2d 777 (1992); <em>Hazen Paper Co v United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co, </em>407 Mass 689, 696-699; 555 NE2d 576 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In contrast, other jurisdictions have declined to impose a duty to defend absent a more definitive and directive epa action, e.g., an order to undertake site investigation or cleanup. Those courts have tended to focus on the \"voluntary\u201d participation sought by the epa, as well as the lack of certainty that litigation would ensue if the prp failed to comply. See, e.g., <em>Ryan v Royal Ins Co of America, </em>916 F2d 731, 741 (CA 1, 1990); <em>Avondale Industries, Inc v Travelers Indemnity Co, </em>887 F2d 1200, 1206 (CA 2, 1989), cert den 496 US 906 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In determining whether a \"suit\u201d was initiated in the present case, we must examine the contents of the prp letter received by Bronson. In pertinent part, that letter informed Bronson that the epa had identified it as a potentially responsible party for contamination at the North Bronson Industrial Area. Barring an immediate offer from any of the prps to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study (ri/fs), the epa would undertake to complete one. If the epa did so, under the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>42 USC 9607(a), Bronson could be held jointly and severally liable for \"all costs associated with the removal or remedial action and all other necessary costs incurred in cleaning up the site, including investigation, planning and enforcement.\u201d Further, the epa required Bronson to submit documentation regarding any waste it had released onto the site. Failure to comply with this demand could result in civil action and fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Taking into account the various components of this prp letter and its ramifications, we find that the legal proceeding initiated by the receipt of that notice is the functional equivalent of a suit brought in a court of law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Of critical importance is the creation of the administrative record and the role it may play in future litigation. Documen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>tation sought by the epa, and which Bronson must produce under the force of law, will determine the amount and type of waste generated by Bronson and discharged onto the site. Given the strict liability stance of cercla, this information is all that is needed to establish both the fact and proportional share of Bronson\u2019s liability at the site.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Moreover, because the epa may implement any investigatory and remedial action it deems necessary at the site, subject only to an abuse of discretion review,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the total cost of the project will also be determined before litigation is brought. The significant authority given to the epa in such matters allows it essentially to usurp the traditional role of a court of law in determining and apportioning liability. Such matters are concluded <em>by the epa </em>before the action is ever brought to court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The epa\u2019s powers may also be viewed as coercing the \"voluntary\u201d participation of prps. The entire cercla scheme revolves around \"encouraging\u201d prps to engage in voluntary cleanups. Only in so doing may a prp have a voice in developing the record that will be used against it and in determining the amount of its liability through selection of investigatory and remedial methods and procedures. The significance of these incentives is underscored by the fact that EPA-conducted cercla <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>actions have historically been considerably and, some would suggest, needlessly more expensive than those actions conducted by prp groups.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Finally, we note, from a policy perspective, that the position urged by defendants would only increase the litigiousness of this already extensively litigated area of the law. Limiting an insurer\u2019s duty to defend to an actual court proceeding preceded by a complaint would merely encourage prps to decline \"voluntary\u201d involvement in site cleanups, waiting instead for an actual lawsuit to be brought in order to receive insurance coverage. This would have the effect of substantially protracting the cleanup of contaminated sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We find that the term \"suit,\u201d as used in the insurance policies at issue, is ambiguous and capable of application to nontraditional legal actions that are the functional equivalent of a suit brought in a court of law. We further hold that, under this definition, the prp letter received by Bronson constituted the initiation of a \"suit\u201d that the insurers were obliged to defend under the terms of their insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b707-8\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Mallett, J._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-5\"> Each of the policies contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">I.

It is generally recognized that the duty of an insurer to defend its insured may be broader than the insurer\u2019s obligation to indemnify. <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, </em>432 Mich 656, 662; 443 NW2d 734 (1989) (Riley, J.). Nevertheless, the \"duty to defend is contractual and if there is no contract to defend there is no duty to defend.\u201d 14 Couch, Insurance, 2d (rev ed), \u00a7 51:35, p 444. Any delineation of the scope of the duty to defend requires reference to the terms of the insurance contract itself. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 701 (Boyle, J.); <em>Stockdale v Jamison, </em>416 Mich 217, 224; 330 NW2d 389 (1982); <em>Arco Industries Corp v Travelers Ins Co, </em>730 F Supp 59, 66 (WD Mich, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">It is well settled that ambiguities in the meaning of the terms of an insurance contract are to be resolved in favor of the insured. <em>Mays v Ins Co of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>North America, </em>407 Mich 165, 172; 284 NW2d 256 (1979); <em>Wozniak v John Hancock Mutual Life Ins Co, </em>288 Mich 612, 615; 286 NW 99 (1939).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, this notion is tempered by the axioms that \"[m]eaning should be given to all terms\u201d and \"[a]mbiguities should not be forced.\u201d <em>Fresard v Michigan Millers Mutual Ins Co, </em>414 Mich 686, 694; 327 NW2d 286 (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the language of an insurance contract is plain and unambiguous, it must be enforced as written. <em>Eghotz v Creech, </em>365 Mich 527, 530; 113 NW2d 815 (1962); <em>Kingsley v American Central Life Ins Co, </em>259 Mich 53, 55; 242 NW 836 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Although the issue presented is one of first impression in this Court, it has been addressed with mixed results by other courts applying Michigan law. In <em>City of Evart v Home Ins Co, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, decided April 10, 1989 (Docket No. 103621), the panel found that the term \u201csuit,\u201d as used in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>policy, was \"clear and unambiguous, and [that], given its plain and ordinary meaning,\u201d it did not encompass a policyholder\u2019s receipt of a notice letter issued by the dnr.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Drawing upon the <em>Evart </em>ruling, a similar result was reached in several decisions by federal courts applying Michigan law that determined the meaning of \"suit\u201d in the context of an insured\u2019s receipt of a prp letter. See <em>Upjohn Co v Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co, </em>768 F Supp 1186, 1198 (WD Mich, 1990) (\"[T]he prp letter issued to an insured is not a 'suit\u2019 within the meaning of the general liability insurance policies ... in accord with <em>City of Evart\u201d); Arco Industries Corp v Travelers Ins Co, supra </em>at 68 (\"[T]he prp letter issued to [the insured] is not a 'suit\u2019 within the meaning of the insurance policies and ... it did not trigger the insurers\u2019 duty to defend [the insured] against the epa\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Notwithstanding the holding in <em>Evart </em>and its progeny, a subsequent panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a contrary decision in <em>Polkow v Citizens Ins Co of America, </em>180 Mich App 651; 447 NW2d 853 (1989), rev\u2019d on other grounds 438 Mich 174; 476 NW2d 382 (1991).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It concluded that for the dnr to subject an insured to its \"administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>tive mechanisms\u201d mandating environmental investigation and cleanup, \"backed by the power to expose the insured to a money judgment in a court of law, <em>amounts to a 'suit\u2019 </em>for purposes of invoking the coverage of the policy.\u201d 180 Mich App 657 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">More recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejected the <em>Polkow </em>reasoning, and adopted the position reflected in <em>Evart, Upjohn, </em>and <em>Arco, </em>i.e., that receipt by an insured of a prp letter from the epa does not constitute a \"suit\u201d within the meaning of such policy language. <em>Ray Industries, Inc v Liberty Mutual Ins Co, </em>974 F2d 754, 764 (CA 6, 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">As noted by the majority, the decisions of courts in other jurisdictions are also divided on this issue. A number of courts have held, consistent with <em>Ray Industries, </em>that use of the term \"suit\u201d in this context contemplates the commencement of court proceedings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Other courts have looked to the extent and nature of administrative activity to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>mine whether and when the functional equivalent of a suit has been reached, and have concluded that the mere issuance by an agency of a PRP-type letter does not constitute a suit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, in line with <em>Polkow </em>and the view urged upon us by Bronson, still other courts have ruled that a suit is commenced when a prp letter is issued by the epa.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Today, a majority of this Court adopts the third of these three approaches. I dissent because the insurance policy language delineates the risk assumed and makes clear that the parties contracted for a defense by the insurer against a lawsuit brought in court, and not for something else that might be regarded by some as the \"functional equivalent\u201d thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The majority finds the term \"suit\u201d in the policies before us \"to be ambiguous and capable of application to legal proceedings initiated in other than a traditional court setting.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 571. I disagree. The mere assertion of doubtful meaning does not give rise to an ambiguity, and a court is not at liberty to create ambiguity in a contract where none exists. <em>Upjohn Co v Hampshire Ins Co, </em>438 Mich 197, 206; 476 NW2d 392 (1991). Whether terms in a policy are ambiguous is a question for the court, which must examine the words in the context in which they are used. <em>Jones v Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co, </em>172 Mich App 24, 27-28; 431 NW2d 242 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Here, the language in question reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">The Company shall have the right and <em>duty to defend any suit </em>against the insured seeking dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ages on account of such bodily injury or property damage, even if any of the allegations of the <em>suit </em>are groundless, false or fraudulent, and may make such investigation and settlement of any <em>claim </em>or <em>suit </em>as it deems expedient, but the Company shall not be obligated to pay any <em>claim </em>or <em>judgment </em>or to defend any <em>suit </em>after the applicable limit of the Company\u2019s liability has been exhausted .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">In common usage, the word \"suit\u201d refers to a proceeding in court, and that meaning is starkly apparent in the context of this policy language, which draws a clear distinction between a \"claim\u201d and a \"suit.\u201d Significantly, no obligation is imposed upon the insurer to defend against a <em>claim. </em>However, if a <em>suit </em>is brought against the insured, the duty of the insurer to defend is engendered even though the allegations in the complaint may be \"groundless, false or fraudulent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">This distinction between a \"claim\u201d and a \"suit\u201d does not appear in just one place; it is recognized generally in the contract. For example, at another point the policy language instructs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">4. Insured\u2019s Duties in the Event of Occurrence, <em>Claim </em>or <em>Suit:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">(b) If <em>claim is made </em>or <em>suit is brought </em>against the insured, the insured shall immediately forward to the [insurer] every demand, notice, summons or other process received by him or his representative. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Giving the policy language its ordinary, comm on - sense meaning, I believe it is apparent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the epa\u2019s issuance of a prp letter is a \"claim made,\u201d and not a \"suit brought.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A346\">The majority\u2019s holding that a prp letter constitutes a \"suit\u201d renders superfluous the language giving the insurer the right to investigate and settle any claim, contrary to the tenet that a court must \"give effect to all words in an insurance contract if they serve a reasonable purpose.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, supra </em>at 688. Surely, the authority to investigate and settle a <em>claim, </em>distinct from a <em>suit, </em>undeniably serves a reasonable purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">In effect, the majority has imprudently accepted Bronson\u2019s argument that we either should ignore altogether the long-recognized distinction between a claim and a suit, see 14 Couch, Insurance, 2d (rev ed), \u00a7 51:43, p 457, or that somehow we should say that a very serious claim is a suit. Such an argument amounts to a request that we rewrite the contract between the parties, which we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>do under the guise of interpretation. <em>Upjohn Co, supra </em>at 207. As the <em>Ray </em>court observed, \"while [the insurer] has the power to investigate any claim, it contracted to defend only suits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Even without resort to the dictionary, the meaning of the word \"suit,\u201d in the context of its use in this policy language, is clear and unambiguous. However, this conclusion is strongly fortified by reference to the definitions that are available in the modern lay dictionaries. For example, see:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\"><em>Random House, Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1991) (\"[A]n act or instance of suing in a <em>court </em>of law; lawsuit; a petition or appeal\u201d); <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1966) (\"[A]n action or process in a <em>court </em>for the recovery of a right or claim\u201d); <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary of the American Language </em>(college ed, 1968) (\"[A]n action to secure justice in a <em>court </em>of law; attempt to recover a right or claim through legal action\u201d); <em>Webster\u2019s II </em>\u2014 New <em>Riverside University Dictionary </em>(1984) (\"A <em>court </em>proceeding to recover a right or claim\u201d); <em>Funk &amp; Wagnall\u2019s Standard College Dictionary </em>(1968) (\"A proceeding in a <em>court </em>of law or chancery in which a plaintiff demands the recovery of a right or the redress of a wrong\u201d); <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(3d ed) <em>C[C]ourt </em>proceeding to recover a right or claim\u201d); <em>Scott Foresman, Advanced Dictionary </em>(Doubleday ed, 1979) (\"[C]ase in a <em>court </em>of law; application to a court for justice\u201d); and <em>The Random House College Dictionary </em>(1975) (\"[T]he act, the process, or an instance of suing in a <em>court </em>of law; legal prosecution; lawsuit\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>These definitions are echoed in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), which explains that a \"suit\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">A generic term, of comprehensive signification, referring to any proceeding by one person or persons against another or others <em>in a court of law </em>in which the plaintiff pursues, <em>in such court, </em>the remedy which the law affords him for the redress of an injury or the enforcement of a right, whether at law or in equity. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The majority has managed to find several dictionary definitions referring to suit as an \"attempt to recover a right or claim through legal action\u201d or an \"attempt to gain an end by legal process\u201d <em>(ante </em>at 568), and asserts that these \"persuasively suggest\u201d ambiguity in the meaning of the term. However, I see no ambiguity in such variations. Rather, I agree with Judge Boggs who, writing for the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">[A] \"suit,\u201d as that term is used both in conversation and in dictionaries, is an attempt to gain an object <em>in the courts[,] </em>... as opposed to demands and other tactics that, however powerful, are not enforced by a court of law. We reject any attempt to allow phrases that appear in the definitions of \"suit,\u201d such as \"legal process,\u201d to expand this term beyond its traditional meaning to include a plethora of quasi-judicial actions from administrative orders to bureaucratic regulations. <em>[Ray Industries, supra </em>at 761. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Pointing to an increase in the use of arbitration and other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, the majority seeks to justify its result by asserting that \"a broader definition of the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>'suit\u2019 reflects more accurately the modern realities of our legal system.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 570. But such an assertion is irrelevant. Our task is to determine the meaning of language used by the parties at the time a contract was executed. Of course, for a higher premium, the parties might have agreed that the insurer would defend the policyholder, not only against suits brought in court but also in arbitration or other out-of-court dispute resolution activities. But that is not the contract of the parties in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead of giving effect to the language of the insurance policy before us, the majority looks beyond the contract to embark on a hazardous course of rewriting private contracts for the apparent purpose of furthering social policies as they arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The most recent rejection of the majority\u2019s analysis by the highest court of a sister state was registered by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. In <em>City of Edgerton </em>v <em>General Casualty Co of Wiscon</em>sin, 184 Wis 2d 750; 517 NW2d 463 (1994), that court ruled that an insurer did not have a duty to defend against a pep letter by the epa or a comparable notification letter by a state agency because a \"suit\u201d had not been commenced. Finding \"no ambiguity in the term 'suit,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>p 781, the court rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the argument that such notification letters are the \" 'functional equivalent of a suit\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">Construing either the epa\u2019s prp letter or the dnr letters as the \"functional equivalent of a suit\u201d would be contrary to present Wisconsin insurance law since (a) the insurer would have to look beyond the four corners of the complaint in order to assess whether a potentially covered claim exists, and (b) the insurer would be put in the position of anticipating a coverage expectation for which it did not contract or receive payment. <em>[Id., </em>p 781.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Likewise, the majority\u2019s holding today contravenes settled principles of Michigan insurance law. It not only rewrites unambiguous contract language under the guise of interpretation, but it ignores the significance of a complaint in determining the scope of an insurer\u2019s duty to defend. As this Court recently reiterated in <em>Protective Nat\u2019l Ins Co of Omaha v City of Woodhaven, </em>438 Mich 154, 159; 476 NW2d 374 (1991):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\"The <em>duty of the insurer to defend the insured depends upon the allegations in the complaint </em>of the third party in his or her action against the insured. This duty is not limited to meritorious suits and may even extend to actions which are groundless, false, or fraudulent, so long as the allegations against the insured even <em>arguably </em>come within the policy coverage. ... In a case of doubt as to whether or not the complaint against the insured alleges a liability of the insurer under the policy, the doubt must be resolved in the insured\u2019s favor. 14 Couch, Insurance, 2d (rev ed), \u00a7 51:45, p 538 [now \u00a7 51:49, p 489].\u201d [Quoting <em>Detroit Edison Co v Michigan Mutual Ins Co, </em>102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Mich App 136, 141-142; 301 NW2d 832 (1980). Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Thus, the proper construction of the word \"suit,\u201d rejected today by the majority, comports with the well-established judicial practice of delineating the scope of the duty to defend by analyzing the complaint, which necessarily contemplates the filing of a lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">It is at least noteworthy, I suggest, that the plain, common-sense meaning that attaches today to the word \"suit\u201d has deep roots in the American jurisprudence. In 1821, Chief Justice Marshall considered the meaning of this word, which appears in the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Writing for the United States Supreme Court in the seminal decision <em>Cohens v Virginia, </em>19 US (6 Wheat) 264, 407-408; 5 L Ed 257 (1821), he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">What is a suit? We understand it to be the prosecution, or pursuit, of some claim, demand, or request. In law language, <em>it is the prosecution of some demand in a Court of justice. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\"><em>To commence a suit, is to demand something by the institution of process in a Court of justice; and to prosecute the suit, is, according to the common acceptance of language, to continue that demand. </em>By a suit commenced by an individual against a State, we should understand process sued out by that individual against the State, <em>for the purpose </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>of establishing some claim against it by the judgment of a Court; </em>and the prosecution of that suit is its continuance. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">To be sure, much has changed since 1821. However, despite the evolution and empowerment of administrative agencies, such as the epa and the dnr, the traditionally understood meaning of \"suit\u201d has not been altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">In this appeal, Bronson argues that an expansive interpretation of the term \"suit\u201d is justified because this Court \"has long recognized that coverage under an insurance policy must be determined on the basis of the reasonable expectations of the insured,\u201d citing <em>Zurich Ins Co v Rombough, </em>384 Mich 228; 180 NW2d 775 (1970).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This \"reasonable expectations\u201d argument is completely without merit as applied to the contract language here at issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">In <em>Rombough, </em>our Court quoted with approval from an opinion by Justice Tobriner, of the California Supreme Court, who wrote in <em>Gray v Zurich Ins Co, </em>65 Cal 2d 263, 269-270; 54 Cal Rptr 104; 419 P2d 168 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">In interpreting an insurance policy we apply the general principle that doubts as to meaning must be resolved against the insurer and that any exception to the performance of the basic underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>obligation must be so stated as to clearly apprise the insured of its effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">Although courts have long followed the basic precept that they would look to the words of the contract to find the meaning which the parties expected from them, they have also applied the doctrine of the adhesion contract to insurance policies, holding that in view of the disparate bargaining status of the parties we must ascertain the meaning of the contract which the insured would reasonably expect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In <em>Rombough, </em>however, this Court left no doubt that it found ambiguity in the terms of the policy under review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">The relationship between the exclusion clause (b) and \u00a7 11(a) of the policy results in some uncertainty as to the insurer\u2019s duties. ... It is elemental insurance law that ambiguous policy provisions must be construed against the insurance company and most favorably to the premium-paying insured. <em>[Id. </em>at 232.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">The policy of insurance involved in this case is sufficiently ambiguous to require [a] defense ... by [the insurance company]. <em>[Id. </em>at 234.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">While Bronson may be correct in asserting that this Court has \"recognized\u201d the reasonable expectations theory of insurance contract interpretation, it must be said, at least, that the scope and application of the concept has been the source of considerable controversy. In <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co v Ruuska, </em>412 Mich 321; 314 NW2d 184 (1982), the Court considered the meaning of a policy exclusion relating to \"non-owned automobiles.\u201d Justice Williams, joined by Justices Fitzgerald and Moody, opined that the clause was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>repugnant to the no-fault act and therefore void. Justice Levin disagreed with that reasoning, but concurred in the result on the ground that the exclusion was \"unconscionable and contrary to the reasonable expectations of an insured . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">As Justice Levin explained, the policy at one point stated that it covered the insured when she drove a \"non-owned\u201d automobile. However, in another section of the policy the term was defined to exclude an automobile owned by a relative residing in the same household and made available to the insured on a regular basis. Justice Levin observed that there \"is no evidence that [the insured] knew of the exclusion. . . . [I]t was not even contained in the list of exclusions but, rather, was embedded in the definition of a term which the average consumer would probably consider clear on its face . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Chief Justice Coleman, joined by Justices Kavanagh and Ryan, registered disagreement with the result and the reasoning of those holding the policy provision invalid. Finding it \"presumptuous to guess what the reasonable expectations of [the insured] may have been,\u201d she stated that she was not persuaded by the \"reasonable expectations\u201d argument, and added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">Although the exclusionary language was not ambiguous, the Court [of Appeals] said that it was not set forth obviously enough and so was unenforceable. The reasoning seems to be that because some people do not read the contracts they sign, even if exclusions are explained, the contracts are, in effect, void as to some parts but not as to others. <em>[Id. </em>at 353.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The division within the Court concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>reasonable expectations notion was further emphasized by release on the same day of the decision in <em>Raska v Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co, </em>412 Mich 355; 314 NW2d 440 (1982). Not only are the names of the two cases similar, but the issue, again, involved the validity of an \"owned vehicle\u201d exclusion in an automobile insurance policy. However, because the accident giving rise to the suit occurred before the no-fault act, compatibility with that legislation was not a question. In <em>Raska, </em>Justice Williams again wrote for those who would invalidate the exclusion; however, this time his reasoning was based on the reasonable expectations of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Referring to the particular language in question as \"a jigsaw-puzzle statement of coverage,\u201d Justice Williams explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">[C]overage is first announced as absolutely unlimited. There is no suggestion whatsoever of any limitation. On the other hand, if one turns to the back side of the page, it is true that there is a section entitled \"Exclusions\u201d and by a jigsaw-puzzle search and construction back and forth between the pages, a series of contradictory limitations can be affixed to the previously unlimited coverage. <em>[Id. </em>at 374-375.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Concluding that a reasonable expectation of coverage should not be defeated by the \"obscurant drafting\u201d of the policy, Justice Williams indicated that he would remand for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the insured reasonably expected coverage without the exclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 376. Although he was joined by Justices Levin and Moody, his opinion was a dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">A majority of the <em>Raska </em>Court, speaking through Justice Kavanagh, decided that the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>tract should be enforced as written. Joined by Chief Justice Coleman and Justices Fitzgerald and Ryan, Justice Kavanagh stated that \"[t]he only pertinent question ... is whether the exclusionary clause in this contract is ambiguous . . . .\u201d \"[I]f a contract, however inartfully worded or clumsily arranged, fairly admits of but one interpretation it may not be said to be ambiguous or, indeed, fatally unclear.\u201d He then added,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\">Plaintiffs also assert that as drafted the policy did not meet their \"reasonable expectations.\u201d Still the expectation that a contract will be enforceable other than according to its terms surely may not be said to be reasonable. <em>[Id. </em>at 362.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">More recently, in <em>Powers v DAIIE, </em>427 Mich 602; 398 NW2d 411 (1986), this Court consolidated and considered five cases, each of which challenged the validity of an \"owned vehicle\u201d exclusion in policies of no-fault insurance. Chief Justice Williams, once again, wrote an opinion for invalidation. Again, he exhaustively reviewed the history and rationale of the reasonable expectation theory, and concluded that \"in these cases, the policyholder, upon reading the contract language is led to a reasonable expectation of coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632. While it happened that a majority of the justices agreed with the result in <em>Powers, </em>once again, there was no majority support for the reasonable expectations rationale that, in part, under-girded the decision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Even if this Court had taken a different course and had embraced the reasonable expectations theory, such a turn would not support the result reached today by the majority.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As Justice Levin and Chief Justice Williams indicated in their writings, the rule primarily addresses concerns stemming from artful definitions, hidden exclusions, and structural arrangements in a contract drafted by the insurer that tend to obfuscate rather than clarify or enlighten the insured. There is nothing of that character or dimension to be found in the provision before us in this case. It is not an exclusion or exception to coverage. The language at issue is \"up front\u201d in the policy; there is no separate definition in another section of the contract; the terms are common, ordinary words, and they have been used in insurance contracts with the same meaning for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">I conclude, as did the <em>Raska </em>Court, that it is not reasonable for the insured in this case to expect that the contract will be enforced other than according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Bronson also argues that as early as 1913 this Court recognized that a \"suit\u201d is not limited to an action in a court of law. In <em>Patterson v Standard Accident Ins Co, </em>178 Mich 288; 144 NW 491 (1913), we were asked to determine the meaning of the word \"suit\u201d as that term was used in an automobile insurance policy. Bronson notes that in <em>Patterson </em>the Court referred to a suit as \"the mode or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>manner authorized and adopted by law to redress civil injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292. As Bronson sees it, an epa administrative proceeding under cercla commenced by a prp letter fits that definition. Embracing Bronson\u2019s view of <em>Patterson, </em>the majority suggests that \"by defining 'suit\u2019 broadly . . . the Court certainly left open the possibility that proceedings occurring outside the courtroom could be encompassed.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 570.1 disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The issue in <em>Patterson </em>was whether a \"suit,\u201d against which the insurer was obligated to defend, included a criminal prosecution or pertained only to civil actions for damages. Finding the word \"suits\u201d to mean \"civil suits which would determine the pecuniary liability of defendant for injury to person or property,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 293 (emphasis added), this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">It must be conceded that the word \"suit,\u201d as applied to legal controversies, both by the legal profession and others, is now used and recognized as a generic term of broad significance, often understood and used, even by legislatures and courts, <em>to designate almost any proceeding in a court, </em>even, though rarely, being applied to a criminal prosecution in certain connections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">[T]he expression \"criminal suit\u201d is unnatural and awkward to the professional ear and is seldom used, even in common parlance. \"Suit,\u201d in its general unqualified use in legal documents, such as the one before us, naturally means, and should be construed as intended to include, the mode or manner authorized and adopted by law to redress <em>civil </em>injuries. <em>[Id. </em>at 291-292. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">It is evident from the above-quoted passage that, while resolving the issue of the <em>type </em>of court proceedings contemplated by the term \"suit\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the particular contract, the <em>Patterson </em>Court necessarily found that the commencement of court proceedings is indispensable to the existence of a \"suit.\u201d Thus, rather than contradicting previous case law, as Bronson suggests, the conclusion that a prp letter does not constitute a suit is consistent with and supported by the reasoning set forth in <em>Patterson </em>more than eighty years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Although, as the Maine Supreme Court has observed, \"our role here is simply to determine the meaning of a private contract between these parties, not to foster or retard environmental goals,\u201d <em>Patrons Oxford Mutual Ins Co v Marois, </em>573 A2d 16, 17 (Me, 1990), I am not oblivious to the consequences that may flow from an epa notice letter. In view of the extraordinary authority vested in the epa through enactment by Congress of cercla, and the financial burdens that can befall a target of its scrutiny, anyone who receives such a letter would be foolish not to take it seriously. Still, that is not sufficient reason for a court to create new coverage and impose risks not assumed or paid for by the contracting parties.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">For the reasons stated, I conclude that the term \"suit\u201d in the context presented unambiguously refers to court proceedings instigated by the filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>of a complaint. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b729-4\">Brickley and Riley, JJ., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">ADDENDUM</p>\n<p id=\"AStg\">UNITED STATES</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</p>\n<p id=\"AIX\">REGION 5</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">230 SOUTH DEARBORN ST.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60604</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">REPLY TO THE ATTENTION OP 5HE-12</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">Certified mail</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">Return Receipt Requested</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">Re: North Bronson Industrial Area Bronson, Michigan</p>\n<p id=\"A59\">Dear Sir of [sic] Madam:</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">The United States Environmental Protection Agency (epa) has documented the release or threatened release of hazardous substances, pollutants and contaminants at the above-referenced site, and is planning to spend public funds to control and investigate these releases.
