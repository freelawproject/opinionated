We further hold that state statutes that provide new procedures or methods for collecting unpaid real property taxes are retroactively applicable. Consequently, we remand this case to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">This matter involves six consolidated tax collection suits initiated in 1989 by the plaintiff-appellant City of Detroit, to collect delinquent real property taxes owed by the defendants-appellees R. Terry Walker, Curtis Anderson, Superior Investment and Rental Corporation, Total Investment Company, Charles Smith, and Kenneth Al-mas, personally and as personal representative of the estate of Victor Almas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City of Detroit attempted to collect the debts by filing in personam lawsuits against the delinquent taxpayers, a remedy authorized by a 1988 amendment of the General Property Tax Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">On motion by the delinquent taxpayers, the trial court granted summary judgment in their favor. The trial court accepted the defendants\u2019 argument that pursuant to the holding in <em>Joy Management Co v </em>Detroit, 176 Mich App 722; 440 NW2d 654 (1989), the city was precluded by the provisions of the city charter from using any method of tax collection, other than the real property foreclosure method contained in art 8, \u00a7 8-403(6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A unani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>mous panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We thereafter granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">At the turn of the. century, a Michigan city\u2019s autonomy was inferior to a modern state agency. See <em>Streat v Vermilya, </em>268 Mich 1; 255 NW 604 (1934). For example, state lawmakers had the power to select local officers. In addition, state lawmakers modified city charters and made organizational changes to city departments. This interference perpetually fueled public resentment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AmX\">In 1908, constitutional convention delegates pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>posed and the Michigan voters approved the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-4\">The legislature shall provide by a general law for the incorporation of cities, and by a general law for the incorporation of villages; such general laws shall limit their rate of taxation for municipal purposes, and restrict their powers of borrowing money and contracting debts. [Const 1908, art 8, \u00a7 20.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">Under such general laws, the electors of each city and village shall have power and authority to frame, adopt and amend its charter and to amend an existing charter of the city or village heretofore granted or passed by the legislature for the government of the city or village and, through its regularly constituted authority, to pass all laws and ordinances relating to its municipal concerns, subject to the Constitution and general laws of this state. <em>[Id., </em>\u00a7 21.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">State lawmakers propelled by the Michigan Constitution and the power and authority conferred by it enacted the home rule cities act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The act, among other things, provides that each organized city shall be a body corporate and shall adopt mandatory charter provisions, and allows for other permissible charter provisions. The act also pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>vides for the revision of existing city charters and the creation of a charter commission, and defines the powers and duties of such a commission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The home rule cities act, MCL 117.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2071 <em>et seq., </em>specifically directs the City of Detroit and other home rule cities to enact charters recognizing the power to levy taxes; limiting the subject of ad valorem taxation for municipal purposes to the same subject of state, county, and school purposes under the general law; and setting a maximum rate of taxes. MCL 117.3(f), (g); MSA 5.2073(f), (g). Moreover, home rule cities have power to make all reasonable provisions for the collection of these taxes. <em>Detroit v Safety Investment Corp, </em>288 Mich 511, 515; 285 NW 42 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">The Michigan Constitution provides that \"[t]he provisions of this constitution and law concerning counties, townships, cities and villages shall be liberally construed in their favor.\u201d Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 34. It also provides that \"[n]o enumeration of powers granted to cities and villages in this constitution shall limit or restrict the general grant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>authority conferred by this section.\u201d Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Accordingly, it is clear that home rule cities enjoy not only those powers specifically granted, but they may also exercise all powers not expressly denied. Home rule cities are empowered to form for themselves a plan of government suited to their unique needs and, upon local matters, exercise the treasured right of self-governance. See Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 22.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Our municipal governance system has matured to one of general grant of rights and powers, subject only to certain enumerated restrictions instead of the earlier method of granting enumerated rights and powers definitely specified. The convention comment to the most recent amendment of the Michigan Constitution announces best the current relationship between municipalities and the state. It provides that \"a revision of Sec 21, Article VIII, of the present [1908] constitution <em>refects Michigan\u2019s successful experience with home rule.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Against this backdrop, we go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">The matter before us requires the construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>of a home rule city charter. The prevailing rules regarding statutory construction are well established and extend to the construction of home rule charters. <em>Brady v </em>Detroit, 353 Mich 243, 248; 91 NW2d 257 (1958). Therefore, we are required to construe the charter\u2019s language by its commonly accepted meaning as long as it does not produce absurdity, hardship, injustice, or prejudice to the drafters and ratifiers. <em>Reisman v Regents of Wayne State Univ, </em>188 Mich App 526, 536; 470 NW2d 678 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Here, we must determine whether \u00a7 8-403(1) of the Detroit City Charter incorporates by reference the provisions of state law, specifically the 1988 amendment of the General Property Tax Act that allows local governments to collect delinquent real property taxes by suing the taxpayer personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The Detroit City Charter, in its general powers section, directs that the specific mention of particular powers in the charter <em>shall </em>not be construed as a limitation of the powers of the city conferred by the constitution and state law, and that the powers of the city under the charter shall be construed liberally in favor of the city.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, several sections of the 1974 Detroit City Charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>incorporate by reference provisions of state law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nonetheless, in <em>Joy Management v Detroit, supra </em>at 733, the Court of Appeals held that art 8, \u00a7 8-403 of the Detroit City Charter only authorized a single means of collecting delinquent real property taxes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In <em>Joy Management, </em>the City of Detroit attempted to settle delinquent real property taxes by seizing fire insurance proceeds. The circuit court ruled that statutory law then in effect precluded seizure of insurance proceeds as intangibles.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals affirmed and went several steps further to conclude that the city\u2019s charter afforded merely one remedy for collecting unpaid real property taxes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-7\">Defendant\u2019s charter limits defendant\u2019s remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>to an action for foreclosure on the tax lien. Section 8-403 of the Detroit City Code provides that the city may bring a civil action to foreclose its lien two years after the city\u2019s lien on real property for delinquent city real property taxes accrues. The city\u2019s charter does not provide any other method for the city to collect delinquent real property taxes. Even if \u00a7 47 [MCL 211.47; MSA 7.91] were to allow the city treasurer to place a lien on insurance proceeds, defendant\u2019s own charter does not authorize it to do so. The General Property Tax Act does not apply to cities whose charters provide inconsistent provisions. MCL 211.107; MSA 7.161. <em>[Id. </em>at 733-734.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In the case before us, the Court of Appeals similarly held that the city\u2019s sole means of collecting delinquent real property taxes was by lien and foreclosure. Defendants argue that the Detroit City Charter\u2019s article 8, before its 1991 amendment, expressly provided that the sole remedy available to the City of Detroit to collect unpaid real property taxes was the lien foreclosure remedy. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">When the Detroit City Charter was adopted in 1974, the 1893 General Property Tax Act mentioned two methods to <em>enforce </em>and <em>collect </em>delinquent real property taxes. One was the lien foreclosure procedure set forth in MCL 211.61; MSA 7.105<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the other was the seizure and sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the taxpayer\u2019s personal property as set forth in MCL 211.47; MSA 7.91.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, at the time of the 1974 enactment, \u00a7 8-403(1) incorporated by reference the collection provisions of MCL 211.47; MSA 7.91 (seizure and sale of personal property) and the lien foreclosure method of MCL 211.61 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 7.105 <em>et seq., </em>\"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by [the] charter . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The Detroit City Charter language contained in art 8, \u00a7 8-403 is plain and unambiguous. The charter declares that state law regarding property tax collection applies unless the charter provides otherwise.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, in order to embrace defendants\u2019 positions, we would have to find that the City of Detroit deliberately precluded itself from exercising the broad powers granted by our Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Defendants suggest that the express inclusion of one procedure manifests exclusion of all others, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>and that that should be the reason why the city foreclosure method must be construed as being the sole remedy available to the city. Their arguments, however, fail because they ignore the language of the city charter and its instructive commentaries. The 1974 Charter Comments purposefully provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">Subsection 8-403(1) <em>incorporates by reference the provisions of state law for the collection and enforcement of property taxes. </em>As a result, it has been possible to eliminate 14 pages of procedural detail contained in chapter 4 of title 6 of the present charter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-7\">With respect to subsection 8-403(2), state law provides \"all taxes shall become a debt due to the . . . city\u201d on December 31st. See CL 1948 211.81, 211.2 and 211.13.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-8\">In two important respects, however, Detroit\u2019s law and procedure is different from, and preferable to, the law and procedure of the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-9\">First, there is no counterpart in state law for the right granted Detroit property taxpayers to pay in 2 installments. Second, state law permits the sale of liens for delinquent property taxes to private tax title speculators, often to the great prejudice of the owner whose taxes are delinquent. Because of the abuses that can result, the Detroit treasurer, for some years, has not sold to private persons the City\u2019s lien for delinquent City real property taxes but has collected those delinquent taxes himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-10\">Detroit\u2019s current practice on both these matters is retained in the new charter. [Final Report of the Detroit Charter Revision Comm, Commentary to Art 8, \u00a7 8-403, p 37. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">Moreover, defendants direct the Court to <em>Fink v Detroit, </em>124 Mich App 44; 333 NW2d 376 (1983), for the holding that a city charter takes priority over the General Property Tax Act. In <em>Fink, </em>the Court noted that the General Property Tax Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>applies only where it is consistent with respect to the charter provision involved. However, defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Fink </em>is clearly misplaced because the charter differs only with regard to the state\u2019s exhausting foreclosure sale procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Defendants further highlight <em>Fink, </em>for a semantic discourse on \"shall\u201d versus \"may\u201d as contained in \u00a7 8-403(6).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendants state with conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-7\">In examining the context of that term as used in the Charter, it is clear that the word \"may\u201d means \"shall.\u201d The Charter does not contain any other option for bringing an action to recover unpaid taxes. If any other action was available, it would have been specifically included in the original Charter. In this context, the word \"may\u201d was used to authorize the City to bring a civil action to foreclose upon its lien, as opposed to taking no action at all to foreclose. That was the option available to the City at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Defendants have engaged in a semantic war. However, such a battle is futile when the drafters\u2019 and ratifiers\u2019 intent is clear as it is here. The comments suggest no intention to exclude from the incorporation by reference of state law any provision for the collection of taxes other than portions of the lien foreclosure procedure of state law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Assuming arguendo, that the city charter in effect failed at the time the actions were filed to incorporate by reference the additional tax collection remedy, the city attempted to stop the hemorrhaging arguably caused by the loss of tax reve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>nue resulting from the <em>Joy Management </em>decision and other delinquent taxpayers like the defendants. Consequently, in 1991, the Detroit City Charter was amended to allow the city to maintain a personal action against a delinquent real property taxpayer.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">It is well settled by this Court that when an amendment is enacted soon after controversies arise regarding the meaning of the original act, \" 'it is logical to regard the amendment as a legislative interpretation of the original act ....\u201d\u2019 <em>Detroit Edison Co v Revenue Dep\u2019t, </em>320 Mich 506, 519-521; 31 NW2d 809 (1948), quoting 1 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (3d ed), \u00a7 1931, p 418. See also <em>People v Khoury, </em>437 Mich 954; 467 NW2d 810 (1991); <em>Detroit Edison Co v Janosz, </em>350 Mich 606, 613-614; 87 NW2d 126 (1957). In our case, the amendment of the Detroit City Charter clarifies what the drafters\u2019 and ratifiers\u2019 intent had been all along.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The Court of Appeals in the case at bar and <em>Joy Management</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was incorrect in its rulings. Each panel failed to give effect to the drafters\u2019 and ratifiers\u2019 intent. Each disregarded the express provisions that permit incorporation by reference, such as \u00a7 8-403(1). Moreover, the decisions ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>dered nugatory other provisions of the Detroit City Charter.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The general powers of a home rule city as expressed by \u00a7\u00a7 1-102 and 1-103 of the Detroit City Charter naturally adopt future amendments.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, the charter is the organic law of the City of Detroit, and, absent a clear declaration by its citizens to preclude provided by state law, we find that the 1974 Detroit City Charter incorporates by reference the tax collection remedies afforded by the General Property Tax Act and all future amendments of the act, including 1988 PA 202, MCL 211.47; MSA 7.91.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Defendants argue in the alternative that it is impermissible to retroactively apply 1988 PA 202 because the amendment creates a new right for plaintiff and creates a new liability for the defendants, i.e., personal liability for real property taxes where they did not exist before. The concern regarding the retroactivity of statutes arises from constitutional due process principles that prevent retrospective laws from divesting rights to property or vested rights, or the impairment of contracts. See, e.g., US Const, art I, \u00a7 10; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10. See also <em>Hansen-Snyder Co v General Motors Corp, </em>371 Mich 480; 124 NW2d 286 (1963); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>Stott v Stott Realty Co, </em>288 Mich 35; 284 NW 635 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In the case before us, defendants do not claim that the retroactive application of 1988 PA 202 injuriously affects any contractual obligations. Therefore, we assume that defendants allege that the retroactive application of this statutory amendment adversely affects some vested right. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">1. VESTED RIGHT</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">A vested right has been defined as an interest that the government is compelled to recognize and protect of which the holder could not be deprived without injustice. <em>Cusick v Feldpausch, </em>259 Mich 349, 352; 243 NW 226 (1932), citing 2 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (8th ed), p 749. Nonetheless, when determining whether a right is vested, policy considerations, rather than inflexible definitions must control, and we must consider whether the holder possesses what amounts to be a title interest in the right asserted. We explained in <em>Minty v Bd of State Auditors, </em>336 Mich 370, 390; 58 NW2d 106 (1953):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-8\">\"It would seem that a right cannot be considered a vested right, unless it is something more than such a mere expectation as may be based upon an anticipated continuance of the present general laws; it must have become a title, legal or equitable, to the present or future enjoyment of property, or to the present or future enforcement of a demand, or a legal exemption from a demand made by another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">See also <em>Wylie v Grand Rapids City Comm, </em>293 Mich 571, 587; 292 NW 668 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">In the case at bar, defendants suggest that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>new enforcement procedure creates a new liability and therefore infringes on a right deserving protection. As we articulated in <em>Minty, </em>the holder must have more than an expectation that the tax collection procedures would remain unchanged. Here, defendants would have us include within the realm of vested rights immunity from the retroactive operation of a tax collection procedure implemented to secure delinquent taxes owed to a municipality where there is no question that the amendment is not expanding the defendant\u2019s preexisting indebtedness. We refuse to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The underlying concern is that allowing in personam actions may affect the character of the <em>remedy </em>or the character of the <em>tax. </em>In this case, allowing an in personam action does not change the character of the tax because the amount of the tax itself has not been altered. The taxes assessed against defendants\u2019 property were never forgiven and then reinstated as a result of the new enforcement procedure. Quite the opposite. They are debts defendants elected not to pay. Thus, its character as a property tax has never been affected.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Today, as we have in the past, we refuse to make delinquent taxpayers immune from the imposition of statutory obligations. It is instructive to revisit our decision in <em>Detroit v Safety Investment, supra, </em>p 516, in which we discussed what tax collection was like before and after the enactment of the General Property Tax Act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 7.1 <em>et seq. </em>We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-6\">\"Under the old law, the prudent and honest men paid their taxes; <em>the careless and dishonest did not. </em>Under that system the prudent and honorable men paid more than their fair share of the public burdens. <em>[The General Property Tax Acf\\ was aimed to cure this evil, and should be liberally construed.\u201d </em>[288 Mich 516. Citation omitted; emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Property tax collection is essential to the eco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>nomic security and social stability of Detroit and other municipalities, as well as the state. As a matter of policy, it is imperative that taxpayers do not hide behind the facade of vested rights in an attempt to evade their financial responsibilities. As explained by one commentator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">Traditionally, the property tax \u2014 and in particular, the tax on real property \u2014 has been the mainstay of municipal revenue-gathering \u2014 the largest single source of municipal revenue. . . . But the property tax has numerous advantages that may keep it in use to a considerable extent: (1) Property, especially real property, is directly benefited by many municipal services, such as fire protection and garbage collection. Thus, there is a certain fairness in assessing the costs of these services on the basis of the value of property benefited thereby. (2) It is fairly easy to forecast in advance the amount of revenue that the real-property tax in a particular locality will produce, thus facilitating the budget process. (3) The real-property tax is not likely to be used by the federal government; it is thus one of the few potential sources of municipal income that is untapped by the U.S. government. And the full potential of the real-property tax has not been realized, since much urban property is assessed, and thus taxed, at substantially less than its current fair-market value. [Reynolds, Local Government Law, \u00a7 96, pp 291-293.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Recently, in <em>Taxpayers United v Detroit, </em>196 Mich App 463, 466; 493 NW2d 463 (1992), a Court of Appeals panel held that the retroactive revival of Detroit utility users tax is constitutional because the 1990 law did not create a novel tax. Plaintiffs were not assessed a retroactive fee for engaging in a voluntary act they might have forgone had they been aware of the tax. <em>Id. </em>at 468. The panel reasoned that the 1990 law did not violate the Due Process Clauses of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>States or Michigan Constitutions because it applied the same type and rate of tax to the same group of taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">Similarly, the tax collection method in the case before us is not a novel tax because it does not enlarge the preexisting tax debt. On the contrary, 1988 PA 202 is a procedural device to secure taxes owed. Defendants are not being taxed as a result of voluntary activities that they might have forgone had they been aware of the tax. Rather, had defendants elected to forgo the activities at issue in this case, namely, their refusal to pay property taxes, they would have ended up in exactly the same situation in which they now find themselves \u2014in short, paying their taxes.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">It is firmly established that there is no vested right in any particular procedure or remedy. See <em>Hanes &amp; Co v Wadey, </em>73 Mich 178, 181; 41 NW 222 (1889). Moreover, it is also well established that a taxpayer does not have a vested right in a tax statute or in the continuance of any tax law. <em>Ludka v Treasury Dep't </em>155 Mich App 250; 399 NW2d 490 (1986). See 6 Michigan Law &amp; Practice, Constitutional Law, \u00a7223, pp 248-249; 16A CJS, Constitutional Law, \u00a7 246, pp 49-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">For instance, in <em>Webster </em>v <em>Auditor General, </em>121 Mich 668; 80 NW 705 (1899), a provision of the General Property Tax Act of 1893 regarding the assessment, levy, and the return of land for delinquent taxes was amended. The dispute involved the retroactive operation of the interest added to delinquent taxes. The Court noted that a landowner has a duty to pay taxes and to pay them when they become due. The interest imposed on delinquent taxes serves multiple purposes, one of which is to encourage the timely payment of prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>erty taxes. Consequently, the Court held that one who owes delinquent taxes has no vested right to have the rate of interest thereon remain unchanged. <em>Id. </em>at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">In this action, 1988 PA 202 did not create, enlarge, diminish, or destroy contractual or vested rights. Rather, it implemented an additional enforcement mechanism that the city may use to effect its preexisting constitutional and statutory right to assess and collect city property taxes. Furthermore, because the procedure relates only to tax collection remedies or procedures, it does not fall within the general rule against retrospective operation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">The constitutional prohibition of the passage of retroactive laws refers only to retroactive laws that injuriously affect some substantial or vested right, and \"does not refer to those remedies adopted by a legislative body for the purpose of providing a rule to secure for its citizens the enjoyment of some natural right, equitable and just in itself, but which they were not able to enforce on account of defects in the law or its omission to provide the relief necessary to secure such right.\u201d <em>[Stott </em>at 46.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">In <em>Hansen-Snyder, </em>this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-9\">[Amendments of] statutes related to remedies or modes of procedure, which do not create new or take away vested rights, but only operate in furtherance of a remedy or confirmation of rights already existing, do not come within the legal conception of retrospective law, or the general rule against retrospective operation of statutes. <em>[Id. </em>at 485.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">In fact, statutes or amendments that relate only to procedure, prima facie apply to all actions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>have accrued as well as future actions, unless the amendment expressly provides otherwise. Stott, <em>supra </em>at 46. We acknowledge that generally the distinction between remedial procedures and the impairment of vested rights is difficult to draw. However, it is clear that defendants have no property or title interest in our state or local tax collection methods. A vested right may encompass many things, but this is not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Finally, although it is remedial, the retroactive reach of 1988 PA 202 has statutory limitations. MCL 600.5813; MSA 27A.5813 provides that personal actions not otherwise provided for are subject to a six-year limitation period. An in personam suit to collect real property taxes is clearly a personal action. See <em>Borden, Inc v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>391 Mich 495; 218 NW2d 667 (1974). Because an in personam suit to collect delinquent real property taxes becomes a personal action, we also find that the general six-year limitation statute applies. <em>In re Atkinson Estate, </em>305 Mich 323; 9 NW2d 588 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Our decision today affirms the integrity of not only the City of Detroit\u2019s charter, but Michigan statutory law as well.

See <em>Grand Rapids v Lake Shore &amp; M S R Co, </em>130 Mich 238; 89 NW 932 (1902), and <em>Weber v Detroit, </em>158 Mich 149; 122 NW 570 (1909). However, those cases are easily distinguishable from the case before us. Both are the progeny of <em>Mogg v Hall, </em>83 Mich 576; 47 NW 553 (1890). In <em>Mogg, </em>certain parcels owned by the plaintiff had been assessed. The Duplain Township treasurer in 1884 sought to recover delinquent taxes for drain assessments. At the time, the drain law of 1881 was in effect and did not contain any provision \"making the drain tax a personal claim against the owner of land,\u201d but instead declared a failure to pay taxes due to constitute a lien on the land, and provided for a sale of the land in case of nonpayment. <em>Id. </em>at 580. To eliminate any doubt, the Court noted that the 1885 drain law expressly stated that an in personam action to collect taxes was permissible, thereby curing a defect in the 1881 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Similar to <em>Mogg, </em>in <em>Grand Rapids </em>and <em>Weber, </em>personal liability was attached to the taxpayer after the taxes had been assessed. At the time of <em>Grand Rapids, Weber, </em>and <em>Mogg, </em>neither the pertinent tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>law nor the charter regarding the assessments under review authorized in personam actions or stated that personal liability attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Moreover, any reliance on those cases is tenuous at best, because each case lacked a substantive analysis of why a tax on land cannot be transformed into a personal obligation. Nevertheless, the law has come a long way since <em>Mogg, </em>and today, personal liability attaches the moment taxes are assessed. In <em>Gilken Corp v Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>176 F2d 141, 143-144 (CA 6, 1949), the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit decided that, under Michigan law, the real and personal property taxes assessed before the taxpayer acquired title or possession were the personal liability of the taxpayer\u2019s vendor. The court looked to the Detroit City Charter, \u00a7 8-403(2) \" 'all city taxes shall become a debt\u2019 \u201d language and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-10\">We cannot accept as valid the argument of petitioner that Michigan realty taxes are exclusively in rem and that there is no personal liability for them. We think the contrary to be true. [See] <em>Gulf Refining Co v Perry, </em>303 Mich 487, 490; 6 NW2d 756 (1942).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">In <em>Gulf Refining, </em>we stated that despite the defendant having had a mortgage foreclosed, and the mortgagee\u2019s title, having subsequently become absolute: \"The tax assessment against defendants Perry [concerning <em>real </em>property] was a debt due from them to the city of Lansing. Perry\u2019s <em>personal </em>property was subject to seizure and sale for the amount of the tax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\"> In other words, they pay their taxes, either voluntarily or by being subject to an in personam collection action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Riley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aotx\">I respectfully dissent for several reasons. First and foremost, there exists binding authority for the proposition that changes in the method of tax collection that alter the nature of collection from an in rem to an in personam action are unconstitutional to the extent that they apply retroactively, i.e., to taxes previously assessed. Second, statutes governing the collection of taxes are to be strictly construed with all doubts to be construed in favor of the taxpayer. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertions, the 1974 charter provisions at issue are far from clear on the issue whether the charter provides for, or even preserves the right to utilize, methods of tax collection other than the judicial sale method provided in charter \u00a7 8-403. In fact, I am persuaded that the clear intent of the charter\u2019s ratifiers was to limit the method of tax collection to the judicial sale set forth in \u00a7 8-403. Third, careful analysis of the historical backdrop provides, if implicitly, a strong policy reason for limiting plaintiff\u2019s tax collection powers. Although this Court\u2019s inquiry could more appropriately be decided without resort to policy arguments, I offer a plausible reason for the ratifiers\u2019 intent to limit plaintiff\u2019s tax collection powers. Thus, the language at issue is ambiguous at best. In turn, resort to a construction in favor of the taxpayer is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">It is important to understand the history and the mechanics of the tax lien in the area of real property law. The first step is to distinguish real and personal property taxes from other forms of taxation such as the excise tax. Property taxes are assessments on real and personal property within a specific territory, measured in proportion to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>value, and whose obligation for payment is absolute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In contrast, an excise tax is a \"privilege\u201d tax that is not imposed <em>directly </em>upon persons or property,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but that is instead levied on activities that are voluntarily assumed to the degree to which the privilege is exercised.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, it has generally been said that property taxes burden the property assessed, but do not constitute personal debts of an individual in the ordinary sense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">A taxpayer\u2019s proportionate share of debt for the general revenue is secured only by property owned at the time a lien attaches and only on property located within the taxing district.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>To be sure, the taxing legislature may secure the payment of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>linquent taxes with real or personal property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, a line of demarcation has been drawn between the right of seizure and sale of real or personal property and a personal obligation for taxes that permits a lawsuit for the collection of delinquent taxes, i.e., an in personam action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While some states permit in personam actions for the collection of delinquent tax liability,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the general rule indicates that no personal action will lie against a delinquent taxpayer at law or in equity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As one author has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-5\">Generally, . . . the rule developed that <em>in the absence of an explicit statutory provision, no personal action will lie to recover property taxes. </em>These holdings are grounded on the theory that taxes are not debts, or in the view that since the statute provides only for proceedings <em>in rem, </em>personal liability is not imposed. [Hellerstein, State and Local Taxation (3d ed), p 702. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Another source provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>In the absence of constitutional restrictions, the legislature has plenary power to make any change in the method of collecting taxes, <em>but the amendment ... of a statute providing for the levy and collection of taxes will not operate retrospectively so as to affect unpaid taxes already due or pending proceedings for their collection </em>....

Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Before turning to specific state law on the issues involved, it is instructive to review certain other general propositions that arise in this context. First, laws on taxation must be strictly construed, with any ambiguities to be decided in favor of the taxpayer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, statutes creating tax liens are not to be enlarged by construction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, the method of collection that is prescribed by statute (or charter) is generally the exclusive method.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">This Court had the opportunity to address a similar issue nearly a century ago. In <em>Grand Rapids v Lake Shore &amp; M S R Co, </em>130 Mich 238; 89 NW 932 (1902), the Court was called on to determine whether an amendment of a city charter providing for personal liability could be applied to taxes for improvements to real property that had already been assessed. Six justices agreed that a change in collection methods from in rem to in personam could not apply retroactively. See also <em>Weber v Detroit, </em>158 Mich 149; 122 NW 570 (1909) (a property owner could not be made personally liable for a special assessment tax created at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>time when the city charter provided for enforcement only against real property).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The majority attempts to avoid this precedent although it is dispositive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Whether plaintiff reserved the right to seize personal property in the applicable sections of the 1974 charter is the subject of later argument, but it cannot be gainsaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>that the procedure described in \u00a7 8-403 is in the nature of an in rem proceeding.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">The Legislature amended MCL 211.47; MSA 7.91 to permit the filing of in personam actions against delinquent taxpayers by way of 1987 PA 177 and 1988 PA 202.

In light of the fact that the only evidence of intent specifically dealing with the collection of delinquent taxes evinces the desire to limit its power, I cannot agree with the majority that the broad reservation-of-rights clauses permit retroactive application of the in personam action.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">The most basic rule of statutory construction<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> is that the intent of the Legislature is to be followed. <em>Town &amp; Country Dodge, Inc v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>420 Mich 226, 240; 362 NW2d 618 (1984). Of equal importance to this case is the rule that a state may impose a tax only if it is expressly authorized by law. The authority to tax may not be inferred or extended by implication. <em>Molter v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>443 Mich 537, 543; 505 NW2d 244 (1993); <em>Michigan Allied Dairy Ass\u2019n v State Bd of Tax Administration, </em>302 Mich 643, 650; 5 NW2d 516 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>(1942); <em>In re Dodge Bros, </em>241 Mich 665, 669; 217 NW 777 (1928); <em>Triangle Land Co v Detroit, </em>204 Mich 442, 455; 170 NW 549 (1919); 3A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (5th ed), \u00a7 66.01, p l.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In addition, ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Dodge Bros, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> A </em>specific remedy provided as the proper method of tax collection precludes the use of any other collection method unless specifically provided for. <em>Bankers Trust Co of Detroit v Russell, </em>270 Mich 568, 571-572; 259 NW 328 (1935).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Changing the nature of tax collection from in rem to in personam affects substantive rights. See <em>ante, </em>pp 707-709. Furthermore, tax collection provisions are to be strictly construed against the taxing authority.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In my opinion, the language of the charter is clear on the point that plaintiff advocated a single method of tax collection and requires affirming the decision of the Court of Appeals. See <em>Town &amp; Country Dodge, supra. </em>Even if the intent of the drafters and ratifiers is ambiguous, the great weight of authority requires a construction that favors the taxpayer. See <em>Molter, Michigan Allied Dairy Ass\u2019n, In re Dodge Bros, Triangle Land Co, </em>and 3A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction, <em>supra. </em>Despite the existence of several reservation-of-rights clauses, the charter provides for a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>method collection and obligates courts to construe it as the exclusive method. <em>Bankers Trust Co of Detroit, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">A final question that the majority fails to address is why plaintiff would forgo the method of judicial sale provided in charter provision \u00a7 8-403 for nearly two decades and at a time when the real property subject to taxation was worth significantly more than the escalating delinquent tax liability.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The fact that the instant lawsuits were filed <em>after </em>the 1987 and 1988 amendments of MCL 211.47; MSA 7.91 appears to indicate that plaintiff gave no thought to the possibility of an in personam action pursuant to its discretionary powers under the home rule cities act<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> until \u00a7 47 of the General Property Tax Act was amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>I am unaware of any evidence, outside the language of the charter itself, that explains the intent either of the charter\u2019s drafters or its ratifiers on the issue whether plaintiff was entitled to utilize in personam methods of tax collection until this option was specifically adopted in the 1991 amendments of the charter. The majority presumes that the broad reservation-of-rights language in the preamble and in other areas of the charter, together with latent policy arguments that are not well defined in the majority\u2019s opinion, entitles plaintiff to a judgment in its favor. In contrast, I am aware of another possibility that may explain why the drafters and the ratifiers of the 1974 charter failed to provide for in personam liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">In the late 1960s and early 1970s, large urban areas experienced an alarming exodus of residents and businesses<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> that eroded their tax bases. Moreover, abandonment of property located within the city limits, and the inherent social evils that are thought to naturally follow, reached crisis levels.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The City of Detroit was no exception.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It is not outside the realm of possibility that the drafters and ratifiers of the 1974 charter had this in mind when the charter was enacted. The imposition of in personam liability for delinquent taxes, which would allow plaintiff to attach a new set of assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>that includes <em>intangibles </em>such as bank accounts and even wage garnishment for the first time, may be an attractive method of tax collection today.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> However, the hint of this form of liability at the time when the 1974 charter was enacted could have had a disastrous effect on continued investment in real property located within city limits, which would have taken the form of even more widespread abandonment than actually occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">In the least, the foregoing analysis constitutes a plausible formulation of the drafters\u2019 and ratifiers\u2019 intent where there is little else to guide us. The fact that the ratifiers specifically abdicated one state right to protect real property owners, i.e., the right to sell land to title speculators, underscores the validity of this point. Thus, it is not possible to validly claim that the ratifiers\u2019 intent on this narrow question, as evidenced by the language of \u00a7 8-403, only permits a single conclusion: that plaintiff had not only the authority to reserve such a right, but also that it clearly did so. At best, the intent that the majority attributes to the charter provision is ambiguous. Accordingly, construction against the taxing authority is in order pursuant to longstanding precedent. See <em>In re Dodge Bros, supra; </em>note 10 and accompanying text, <em>ante, </em>p 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">In conclusion, I cannot agree with the majority that plaintiff somehow preserved its right to retroactively assert in personam liability for delinquent taxes. I am convinced that the home rule cities act does not afford this degree of discretion, which would flout established constitutional principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>and rules of construction. Moreover, I believe that the majority is allowing present concerns and policies to guide its conclusion when the appropriate form of inquiry demands attention to the political and economic climate at the time of the charter\u2019s ratification. Accordingly, I conclude that plaintiff is entitled to collect delinquent taxes through a personal action only for taxes assessed after the 1991 amendment of the city charter.</p>\n<judges id=\"b852-5\">Levin and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-5\"> 71 Am Jur 2d, State and Local Taxation, \u00a7 24, p 358.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-6\"> <em>Id., </em>\u00a728, pp 360-361.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-7\"> <em>Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 28-29, pp 360-362.

However, Justice Cooley notes inherent problems with the taxation of personal property.

In <em>Hansen-Snyder Co v General Motors Corp, </em>371 Mich 480; 124 NW2d 286 (1963), <em>ante, </em>p 698, this Court treated the extension of a lien filing date as procedural. However, the nature of the remedy, i.e., a mechanic\u2019s lien to secure payment for materials and services supplied, was unchanged. <em>Stott v Stott Realty Co, </em>288 Mich 35; 284 NW 635 (1939), <em>ante, </em>p 699, involved a corporate privilege tax rather than a real property tax, which, as provided earlier, varies with the level of prescribed activity. See also <em>Taxpayers United v Detroit, </em>196 Mich App 463, 466; 493 NW2d 463 (1992), <em>ante, </em>p 702 (utility tax), and <em>Ludka v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>155 Mich App 250; 399 NW2d 490 (1986), <em>ante, </em>p 703 (income tax). <em>Hanes &amp; Co v Wadey, </em>73 Mich 178, 181; 41 NW 222 (1889), <em>ante, </em>p 703, concerned a lienholder\u2019s inability to use the previously mandated form of lien collection, i.e., the amendment of a statute did not retroactively preserve the old method of collection that was more favorable to the lienholder. It had nothing to do with the retroactive application of a new form of tax collection. In <em>Webster </em>v <em>Auditor General, </em>121 Mich 668; 80 NW 705 (1899), <em>ante, </em>p 703, this Court unanimously agreed that a change in the interest rate charged for delinquent taxes as a condition to redemption before judicial sale could be applied retroactively. Because the choice to redeem was discretionary, property owners were not obligated to pay the interest charge or the increase. Moreover, it is clear that the purpose of the increase was to defray the costs incurred by seizing real property for delinquent taxes only to have the property redeemed before sale. <em>Id. </em>at 671. Thus, the purpose was to ensure recoupment of costs incurred in the judicial sale process rather than secure payment of the delinquent tax liability through the use of a new form of collection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b843-5\"> See <em>Detroit v O\u2019Connor, </em>302 Mich 531, 535; 5 NW2d 453 (1942) (tax foreclosure proceedings under the existing city charter were in rem actions); <em>Thompson v Auditor General, </em>261 Mich 624, 649, 657; 247 NW 360 (1933). See also <em>United States v Michigan, </em>346 F Supp 1277, 1280 (ED Mich, 1972) (\"The law in Michigan is explicit in stating that the enforcement of an <em>ad valorem </em>tax is an <em>in rem </em>proceeding against the property rather than the owner\u201d). There are cases that may be cited for the proposition that city taxes are personal to the landowner. While this is true, it does not support the proposition that actions to collect delinquent taxes are in personam in nature. For example, in <em>Gulf Refining Co v Perry, </em>303 Mich 487; 6 NW2d 756 (1942), this Court stated that a tax assessment was a debt due to the City of Lansing for which the defendants were responsible. However, the Court went on to indicate that collection was to be had under a state law permitting seizure and sale of personal property. Clearly, the case involves an action for distress and sale of personal property, which is not the same as an in personam action.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">In <em>Gilken Corp </em>v <em>Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>176 F2d 141, 143 (CA 6, 1949), the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit noted that the existing Detroit City Charter \" 'makes the tax a debt of the owner . . . .\u2019\u201d However, that case involved the question who is entitled to an exemption for the payment of state taxes under federal tax law. In other words, the case had nothing to do with the nature of the debt or the assets securing it.

While an 1885 amendment of the relevant statute may have \"cured\u201d the defect, even a casual reading of <em>Mogg </em>only permits a single conclusion: the \"cure\u201d could not be applied retroactively.

There is no indication that the city asserted in personam liability of the plaintiff in <em>Joy Management.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\"> See, generally, Cisneros, <em>Interwoven Destinies: Cities and the Nation, </em>in Interwoven Destinies: Cities and the Nation (New York: Norton &amp; Co, 1993) (Cisneros, ed), pp 20, 25; Ginzberg, <em>The Changing Urban Scene: 1960-1990 and Beyond, </em>pp 33-44; Kasarda, <em>Cities as places where people live and work: Urban change and neighborhood distress, </em>pp 81-83, 87, 90-91, and the tables that follow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b850-8\"> See, generally, comment, <em>Property abandonment in Detroit, </em>20 Wayne L R 845 (1974), and authorities cited therein.
