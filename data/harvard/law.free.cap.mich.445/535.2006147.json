We conclude that it does not. Moreover, we find that defendant failed to preserve the error for appellate review. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Defendant was charged and thereafter convicted of first-degree murder<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> following a jury trial. The trial court sentenced defendant to mandatory life without parole for the murder conviction and to a two-year term for the felony-firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Before trial, defendant gave notice of his intent to assert the defenses of legal insanity and diminished capacity. By order of the court, defendant\u2019s competence to waive his Miranda<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rights was assessed by a clinical psychologist. Later, defendant moved the court for the appointment of an independent psychiatrist to determine his criminal responsibility and the possibility of diminished capacity at the time of the killing. Defendant asserted a combination of longstanding mental problems, which allegedly included the hearing of voices that told him what to do, and drug and alcohol abuse on the date of the killing constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>legal insanity or, at the least, a diminished capacity that negated the intent element of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Immediately preceding jury voir dire on the first day of trial, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his confession for lack of capacity to understand his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Next, the prosecutor reminded the court that defendant had filed a notice of insanity defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>court incorporated this possibility in its voir dire of the jury. After the prosecution rested its case and the court denied a motion for directed verdict, defense counsel indicated defendant\u2019s intent to testify regarding the defenses of legal insanity or diminished capacity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant testified to long-term drug abuse, to hearing voices during stressful periods, and to having ingested drugs and alcohol on the date of the shooting.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">In rebuttal, the prosecutor offered the testimony of the clinical psychologist who had conducted the independent examination of defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility or diminished capacity. After the close of proofs, the court instructed the jury regarding intoxication as a defense to a specific intent crime,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> mental illness,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> mental retardation,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>legal insanity,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a mixture of intoxication and mental illness or retardation as a defense,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the guilty but mentally ill verdict.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The instructions were in substantial compliance with the applicable Michigan Criminal Jury Instructions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A unanimous jury convicted defendant of first-degree murder and of illegal possession of a firearm during a felony._</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Defendant appealed his conviction on two grounds. First, he asserted that the failure to give a preliminary jury instruction on insanity was error requiring reversal. Second, he alleged error in the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for directed verdict concerning whether he could be guilty of first-degree murder where his own confessions, the only direct evidence offered on the point, could not establish an intent to rob the decedent before the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Relying on the mandatory language of MCL 768.29a(1); MSA 28.1052(1)(1) and on <em>People v Mikulin, </em>84 Mich App 705; 270 NW2d 500 (1978), the Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction because of the trial court\u2019s failure to give a preliminary jury instruction on the issue of insanity. The Court of Appeals also held that defendant\u2019s second issue did not \"independently require reversal.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Unpublished opinion per curiam, decided May 12, 1993 (Docket No. 138577).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">This Court granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">MCL 768.29a(1); MSA 28.1052(1)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-11\">If the defendant asserts a defense of insanity in a criminal action which is tried before a jury, <em>the judge shall, before testimony is presented on that issue, instruct the jury on the law </em>as contained in [MCL 330.1400a; MSA 14.800(400a)] and [MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>330.1500(g); MSA 14.800(500)(g)[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] and in [MCL 768.21a; MSA 28.1044(1)] of chapter 8 of this act. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Clearly, this statutory language directs our courts to instruct on the definitions of mental illness, mental retardation, and legal insanity immediately <em>before </em>the commencement of testimony on insanity in a jury trial. See <em>Achtenberg v East Lansing, </em>421 Mich 765, 770; 364 NW2d 277 (1985) (\"When the language of a statute is clear, courts must apply it as written\u201d). Furthermore, use of the term \"shall\u201d rather than \"may\u201d indicates mandatory rather than discretionary action. <em>Browder v Int\u2019l Fidelity Ins Co, </em>413 Mich 603, 612 and n 7; 321 NW2d 668 (1982); <em>Matheson v Secretary of State, </em>170 Mich App 216, 219; 428 NW2d 31 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">It cannot be gainsaid that the purpose behind MCL 768.29a(1); MSA 28.1052(1)(1) is other than to establish the framework of an insanity defense in the minds of the jury <em>before </em>testimony begins, in light of the highly technical and esoteric nature of testimony, especially expert testimony, that often obtains in matters of insanity. The statute\u2019s clear language evidences the purpose to ensure that the preliminary instruction is given in all cases and not simply when a trial court believes that it would be useful. See <em>Achtenberg, Browder </em>and <em>Matheson, supra. </em>Indeed, the mandatory nature of the preliminary instruction language has already been recognized. See <em>People v Cramer, </em>201 Mich App 590, 593; 507 NW2d 447 (1993); <em>People v Girard, </em>96 Mich App 594, 596; 293 NW2d 639 (1980); <em>Mikulin, supra </em>at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">Accordingly, we agree with the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>that the failure to give the preliminary instruction on insanity was error regardless of defendant\u2019s failure to request it. In fact, the prosecutor does not argue that this did not constitute some form of error. However, whether this error required automatic reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction as the Court of Appeals held is another question.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We conclude that the failure to give a preliminary instruction on insanity does not require automatic reversal for several reasons. First, automatic reversal would come into direct conflict with MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096, which orders that judgments or verdicts shall not be reversed absent a miscarriage of justice. Automatic reversal would presume a miscarriage of justice, and this presumption is far from evident in the terms of MCL 768.29a(1); MSA 28.1052(1)(1). Second, other important concerns such as proper <em>final </em>instructions to the jury are the subject of harmless-error analysis and are therefore <em>not </em>susceptible to automatic reversal.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Absent a clear legislative directive, we cannot consider the preliminary jury instruction involved here to avoid the more generalized requirement that no judgment or verdict may be reversed absent a miscarriage of justice. Third, rules of automatic reversal are disfavored. <em>People v Mosko, </em>441 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Mich 496, 502-503; 495 NW2d 534 (1992). Finally, the error at issue in this case does not resemble cases that have historically been the subject of automatic reversal in the federal system. Thus, we are unable to discern any state or federal basis for treating errors surrounding MCL 768.29a(1); MSA 28.1052(1)(1) any differently than the myriad of trial errors subject to harmless error analysis. For these reasons, we overrule the <em>Mikulin </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Guidelines for correcting trial errors are described in three places: MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096, MCR 2.613, and MRE 103(a) and (d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The specific terms differ in each source, and courts appear to have used them interchangeably. It is therefore important to determine whether there are any substantive differences in the terms as used.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">No judgment or verdict shall be set aside or reversed or a new trial be granted by any court of this state in any criminal case, on the ground of misdirection of the jury, or the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or for error as to any matter of pleading or procedure, unless in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a <em>miscarriage of justice. </em>[Emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Similarly, MCR 2.613(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">An error in the admission or the exclusion of evidence, an error in a ruling or order, or an error or defect in anything done or omitted by the court or by the parties is not ground for granting a new trial, for setting aside a verdict, or for vacating, modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take this action appears to the court <em>inconsistent with substantial justice. </em>[Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Finally MRE 103, which applies only to evidentiary matters, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">(a) Effect of erroneous ruling. Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a <em>substantial right </em>of the party is affected, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">(1) Objection. In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context; or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">(2) Offer of proof. In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">(d) Plain error. Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting <em>substantial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>rights </em>although they were not brought to the attention of the trial court. [Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Clearly, only MRE 103 specifically addresses the concept of issue preservation. However, the courts of this state have long recognized the importance of preserving issues for the purpose of appellate review. As a general rule, issues that are not properly raised before a trial court cannot be raised on appeal absent compelling or extraordinary circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Napier v Jacobs, </em>429 Mich 222, 235; 414 NW2d 862 (1987) (failure to raise a claim of insufficiency of the evidence); <em>Moskalik v Dunn, </em>392 Mich 583, 592; 221 NW2d 313 (1974) (failure to object to an erroneous jury instruction); <em>People v DerMartzex, </em>390 Mich 410, 416-417; 213 NW2d 97 (1973) (failure of the defendant to request a limiting instruction on admissibility of prior-acts evidence); <em>People v Farmer, </em>380 Mich 198, 208; 156 NW2d 504 (1968) (failure to raise the issue of the involuntariness of a confession). Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has recognized a state\u2019s right to develop procedural rules that lead to issue forfeiture even where the procedural rules implicate constitutional protections if the rules serve a legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>state interest. <em>Henry v Mississippi, </em>379 US 443; 85 S Ct 564; 13 L Ed 2d 408 (1965).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">As alluded to previously, this preservation rule is not without exceptions. For example, appellate courts will consider claims of constitutional error for the first time on appeal when the alleged error could have been decisive of the outcome. See, e.g., <em>People v Degraffenreid, </em>19 Mich App 702, 716; 173 NW2d 317 (1969); <em>People v Merchant, </em>86 Mich App 355, 358; 272 NW2d 656 (1978); <em>People v Catey, </em>135 Mich App 714, 722; 356 NW2d 241 (1984); <em>People v Bushard, </em>444 Mich 384, 439; 508 NW2d 745 (1993) (opinion of Brickley, J.). However, the instant case does not involve a constitutional right. Rather, it is concerned with the violation of a statutory provision requiring a trial court to give a preliminary instruction to the jury immediately preceding the submission of insanity testimony. See MCL 768.29a(1); MSA 28.1052(1)(1). We now turn to the questions whether the unpreserved, nonconstitutional plain error in this case may nonetheless be considered as an exception to the preservation rule, and if so, whether reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The federal courts\u2019 approach to nonconstitutional plain error, especially in regard to the subject of issue preservation, is highly instructive. A recent pronouncement of the federal standard for unpreserved, nonconstitutional error is found in <em>United States v Olano, </em>507 US \u2014; 113 S Ct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>1770; 123 L Ed 2d 508, 519-520 (1993).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <em>Olano, </em>the majority distinguished FR Crim P 52(a), regarding preserved harmless error, from rule 52(b), plain, unpreserved error.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">When the defendant has made a timely objection to an error and Rule 52(a) applies, the Court of Appeals normally engages in a specific analysis of the District Court record \u2014 a so-called \"harmless error\u201d inquiry \u2014 to determine whether the error was prejudicial. <em>Rule 52(b) normally requires the same kind of inquiry, with one important difference: It is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice. In most cases, the Court of Appeals cannot correct the forfeited error unless the defendant shows that the error was prejudicial. [Id., </em>123 L Ed 2d 519-520. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">On the issue whether a specific, unpreserved, nonconstitutional plain error could be addressed by an appellate court in light of possible forfeiture, the <em>Olano </em>Court developed a three-step test.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">The first limitation on appellate authority under Rule 52(b) [plain, unpreserved error] is that there indeed be an \"error.\u201d Deviation from a legal rule is \"error\u201d unless the rule has been waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">The second limitation on appellate authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>under Rule 52(b) is that the error be \"plain.\u201d \"Plain\u201d is synonymous with \"clear\u201d or, equivalently, \"obvious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">The third and final limitation on appellate authority ... is that the plain error \"affec[t] substantial rights.\u201d This is the same language employed in Rule 52(a), and <em>in most cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the . . . proceedings. [Id., </em>123 L Ed 2d 518-519. Emphasis added; citations omitted.][<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The <em>Olano </em>majority concluded that the presence of alternate jurors did not affect substantial rights <em>independent </em>of any prejudicial effect and that there was neither a specific showing of prejudice nor a reason to presume any prejudice. <em>Id., </em>123 L Ed 2d 521-522. Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim was held to have been forfeited, which prevented the need for a determination whether reversal was required. Moreover, <em>Olano </em>clearly placed the burden of proving the prejudice of a plain forfeited error on the appealing party because the grant of relief under FR Crim P 52(b) is permissive rather than mandatory. See <em>id., </em>123 L Ed 2d 520.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Presuming that the test for avoiding forfeiture is met, the <em>Olano </em>majority provided a separate test for reversal: a federal appellate court may reverse a plain forfeited error (1) where a miscarriage of justice would result because the defendant is actu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>ally innocent or (2) if the error \"seriously affects\u201d the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Id, 123 L Ed 2d 521. It is important to note that the specific language of the federal rules themselves, and of the <em>Olano </em>majority\u2019s formulation from earlier precedent, make no distinction between constitutional and nonconstitutional error. Accordingly, we conclude that it is the forfeiture aspect and not the actual constitutional status that drives the federal standard.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The rationale underlying the distinction between preserved and unpreserved error is strongly supported by history as well as by policy. At the beginning of this century, legislative reformers around the country advocated the adoption of the harmless error doctrine in response to an ever-increasing number of reversals in criminal cases on the basis of perceived minor errors occurring at trial.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Many years ago, Dean Pound stated that \"[njothing is so subversive of the real purposes of legal procedure as individual vested rights in procedural errors . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> More recently, writing for the majority in <em>United States v Mechanik, </em>475 US 66, 72; 106 S Ct 938; 89 L Ed 2d 50 (1986), Justice Rehnquist stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The reversal of a conviction entails substantial social costs: it forces jurors, witnesses, courts, the prosecution, and the defendants to expend further time, energy, and other resources to repeat a trial that has already once taken place; victims may be asked to relive their disturbing experiences. The \"[p]assage of time, erosion of memory, and dispersion of witnesses may render retrial difficult, even impossible.\u201d Thus, while reversal \"may, in theory, entitle the defendant only to retrial, in practice it may reward the accused with complete freedom from prosecution,\u201d and thereby \"cost the society the right to punish admitted offenders.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">A forfeiture rule, then, serves the important \" 'need to encourage all trial participants to seek a fair and accurate trial the first time around ....\u2019\u201d <em>United States v Young, </em>470 US 1, 15; 105 S Ct 1038; 84 L Ed 2d 1 (1985), quoting <em>United States v Frady, </em>456 US 152, 163; 102 S Ct 1584; 71 L Ed 2d 816 (1982).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> See also <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433, 446; 94 S Ct 2357; 41 L Ed 2d 182 (1974) (\"[T]he law does not require that a defendant receive a perfect trial, only a fair one\u201d). Accordingly, the United States Supreme Court has recognized the importance of an incentive for criminal defendants to raise objections at a time when the trial court has an opportunity to correct the error, which could thereby obviate the necessity of further legal proceedings and would be by far the best time to address a defendant\u2019s constitutional and nonconstitutional rights. Failure to timely raise error thus requires defendants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>establish prejudice in order to avoid the forfeiture of an issue.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">We now turn to an analysis of the appropriate state standard for assessment of unpreserved, non-constitutional plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Review of state law on the issue of harmless error leads us to the conclusion that the distinction between issue preservation and harmless error has not been clearly defined.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We are persuaded that <em>Olano, </em>which first requires assessing the merits of an issue presented for the first time on appeal, is instructive in this regard. As in <em>Olano, </em>in this case there was error and it was plain, to wit: the violation of the statute mandating that a preliminary jury instruction on insanity be given before testimony on insanity. Although defendant failed to properly request the instruction, the language of MCL 768.29a(1); MSA 28.1052(1)(1) does not require a defendant to make a specific request. The question then becomes whether the error affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The <em>Olano </em>majority defined the term \" 'affect[ing] substantial rights\u2019 \u201d as an error that was \u201cprejudicial: It must have affected the out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>come of the . . . proceedings.\u201d <em>Olano, supra, </em>123 L Ed 2d 519. We believe that the proper interpretation of the term \"prejudice\u201d in the context of issue preservation for plain error may be equated with the longstanding state precedent of outcome determination. See <em>Degraffenreid, Catey, </em>and <em>Merchant, supra. </em>In other words, a plain, <em>unpreserved </em>error may not be considered by an appellate court for the first time on appeal unless the error could have been decisive of the outcome or unless it falls under the category of cases, yet to be clearly defined, where prejudice is presumed or reversal is automatic. Cf. <em>Napier, Moskalik, DerMartzex, </em>and <em>Farmer, supra. </em>Under the facts of this case, we are persuaded that the error involved here was not decisive of the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Although our review of the facts on the record indicates that defense counsel raised the matter of an insanity defense before voir dire of the jury, no reference was made to MCL 768.29a(1); MSA 28.1052(1)(1) and its requirement of an instruction to be given immediately before expert testimony on insanity. Thus, the error was unpreserved. In addition, the trial court asked jurors during voir dire whether they could conceptualize the nature of the insanity defense and the fact that, if successful, it would support a verdict of not guilty. Moreover, the jury instructions given at the conclusion of proofs were straight from an instruction manual and therefore presented the appropriate standards. Finally, the only witnesses to testify regarding the issue of insanity were one expert witness and defendant. Because we are not convinced that the error in this case led to significant confusion regarding an insanity defense, we conclude that the error was not decisive of the outcome. Thus, defendant failed to establish the form of prejudice necessary to preserve an issue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>was not raised before the trial court. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to address the standard of reversal in this case of unpreserved, plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The Court of Appeals decision is reversed and the jury verdict reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b686-6\">Brickley, Boyle, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\"> MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\"> MCL 750.227b; MSA 28.424(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b669-11\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> [Prosecutor]: Your Honor, there is another issue that I guess I want to see if we can clarify.

However, 28 USC 2111 does not contain the same clear dichotomy between preserved and plain errors as is found in the criminal procedural rules. Rather, it forbids appellate reversal \"without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d Clearly, the procedural rule provides a stronger semantic basis for the decision reached by the majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\"> For a history of the harmless error doctrine, see, generally, 3 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 26.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b682-10\"> Pound, <em>The canons of procedural reform, </em>12 ABA J 541, 543 (1926).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\"> See also <em>Yakus v United States, </em>321 US 414, 444; 64 S Ct 660; 88 L Ed 834 (1944) (\"No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\"> Except, of course, in the class of cases in which prejudice is presumed.

This case can be adequately resolved on the basis set forth in part hi of the majority opinion, which, as set forth in the last full paragraph of part hi, shows that even if there was error, it may not have been clear or obvious, and that whether the burden is on the prosecution, because the error is deemed to have been preserved, or on the defendant, because it was not preserved, the instructional omission in the instant case was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The adoption of the views expressed by the majority in <em>Olano </em>concerning the meaning of the federal plain error rule ignores the significant difference between the federal judicial power and the judicial power confided to this Court. As set forth in <em>Olano, </em>123 L Ed 2d 517-518, the federal plain error rule provides \"the Court of Appeals a <em>limited power </em>to correct errors that were forfeited because not timely raised in the District Court,\u201d and \"the <em>authority </em>created\u201d by that rule \"is circumscribed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

I would follow the approach suggested by Justice Stevens, and recognize in the Court of Appeals a \"wide measure of discretion in the supervision of litigation . . . .\u201d 123 L Ed 2d 527.
