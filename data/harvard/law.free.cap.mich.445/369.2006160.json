Specifically, we must decide whether the trial court acted properly in admitting as substantive evidence the testimony of two witnesses that a witness who denied having identified the defendant at trial had previously identified him at a photographic showup.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We hold that, under MRE 801(d)(1)(C), statements of identification are not hearsay when the identifier is subject to cross-examination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The history of the rule and the goal of promoting reliable fact finding support this conclusion. The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">This case arose from the July 26, 1988, shooting death of Orlando Nance that occurred in an alley outside a market in Detroit. The defendant, Donald Malone, was charged with first-degree murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Witnesses Robin Lasenby, Carey Jackson, and Melvin Mann each observed individuals running to, or from, the scene of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Carey Jackson later identified the defendant at a photographic showup. At trial, however, Carey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Jackson denied having identified the defendant. Other eyewitnesses were also reluctant to testify. Robin Lasenby testified that, although he was not afraid for himself, his mother \"[g]ot [him] to make a statement because she felt frightened for her safety or whatever.\u201d Defendant Malone \"told [Lasenby] that the affair was none of Lasenby\u2019s business.\u201d Lasenby, who had previously given a statement that unequivocally identified the defendant as the person who got out of the black Omni with a dark object<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in his hand, testified that the defendant later told him that the incident was \"none of [his] business,\u201d and that, at that time as well, the defendant had in his possession a dark object.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>was only after that conversation that Lasenby \"didn\u2019t want to come\u201d to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Over the defendant\u2019s objections, attorney James Hall, the attorney appointed to protect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair showup, testified that Carey Jackson identified defendant Malone as \"the guy who had the gun,\u201d and signed a statement recording this identification. Attorney Hall also testified that the photographic showup was fair. Officer James Bivens of the Detroit Police Department also testified and confirmed Jackson\u2019s identification and signed statement. The trial court held that the testimony of both Officer Bivens and Attorney Hall was not limited to impeachment of Jackson\u2019s trial testimony and was admissible as substantive evidence under MRE 801(d)(1)(C).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury convicted the defendant of first-degree murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions. 193 Mich App 366; 483 NW2d 470 (1992). The Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the identification testimony was inadmissible hearsay. Judge Connor concurred only because he felt compelled to apply the rule announced in <em>People v </em>Newcomb, 190 Mich App 424, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>429-430; 476 NW2d 749 (1991), as required by Administrative Order No. 1990-6, 436 Mich lxxxiv. See 193 Mich App 372 (Connor, J., concurring). This Court granted the defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal on March 16, 1993. 442 Mich 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">THE TESTIMONY IS NOT HEARSAY UNDER MRE 801(d)(1)(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The testimony of Attorney Hall and Officer Bivens about the prior statement of witness Carey Jackson is not hearsay. On this point, the Rules of Evidence could not be more clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">A statement is not hearsay if . . . [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is . . . one of identification of a person made after perceiving him .... [MRE 801(d)(1)(C).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">MRE 801(d) is an outgrowth of attempts to abandon the orthodox rule that prior statements of a witness were admissible only for impeachment or under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. The proponents of change, among them Wig-more and Learned Hand, countered the orthodox view that substantive use was objectionable because the prior statement when made was not under oath, subject to cross-examination, or in the presence of the trier of fact. They observed that the oath was no longer the principal safeguard of trustworthiness, that the interests of cross-examination were met by the declarant\u2019s presence at trial, and that the trier\u2019s advantage of observing the demeanor of the witness was also satisfied. In Hand\u2019s classic statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>If, from all that the jury see of the witness, they conclude that what he says now is not the truth, but what he said before, they are none the less deciding from what they see and hear of that person and in court. <em>[Di Carlo v United States, </em>6 F2d 364, 368 (CA 2, 1925).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The reformers\u2019 views are represented in the Model Code of Evidence Rule 503, which abolishes the orthodox rule and provides that all prior statements are admissible if the declarant is found to be \"present and subject to cross-examination.\u201d 2 McCormick, Evidence (4th ed), \u00a7 251, p 118. However, concern that the Model Code approach would produce the manufacture of prior statements led to an intermediate position taken by the advisory committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">exempting from classification as hearsay certain prior statements thought by circumstances to be free of the danger of abuse. The exempt statements are (A) inconsistent statements, (B) consistent statements when admissible to rebut certain attacks upon the credibility of the witness, and (C) statements of identification. [2 McCormick, <em>supra, </em>p 120.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The Congress modified the original proposal, and the structure of MRE 801(d), as ultimately adopted by this Court, parallels FRE 801(d), as modified. The rule clearly indicates the circumstances in which prior statements are defined as not hearsay: where the prior statement was made under oath and is inconsistent with the witness\u2019 testimony,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>MRE 801(d)(1)(A); where the prior statement is consistent and offered to rebut, MRE 801(d)(1)(B); and where the prior statement is one of identification, MRE 801(d)(1)(C). Unlike subrules (A) and (B) of Rule 801(d)(1), subparagraph (C) does not require laying a foundation other than that the witness is present and found to be available for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Thus, statements of identification are not limited by whether the out-of-court declaration is denied or affirmed at trial. There is no requirement \"of inconsistency\u201d as in subparagraph (A), nor is there a condition of previous impeachment as in subparagraph (B). As long as the statement is one of identification, Rule 801(d)(1)(C) permits the substantive use of any prior statement of identification by a witness as nonhearsay, provided the witness is available for cross-examination. 4 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Evidence, \u00b6 801(d)(1)(C)[01], pp 801-214 to 801-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">All that is contemplated is an out-of-court statement of identification (which is simply a particular type of prior statement) and that the out-of-court declarant be subject to cross-examination \"concerning\u201d the statement. Thus, it is clear that the effect of both MRE 801(d)(1)(A) and MRE 801(d)(1)(B) is to change Michigan law, and the committee notes confirm this. 399 Mich 1003. Further, there is no distinction regarding whether the out-of-court statement is offered by a third party or is the statement of identification of a witness on the stand regarding something the witness previously said. Under the orthodox definition of hearsay, an out-of-court statement offered for the truth is inadmissible, whether offered through its maker or a third party. A statement of identification defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>as nonhearsay is substantively admissible under Rule 801, without regard to its proponent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Because Mr. Jackson testified regarding the subject of identity at trial, and was subject to cross-examination regarding his identification, the testimony was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">THE DRAFTING HISTORY OF MRE 801(d)(1)(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">A full review of the committee commentary on the Michigan Rules of Evidence confirms that the testimony in question is not hearsay. After first stating that MRE 801(d)(1)(A) and (B) were \"inconsistent with prior Michigan law\u201d that defined prior inconsistent statements and consistent statements as hearsay, see, e.g., <em>People v Hallaway, </em>389 Mich 265, 271-279; 205 NW2d 451 (1973) (opinion of Brennan, J.), the committee summarized the effect of Rule 801(d)(1)(C):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">MRE 801(d)(1)(C) is consistent with prior Michigan law in admitting testimony by a witness as to his own prior statement of identification of a person made after perceiving him. <em>People v Poe, </em>388 Mich 611; 202 NW2d 320 (1972); <em>People v Londe, </em>230 Mich 484; 203 NW 93 (1925). [399 Mich 1004.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The committee\u2019s statement that MRE 801(d)(1)(C) was consistent with prior law <em>\"admitting </em>testimony by a witness as to his own prior statement . . .,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis added), does not mention previous Michigan law <em>excluding </em>a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ness\u2019 prior inconsistent statements as hearsay.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That line of authority was overruled in the committee\u2019s version of MRE 801(d)(1)(A).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since the committee\u2019s proposals would have made all prior inconsistent statements admissible as substantive evidence without limitation, the only category of statements of identification evidence not contemplated by the proposal was a prior statement of identification admitted by the witness. Since <em>People v Poe </em>and <em>People v Londe, supra, </em>admitted as substantive evidence the prior statement of identification of a witness affirming his in-court identification, the commentary to FRE 801(d)(1)(A), (B), and (C) accurately describes the changes proposed in Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The Committee Note also describes MRE 801(d)(1)(C) as identical to its federal counterpart. 399 Mich 1002-1003. According to the General Comment, when a particular rule is drawn from \"the corresponding Federal rule, the Michigan Committee Note usually does not restate the rule\u2019s background or comment on its meaning. Rather the Federal Advisory Committee Notes and Congressional reports are allowed to speak for them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>selves.\u201d 399 Mich 955.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Report of the Senate Judiciary committee addressed this precise situation in explaining why the rule is desirable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\"The identification occurs before [the witness\u2019] recollection has been dimmed by the passage of time. Equally as important, it also takes place before the defendant or some other party has had the opportunity, through bribe or threat, to influence the witness to change his mind.\u201d [4 Weinstein &amp; Berger, <em>supra, </em>p 801-6, quoting the Report of the Committee on the Judiciary, Senate, 94th Cong, 1st Sess, No 94-199, pp 2-4 (1975).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">We assume that the justices of this Court were familiar with the interpretative materials, leading commentators, the extensive case law preceding adoption of the federal rules that admitted first- or third-party identification without limitation,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the federal rule and its effect on common-law practice. Indeed, whatever the views of the individual justices<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> regarding the arguments for and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>against retention or reform of the common-law rules of limited admissibility, it is beyond dispute that at least four justices were persuaded that previously inadmissible statements should be defined as nonhearsay, MRE 801(d)(2)(D), and that statements previously admitted only for impeachment or support should be admitted as substantive evidence, MRE 801(d)(2)(A) and MRE 801(d)(2)(B). The Court clearly cast its vote against orthodoxy and in favor of \"the promotion of growth and development in the law of evidence.\u201d MRE 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">THIS TESTIMONY DOES NOT PRESENT THE DANGERS OF HEARSAY</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">As Professor Wigmore observes in explanation of FRE 801(d)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">The witness who has told one story aforetime and another today has opened the gates to all the vistas of truth which the common law practice of cross-examination and reexamination was invented to explore. The reasons for the change of face, whether forgetfulness, carelessness, pity, terror, or greed, may be explored by the two questioners in the presence of the trier of fact, under oath, casting light on which is the true story and which the false. It is hard to escape the view that evidence of a prior inconsistent statement, when declarant is on the stand to explain it if he can, has in high degree the safeguards of examined testimony. In addition, allowing it as substantive evidence pays a further dividend in avoiding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>limiting instruction quite unlikely to be heeded by a jury. [2 McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 251, p 120.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The United States Supreme Court considered the asserted dangers of hearsay in <em>California v Green, </em>399 US 149; 90 S Ct 1930; 26 L Ed 2d 489 (1970). The question there was whether the trial court properly admitted as substantive evidence a statement to the police and testimony at preliminary examination that the defendant supplied marijuana to a witness, where the witness became markedly evasive at trial and claimed he could not remember the actual events.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The Court held that admission of the declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements at trial does not violate the Confrontation Clause as long as the declarant testifies as a witness and is subject to full and effective cross-examination. In reaching this conclusion, the Court observed that the alleged dangers of admitting the out-of-court statement are not present when the witness is under oath and forced to submit to cross-examination and the jury is allowed to observe the witness\u2019 demeanor in assessing his credibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">It is, of course, true that the out-of-court statement may have been made under circumstances subject to none of these protections. But if the declarant is present and testifying at trial, the out-of-court statement for all practical purposes regains most of the lost protections. If the witness admits the prior statement is his, or if there is other evidence to show the statement is his, the danger of faulty reproduction is negligible and the jury can be confident that it has before it two conflicting statements by the same witness. Thus, as far as the oath is concerned, the witness must now affirm, deny, or qualify the truth of the prior statement under the penalty of perjury .... [399 US 158-159.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Addressing the claim that the jury could not evaluate the declarant\u2019s demeanor when he first made his out-of-court statement, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">The witness who now relates a different story about the events in question must necessarily assume a position as to the truth value of his prior statement, thus giving the jury a chance to observe and evaluate his demeanor as he either disavows or qualifies his earlier statement. The jury is alerted by the inconsistency in the stories, and its attention is sharply focused on determining either that one of the stories reflects the truth or that the witness who has apparently lied once, is simply too lacking in credibility to warrant its believing either story. <em>[Id. </em>at 160.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Finally, to the extent that the orthodox rule rested on the value of contemporaneous cross-examination, the Court observed in words equally applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">The main danger in substituting subsequent for timely cross-examination seems to lie in the possibility that the witness\u2019 \"[f]alse testimony is apt to harden and become unyielding to the blows of truth in proportion as the witness has opportunity for reconsideration and influence by the suggestions of others, whose interest may be, and often is, to maintain falsehood rather than truth.\u201d . . . That danger, however, disappears when the witness has changed his testimony so that, far from \"hardening\u201d his prior statement has softened to the point where he now repudiates it. <em>[Id. </em>at 159.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">In <em>United States v Owens, </em>484 US 554, 561; 108 S Ct 838; 98 L Ed 2d 951 (1988), nearly twenty years later, the Supreme Court upheld the admission of a prior identification under FRE 801(d)(1)(C), and the Confrontation Clause. The Court con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>eluded that the opportunity for cross-examination is not denied when the witness testifies about his current belief, the basis for which he cannot recall, or when the witness\u2019 past belief is introduced and he is unable to recollect the reason for that past belief. In both, the foundation for the belief (current or past) cannot effectively be elicited, but other means of impugning the belief are available. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia interpreted the identical language at issue here as requiring only that the declarant take the stand and answer questions under oath:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">It seems to us that the more natural reading of \"subject to cross-examination concerning the statement\u201d includes what was available here. Ordinarily a witness is regarded as \"subject to cross-examination\u201d when he is placed on the stand, under oath, and responds willingly to questions. . . . Rule 801(d)(1)(C), which specifies that the cross-examination need only \"concer[n] the statement,\u201d does not on its face require more. <em>[Id. </em>at 561-562.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">We, too, conclude that a statement of identification is admissible under MRE 801(d)(1)(C) if a witness is present in court and under oath and is considered subject to cross-examination about his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>prior position. The jury can determine the credibility of a disavowal as well as his present position. Likewise, the third party who is under oath also is subject to cross-examination regarding the circumstances of the identification.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES INTERPRETING THE PARALLEL FEDERAL RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Authorities considering this precise question under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(C) overwhelmingly agree that third-party testimony about a prior statement of identification is not hearsay. Judge Weinstein states that \"if at the trial the eyewitness fails to remember or denies that he made the identification, the previous statement of the eyewitness can be proved by the testimony of a person to whom the statement was made, and the statement can be given substantive effect.\u201d 4 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Evidence, \u00b6 801(d)(1)(C)[01], p 801-222. As Judge Henry Friendly observed the year before MRE 801(d)(1) was adopted: \"The purpose of the rule was to permit the introduction of identifications made by a witness when memory was fresher and there had been less opportunity for influence to be exerted upon him.\u201d <em>United States v Marchand, </em>564 F2d 983, 996 (CA 2, 1977). Elaborating on why the prior identification was properly admitted in that case, he explained that outside influence \"was one plausible explanation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>loss of recollection of the identifying witness . . . <em>Id. </em>at 996, n 23. See also <em>United States v </em>Lewis, 565 F2d 1248, 1251-1252 (CA 2, 1977), cert den 435 US 973 (1978). <em>United States v Jarrad, </em>754 F2d 1451, 1456 (CA 9, 1985), cert den 474 US 830 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">While this Court is not bound by these decisions, because of the parallel purpose and similar language of the state and federal rules, they are highly persuasive. Like its federal counterpart, MRE 801(d)(1)(C) permits the jury to assess the substantive worth of a prior statement of identification where the identifying witness fails, refuses, or reaffirms a prior statement of identification at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">THE FALLACY OF THIRD-PARTY ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">In Michigan, a distinction was drawn at common law between a party\u2019s testimony affirming his own prior identification and the testimony of a third party corroborating the witness\u2019 out-of-court identification. The former was admissible for the truth of the matter. The latter was not. Because this distinction has been the basis for difference of opinion in the Court of Appeals regarding the proper interpretation of MRE 801(d)(1)(C),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a brief discussion of the common-law rules is in order. The history of those rules reveals that the distinction arose from early efforts to reform the rigid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>orthodox rule of hearsay, and should not be read as a limitation on what statements are not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">It bears repeating here that a statement of identification is merely one species of a prior statement. All prior statements, whether offered through the declarant or a third party,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> were hearsay under the orthodox definition of hearsay and were inadmissible except under a recognized exception or for impeachment or support.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Third-party identification testimony, like other prior statements, was admissible on the issue of credibility. Thus, if a prior statement, including a prior statement of identification, was inconsistent with trial testimony, it could be admitted to impeach. If adopted as true by the witness, it was admitted as substantive evidence. <em>Ruhala v Roby, </em>379 Mich 102, 120; 150 NW2d 146 (1967) (opinion of Brennan, J.). Likewise, if the tenor of cross-examination suggested that a witness\u2019 testimony was a recent fabrication, a prior consistent statement, including one of identification, was admissible in support of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Properly understood, then, under the orthodox definition of hearsay: (1) all prior out-of-court statements of identification were hearsay, but prior statements offered to prove that the statement was made, irrespective of its truth, were admitted where relevant to credibility; (2) extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statements of identification was admissible for impeachment; (3) prior consistent statements of identification were admissible to rehabilitate; and (4) where the prior statement of a witness agreed with his testimony, prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>consistent statements were simply irrelevant bolstering because prior statements were hearsay and not admissible for the truth of the matter, but only for credibility. <em>People v Hallaway, supra, </em>389 Mich 276-277 (Brennan, J., separate opinion).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">More than one hundred years ago, however, Michigan created a common-law exception to the orthodox definition of hearsay and admitted first-party statements of identification for the truth of the matter. In <em>People v Mead, </em>50 Mich 228; 15 NW 95 (1883), Justice Cooley approved admission of a prior statement of identification for the truth of the matter, where the witness made an in-court identification. Otherwise, Michigan common law generally followed the orthodox rule that prior statements were admitted only on a proper showing that they were relevant to credibility. See <em>People v Jolly, </em>193 Mich App 192, 195; 483 NW2d 679 (1992). The Michigan rule of first-party identification thus appears to be a hundred-year-old precursor of a break with orthodoxy.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">A limiting construction of MRE 801(d)(1)(C) cannot be inferred from the fact that the Michigan rule allowed the substantive use of first-party testimony regarding a prior statement of identification. The exception is historically significant, but otherwise irrelevant. Indeed, to the extent that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>historical approach sheds light on the present inquiry, history shows that the justices of this Court were not hide bound to the orthodox approach. In fact, to read the common-law exception to hearsay recognized in <em>Mead </em>as limiting prior statements of identification now defined as non-hearsay illogically converts the historical exception to hearsay into the contemporary definition of what is not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Finally, a distinction between first- and third-party testimony under MRE 801(d)(1)(C) cannot rest on the premise that the third party cannot credibly provide the trier of fact with facts the third party knows to be true. It would follow from this premise that a third party cannot testify to any extrajudicial statement of a witness because, by definition, the third party does not know it to be true. Because a third party can not vouch for the accuracy of an inconsistent statement under MRE 801(d)(1)(A) or of a consistent statement under MRE 801(d)(1)(B), any more than a third party can vouch for the accuracy of a statement of prior identification, the premise would simply emasculate the redefinition of hearsay adopted in Rule 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The common-law distinction between first- and third-party testimony of an out-of-court statement of identification was made to escape the orthodox definition of hearsay, which precluded prior statements unless relevant to credibility. There is no basis in logic or policy to employ the escape route from orthodoxy as a vehicle for its reestablishment.

In the event that the Court is required to construe a provision, the Court must discover and effectuate the intent of the formulating body. <em>Storey v Meijer, Inc, </em>431 Mich 368, 376; 429 NW2d 169 (1988). The Court must ascertain and apply a reasonable construction that promotes the purpose of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">This Court adopted the Michigan Rules of Evidence in 1978. A preview of the proposed rules included the drafting committee\u2019s comments regarding the rules\u2019 effect on prior Michigan law. While the committee\u2019s comments are in no way binding upon this Court, they are nevertheless instructive with respect to this Court\u2019s intent in adopting the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">While the committee recognized the similarity between the language of proposed MRE 801(d)(1)(C), and its federal counterpart, FRE 801(d)(1)(C), it did not indicate that the application of the Michigan rule would mirror the application of the federal rule. To the contrary, the committee, in its statement regarding MRE 801(d)(1)(C)\u2019s effect on prior Michigan law, expressly acknowledged that the rule was consistent with prior Michigan law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">MRE 801(d)(1)(C) <em>is consistent with prior Michigan law in admitting testimony hy a witness as to his own prior statement of identification of a person made after perceiving him.

Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">An identifier\u2019s courtroom testimony of an earlier extrajudicial identification constituted hearsay by definition,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nevertheless, this Court allowed its use as substantive evidence before the adoption of MRE 801(d)(1)(C). However, the Court limited the admissibility of third-party identification testimony, generally excluding it from use as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Admittedly, before today this Court had not announced whether third-party identification testimony is admissible as substantive evidence when the identifier has either denied making or failed to recall the identification. The Court has, however, expressed its pre-MRE position regarding the use of third-party identification testimony to bolster the identifier\u2019s identification. In <em>People v Mead, </em>50 Mich 228; 15 NW 95 (1883), the victim of a burglary identified the defendant on the street in the presence of her husband. At trial, the woman identified the defendant as the burglar, and testified about her previous out-of-court identification. The victim\u2019s husband also testified. The prosecutor asked the husband if his wife had recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>anyone on the street, and, if so, whom. The husband responded that his wife had recognized the defendant as the robber. The trial court struck the husband\u2019s answer from the record, and this Court upheld the trial court\u2019s action. While the identifier\u2019s repetition of her extrajudicial identification was properly admitted as substantive evidence, the third-party identification testimony was inadmissible. Justice Cooley explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">[T]he witness, not content with giving a simple answer to it, added what in effect was a statement that his wife told him she recognized the respondent as the burglar. <em>The statement was hearsay, and it was likely to be exceedingly mischievous, for much depended in the case upon this recognition. [Id. </em>at 230. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Remaining faithful to this premise, the Court restated the standard regarding the admissibility of extrajudicial identification testimony in <em>Londe. </em>While an identifier may testify regarding an extrajudicial identification, a third party who witnessed the extrajudicial identification may only testify regarding the \"circumstances [under which] the identification was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Almost fifty years later, this Court reaffirmed the <em>Londe </em>holding excluding third-party evidence of extrajudicial identifications. <em>People v Poe, supra </em>at 618-619. <em>Poe </em>arose from a robbery of a supermarket. Four witnesses of the crime attended pretrial lineups. The police notes concerning the lineups indicated that two of the four eyewitnesses positively identified defendant Poe as the robber; one eyewitness stated that Poe looked like the robber, but he could not assert that in court; and the fourth eyewitness identified someone other than the defendant. Despite the lineup results, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>each witness testified at trial that Poe was the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">While the Court approved of the admission of the police officer\u2019s testimony and lineup notes to reflect the hesitation by one witness and the misidentification by the other,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it prohibited their use as substantive evidence to reveal the consistent pretrial identification made by the two remaining eyewitnesses. The Court, relying on <em>Londe, </em>restricted third-party identification testimony to \" 'what took place\u2019 and under 'what circumstances the identification was made . . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Poe </em>at 618. Unlike <em>Londe, </em>however, the <em>Poe </em>Court defined inadmissible third-party identification testimony as testimony concerning \"the nature or quality of the identification.\u201d <em>Poe </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The status of the Michigan rule remained settled despite this Court\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Sanford. </em>While the entire Court concluded that the admission of the third-party identification testimony of the extrajudicial identification did not require reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction, the Court split regarding <em>why </em>the admission did not compel relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The clear rule in Michigan is that a majority of the Court must agree on a ground for decision in order to make that binding precedent for future cases. If there is merely a majority for a particular result, then the parties to the case are bound by the judgment but the case is not authority beyond the immediate parties. <em>[People v Anderson, </em>389 Mich 155, 170; 205 NW2d 461 (1973).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The <em>Mead/Londe/Poe </em>trilogy firmly established Michigan\u2019s pre-MRE position regarding the admissibility of identification testimony. An identifier\u2019s testimony of an extrajudicial identification, albeit hearsay by definition, is admissible as substantive evidence. Third-party identification testimony offered to bolster the identifier\u2019s identification, however, is limited to the circumstances surrounding the identification, prohibiting testimony about the content of the identification as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Justice Boyle\u2019s interpretation of the rule contradicts the drafting committee\u2019s comments that \"MRE 801(d)(1)(C) <em>is consistent with prior Michigan law </em>. . . .\u201d 399 Mich 1004. (Emphasis added.) This Court repeatedly held that a third party, who witnessed an extrajudicial identification, may only testify about the \"circumstances [under which] the identification was made.\u201d <em>Londe, supra </em>at 487. See also <em>Mead </em>and <em>Poe. </em>The Court refused to allow a third party to testify of the identification to bolster the identifier\u2019s identification. Nevertheless, Justice Boyle\u2019s interpretation permits the admission of the prohibited testimony. To temper this fundamental anomaly, Justice Boyle notes in a footnote that trial courts <em>may </em>exclude the bolstering testimony via MRE 403. <em>Ante, </em>p 390, n 19. This is a far cry from the previously mandated exclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>such evidence. With a few keystrokes, my sister has eradicated a century-old rule that was intended to remain consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Furthermore, a vivid or eccentric imagination is not required to reach the conclusion that if this Court consistently excluded third-party identification testimony that merely bolsters the identifier\u2019s identification, then it would have, given the opportunity, assuredly excluded the less reliable, inherently more suspect, third-party identification testimony of a recanted or forgotten identification. In this context, Justice Cooley\u2019s justification for exclusion is equally compelling: \"it [the third-party identification testimony] was likely to be exceedingly mischievous, for much depended in the case upon this recognition.\u201d Mead, <em>supra </em>at 230. Third-party identification testimony is inherently unreliable because the accuracy of the identification cannot be adequately assessed by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">This Court recognized the problems inherent in eyewitness identification. See <em>People v Anderson, supra, </em>and accompanying appendix at 192-220. While one infirmity concerns the suggestiveness of the identification procedure employed, this is only one of many infirmities that render eyewitness identification suspect.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">Some are implicit in the original situation, including, for example, the insignificance \u2014 at the time and to the observer \u2014 of the events, the length of time of observation, and the less than ideal observation conditions which generally apply (distance, poor lighting, fast movement, or crowds). The witness himself is a major source of unreliability, due to the effect of observing under stress (especially applicable in the case of observers who are the victims as well), or often to defects in physical condition such as age, sickness, or fatigue.[<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] [Comments, <em>The use of prior identification evidence in criminal trials under the federal rules of evidence, </em>66 J Crim L &amp; Criminology 240, 246 (1975).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The majority opinion overlooks the infirmities inherent in eyewitness identification. Even in the absence of a suggestive identification procedure, the intrinsic infirmities in eyewitness identification remain. When an identifier denies or forgets an extrajudicial identification, the jury cannot assess whether the identifier was equipped to make an accurate identification. Furthermore, the third party cannot provide information relating to the identifier\u2019s initial observation of the defendant and the identifier\u2019s ability to accurately transfer these images to the extrajudicial identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">When the identifier denies or forgets an extrajudicial identification, the jury is not presented with the tools necessary to determine whether the alleged extrajudicial identification was accurate. When the third-party identification testimony is offered merely to bolster, the jury will have had the benefit of hearing how the identifier made the identification. The accuracy of the identification can be tested. It defies logic to suggest that earlier panels of this Court would have embraced third-party identification testimony whose accuracy could not be credibly tested when it excluded third-party identification testimony whose accuracy could be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The policies prompting the universal exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>of hearsay testimony, as well as the justification for established exceptions, shed further light on this Court\u2019s intent regarding the proper boundaries of MRE 801(d)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Hearsay is \"a statement, other than the one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d MRE 801(c). Generally, hearsay evidence is inadmissible unless it qualifies as an exception to the hearsay rule. MRE 802. Hearsay is repugnant to the truth-seeking function of litigation because the statement is made in the absence of testimonial safeguards implemented to foster reliability. At trial a witness must testify under oath or affirmation, exposed to the threat of perjury. The trier of fact can observe a witness\u2019 demeanor and physical response to offered testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, a witness is exposed to contemporaneous cross-examination regarding his offered assertions. Binder, Hearsay Handbook (2d ed), \u00a7 3.01, p 59. Cross-examination is \"beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u201d 5 Wigmore (Chadbourn rev), \u00a7 1367, p 32. The safeguards are believed to aid the exposure of possible ambiguity, insincerity, faulty perception, and erroneous memory. The absence of the three testimonial safeguards render hearsay statements untrustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Similarly, the recognition that certain extrajudicial statements possess sufficient indicia of reliability, coupled with a need for the evidence, has prompted this Court to recognize exceptions to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Exceptions to the hearsay rule are justified by the belief that the hearsay statements are <em>both necessary and inherently trustworthy. [People v Meeboer (After Remand), </em>439 Mich 310, 322; 484 NW2d 621 (1992). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">On the basis of the policies prompting the hearsay rule and its exceptions, it cannot be denied that the Court generally intends to exclude from trial evidence that is untrustworthy and unreliable. It is from this premise that the different types of identification testimony must be examined in order to determine whether such statements are excluded from the definition of hearsay pursuant to MRE 801(d)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">This Court extensively examined the reliability of eyewitness identification in <em>People v Anderson, supra. </em>On the basis of documentation of instances of erroneous eyewitness identification and scientific principles, the Court concluded \"that there are serious problems concerning the accuracy of eyewitness identification and that real prospects for error inhere in the very process of identification completely independent of the subjective accuracy, completeness or good faith of witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">The vagaries of eyewitness identification are well-known; the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification. Mr. Justice Frankfurter once said: \"What is the worth of identification testimony even when uncontradicted? The identification of strangers is proverbially untrustworthy. The hazards of such testimony are established by a formidable number of instances in the records of English and American trials. These instances are recent \u2014 not due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>brutalities of ancient criminal procedure.\u201d <em>[United States v Wade, </em>388 US 218, 228; 87 S Ct 1926; 18 L Ed 2d 1149 (1967).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">As a result, eyewitness identification testimony is burdened by the same characteristic found offensive in hearsay evidence: it is untrustworthy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">Considering that no evidence, other than an outright confession, probably carries as much weight, not only with lay jurors but with many law enforcement officials as well, such criticisms are by no means academic. [66 J Crim L &amp; Criminology 245.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">1. IDENTIFICATION TESTIMONY BY THE IDENTIFIER</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">While the reliability of an eyewitness identification is questionable, it has nevertheless been recognized that an identification made soon after an event is generally more probative than an identification made during trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">[T]he earlier identification has greater probative value than an identification made in the courtroom after the suggestions of others and the circumstances of the trial may have intervened to create a fancied recognition in the witness\u2019 mind. [4 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Evidence, \u00b6 801(d)(1)(C)[01], p 801-217. Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-12\">We should not blind ourselves to what the law has learned by bitter experience \u2014 identification in court is frequently an almost worthless formality. ... By the time of trial positions have often become so fixed and memory so attenuated and distorted by subsequent events that witnesses sel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>dom make identifications on the basis of their raw recollection of the original event. <em>[United States v Barbati, </em>284 F Supp 409, 413 (ED NY, 1968). Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The identifier\u2019s identification testimony possesses attributes that elevate eyewitness identification from its unreliable status to a position that satisfies this Court\u2019s intent of admitting evidence that is necessary and trustworthy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In an attempt to provide the most probative evidence to the trier of fact, this Court has admitted testimony of an extrajudicial identification offered by the identifier for over one hundred years.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While the reliability of eyewitness identifications is dubious, the identification is often essential to resolution of the case. Admittedly, an extrajudicial identification cannot be tested by contemporaneous cross-examination. However, when an extrajudicial identification is offered by the identifier, the opposing party can scrutinize the circumstances prompting the identifier\u2019s selection. Cross-examination will reveal how the identifier came to make the identification, potentially exposing any weaknesses and uncertainty of the prior identification. This ability to test the identification and the process attendant to the identification provides, in essence, an indicia of reliability, not necessarily that the identification is correct, but in the sense that the factfinder is adequately equipped to judge the accuracy of the often vital identification.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Identification testimony offered by the identifier is the most reliable evidence of identification because it was made before the influences found at trial, before the identifier\u2019s position has become fixed. The trustworthiness of the assertion can be tested through cross-examination before the trier of fact, while the identifier is under oath. Furthermore, the identifier has personal knowledge of why the identification was made, providing a basis not only for cross-examination, but for meaningful cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">This type of evidence is in accord, not only with this Court\u2019s pre-MRE position concerning identification testimony, but also with its purpose and policies underlying adherence to the hearsay rule and the recognition of various exceptions. Accordingly, MRE 801(d)(1)(C) excludes from the definition of hearsay the out-of-court statements of identification as communicated at trial by the identifier.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">2. THIRD-PARTY IDENTIFICATION TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Unlike identification testimony of the identifier, third-party identification testimony possesses none of the attributes that would elevate it from its unreliable status. When a third party testifies about a prior identification by the identifier, the accuracy of the identification (which is generally being used to convict a defendant of a crime), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>cannot be tested. As a result, the third-party identification testimony is not only unreliable, but it lacks probative value. It cannot credibly provide the trier of fact information the third party knows to be true. MRE 801(d)(1)(C) does not authorize the admission of third-party identification testimony as substantive evidence irrespective of the identifier\u2019s testimony regarding the extrajudicial identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">a. IDENTIFIER TESTIFIES OF EXTRAJUDICIAL IDENTIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Regardless of the identifier\u2019s identical testimony, third-party testimony of another\u2019s identification is unreliable. The third-party identification testimony cannot vouch for the accuracy of the identification, and its cumulative effect is potentially dangerous.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">Third-party bolstering occurs when, for example, a police officer present at the lineup testifies in court that the witness in his presence said, \"This' is the man.\u201d Obviously the testimony of the police officer is of no value whatsoever. If the witness made a \"wrong\u201d identification, the police officer is bolstering that mistake. If the witness made a \"right\u201d identification, the police officer is bolstering evidence he knows nothing about, since he himself never saw the perpetrators. Yet juries ask, \"How can they <em>both </em>be mistaken?\u201d [Sobel, Eyewitness Identification (2d ed), \u00a7 4.3(b), p 4-18. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The third-party identification testimony fails to reveal whether the identifier accurately transferred the mental images made during the commission of the crime to the later extrajudicial identification. The third party cannot testify about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the identifier\u2019s \"ability to remember and articulate the details of the crime, and the appearance of the offender.\u201d Mauet, <em>Prior identifications in criminal cases: Hearsay and confrontation issues, </em>24 Ariz L R 29, 49 (1982). The third party cannot testify about the factors scrutinized by the trier of fact when determining the accuracy of the identifier\u2019s identification. Such testimony is not only irrelevant, but misleading because it appears to corroborate the identifier\u2019s testimony while it is not true corroboration testimony at all.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>While the third party can corroborate the fact that the identifier did identify a person at a certain time and place, the third party has no basis on which to corroborate the accuracy of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In light of the unreliability of such testimony, coupled with this Court\u2019s pre-MRE position regarding third-party identification testimony, third-party identification testimony that bolsters the identifier\u2019s identification is inadmissible as substantive evidence. Third-party identification testimony is restricted to \" 'what took place\u2019 and under 'what circumstances the identification was made\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Poe </em>at 618. The third party <em>cannot </em>testify about the identifier\u2019s actual identification because this type of statement is hearsay, MRE 801(c), and it is not excluded from the definition of hearsay under MRE 801(d)(1)(C).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>b. IDENTIFIER DENIES OR FORGETS MAKING EXTRAJUDICIAL IDENTIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Third-party testimony of an identifier\u2019s identification that the identifier has either denied making or failed to recall is devoid of any attributes that would make it reliable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The eyewitness identification itself is unreliable. Furthermore, under this situation there is no one available to testify to the accuracy of the identification.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While the alleged identifier can be cross-examined,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the cross-examination is, in reality, an exercise in futility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\"[SJuppose that at the trial the witness not only fails to identify the defendant, but also denies that he ever identified him on a prior occasion. May the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>prosecutor prove by mere observers that a positive identification actually took place, and obtain a conviction on the basis of that testimony? Clearly the answer would be no. . . . The plain common sense prohibiting such testimony is obvious. True it is that the person alleged to have made the out-of-court statement (i.e., the original identification) is present in court and available for cross-examination .... Here, however cross-examination would constitute an exercise in futility. Of what possible value to the defendant is a cross-examination of a witness as to the accuracy of an identification he claims he never made?\u201d [4 Weinstein &amp; Berger, \u00b6 801(d)(1)(C)[01], p 801-223, n 27, quoting Wall, Eye-Witness Identification in Criminal Cases, 161-162 (1965).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The Massachusetts Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">Prior identifications are admissible as probative evidence notwithstanding their hearsay attributes because of the superior probative worth of an identification made closer in time to the events in question. Where, however, the extrajudicial identification is established not by the identifying witness but by a person who observed the identification, we believe that probative worth is outweighed by \"the hazard of error or falsity in the reporting.\u201d Where there is a dispute not only as to the accuracy of a pretrial identification, but also as to whether the identification was in fact made, \"the evidential value of the prior identification is almost completely dissipated.\u201d Thus, a police officer\u2019s attribution to a witness of a positive identification denied by the witness at trial is not admissible to prove the identification. Its effect is limited to impeachment. <em>[Commonwealth v Daye, </em>393 Mass 55, 61; 469 NE2d 483 (1984). Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">While the majority insists that defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>has the ability to attack the extrajudicial identification via cross-examination, it cannot seriously contend that cross-examination can expose the accuracy, trustworthiness or the reliability of the identification.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The absence of a scintilla of reliability of this type of testimony, coupled with this Court\u2019s pre-MRE position regarding the admissibility of third-party identification testimony, compels the conclusion that MRE 801(d)(1)(C) does not exclude from the definition of hearsay, third-party identification testimony of an identifier\u2019s extrajudicial identification when the identifier denies or forgets making the extrajudicial identification.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This testimony is repugnant to the truth-seeking function of trial, contrary to the intent and policies surrounding the adoption of MRE 801(d)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">3. THE FEDERAL INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">While I am aware of the federal interpretation of FRE 801(d)(1)(C), see <em>United States v Jarrad, </em>754 F2d 1451 (CA 9, 1985); <em>United States v Lewis, </em>565 F2d 1248 (CA 2, 1977), I cannot espouse its rationale or result. Admittedly, the federal approach provides persuasive authority; this Court, however, is not bound by the federal application. We have in the past interpreted the MREs more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>stringently than their federal counterparts. See <em>Meeboer (After Remand) </em>at 340, n 1 (Brickley, J., dissenting). When the federal approach is repugnant to this Court\u2019s intent in adopting the MREs, it is this Court\u2019s duty to reject the federal application. Furthermore, not all commentators embrace the direction the federal rule has taken. See Seidelson, <em>Third-party testimony about prior identifications and federal rule of evidence 801(d)(1)(C): A petition for rehearing, </em>8 Rev of Litigation 259 (1989). Professor Seidelson suggests that the federal courts have erred in their application of FRE 801(d)(1)(C) because of their erroneous reliance on extraneous statements made during the floor debate. \"It is established law . . . that the statements and opinions of legislators uttered in the debates are not competent aids to the court in ascertaining the meaning of statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, n 38 (citations omitted). Professor Seidelson asserts that the federal courts would have properly applied FRE 801(d)(1)(C) had it effectuated the intent of the conference committee: The codification of existing federal law which allowed \"only the substantive admissibility of an identifying witness\u2019s testimony as to his prior identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267. I would not disregard the precedent and policies of this Court to simply mimic the Federal Rules of Evidence and other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Third-party identification testimony is limited to the facts and circumstances surrounding the identification, prohibiting testimony of the content of the identification as substantive evidence. Accordingly, the admission of Officer Bivens and attorney Hall\u2019s testimony of Carey Jackson\u2019s earlier identification as substantive evidence was erroneous. MRE 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Furthermore, I cannot agree with the Court of Appeals conclusion that \"admission in this case was not prejudicial because two very credible witnesses for the prosecution positively identified the defendant.\u201d 193 Mich App 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The testimony of Lasenby and Mann is suspect at best. In regard to Lasenby, his trial testimony contradicted the initial statement he gave to the police. Additionally, he acknowledged that he testified only because he feared arrest. Such testimony is neither positive nor particularly credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The other \"credible witness\u201d was the state witness, Melvin Mann. Mann\u2019s testimony can only be characterized as \"incredible.\u201d Mann failed to inform the police of his presence at the crime scene until he was arrested for the victim\u2019s murder. In addition to this active concealment, Mann went out of his way to hide pertinent evidence following the shooting of his friend and business partner. Immediately following the shooting, Mann left the scene of the crime in the Jeep in which Nance was shot under the pretense of getting help.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> While his friend was dying on the ground, Mann drove to another acquaintance\u2019s house, hid the Jeep in a garage, disposed of the bullet-riddled seatcover and hid the keys to the vehicle. Upon his return to the crime scene, he failed to report anything to the police. While he was \"persuaded\u201d to give a statement,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> this statement differed from his ultimate trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In addition to the dubious credibility of both identifying witnesses, their versions of the event were inconsistent. Lasenby asserted that the defendant wore blue jeans at the time of the shoot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ing, while Mann stated that the defendant wore beige shorts.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">These facts, coupled with the heavy reliance most juror\u2019s place on a police officer\u2019s testimony,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> clearly prejudiced the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b543-5\">Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\"> I take issue with my sister\u2019s declaration that the language of MRE 801(d)(1)(C) \"could not be more clear.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>p 375.

The rule\u2019s ambiguity is further evidenced by the Court of Appeals split on its proper application.

Specifically, whether the introduction of such testimony violates a defendant\u2019s constitutional guarantee of confrontation. Admission appears especially suspect in instances in which the identifier denies or forgets making the extrajudicial statement. While the federal courts have examined this issue and found no federal constitutional violation, <em>United States v Owens, </em>484 US 554; 108 S Ct 838; 98 L Ed 2d 951 (1988), this Court has yet to determine the issue under the Michigan Constitution. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20. I do not address this issue because this case can be disposed of on nonconstitutional grounds. \" 'Constitutional questions will not be passed upon when other decisive questions are raised by the record which dispose of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lisee v Secretary of State, </em>388 Mich 32, 40; 199 NW2d 188 (1972) (citations omitted). The majority, however, concludes that MRE 801(d)(1)(C) allows the admission of third-party identification testimony. Yet, the majority fails to examine the confrontational issue that its holding implicates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\"> The rule conditions admissibility of the statement of identification on the opposing party\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine the identifier.

Did the witness perceive accurately? Has he retained an accurate impression of what he perceived? Is his language such as to convey that impression correctly?

The third-party identification testimony is admissible for impeachment purposes as a prior inconsistent statement. The jury does not need third-party identification testimony as substantive evidence to evaluate the identifier\u2019s credibility. Once confronted with the impeaching evidence, the jury can give weight to the witness and his trial testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b542-8\"> Recall that Mann was at a public phone at the time of the shooting.
