We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Defendant Thomas Jaffray, Jr., and two codefendants, brothers Ronald and Martin Normandin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>were charged and tried jointly for kidnapping<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a result of acts committed before the fatal beating of Bruce Williams on August 13, 1987, in the basement of a house that Williams, the victim, shared with the codefendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Another resident of the home, Francis Hamilton, was accused of beating the victim with a nail-studded baseball bat, which resulted in Williams\u2019 death. Hamilton was tried separately for first-degree murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">At the bench trial of Jaffray and his two co-defendants, the prosecution called six witnesses and presented three statements that had been given to the police, one by each of the three codefendants. References in each statement to either of the other two codefendants were blocked out,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the three redacted statements were placed in evidence by stipulation. None of the codefendants testified and they called no witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The record reflects little dispute concerning the sequence of events that preceded the killing of Williams. On August 13, 1987, Ronald Normandin arrived home at about 3:30 a.m. and noticed that his dog, a pit bull terrier, was missing. Later that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>morning in the living room of the home, codefendants Ronald and Jaffray confronted and accused Williams of taking the dog. Initially, Williams claimed the dog had been stolen. However, after Jaffray threatened him with the nail-studded bat, Williams admitted that he had sold the dog for $20 to buy crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Upon further questioning, Williams indicated that the dog could be located at a house on Puritan Street several blocks away. After securing this information, handcuffs were placed on Williams\u2019 wrists, which were shackled behind his back. Jaffray then tied Williams\u2019 feet with rope and attached the rope to the handcuffs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Williams offered to participate in an initial search for the dog, but Jaffray refused. Instead, Jaffray stayed behind to guard Williams while one of the other codefendants set out in Jaffray\u2019s car to locate and retrieve the pit bull.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the codefendant soon returned after an unsuccessful search. Williams then provided additional information concerning the dog\u2019s location. Again, Jaffray <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>refused to allow Williams to help search for the dog. This time, Jaffray and a codefendant departed while, at Jaffray\u2019s suggestion, the other codefendant stayed behind to guard the victim for the duration of the search, which lasted approximately fifteen minutes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Although the specific time frame of this episode is unclear from the record, it is fixed in part by the testimony of Curtis Kennedy, a friend of Williams who lived across the street. Kennedy testified that, when he attempted to visit Williams between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he met Ronald Normandin outside the Normandin home, where Ronald indicated that Williams was \"dog-tied\u201d upstairs because he had sold the pit bull for crack cocaine. Kennedy further testified that he heard Williams\u2019 cries for help coming from the upstairs portion of the house.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Kennedy then ran home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>and informed his mother, Minnie Collins, of his discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">After this disclosure, Mrs. Lois Normandin, mother of the Normandin brothers, warned the codefendants that Williams had been \"making a lot of noise\u201d while they were out searching for the dog.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Unbeknown to anyone outside the home, Jaffray and a codefendant then took Williams to the basement,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> where Jaffray placed a \"gag\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Williams\u2019 mouth and tied him to a pole with an extension cord.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Later, while Williams remained confined in the basement,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Hamilton allegedly bludgeoned Williams to death with the nail-studded bat.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Minnie Collins called the police at approximately 10:20 a.m. When the officers arrived at 11:25 a.m., Collins told them that Williams was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the Normandin house \"bound and gagged.\u201d The police then attempted to search the Normandin home, but were denied entrance for approximately twenty minutes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> They eventually entered the home, but did not find Williams after a brief inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Thereafter, at approximately 12:55 p.m., the police were again summoned to the Normandin home. After talking with the victim\u2019s mother, Ruth McClinton, the officers attempted to reenter the home, but again met resistance. Eventually, the officers gained access to the home and found Williams\u2019 plastic-wrapped body in the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Following a bench trial, the trial judge acquitted Martin Normandin, but found Jaffray and Ronald Normandin guilty of kidnapping as charged. With respect to Jaffray and Ronald, the court specifically found \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim Bruce Williams was forcibly confined or imprisoned . . . that during the course of said confinement the Defendants [Jaffray and Ronald Normandin] kept the location of the victim secret . . . [and] that the two Defendants . . . intended the confinement to be secret.\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>In his appeal in the Court of Appeals, defendant Jaffray argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction of secret confinement kidnapping. The panel agreed and reversed his conviction. We then granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 442 Mich 935 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">In determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to sustain a conviction, an appellate court is required to view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution and determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>People v Hampton, </em>407 Mich 354, 368; 285 NW2d 284 (1979), cert den 449 US 885 (1980). See also <em>Jackson v Virginia, </em>443 US 307; 99 S Ct 2781; 61 L Ed 2d 560 (1979), and <em>People v Wolfe, </em>440 Mich 508, 515; 489 NW2d 748 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The elements of the offense of \"kidnapping\u201d are not easily set forth in a short, simple statement. As Justice Boyle, writing for this Court, explained in <em>People v Wesley, </em>421 Mich 375; 365 NW2d 692 (1984), Michigan\u2019s kidnapping statute<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> encompas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ses six forms of conduct, each of which constitutes the crime of kidnapping. There the Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">[A] person can be convicted of kidnapping if it is proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he or she wilfully, maliciously, and without lawful authority,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">(a) forcibly or secretly confined or imprisoned any other person within this state against his will, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">(b) forcibly carried or sent such person out of this state, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">(c) forcibly seized or confined, or inveigled or kidnapped any other person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">(1) with intent to extort money or other valuable thing thereby, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">(2) with intent either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-12\">(A) to cause such person to be secretly confined or imprisoned in this state against his will, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-13\">(B) [to cause such person to be] in any way held to service against his will. <em>[Wesley, supra, </em>p 383.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">Although this articulation may appear to enumerate only five forms of kidnapping, the Court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-15\">The portion of the statute contained in (a) above actually contains two separate descriptions of punishable conduct: forcible confinement or imprisonment and secret confinement or imprisonment. <em>[Id., </em>p 384.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-16\">At issue in <em>Wesley </em>was whether the specific intent portion of the statute \"applies to <em>all </em>of the forms of conduct which precede it or applies only to the form of conduct which immediately precedes it, i.e., 'forcibly seize or confine, ... or inveigle or kidnap.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>p 383 (emphasis in original). The <em>Wesley </em>Court concluded that \"the 'intent section\u2019 of the statute applies only to the form of conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>which immediately precedes it,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and, therefore, does not apply to that portion of the statute which prohibits any person from \"forcibly or secretly confining] or imprisoning] any other person within this state against his will. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In other words, three of the six formulations of kidnapping within the Michigan statute do not require a showing of specific intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">(1) forcible confinement or imprisonment of another within this state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">(2) secret confinement or imprisonment of another within this state; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">(3) forcible carrying or sending of another out of this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">This important distinction in the statutory framework comports with the judicial purpose of deterring prosecutorial overcharging in connection with the kidnapping statute. <em>People v Otis Adams, </em>34 Mich App 546; 192 NW2d 19 (1971) (opinion of Levin, J.). Although \"asportation\u201d is not mentioned in the statute, asportation of the victim is a judicially required element of the crime of \"kidnapping by forcible confinement or imprisonment,\u201d having been read into the statute to sustain its constitutionality by distinguishing true kidnapping from common-law false imprisonment and other lesser crimes. <em>People v </em>Adams, 389 Mich 222; 205 NW2d 415 (1973).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>However, a showing of asportation is not required where the accused is charged with either secret confinement of the victim or forcible confinement with intent to secretly confine the victim. As this Court explained in <em>Wesley, </em>\"no movement is required <em>where the victim was secretly confined, </em>Perkins [Criminal Law (2d ed)], p 178.\u201d <em>Wesley, supra, </em>p 388 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Alternatively, where \"forcible confinement with intent to secretly confine\u201d is the crime, the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">specific intent requirement obviates the need to read an asportation element into the statute. The intent to cause the victim to be secretly confined substitutes for the requirement of asportation. See Perkins, Criminal Law (2d ed), p 178. <em>[Wesley, supra, </em>p 390.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In the case before us, we note that although the trial court specifically found that the location of the confinement was kept secret and that defendant Jaffray intended the confinement to be secret, the trial judge made no finding concerning the element of asportation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, we draw from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>Wesley </em>analysis two formulations of proscribed conduct that have possible application in this case. We refer to conduct</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">(1) where the perpetrator confines or imprisons the victim secretly against his will (secret confinement kidnapping);<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">(2) where the perpetrator forcibly seizes or confines the victim against his will with the intent to cause the victim to be secretly confined (forcible confinement with intent to secretly confine).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Despite the clear dichotomy between these two formulations of kidnapping, the Court of Appeals in the case at bar misinterpreted <em>Wesley </em>as requiring a showing of secret confinement <em>and </em>a showing of specific intent to secretly confine the victim in every case in which kidnapping by secret confinement is alleged.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This is contrary to the <em>Wesley </em>explanation that a kidnapping conviction may be premised on a showing of confinement that in fact is secret or upon a showing of forcible seizure or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>confinement with intent to secretly confine, whether or not the confinement remains a secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">With that clarification in mind, we turn to the task of determining whether sufficient evidence was produced in this case to support a finding of defendant\u2019s guilt of either of these two types of kidnapping. To this end, we shall first consider whether there was sufficient evidence of \"forcible confinement with intent to secretly confine,\u201d and then we shall examine the evidence tending to establish guilt of \"secret confinement kidnapping.\u201d Because we find sufficient evidence of either, and both, types of kidnapping, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred, and that reversal is required.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">To convict an accused of \"forcible confinement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>with intent to secretly confine,\u201d the prosecution must prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">(1) a forcible seizure, confinement, inveigling or kidnapping of another,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">(2) done wilfully, maliciously and without lawful authority,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">(3) with the intent to cause such person to be secretly confined or imprisoned within the state against his will. <em>[Wesley, </em>supra, p 389.][<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Defendant Jaffray does not dispute the existence of the first two elements,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> but asserts that he \"did not hide what was going on.\u201d However, our review of the record indicates that a rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Jaffray intended to secretly confine the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Proof of Jaffray\u2019s intent can be established inferentially on the basis of his conduct during the morning in question. <em>People v Love, </em>127 Mich App 596; 339 NW2d 493 (1983). As already noted, Jaffray provided a detailed account of his involvement in Williams\u2019 confinement in a statement to police, which was admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In his statement, Jaffray acknowledged that he actively participated in the initial confinement of Williams, binding his hand-cuffed wrists and feet with a cord. Although Williams offered to help in the first search for the dog, Jaffray denied his request and guarded Williams while a codefendant set out to recover the missing dog in Jaffray\u2019s car. A reasonable inference can be drawn that the purpose of Jaffray\u2019s decision to guard the shackled victim in the living room of the home was to deny Williams the opportunity to alert others of his predicament.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The manifestation of Jaffray\u2019s intent is further evidenced by his response to the first unsuccessful search by a codefendant. Again, in lieu of allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Williams to help in the second search for the dog, Jaffray and a codefendant departed while, at Jaffray\u2019s suggestion, the other codefendant stayed behind to guard Williams. It could be reasonably inferred that Jaffray would not allow Williams, the only person who knew the precise location of the dog, to assist in the search because he wanted to maintain the secrecy of Williams\u2019 confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The strongest evidence of Jaffray\u2019s intent to secretly confine the victim was provided by the action he took when he learned of efforts by Williams to alert others. As Jaffray admitted in his statement, upon returning to the home after the second unsuccessful effort to retrieve the dog, Mrs. Lois Normandin informed the codefendants that Williams had been \"making a lot of noise.\u201d Jaffray\u2019s response was to join a codefendant in moving Williams to the basement, where Jaffray tied the victim to a pole and \"gagged\u201d his mouth. Clearly, this action was taken by Jaffray to prevent Williams from communicating his plight to others, in an effort to preserve the secrecy of the confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Defendant Jaffray points to Ronald Normandin\u2019s disclosure to Kennedy as evidence that there was a lack of secrecy. However, that action by Ronald is not material to the issue of Jaffray\u2019s intent in the absence of knowledge by Jaffray that such a disclosure had been made. In his statement to police, Jaffray made clear that he was unaware of the fact that Ronald had informed Kennedy of Williams\u2019 plight,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Even if one were to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Ronald did not intend to secretly confine Williams, the same could not be said of Jaffray.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">We find that the evidence produced was sufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt by a rational factfinder that defendant Jaffray forcibly seized or confined Williams with the intent to secretly confine him.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">To be guilty of secret confinement kidnapping, an accused must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">1. Willfully, maliciously, and without legal authority[,]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">2. Secretly confine or imprison another person[,]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">3. By force/without consent. [12 Michigan Practice, Criminal Law, \u00a7 9.16, p 283.][<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">Given the facts of this case, our analysis of the application of this form of kidnapping necessarily focuses on the knowledge of third persons regarding the victim\u2019s plight and its effect on the element of secret confinement. Defendant asserts that secret confinement kidnapping cannot be established unless the victim is placed in a situation in which his location will not be discovered within a reasonable period of time, citing <em>People v </em>Johnson, 171 Mich App 801; 430 NW2d 828 (1988), <em>People v McNeal, </em>152 Mich App 404; 393 NW2d 907 (1986), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>and <em>People v Lucille </em>Walker, 135 Mich App 311, 325-326; 355 NW2d 385 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Defendant Jaffray contends that the element of secret confinement was not established in this case because others outside the group living at the Normandin house learned from one of the perpetrators that Williams, the victim, was being detained in the upstairs portion of the house. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">As we read the kidnapping statute in the light of <em>Wesley </em>and its progeny, mere awareness by a third party of the victim\u2019s plight is not dispositive. In some situations, other factors must be taken into account in determining whether the conduct of an accused constitutes secret confinement kidnapping. In <em>People v Lucille Walker, supra, </em>our Court of Appeals quoted with approval the Missouri Supreme Court, which construed a similar kidnapping statute and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">\"Secret confinement, within the meaning of \u00a7 559.240, does not require proof of total concealment and complete isolation whereby the victim is rendered invisible to the entire world. It is sufficient to show that the person kidnapped has been effectively confined against his will in such a manner that he is prevented from communicating his situation to others and accused\u2019s intention to keep the victim\u2019s predicament secret is made manifest.\u201d <em>State v Weir, </em>506 SW2d 437, 440 (Mo, 1974). <em>[Id., </em>pp 325-326.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The <em>Lucille Walker </em>panel considered the plight of a number of elderly women allegedly held secretly against their will,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>These women were not forcibly seized and removed to a hiding place for the purpose of extortion. They were transported openly in tourist class seats on a Delta Airlines flight which was filled to capacity from Miami via Ft. Lauderdale to Detroit Metropolitan Airport. They exited through a public terminal. . . . The ladies admitted that while at the house [in Michigan] they saw, but did not complain to, an attorney, a bank clerk, two plumbers, a gas company meter man, and two handymen. . . . <em>There were many windows to the world open to [the </em>victims]. <em>[Id., </em>pp 324-325. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">As the final sentence suggests, in cases dealing with secret confinement kidnapping, a proper focus is on the channels of communication available to the victim. Although a third person may have suspicions or even knowledge concerning a confinement, unless he is aware of the specific location of the victim, the victim may be deprived of the ability to communicate his plight to others.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In other words, absolute, prolonged secrecy is not always required to sustain the charge; it is enough that secrecy, or the attempt to maintain secrecy, denied the victim the opportunity to avail himself of outside help._</p>\n<p id=\"AEd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>In <em>McNeal, supra, </em>p 412, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">There is very little case law in Michigan to indicate what constitutes \"secret confinement.\u201d . . . One thing is obvious. \"Secret\u201d confinement is to be distinguished from confinement in a public place such as a jail or a mental institution. ... In general, we believe that secret confinement is confinement in a place or manner which makes it unlikely that members of the public will know or learn of the victim\u2019s unwilling confinement within a reasonable period of time. Moreover, in order to establish secret \"confinement\u201d or \"imprisonment,\u201d some significant type or amount of detention may be required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Although this explanation by the <em>McNeal </em>panel is instructive, we find it too narrow to be useful as a standard for all cases in which secret confinement is charged. For example, we disagree with the <em>McNeal </em>articulation to the extent it can be read to limit secret confinement kidnapping to those situations in which it is unlikely that members of the public will learn of the victim\u2019s unwilling confinement within a reasonable period of time. There are other factual scenarios that constitute secret confinement which fall outside the <em>McNeal </em>parameters, as where the <em>con\u00f1nement </em>is known by third parties but the <em>location </em>of confinement is unknown to others. See <em>Johnson, supra, </em>pp 806-807.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Other jurisdictions have adopted the concept that secret confinement does not require a showing of complete isolation of the victim, free from any knowledge by others of the detention.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> For example, in <em>People v Mulcahey, </em>72 Ill 2d 282; 381 NE2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>254 (1978), the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that \"the secret confinement contemplated by the statute may be shown by proof of the secrecy of both the confinement and place of confinement, <em>or of </em>either.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 285 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">As we read Michigan\u2019s kidnapping statute in light of the authorities, we conclude that the essence of \"secret confinement\u201d as contemplated by the statute is deprivation of the assistance of others by virtue of the victim\u2019s inability to communicate his predicament. \"Secret confinement\u201d is not predicated solely on the existence or nonexistence of a single factor. Rather, consideration of the totality of the circumstances is required when determining whether the confinement itself or the location of confinement was secret, thereby depriving the victim of the assistance of others. That others may be suspicious or aware of the confinement is relevant to the determination, but is not always dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Applying these principles to the evidence adduced at trial, we are convinced that a rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of secret confinement kidnapping. After Williams confessed to selling the dog and informed the codefendants of its location, Jaffray bound Williams with handcuffs and a rope, rendering the victim immobile. Jaffray then refused to allow Williams to participate in two subsequent searches for the dog, where Williams would have been visible to the outside world. Instead, Williams remained shackled on the living room floor, while either Jaffray or a codefendant kept guard. Throughout the duration of this episode, the victim\u2019s confinement was a secret to everyone outside the Normandin home.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">When Ronald Normandin disclosed to Curtis Kennedy that Williams was \"dog-tied\u201d upstairs, and Kennedy allegedly heard Williams upstairs screaming for help, the veil of secrecy was temporarily fractured, but it was not completely destroyed. After Kennedy returned to his home, he received no further information regarding Williams\u2019 plight or location.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Further, unbeknown to Kennedy or anyone else outside the Normandin home, Jaffray and a codefendant subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>moved the victim to the basement, clearly an area of greater isolation. Jaffray then \"gagged\u201d Williams to prevent him from screaming for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">After Williams was moved to the basement and gagged, the occupants of the Normandin home engaged in a concerted effort to maintain the secrecy of Williams\u2019 location.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In the light of this conduct on the part of Jaffray and the fact that the occupants of the home, including Jaffray, refused to divulge the location of the decedent after he was moved to the basement, a rational trier of fact could conclude that Williams\u2019 confinement in the basement was secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>As noted in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>p 807:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">[W]e believe that one could be secretly confined in the perpetrator\u2019s own home even though, once suspicion fell upon the perpetrator, one of the first logical places to look would be his home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Like the <em>Johnson </em>Court, we believe Williams could be, and was, secretly confined in the perpetrators\u2019 home<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> even though, once suspicion fell upon the defendants, Minnie Collins summoned the police to the defendants\u2019 home. Despite the fact that Kennedy and his mother were aware that Williams was being held against his will, they were not aware of the location of his confinement in the basement. Indeed, Kennedy believed that Williams was confined in the top floor of the three-level home. If Jaffray and a codefendant had not moved Williams to the basement, he might have been able to summon outside help before being bludgeoned with the nail-studded bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">We also reject Jaffray\u2019s argument that, on the basis of <em>McNeal, supra, </em>a secret confinement did not occur here because a disinterested person learned of the confinement within a reasonable period of time. Essentially, he asserts that the duration of the confinement was insufficient to establish the element of secrecy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">While the duration of the confinement is certainly relevant, as already indicated, we reiterate that \"secret confinement\u201d is not predicated upon a single factor. In this case, there is no doubt that the victim, throughout the period of his confine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ment in the basement, was effectively precluded from communicating his plight or location to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Although the duration of Williams\u2019 confinement in the basement before his death is not precisely fixed by the evidence, the record makes clear beyond doubt that the fatal beating did not occur immediately following his removal to the basement.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, we are satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>that a rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Williams was secretly confined in the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to justify a finding beyond a reasonable doubt by a rational trier of fact that defendant was guilty either of kidnapping by forcible confinement with intent to secretly confine or of kidnapping by secret confinement. Therefore, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to that Court for consideration of defendant Jaffray\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b446-6\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-14\"> MCL 750.349; MSA 28.581.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\"> Specifically, the information charged that the defendants \"wilfully, maliciously and without lawful authority forcibly or secretly confined the above-named complainant within the State of Michigan, against complainant\u2019s will, contrary to sec. 750.349, M.C.L.A.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b422-9\"> Mrs. Lois Normandin, mother of the Normandin brothers, owned and also resided in the house located at 16814 Strathmoor in the City of Detroit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b422-10\"> MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548.

See also <em>People v Mulcahey, supra, </em>p 285 (\"The victim in this case was 'secretly confined\u2019 as effectively in her own home as if defendant had asported her to some remote isolated place of confinement\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\"> In Ronald Normandin\u2019s redacted statement, he recalled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">So, then we all went upstairs, and left Bruce in the basement.

Diefenbach did not recall seeing or hearing the victim on the morning in question. However, she further testified that after waking that morning, she went to the kitchen, which apparently adjoined the basement stairs. While in the kitchen, Diefenbach began preparing breakfast. Jaffray and Ronald then arrived in an automobile and entered the kitchen through a side door. After engaging in a brief conversation with Jaffray, Diefenbach began eating breakfast, which apparently consisted of eggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">Diefenbach testified that while she was eating, Hamilton came into the kitchen with a baseball bat on his shoulder and continued into the basement. After having an \"uneasy feeling\u201d and hearing \"some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>noises downstairs,\u201d Diefenbach went upstairs to the bedroom. Thus, although Diefenbach never saw the victim that morning, Williams apparently had been moved to the basement before Diefenbach awoke, where he remained bound and gagged while she prepared and ate breakfast.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b446-7\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ0\">(concurring). I agree with Justice Griffin\u2019s result and much of his rationale. I write separately first to observe that I do not agree with Justice Levin\u2019s description of the majority opinion. Specifically, I do not agree that the majority \"concedes\u201d that the veil of secrecy was fractured. Cf. separate opinion of Levin, J., p 322, n 16. Justice Levin\u2019s characterization implies that the majority and separate opinions diverge because the majority finds a partial fracture as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">This appeal raises only an issue regarding sufficiency of the evidence of secret confinement. The defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on the basis of the duration of the confinement for obvious reasons; the confinement oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>curred over the course of several hours. I read the majority opinion to hold that the evidence of secret confinement was sufficient, not to agree that there are artificial parsing points in the continuity of activity, past which secret confinement must be reestablished.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">For the same reason, this is not an appropriate vehicle for either the majority or the separate opinion to address in dicta unraised issues regarding length of confinement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant did not argue before the trial court or in his brief to this Court that evidence of the length of confinement in the basement was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Further, although the separate opinion does not indicate how this case should be decided, to the extent that it implies that the incident was no more than a relatively \"minor confinement,\u201d I strongly disagree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant aided and abetted in a course of conduct so extreme in relation to its provocation that common sense suggests that it was likely to end, as it did, in someone\u2019s death. Indeed, it would appear that the Model Penal Code would permit a conviction of the most serious degree of kidnapping on the evidence presented. Model Penal Code, \u00a7 212.1(c) (quoted <em>post </em>at 324, n 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Finally, as the trial judge observed, there was no evidence that defendant Jaffray said anything to anybody about where the victim was, nor was there a \"[b]illboard saying who is being held . . . .\u201d If, as defendant Jaffray himself observed, the victim\u2019s screams are heard by those whom the captor can trust not to call the police, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the confinement still secret? Such observations simply underscore the fact that speculation regarding the \"absurd results\u201d of \"relatively minor confinements\u201d is without empirical support in this record or the thousands of cases this Court has reviewed in the decade since the decision in <em>People v Wesley, </em>421 Mich 375; 365 NW2d 692 (1984). <em>Post </em>at 324.</p>\n<judges id=\"b448-5\">Riley, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b448-6\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOu\"><em>(separate opinion). </em>Jaffray was convicted of kidnapping for \"forcibly or secretly con-fin[ing]\u201d Bruce Williams and for \"forcibly seiz[ing] or confin[ing]\u201d him with intent to cause Williams \"to be secretly confined or imprisoned.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The penalty for kidnapping is imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The prosecutor asserts that the crime of kidnapping was committed at the moment Bruce Williams was seized, handcuffed and his feet were tied.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The prosecutor has, in effect, conceded that there is no evidence that Jaffray intended to cause physical harm to Williams.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">I question whether the Legislature intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>make secret confinement a capital offense where, although the manner or length of confinement may not have been insignificant, there was evidence only of an intent <em>to conf\u00edne </em>and <em>no </em>evidence of an intent to harm the victim or hold the victim as a hostage for ransom or other felonious purpose. In the instant case, the purpose of the confinement was to recover a dog that had been stolen by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">I am concerned that the majority opinion in the instant case, and this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>People v Wesley, </em>421 Mich 375; 365 NW2d 692 (1984), may be read to permit charging a defendant with kidnapping <em>and </em>an underlying felony whenever the underlying felony involves an element of confinement, and to permit transforming a simple assault or false imprisonment into kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Because the majority adopts the <em>Wesley </em>view that \" 'no movement is required where the victim was secretly confined,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an offender might be charged with <em>both </em>kidnapping and another underlying crime that involves an element of confinement in any situation in which the underlying crime was committed in a private or secret place. Thus, a stairwell robbery in which the victim was confined might now be kidnapping <em>and </em>robbery as long as the victim was unable to communicate his plight to the outside world during the duration of the robbery. Similarly, a nighttime sexual assault in which the victim is wrestled to the ground and rendered unable to call for help might be both kidnapping and sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The majority\u2019s approach might facilitate the avoidance of the strictures of <em>People v Adams, </em>389 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Mich 222; 205 NW2d 415 (1973), aff'g 34 Mich App 546, 550; 192 NW2d 19 (1971),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> simply by substituting a charge of secret confinement kidnapping, rather than forcible confinement kidnapping, along with the underlying felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The majority opinion could be read to allow a trier of fact to convict a defendant of secret confinement kidnapping where the offender\u2019s actions are closer to the common-law offense of simple assault than to the capital offense of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The majority does not construe the kidnapping statute as requiring a \"significant type or amount of detention,\u201d as did the Court of Appeals in <em>People v McNeal, </em>152 Mich App 404, 412; 393 NW2d 907 (1986). Thus, any detention in which the victim is unable to communicate his plight to the outside world might now constitute kidnapping. Under the majority\u2019s approach, a frustrated worker might be said to have committed secret confinement kidnapping if he blocks the door of the office restroom and says to another employee who had already entered something like \"let\u2019s settle our disagreement once and for all. We\u2019re not going anywhere until we work this thing out.\u201d Clearly, there is a distinction between the behavior of the frustrated worker and a criminal who, after forcibly seizing his victim, secretly binds and gags that person. Yet, it appears that under the majority\u2019s approach both the frustrated worker and the criminal have each committed the same offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>I believe that, just as this and other courts have read an asportation requirement into the forcible confinement portion of the kidnapping statute to remedy that provision\u2019s potential overbreadth, it might be necessary to construe the secret confinement provision of the kidnapping statute as requiring some significant manner or length of detention. Otherwise, defendants might be convicted of \"true kidnapping\u201d when they have merely committed false imprisonment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">When the Penal Code was enacted in 1931,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a sentence of life imprisonment or for any term of years<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> could only be imposed where an <em>assault </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>\"with intent to commit the crime of murder\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or \"with intent to rob and steal\u201d by a person armed with a dangerous weapon,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or for an assault (\"forcibly seizing] or confining]\u201d) with intent to cause the victim \"to be secretly confined or imprisoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AC74\">The maximum sentence that could be imposed for an assault with \"intent to do great bodily harm, less than the crime of murder\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is ten years, for an assault with force and violence, and with intent to rob and steal (unarmed)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it is fifteen years, and for an assault with \"intent to commit criminal sexual conduct involving sexual penetration\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it is ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In light of the legislative judgment that a sentence for life or any term of years should be imposed where the assault involved an intent to commit murder or armed robbery, and that the maximum sentence for an assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder or with intent to commit unarmed robbery or with intent to commit rape should be a maximum of ten or fifteen years, I doubt that the Legislature intended that a person be subject to conviction of the capital offense of kidnapping, subjecting the offender to a life sentence or a box score sentence,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> where the assault \u2014 \"forcibly seizing] or confining]\u201d \u2014 was committed only with the intent to \"secretly confine\u201d and without intent to cause physical harm or hold the victim for ransom or to facilitate the commission of another felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The majority holds that a rational trier of fact could have found that Jaffray in fact secretly confined Bruce Williams because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">1) From the time Jaffray initially bound Williams on the living room floor to the time that Curtis Kennedy learned that Williams was being held in the house and heard Williams\u2019 screams, nobody outside the house knew of Williams\u2019 confinement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">2) After Jaffray learned that Williams\u2019 screams may have been audible outside the house, he moved Williams to the basement, \"clearly an area of greater isolation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">3) After moving Williams to the basement, Jaffray was part of a concerted effort to \"maintain the secrecy of Williams\u2019 location.\u201d <em>[Ante, </em>pp 310-311.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Taking the last factor first, an accused could not be convicted of secret confinement kidnapping however strong his desire to secretly confine the victim if the confinement was not in fact secret. Jaffray\u2019s participation in a concerted effort to maintain the secrecy of Williams\u2019 confinement is not pertinent to a determination whether Williams was in <em>fact </em>secretly confined. Indeed, the majority notes that a specific intent to confine is not an element of secret confinement kidnapping.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Nor did Jaffray commit secret confinement kidnapping by carrying Williams to the basement. By the time Williams was carried to the basement, he had already communicated his plight to the outside world \u2014 and thereby foiled his captors\u2019 efforts to keep his confinement secret \u2014 by screaming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>through the window of the upstairs bedroom where he was being held.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The majority implies, however, that Jaffray\u2019s carrying Williams to the basement is relevant to whether Jaffray secretly confined Williams because transporting Williams to the basement reestablished the secrecy of Williams\u2019 confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The majority stresses that, while the outside world may have known of Williams\u2019 confinement and of his need for help, nobody outside the house knew that Williams was being held in the basement, and his confinement there was thus secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Curtis Kennedy and his mother were aware that Williams was being held captive in the house and were aware that Williams needed help. While it is true that neither Kennedy nor his mother knew exactly where in the house Williams was being held, they had enough information \u2014 as a result of Williams\u2019 earlier communication of his plight \u2014 to summon help for Williams, and the officers who responded to their call <em>went into the </em>basement<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and would probably have been able to rescue Williams from the basement if he had not been killed before their arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">JafFray\u2019s movement of Williams to the basement did not reestablish the secrecy of his confinement. It did not disable Kennedy and his mother from sending assistance to Williams. The veil of secrecy that was broken by Williams\u2019 screams from the bedroom was not \"temporarily\u201d but, rather, \"permanently\u201d shattered by those screams. The loca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>tion of Williams\u2019 confinement was not secret after he was moved to the basement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The majority emphasizes that a reasonable fact-finder could find that Jaffray committed secret confinement kidnapping because nobody in the outside world knew of Williams\u2019 confinement between the time that Williams was initially bound in the living room and the time that Curtis Kennedy learned of his condition.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> I agree with the majority that the confinement during this indeterminate period was secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">It is again noteworthy that Jaffray had no intent to harm Williams. He sought to assure that Williams did not run away before the dog was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">I do not wish to be understood as suggesting that what occurred here should not be subject to more serious penalties than for an ordinary assault. Nor would I contend that this particular defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>guilty of nothing more than the common-law offense of false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The Model Penal Code establishes a carefully tiered offense and sentencing system to address the tendency of broadly worded kidnapping statutes to yield absurd results in many cases of relatively minor confinements.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>In a recent case, one of the justices called upon the Legislature to address the problem of sentencing youthful offenders for capital offenses. In the same spirit, I call upon the Legislature to address the many problems created by our kidnapping statute. I respectfully suggest that the Legislature study the Model Penal Code provisions for kidnapping and the accompanying commentaries<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>view to reconstructing the kidnapping statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The concurring opinion makes a number of points to which I now respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The concurring opinion states \"Specifically, I do not agree that the majority 'concedes\u2019 that the veil of secrecy was fractured.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A19\">The referenced sentence in the majority opinion reads as follows: \"When Ronald Normandin disclosed to Curtis Kennedy that Williams was 'dog tied\u2019 upstairs, and Kennedy allegedly heard Williams upstairs screaming for help, the veil of secrecy was temporarily fractured, but it was not completely destroyed.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, the reference to the majority opinion is accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">The concurring opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">The prosecutor has not \"conceded\u201d that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>defendant did not intend to cause physical harm to the victim.[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The following is an excerpt from the prosecutor\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">What is truly remarkable about this case is that two \"technically\u201d separate offenses were committed by different defendants during the same criminal episode. The evidence adduced at the trial of Jaffray and the Normandin brothers showed that their only intent was to commit secret confinement kidnapping. They only intended to confine Bruce Williams in order to force him to reveal the location where he sold Ronald Normandin\u2019s dog for crack cocaine. Jaffray\u2019s written statement shows that they intended to release him after the dog was retrieved. Due both to a pre-existing grudge and to the fact that Williams had stolen his friend\u2019s dog, Francis Hamilton apparently took it upon himself to beat Williams to death with a baseball bat.[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">While there is evidence that Jaffray bound and gagged Williams, there is no evidence that he beat Williams or encouraged others to do so. Nor would \"common sense suggest\u201d that, from the beginning, this incident \"was likely to end, as it did, in someone\u2019s death.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> When Jaffray and the Norman-dins initially bound Williams, they had no intention of harming him, and they had no reason to believe that Hamilton would, in the prosecutor\u2019s words, take \"it upon himself\u201d to kill Williams. When the incident began, there was no indication that Hamilton might become involved in the situation, much less kill Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Because Jaffray did not intend to harm or terrorize Williams, it does not appear that the Model <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Penal Code would permit a conviction of the most serious grade of kidnapping as the concurring opinion suggests.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Rather, under the Model Penal Code, the crime of false imprisonment appears to most appropriately apply to Jaffray\u2019s conduct, although Jaffray might also have committed felonious restraint.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The concurring opinion asserts that in none of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the \"thousands of cases this Court has reviewed in the decade since the decision in <em>People v </em>Wesley, 421 Mich 375; 365 NW2d 692 (1984),\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> has this Court been presented with a situation in which a defendant was convicted of kidnapping on the basis of a relatively minor confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">While this Court has reviewed thousands of cases, indeed even thousands of criminal cases, in the decade since <em>Wesley </em>was decided, it most assuredly has not reviewed thousands, or even hundreds, of kidnapping cases. It has reviewed even fewer secret confinement kidnapping cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">This Court generally sees an application for leave to appeal only in a case in which a lengthy term of imprisonment has been imposed. Thus, we do not know to what extent charges of secret confinement kidnapping are washed out in plea bargaining in exchange for charge or sentencing concessions. Because an accused charged with a capital offense carrying a potential life sentence might be constrained to plead guilty to a lesser offense or to agree to the imposition of a particular sentence, it is especially important that the substantive law of kidnapping recognize the risk and potential for overcharging.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\"> The fact that the focus of the trial and appeal was on the entire length of confinement in the house accounts for the fact that the record does not reflect the length of time the victim was confined in the basement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\"> The prosecutor has not \"conceded\u201d that the defendant did not intend to cause physical harm to the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-11\"> Kidnapping is proscribed and defined in \u00a7 349 of the Penal Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">Any person who wilfully, maliciously and without lawful authority shall forcibly or secretly confine or imprison any other person within this state against his will, or shall forcibly carry or send such person out of this state, or shall forcibly seize or confine, or shall inveigle or kidnap any other person with intent to extort- money or other valuable thing thereby or with intent either to cause such person to be secretly confined or imprisoned in this state against his will, or in any way held to service against his will, shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years.

The challenge, in other words, is to define the crime in terms that identify a distinct kind of wrongful act. This goal requires avoidance of two related dangers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">First, the entire range of misconduct based on unlawful confinement of another must not be lumped together in one undifferentiated offense for purposes of grading. The person who physically restrains another on a public street in order to drive a point home is guilty of wrongful interference with the other\u2019s personal liberty, but a rational penal code must distinguish such conduct from prolonged confinement and isolation from the protection of the law. Even instances of more serious misbehavior, such as locking another in a closet for several hours, should be treated differently from abduction for ransom. Finally, the extreme gravity of sanctions authorized under existing law is related to the prospect that the victim will not emerge alive. This danger is precluded if the kidnapper voluntarily releases his captive, and the law should take some account of such action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">The Model Code addresses these concerns by defining three progressively less serious offenses and distributing them across a wide range of felony and misdemeanor sanctions. The reasoning behind the definition of the lesser crimes of felonious restraint and false imprisonment is explained in the commentary to Sections 212.2 and 212.3, respectively. Grading within the kidnapping offense is discussed in Comments 4 and 5 below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">The other potential danger which a rational penal code must avoid is that the definition of kidnapping will sweep within its scope conduct that is decidedly wrongful but that should be punished as some other crime. Thus, for example, the robber who forces his victim to move from one room to another in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>order to find a cashbox or open a safe technically may commit kidnapping as well as robbery. This reasoning raises the possibility of cumulative penalties or of higher sanctions for kidnapping, even though the \"removal\u201d of the victim to another place was part and parcel of the robbery and not an independent wrong. Similarly, many instances of forcible rape involve some coerced movement of the victim or unlawful restraint for enough time to complete the sex act. Again, the actor may be liable for both kidnapping and rape, even though such asportation or detention of the victim is a criminologically insignificant circumstance in a course of conduct constituting rape. Definition of kidnapping to exclude such cases is a task of special subtlety for, unless particular care is taken, trivial aspects of robbery, rape, or some other crime will end up classified as the most serious version of kidnapping.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b459-12\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 314.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b459-13\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 310.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 315, n 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\"> Prosecutor\u2019s brief, p 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"Abi\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 315.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The concurring opinion suggests that Jaffray could be guilty of kidnapping under \u00a7 212.1(c) of the Model Penal Code, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">212.1 Kidnapping</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">A person is guilty of kidnapping if he unlawfully removes another from his place of residence or business, or a substantial distance from the vicinity where he is found, or if he unlawfully confines another for a substantial period in a place of isolation, with any of the following <em>purposes:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">(c) <em>to indict bodily injury on or to terrorize the victim or another </em>....
