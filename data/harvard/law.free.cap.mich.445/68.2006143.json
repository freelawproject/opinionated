It is also undisputed that she suffers an ongoing total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s injury initially caused her to miss five days of work. She eventually returned to her job and worked until March 1985 with various medical restrictions. Her last day was March 5, 1985, at which time defendant began paying benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Corrective surgery was performed on her wrist that March, but she never regained the complete use of her hand. After the surgery she saw several doctors and therapists, but could not return to work because defendant failed to offer work suitable to her medical restrictions. Plaintiff regularly called defendant regarding the availability of work. Defendant regularly informed her that none was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s treating physician concluded that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>was permanently disabled in October 1985. Unhappy with this diagnosis, defendant sent her to one of its doctors. Defendant\u2019s doctor examined her and placed her on disability for six additional weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Approximately six weeks later, plaintiff returned to work and received \"favored work\u201d\u2014 sweeping floors. She quickly discovered, however, that she could not perform this job without aggravating her wrist. Defendant and plaintiff\u2019s union came to an agreement, and plaintiff was sent home that day with the understanding that defendant would continue to pay benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">On May 27, 1986, defendant sent plaintiff to see another doctor. That doctor concluded that plaintiff could not return to her former job and that it was very likely that she was permanently disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Shortly after this diagnosis, and after having tried to secure work within her restrictions for well over a year, plaintiff decided to move to Florida. This allowed her to be closer to her family, and she believed the warm weather was better for her wrist. On June 27, 1986, she notified defendant in writing that she was moving and that any further correspondence could be directed to her new address in Florida or to her attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff sold all of her belongings and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">In a letter mailed July 15, 1986, and received July 28, 1986,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> defendant notified plaintiff that a job within her restrictions was now available. After first stalling for time to consult her attorney, she eventually rejected this offer because she now considered herself a permanent resident of Flor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ida. Defendant stopped paying benefits and plaintiff began this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">At the hearing, the magistrate held that plaintiff\u2019s refusal of defendant\u2019s bona fide offer of \"favored work\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was reasonable. On appeal, the wcab affirmed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">[W]e find from the facts that plaintiff had relocated to Florida in June of 1986 and intended to stay in Florida on a permanent basis. Plaintiff was attempting to seek work in Florida, had signed a lease with the condominium association, and was reliant upon family members as she had sold all of her possessions prior to leaving Toledo, Ohio. We find that plaintiff was credible in her testimony and accept that she planned to reside in Florida on a permanent basis. The record discloses that there was nothing to her knowledge that would have her return to Michigan since at the time of her move she did not know that defendant was seeking favored work for her. [Unpublished decision of the wcab, mailed December 20, 1990 (Decision No. 1617), slip op at 6.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The wcab concluded, as did the magistrate, that defendant had made a bona fide offer of \"favored work,\u201d but that plaintiff\u2019s refusal was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Defendant appealed, again arguing that plaintiff\u2019s refusal was unreasonable. Plaintiff failed to cross appeal on the issue whether the job offer was a bona fide offer of reasonable employment. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the WCAB.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">The only disputed issue properly before us in this appeal is whether plaintiff unreasonably re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>fused defendant\u2019s bona fide offer of favored work. We conclude that the appeal board\u2019s decision that plaintiff is entitled to continuing benefits because her refusal of favored work was reasonable is based on an error of law and should therefore be reversed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">[I]t is clear that, inasmuch as plaintiff did not have employment in Florida, her choices, when favored work was offered by defendant, were to accept such work or have her disability benefits terminated. Any other resolution would be contrary to the purpose of the act, as interpreted by our Supreme Court and as enacted, in acquiescence to that interpretation, by the Legislature. [196 Mich App 91, 93-94; 492 NW2d 778 (1992). Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-13\"> If an employee receives a bona fide offer of reasonable employment from the previous employer, another employer, or through the Michigan employment security commission and the employee refuses that employment without good and reasonable cause, the employee shall be considered to have voluntarily removed himself or herself from the work force and is no longer entitled to any wage loss benefits under this act during the period of such refusal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-14\"> Plaintiff disputes the conclusion that the job offered met the statutory definition of \"reasonable employment.\u201d We find that this issue is not properly preserved because plaintiff failed to cross appeal on this issue. See <em>Booth Newspapers, Inc v Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents, </em>444 Mich 211, 234; 507 NW2d 422 (1993).

These findings are supported by competent evidence on the record and no fraud has been alleged. This Court may therefore not disturb those findings ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">I would affirm the wcab\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s refusal was for good and reasonable cause. <em>[Id. </em>at 95-96. Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">The Legislature partially codified the judicially created favored-work doctrine in the reasonable employment provisions of the worker\u2019s compensation act. MCL 418.301; MSA 17.237(301), and MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>418.401; MSA 17.237(401).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, these provisions are far more than a simple compilation of this Court\u2019s prior favored-work decisions. While building on some of those decisions, some of these provisions have significantly changed others. Although the Legislature has made significant changes in the favored-work doctrine, this Court need not ignore all of its prior favored-work decisions in their entirety.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">For example, it is a well-established rule of statutory construction that the Legislature is presumed to be aware of judicial interpretations of existing law when passing legislation. <em>Dean v Chrysler Corp, </em>434 Mich 655, 667, n 18; 455 NW2d 699 (1990). Therefore, when the Legislature codifies a judicially defined requirement without defining it itself, a logical conclusion is that the Legislature intended to adopt the judiciary\u2019s interpretation of that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">This conclusion is also supported by the associated rule of construction that provides that words and phrases that have acquired a unique meaning at common law are interpreted as having the same meaning when used in statutes dealing with the same subject. <em>Thornton v Allstate Ins Co, </em>425 Mich 643, 648; 391 NW2d 320 (1986); MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1). The statutory requirement of \"good and reasonable cause\u201d is analogous to the common-law requirement of \"good faith or reasonableness.\u201d <em>Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172, 178; 312 NW2d 640 (1981). The statutory requirement is too similar to the common-law requirement to be dismissed as coincidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Applying these basic rules of construction to the statute at hand, we think it obvious that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Legislature did not, nor did it intend to, change the common law for this specific requirement. Accordingly, we turn to an examination of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">This Court examined an offer of favored work and the reasonableness of its refusal in <em>Kolenko v United States Rubber </em>Products, <em>Inc, </em>285 Mich 159; 280 NW 148 (1938). In that case, the plaintiff suffered a compensable injury to her arm. After paying compensation for a short period, the defendant stopped. The plaintiff sued, and at the subsequent hearing the defendant alleged that the plaintiff had refused an offer of substitute employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The offer was in the form of a request by the defendant that the plaintiff come to the plant where she would be given work. The plaintiff, accompanied by her attorneys, went to the plant to see what type of job the defendant intended to give her. The defendant, however, refused to provide any details of the job. The defendant also refused to allow the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys into the plant to determine whether she was capable of performing the unspecified job.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The defendant maintained that these events demonstrated the plaintiff\u2019s unreasonable refusal to cooperate with the defendant. Thus, the defendant argued, her benefits should be denied. This Court flatly rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiff had acted unreasonably.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">The burden was on the defendant to show that it offered plaintiff work which she could perform. . . . Plaintiff was under no obligation to comply with the unreasonable and arbitrary de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>mand of defendant that she accept whatever work the company thought suitable for her. Plaintiff in her attitude and conduct with regard to the proposed job clearly appears to have been actuated by good faith. The law does not compel her to submit to the capricious dictates of an employer with regard to the kind of work she must accept in order to show cooperation. The only lack of cooperation that appears from the record in this case is on the part of defendant. <em>[Id. </em>at 162.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The Court held that the actions of both the employer and the employee must be judged against standards of good faith and reasonableness. This type of analysis suggests that these questions are questions of fact and, as such, they are committed to the discretion of the factfinder. The <em>Kolenko </em>Court said as much when it held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">The findings of fact of the department were supported by evidence and according to the provisions of the statute are conclusive. These, together with the conduct of defendant regarding plaintiff\u2019s reemployment, require that the award of the department of labor and industry be affirmed, with costs to plaintiff. <em>[Id. </em>at 163.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The Court reached this conclusion by examining the conduct of the parties. An examination of the conduct of the parties is, by its very nature, a factual examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The <em>Kolenko </em>decision was essentially reaffirmed by this Court in <em>Bower, </em>a case decided only , weeks before the enactment of 1981 PA 200. In <em>Bower, </em>the plaintiff suffered a compensable work-related injury. Aggravations of the injury over a span of three-years resulted in the plaintiff quitting his job and moving to Florida. The plaintiff found suitable employment in Florida, but was notified by the defendant nine months after his arrival there, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>on the eve of trial, that favored work was now available at the defendant\u2019s plant in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">This Court held that the primary purpose of the favored-work doctrine is mitigation. The common-law doctrine of mitigation is founded on reasonableness, and application of a reasonableness standard requires the factfinder to examine the facts and circumstances of each case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The reasonableness of the employee\u2019s actions as well as the employee\u2019s good faith, or lack thereof, are factors that must be considered in determining whether the employee\u2019s refusal of favored work will result in a forfeiture of benefits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">In reaching our decision, we find that the good faith or reasonableness of a worker\u2019s actions must be taken into account in determining whether the forfeiture penalty should be imposed, and, further, that factors other than those relating to the physical capacity to perform favored work may be considered in assessing the reasonableness of the refusal. <em>[Bower </em>at 178-179.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Refusal is justified if it is reasonable and furthers the policies underlying the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">In applying this standard in <em>Bower, </em>this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">Denial [of benefits] would encourage an injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>worker to stagnate, awaiting the possibility that the original employer might offer a job sometime in the future. Certainly the employee would hesitate to seek or accept a job in another city, when he or she could be faced with the no-win choice of incurring the expense and emotional upheaval of returning or suffering a cutoff of benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">Denial would also discourage employers from hiring disabled workers. New employers would be willing to take the risk of employing, and perhaps retraining, injured persons, only to have them forced to quit when called upon by the former employer. <em>[Id. </em>at 192-193.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">This Court noted that allowing Bower to collect benefits could encourage injured workers to move away, in an attempt to avoid having to accept favored work while continuing to receive benefits. However, the high cost of relocation, both financially and emotionally, makes this an unlikely danger. Furthermore, this Court realized that the \"rare\u201d employee who moves in a bad-faith effort to avoid having to accept favored work would be denied benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">This Court emphatically rejected a blanket rule denying benefits whenever an employee moves away from the locale of the employer. \"[A]n employer should [not] be able to exert such control over an individual without an assessment of the unique factors in each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\"><em>Bower, </em>like <em>Kolenko, </em>makes clear that the reasonableness of an employee\u2019s actions are questions of fact. Although not made explicit in <em>Bower, </em>this proposition permeates the entire discussion in that case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>[F]actors other than a claimant\u2019s physical ability to perform the work may be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of the refusal, our function as a reviewing court is <em>extremely limited. </em>The findings of fact of the wcab are <em>conclusive </em>in the absence of fraud and will not be disturbed if supported by competent evidence in the record. <em>[Id. </em>at 197. Emphasis added and citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Given the timing of <em>Bower, </em>decided November 23, 1981, some may question the effect it may have had on the reasonable employment provisions of the worker\u2019s compensation act that took effect January 1, 1982.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That question need not be answered here. <em>Bower </em>does not represent a change in the law; rather, it represents a consolidation of the favored-work doctrine. It solidified and made clear that a reasonableness analysis must be undertaken when examining an employee\u2019s refusal of favored work. This conclusion was not, and is not, revolutionary. This type of analysis has been a part of the favored-work doctrine since <em>Kolenko </em>was decided over fifty years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The Legislature incorporated this Court\u2019s common-law requirement of reasonableness into the worker\u2019s compensation act when it mandated that a refusal of reasonable employment must be for good and reasonable cause..This requirement, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>developed in <em>Kolenko </em>and <em>Bower, </em>calls for case-by-case analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In determining whether a refusal of reasonable employment is for good and reasonable cause, the dispositive questions are questions of fact, not law. Findings of fact in worker\u2019s compensation proceedings, if supported by any competent evidence, are conclusive on the courts of this state in the absence of fraud or unless otherwise provided by law. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28; <em>Holden v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 257, 262; 484 NW2d 227 (1992); MCL 418.861a(14); MSA 17.237(861a)(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We do not attempt to define what \"good and reasonable cause\u201d is. What is reasonable in one situation may not be in another. Therefore no exhaustive definition could ever be formed to encompass the varied nuances of such a deceptively simple legal principle as \"good and reasonable cause.\u201d The case at bar does, however, provide examples of some of the factors that may be considered in gauging the reasonableness of an employee\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Those factors may include: (1) the timing of the offer, (2) if the employee has moved, the reasons for moving,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (3) the diligence of the employee in trying to return to work, (4) whether the employee has actually returned to work with some other employer and, (5) whether the effort, risk, sacrifice or expense is such that a reasonable person would not accept the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">We provide these factors merely as examples. Not every personal consideration will constitute good and reasonable cause entitling an employee to continued benefits after a refusal of an offer of reasonable employment. It is left to the sound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>discretion of the factfinder to carefully examine the facts and circumstances of each case to determine what is good and reasonable cause in any given situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The date of injury in this case is after the effective date of MCL 418.301(5)(a); MSA 17.237(301)(5)(a); therefore, that statute controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Whether this Court believes that plaintiff\u2019s refusal of the offer was for good and reasonable cause is immaterial. Our only concern is whether the wcab applied the correct legal test and whether there is any competent evidence to support its factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Even though the wcab failed to substantively develop its analysis, it did apply the correct legal test.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">The question before us is whether a good-faith bona fide offer of favored work was made by defendant and whether plaintiff reasonably refused to perform the offer of favored work if such offer was reasonable. <em>Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172 (1981), <em>Powell v Casco Nelmor Corp, </em>406 Mich 332; 279 NW2d 769 (1979), and <em>Kolenko v U S Rubber Products, Inc, </em>285 Mich 159 (1938). In the case at hand, we find that plaintiff was not unreasonable in her refusal to return to Michigan from Florida to perform a bona fide offer of favored work. [Unpublished opinion of the wcab at 5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">Furthermore, a review of the record indicates that there is competent evidence to support the wcab\u2019s factual findings. The evidence shows that plaintiff called defendant repeatedly over a one-year period inquiring into the availability of work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>suited to her physical limitations. There was evidence that she tried to return to work as demonstrated by her failed attempt to perform the sweeping job. The wcab found as a matter of fact that plaintiff was credible and that she moved to Florida in a good-faith effort to improve her health, be closer to her family, and to find suitable work. She signed a one-year lease and paid a security deposit, thus substantiating her claim that she intended to live there permanently. Significantly, the wcab found, again as a matter of fact, that plaintiff did not move to avoid accepting the job offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We hold that \"good and reasonable cause\u201d is the statutory equivalent of the same requirement found in the judicially created favored-work doctrine. Whether an employee\u2019s refusal of an offer of reasonable employment is for good and reasonable cause is a question of fact. Our constitution gives considerable discretion to factfinders in worker\u2019s compensation proceedings. Neither this Court nor the Court of Appeals should usurp that discretion. Because the correct legal test was applied, we hold that the Court of Appeals should not have disturbed the factual findings of the wcab.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the wcab. We remand this case to the wcac for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-7\">Levin, Boyle, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b207-8\"> 1981 PA 200 and 1981 PA 199, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b207-9\"> Obviously, if there is a conflict between the common law and a statutory provision, the common law must yield.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b210-11\"> This Court is presently examining the issue of mitigation in <em>Marquis v Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity, </em>444 Mich 638; 513 NW2d 799 (1994).

Although the dollar amount of benefits payable to workers eligible for compensation was increased, there can be no doubt that the Legislature also intended through its 1980 and 1981 reform efforts to narrow and restrict the eligibility qualifications. <em>[Dean v Chrysler Corp, </em>434 Mich 655, 666-667; 455 NW2d 699 (1990).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">In addition, the economic and political climate of the time cannot be divorced from consideration of the legislative intent behind the reforms of 1980 and 1981 of the wdca. In my dissent in <em>Farrington v Total Petroleum, Inc, </em>442 Mich 201, 226; 501 NW2d 76 (1993), I stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">The amendments at issue were but a component of a broad reformation of the wdca, which was motivated by a crippled economic environment and a perceived need to reduce the burden and costs imposed upon free enterprise by the then-existing wdca.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>In light of this historical backdrop, I believe it appropriate to consider the favored-work doctrine and its place amidst the aforementioned reform efforts. In <em>Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172; 312 NW2d 640 (1981), a majority of this Court was called upon to discern the parameters of the favored-work doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\"><em>The primary purpose of the doctrine is that of mitigation. </em>It allows an employer to reduce or completely eliminate compensation payments by providing work within the injured employee\u2019s physical capacity. At the same time, it encourages the employee to return to productive employment rather than to remain idle, thus also serving a rehabilitative function. <em>[Id. </em>at 182. Emphasis added, citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-11\"><em>Bower </em>involved an injured employee who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>moved to Florida while. he was still receiving worker\u2019s disability benefits. Of specific importance to the majority were the facts that the plaintiff had moved nine months before the offer of favored work, that both he and his wife had found employment in Florida, and that the wages plaintiff earned in Florida were credited to the employer against its compensation liability. While recognizing that an employee\u2019s refusal of a favored-work offer was subject to a standard of reasonableness, the majority qualified its holding in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">It should be recognized that we do not hold that just any personal consideration may excuse a refusal of favored work. Nor may an employee avoid returning to work tendered upon a good-faith offer by merely removing himself from the locality of the employer. Only under circumstances similar to those in the instant case, <em>where the claimant\u2019s actions further the policies of the statute, </em>can such a rejection be justified. <em>[Id. </em>at 196.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Shortly thereafter, the Legislature codified the favored-work doctrine in 1981 PA 200. In light of the reform efforts prevalent at that time, I cannot but conclude that the act of codification, although validating certain aspects of the favored-work doctrine, was intended in part to prevent the types of expansive interpretation that were at the heart of the reform legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Thus, we are faced with a conflict. It is clear from the deferential standard of review that reviewing courts should not cavalierly disregard the fact-finding expertise of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Commission (and formerly, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>hand, the policies behind the wdca, which include the duty of an employee to accept reasonable offers of favored work, should not be discounted.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">While I agree that the determination whether an employee\u2019s refusal of favored work is reasonable is essentially a factual question, the determination whether the wcab or wcac applied the correct criteria in analyzing whether the refusal was reasonable is <em>not </em>a question of fact, and hence this Court is not constrained by the limited review applicable to factual findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the case at bar, the wcab failed to apply the correct criteria in determining that plaintiff\u2019s refusal was reasonable. Consequently, this Court is not precluded from reviewing the wcab\u2019s findings despite the fact that substantial, material, and competent evidence may exist to support the conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s refusal was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The findings and analysis of the wcab consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">Nonetheless, we find from the facts that plaintiff had relocated to Florida in June of 1986 and <em>intended </em>to stay in Florida on a permanent basis. Plaintiff was attempting to seek work in Florida, had signed a lease with the condominium association, and was reliant upon family members as she had sold all of her possessions prior to leaving Toledo, Ohio. We find that plaintiff was credible in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>her testimony and accept that <em>she planned to reside in Florida on a permanent basis. </em>The record discloses that there was nothing to her knowledge that would have her return to Michigan since at the time of her move she did not know that defendant was seeking favored work for her. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">It is evident from the above passage that the primary basis upon which the wcab rested its conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s refusal was reasonable was its determination that plaintiff <em>intended </em>to remain in Florida permanently. Although plaintiff\u2019s intent in moving to Florida is <em>one </em>factor to consider in determining whether her refusal was reasonable, it should not be dispositive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The guiding principle in determining whether a refusal of employment is reasonable should be whether such a refusal advances the policies of the worker\u2019s compensation legislation. Failure to properly consider the policy favoring mitigation is therefore an error of law that is not insulated from appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Borrowing the policy concept directly from <em>Bower, </em>as implicitly adopted in 1981 PA 200, the Court of Appeals majority focused not merely on the basic facts, but also on the facts as they related to this policy of facilitating reemployment and not continued unemployment. Under the facts of this case, which differ significantly from those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>in <em>Bower, </em>the majority concluded that plaintiff\u2019s actions failed to further the policies of the act and that her refusal of the bona fide work offer was therefore unreasonable. 196 Mich App 91, 94-95; 492 NW2d 778 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">To reconcile the conflict between an employer\u2019s interest in an employee\u2019s reemployment and the employee\u2019s interest in rehabilitation, which are equally important concerns as provided in <em>Bower </em>and implicit in the statute as it is now written, the reasonableness of an employee\u2019s rejection of a bona fide offer of reemployment must, take into account more than the employee\u2019s motivation for the move into a new locale. Rather, a factual balancing of interests is required under the totality of the circumstances. Examples of the appropriate questions include whether the employee has found alternative employment, how long the employee has been in the new locale, and the nature of any roots that an employee and family members establish in the new community. Without this inquiry, a factual assessment of reasonableness is incomplete because it would disregard the mitigation prong of the favored-work doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In the case before us, plaintiff did sell her home near the employer\u2019s plant, but her letter notifying the employer of her new address did not make clear that the move was to be permanent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, she initially accepted the offer of favored work over the telephone, but later rejected it after speaking with her attorney. Further, the record does not make clear that plaintiff had good prospects for employment in Florida. Accordingly, I am not convinced that plaintiff\u2019s rejection of favored work was reasonable in light of the circumstances, which do not take into account the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>interests and efforts to ensure reemployment through favored work.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Although I am not certain that plaintiff\u2019s rejection was unreasonable, the failure of the wcab to review plaintiff\u2019s claim in light of the purposes of the act, as it relates to the important interest in reemployment rather than unemployment, prevents me from accepting its factual findings without further inquiry. Accordingly, I would hold that a ruling by the wcab or the wcac that does not assess the facts in light of the aforementioned policy is insufficient as a matter of law. While an assessment of the facts that respects the mandates of this policy may remain inviolate absent fraud, an assessment that fails to respect the mandates of <em>Bower </em>and the statute, i.e., the policy favoring employment over unemployment that is based on personal reasons unrelated to the favored-work offer, cannot alone support a finding of reasonableness. While the hardship of relocation may be weighed in the factual balance, it is by no means dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">For all of the aforementioned reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals or remand for further consideration of the reasonableness of plaintiff\u2019s rejection.</p>\n<judges id=\"b222-6\">Brickley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-9\"> Indeed, the legislation\u2019s proponents explained that reducing the excessive costs of the then-current wdca was essential to the economic survival of Michigan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">\"Since 1979, and prior to that, 1978 during the elections, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>everybody said that worker\u2019s compensation is the highest priority in the State of Michigan.
