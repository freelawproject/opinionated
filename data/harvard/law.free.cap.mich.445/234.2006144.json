In deciding this issue, we must determine whether the hiring of permanent replacement workers obligates an employer to renew its offer of favored work to its injured employees, or whether the employee must take action to reinstate benefits. In the case of plaintiff-appellant James Zimmerman, who became fully disabled after the strike had begun, we must determine whether such total disability operates to revive his right to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>We conclude that where a striking favored worker has voluntarily ceased performance of favored work, benefits should be restored once the favored worker expresses a good-faith willingness to return to favored work, provided this willingness is communicated to the employer within a reasonable time after the cessation of favored work. Such benefits should not automatically be restored upon the hiring of permanent replacement workers by the employer. Additionally, we would hold that plaintiff Zimmerman\u2019s supervening heart attack, which rendered him totally disabled, revived his right to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">This dispute arose out of a labor strike between defendant-appellee Cadillac Malleable Iron Company and Local 784 of the uaw, of which plaintiffs-appellants, James Zimmerman and Roger Nederhood, were members. On September 30, 1981, the collective bargaining agreement between Cadillac and the union expired, and the union struck on October 1, 1981, when it became apparent that a new agreement was not forthcoming. At this time, approximately thirty-five proposals for a new contract were unresolved. Cadillac was demanding twenty-four additional language changes in the contract and the union was demanding a $2 per month increase in the employer\u2019s pension contribution for current retirees.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">On October 7, 1981, Cadillac modified its September 30 proposal and submitted it to the union. These modifications included an extension of seniority retention during layoff to thirty-six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This offer was rejected by the union and was withdrawn by Cadillac by October 22, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">On January 12, 1982, Cadillac officially informed the union that it would be hiring permanent replacement workers. At a January 18, 1982, bargaining session, the union attempted to accept the October 7, 1981, proposal, and offered to accept a dollar an hour cut in wages. Cadillac informed the union representative that the October 7 proposal had been withdrawn, and insisted on limiting wages to $6 per hour with no cost-of-living adjustment, and on limiting the number of plant classifications. The union representative terminated this meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">As of March, 1983, forty-one or forty-two replacement workers had been hired. At the time of the strike, approximately eighty workers had been employed by Cadillac. The record is silent with regard to whether plaintiffs\u2019 favored work positions had been given to permanent replacements.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">A hearing referee found both Zimmerman and Nederhood to have been partially disabled at the commencement of the strike, but determined that plaintiffs were not entitled to wage loss benefits for the period between October 1, 1981, and January 18, 1982, because of their participation in a strike.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The referee found, however, that wage loss benefits recommenced on January 18, 1982, determining that the union\u2019s \u201coffer to return\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>work on this date terminated any unreasonable refusal by plaintiffs to perform favored work.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Additionally, the hearing referee found that on February 4, 1982, plaintiff Zimmerman became totally disabled as a result of his supervening, non-work-related heart condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The wcab affirmed the hearing referee\u2019s findings with respect to injury dates and the cessation of benefits during the strike, but reversed the referee\u2019s determination that plaintiffs were entitled to restoration of wage loss benefits as of January 18, 1982, finding instead that there was no showing that plaintiffs themselves had offered to return to work at any time before the wcab hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 applications for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals were denied for lack of merit, and we remanded for consideration as on leave granted. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decisions of the wcab. In Zimmerman, it held that the wcab had not applied erroneous legal reasoning in determining that plaintiff\u2019s <em>individual </em>refusal to perform favored work while his union was on strike, and <em>not </em>the actions of the union in striking, provided a basis for denying benefits, and that such forfeiture continued for the duration of plaintiff\u2019s unwillingness to return to work. In <em>Nederhood, </em>it held that the wcab had correctly applied the law in determining that Nederhood\u2019s participation in the strike precluded him from collecting wage loss benefits during the pendency of the strike. The Court of Appeals also found that the record adequately supported the board\u2019s holding that plaintiffs had not personally offered to return to favored work, and that the union\u2019s January 18, 1982, \"offer\u201d was merely another proposal in a series of negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Additionally, in <em>Zimmerman, </em>it found that plaintiff\u2019s supervening heart attack did not render him eligible for benefits because he had failed to communicate his willingness to return to work before his supervening heart attack, thus failing to meet his burden of establishing his entitlement to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">On March 16, 1993, we granted leave to appeal, ordering that <em>Zimmerman </em>and <em>Nederhood </em>be submitted and argued together. 442 Mich 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the parties do not dispute that the plaintiffs were performing favored work at the time of the strike.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Additionally, the parties do not contest that before the union\u2019s offer to return to work on December 4, 1981, under a contract incorporating prestrike terms, plaintiffs were disqualified from receiving benefits on the basis of their voluntary cessation of favored work stemming from their participation in a strike.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We must now decide the duration of this disqualification._</p>\n<p id=\"Avo_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The general rule is that a refusal of suitable work suspends benefits for the duration of the refusal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although this Court has never expressly decided the question,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in <em>Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172; 312 NW2d 640 (1981), we utilized a case that supports this rule, and our decision in <em>Pigue v General Motors Corp, </em>317 Mich 311; 26 NW2d 900 (1947), seems also to imply a suspension of benefits instead of a permanent forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The <em>Bower </em>Court\u2019s citation, with apparent approval, of <em>PPG Industries, Inc v Aites, </em>7 Pa Commw Ct 588; 300 A2d 902 (1973), supports the conclusion that <em>Bower </em>envisioned only a temporary loss of benefits. In <em>PPG Industries, Inc, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>employee left his favored work to become a minister. Once it became evident that he was unable to earn a living as a minister, he attempted to find other light work. The court held that he had. not permanently forfeited his benefits by leaving favored work. The combination of the claimant\u2019s attempt to find employment other than as a minister and the unavailability of his old favored position triggered his eligibility for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The <em>Pigue </em>Court did not expressly address this issue because the claimant had returned to favored work upon settlement of the strike. In framing the issue, however, the Court stated that the pivotal question was whether the plaintiff was entitled to compensation <em>\"during the period of a strike </em>. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315. While the weight to be accorded this is minimal, it lends credence to the view that suspension is the sanction implicit in <em>Pigue. </em>Noteworthy, also, is that the <em>Pigue </em>Court neither stated nor intimated that a permanent forfeiture results.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Larson, in his treatise on worker\u2019s compensation, opines that a temporary forfeiture of benefits is the preferred sanction. Although discussed within the context of employee misconduct, the reasons underlying his conclusions apply with equal force to the striking employee. Larson states that an injured employee discharged for misconduct should not suffer a permanent loss of benefits. He draws an analogy to the unemployment context, in which misconduct-based discharges and voluntary quitting are handled by imposing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>penalty of a limited number of weeks. Likewise, he concludes that in the worker\u2019s compensation arena, the penalty for a voluntary cessation of favored work should also be limited to a loss of benefits for a period of weeks.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The Minnesota Supreme Court has grappled with this issue and determined that only a temporary forfeiture of benefits should result. <em>Marsolek v George A Hormel Co, </em>438 NW2d 922, 923 (Minn, 1989). In this case, a partially disabled employee, Marsolek, was terminated for misconduct during a strike against the employer. Marsolek had threatened to damage cars and injure employees attempting to cross the picket line. When the plant was reopened five months after the strike began, Marsolek was not invited to return. Except for a three-month period following the strike, he was unable to find employment, and filed a claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits, including a claim for lost wages. The court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">a justifiable discharge for misconduct <em>suspends </em>an injured employee\u2019s right to wage loss benefits; but the suspension of entitlement to wage loss benefits will be lifted once it has become demonstrable that the employee\u2019s work-related disability is the cause of the employee\u2019s inability to find or hold new employment. Such a determination should be made upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances including the usual work search \"requirements.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 924. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">In reaching this conclusion, the court noted that the purpose of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>was to compensate injured employees for a wage loss attributable to a work injury. On this basis, compensation has been denied where the record established only a discharge for misconduct;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but benefits have been awarded where the record evidenced misconduct, yet showed that the employee\u2019s injury was the cause of his inability to find other work.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The Court of Appeals has, on several occasions, spoken on the issue of permanent forfeiture. In <em>Hartsell v Richmond Lumber Co, </em>154 Mich App 523; 398 NW2d 456 (1986), the employee left his favored work as a night watchman and began working elsewhere. Hartsell was given compensation for total disability during the period between his injury and his employment as a night watchman, and was given compensation for partial disability for the period up until his hearing, but was denied compensation for lost wages during the period following his cessation of favored work. In February, 1978, Richmond Lumber closed its plant, and in May, 1978, Hartsell filed a petition for compensation. The Court of Appeals affirmed an award of benefits from the time of the plant closing, holding that the plant closure was a tacit withdrawal of the offer of favored work, rendering Hartsell eligible for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The Court of Appeals reached a similar result in <em>Steward v Westran Corp, </em>130 Mich App 68; 343 NW2d 7 (1983). In this case, the plaintiff initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>accepted Westran\u2019s offer of favored work, but upon completion of his first favored work assignment, he rejected Westran\u2019s offer of additional favored work. Later, while his claim for compensation was pending, the plaintiff requested reassignment to favored work. The Court held that the plaintiff forfeited his benefits during the period of his refusal of favored work, but that such forfeiture terminated upon the plaintiff\u2019s request for reassignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">A different result was reached by the Court of Appeals in <em>Russell v General Motors Corp, </em>172 Mich App 627; 432 NW2d 738 (1988). In this case, General Motors offered Russell favored work on April 18, 1980. Russell failed to respond. On April 8, 1981, a hearing referee concluded that benefits could be terminated because of Russell\u2019s failure to accept favored work. Following this decision, General Motors fired Russell, and on October 27, 1981, Russell attempted to accept the offer of favored work. When General Motors refused, Russell filed a claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits. The Court held that the offer of favored work need only be kept open for a reasonable time, after which the employee <em>permanently forfeits </em>any right to benefits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It should be noted that the permanent forfeiture did not stem from the employee\u2019s <em>initial </em>rejection of favored work; rather, it was triggered by the employee\u2019s refusal to accept favored work within a reasonable time after the offer was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>F</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In formulating our decision on this issue, we must also be mindful of the policies underlying the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act. MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(101) <em>et seq. </em>As a preliminary matter, it must be remembered that the act was designed to be remedial and must not be unnecessarily construed so as to favor a denial of benefits. The <em>Bower </em>Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">The Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act was designed to help relieve the social and economic difficulties faced by injured workers. As remedial legislation, it is liberally construed to grant rather than deny benefits. <em>[Id. </em>at 191.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">It would seem that a permanent forfeiture of benefits is not in accord with a liberal construction of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Finally, support for the concept of a temporary suspension of benefits can be drawn from an amendment of the worker\u2019s compensation legislation that contains the first statutory reference to the favored work doctrine and was implemented while this case was progressing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Despite the inapplicability of this legislation to the case at bar, it cannot be ignored in formulating a policy to be applied in future cases. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">If an employee receives a bona fide offer of reasonable employment from the previous employer, another employer, or through the Michigan employment security commission and the employee refuses that employment without good and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>reasonable cause, the employee shall be considered to have voluntarily removed himself or herself from the work force and is no longer entitled to any wage loss benefits under this act <em>during the period of such refusal. </em>[MCL 418.301(5)(a); MSA 17.237(301)(5)(a). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The only plausible interpretation of this statute is that benefits will be suspended for the duration of the employee\u2019s unreasonable refusal to accept employment. If permanent forfeiture were the intended consequence, the phrase, \"during the period of such refusal,\u201d would be rendered meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">In view of the above, we would hold that a voluntary cessation of favored work per se does not result in a permanent forfeiture of wage loss benefits. We note that this holding is in accord with the views espoused by Larson and most of the cases cited,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and represents what we believe to be the better approach as a matter of policy, given the worker\u2019s compensation legislation in general, and more specifically, the recently enacted amendments implemented following the commencement of this case. A temporary suspension of benefits, in contrast to a permanent forfeiture, comports with the dual aims of worker\u2019s compensation, namely, mitigation and rehabilitation, without enabling the employer to enjoy a windfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Our conclusion that an unreasonable refusal or cessation of favored work does not necessarily cause permanent forfeiture of benefits compels a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>determination of what act or acts operate to reinstate those benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">This issue was addressed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Chilcote v Cadillac Malleable Iron Co, </em>198 Mich App 166; 497 NW2d 211 (1993),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in which the Court held that a voluntary participant in an ongoing strike must inform his employer of his willingness to return to work <em>for that employer </em>before he can be entitled to compensation benefits. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">[P]laintiff, in order to be entitled to compensation benefits while a strike is ongoing and in which he is a voluntary participant, must show that he informed his strikebound employer of his willingness to return to work for that employer. Working for other employers is not evidence that plaintiff is willing to return to work for his strikebound employer. [Id. at 171.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In essence, the Court assumed the existence of an offer of favored work and, in this context, held that the employee had the burden of showing that he had informed his employer of his willingness to return to favored work.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The Court of Appeals also addressed this issue in <em>Russell v General Motors, supra </em>at 632, when it held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">[t]here comes a point after which it is <em>unreasonable </em>to think that such employee might someday accept the offer that was originally spurned. It is at that point that a company should be permitted to withdraw its offer with no fear of disadvantage. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>We believe that the rules announced in <em>Chilcote </em>and <em>Russell </em>strike the best balance between the interests of the injured striking employee and the employer whose offer of favored work has been rejected. Fairness, as well as ease of administration, dictates that the party refusing favored work bears the burden of proving a willingness to perform such work, and that such willingness must be expressed within a reasonable period. An employer should not have to continuously bear the burden of initiating a renewal of favored work, nor should the employer be forced to hold favored positions open indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We conclude then that an employee who has ceased to perform existing favored work should establish a good-faith willingness to accept or resume favored work that remains available in order to restore eligibility for benefits. Additionally, this willingness should be expressed within a reasonable period in order to be effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Plaintiffs advance two theories in support of their argument that, even under the above-mentioned rule, they are entitled to a resumption of benefits. Initially, plaintiffs argue that they expressed the requisite willingness to return on January 18, 1982, when the union representative attempted to accept Cadillac\u2019s October 7, 1981, offer, an offer that had already been withdrawn. Plaintiffs assert that this purported \"offer to return\u201d operated to transform them into involuntary strikers.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Because it was the union that \"offered to return,\u201d we must first determine whether this \"offer\u201d can be attributed to the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>argue that the concept of \"concerted action\u201d supports this conclusion, and that 29 USC 159(a) mandates it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">Exclusive representatives; employees\u2019 adjustment of grievances directly with employer. Representatives designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes, <em>shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees </em>in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">This provision directs the employer to bargain only with the majority representative; he cannot bargain with individual employees. In essence, it forbids separation of the union and its members at the bargaining table.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Applying this to the case at bar, we conclude that the union\u2019s \"offer to return\u201d should be attributed to the individual employees.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the absence of any evidence indicating plaintiffs\u2019 desire to separate themselves from the union\u2019s position, the union\u2019s offer should be deemed an offer by each member.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Accordingly, we must now determine whether the \"offer\u201d established plaintiffs\u2019 willingness to return to work, so that a rejection by the employer would transform plaintiffs into involuntary strikers.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In order to establish that plaintiffs were willing to return, they must show that they would have accepted any reasonable offer of favored work put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>forth by Cadillac.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A conditional \"offer\u201d to return does not operate to transform strikers into involuntary strikers; rather, it represents a repositioning of the union with regard to its demands and concessions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> An analogy to employer liability for backpay to a striking worker is instructive on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In general, an employer is not obligated to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>striking employee for backpay. The exception to this rule arises when the striking worker submits an unconditional application for reinstatement to his job that the employer rejects. The employer\u2019s refusal to reinstate the worker triggers the accrual of backpay, beginning after the denial of the striking employee\u2019s request for reinstatement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Applying this to the case at bar, it is clear that an unconditional offer would have demonstrated plaintiffs\u2019 willingness to return to work. An offer conditioned upon the employer\u2019s acceptance of certain terms does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The wcab concluded that the January 18, 1982, \"offer to return\u201d was nothing more than \"another proposal in a very lengthy series of negotiations.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Support for this conclusion was found in the facts that this \"offer\u201d attempted to accept an offer that had been expressly withdrawn, the union\u2019s \"offer\u201d was not in writing, as had been the practice, and the union members had not voted to ratify such a proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We agree with the wcab\u2019s analysis of the \"offer\u201d and conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 \"offer to return\u201d was merely another proposal in the negotiation process. The \"offer\u201d did not rise to the level of the unconditional offer necessary to establish the requisite willingness to return, thereby transforming plaintiffs into involuntary strikers. Hence, it should not serve to terminate the suspension of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Additionally, plaintiffs argue that Cadillac\u2019s announcement of its intention to hire permanent replacement workers had the effect of withdrawing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>its offer of favored work from its striking employees, thus entitling the plaintiffs to a resumption of benefits. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The announcement by management of the use of permanent replacements has considerable effect on the dynamics of a labor dispute, particularly in view of the fact that to a striking worker, it represents a threat not only to the benefits sought by the union, but also introduces the possibility of permanent job loss. The effect on a favored-work striker, however, is quite different. Such an employee, at most, sees a loss of favored work, which, in turn, may result in a resumption of work loss benefits without the need to perform favored work.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> While favored-work strikers certainly should not be disadvantaged by the outcome of the use of permanent replacements, they also should not improve their position as a result of the use of replacement workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Therefore, in view of the divergent effects of the use of permanent replacements on injured versus noninjured striking employees, we think that the rules for placing the burden of establishing a readiness to offer or accept favored work should be the same as would obtain had there been a voluntary cessation of favored work outside a labor dispute;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we do not believe the hiring of replacement workers during a labor dispute should operate to shift this burden.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Cadillac\u2019s announcement of its intention to hire permanent replacement workers operated to withdraw its offer of favored work and trigger the resumption of benefits.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The announcement of permanent replacements was preceded by plaintiffs\u2019 refusal to accept favored work; the permanent replacements were not the cause of the cessation of favored work.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Furthermore, because the employees did not offer to return to work at anytime before the commencement of this action, we need not undertake a determination of what other circumstances could serve to restore benefits following an offer to return.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">We conclude that plaintiffs failed to indicate individually or collectively an unconditional offer to return to their favored work either during the strike or when it was announced that their jobs would be filled by permanent replacements.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>cordingly, at least plaintiff Nederhood was without recourse to collect work loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In <em>Zimmerman, </em>we must address the additional issue whether a supervening, non-work-related heart attack operates to reinstate plaintiff\u2019s right to benefits. We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">As we have previously stated, the general rule is that an injured employee who refuses an offer of favored work that the employee is physically capable of performing is not entitled to worker\u2019s compensation benefits. See <em>Pigue, supra </em>at 318-319. A corollary to this rule is the supervening events rule, which states that a supervening event causing cessation of favored work will terminate an employee\u2019s right to benefits if the supervening event either is within the employee\u2019s control or is attributable to him. <em>Bower, supra </em>at 188. Applying these rules to plaintiff Zimmerman, it is undisputed that after his heart attack, he was no longer physically capable of performing his favored work. Under the physically capable rule, Zimmerman would be entitled to benefits.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But the supervening events rule is also applicable to Zimmerman because the strike was a voluntary action on his part. Under that rule, Zimmerman would not be entitled to benefits. Because a different result is reached under each rule, they must be reconciled.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">As a preliminary matter, we note that in <em>Powell v Casco Nelmor Corp, </em>406 Mich 332; 279 NW2d 769 (1979), this Court held that the inability of a worker to continue favored work does not preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the payment of benefits where that inability was occasioned by a supervening non-work-related injury beyond the employee\u2019s control. However, we note that in <em>Powell, </em>unlike the facts in this case, the injured employee was performing favored work at the time of the supervening, non-work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">In deciding this issue, we again must bear in mind the remedial nature of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act. It should be construed liberally so as not to unnecessarily deny benefits. When we are dealing with an issue of benefits, we must favor an interpretation that awards, rather than denies, benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We must also consider the extent and circumstances of the disability. Zimmerman\u2019s heart attack has rendered him totally disabled. We are not presented with a case of partial disability that may have little or no effect on the future employment prospects of an employee. We are faced with a situation in which the employee\u2019s injury may prevent him from obtaining any further employment. A denial of benefits in this case would work an unquestionable hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Consideration should also be given to the extent of the refusal to perform favored work. In general, a refusal to perform favored work predicated upon participation in a strike is not viewed as a permanent refusal. In contrast, we can envisage other cases where the original refusal will be of a more permanent nature.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The fact that this refusal was not intended to be of a permanent nature counsels against a denial of benefits where there is a subsequent non-work-related disability._</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Finally, we note that the heart attack did not arise out of the refusal to perform favored work. This is not the case where a striking employee suffered injuries while picketing. The heart attack here was unrelated both to the work and to the strike and did not stem from the refusal to perform favored work.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">On the basis of these considerations, we would hold that the occurrence of plaintiff\u2019s heart attack while on strike does not preclude the recovery of wage loss benefits. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered the remedial nature of worker\u2019s compensation, the certainty and extent of the total disability, the length of the refusal to perform favored work at the time of the heart attack,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and the fact that Zimmerman\u2019s heart attack did not arise out of his refusal to perform favored work; it was a supervening event neither within his control nor attributable to him. We note that a contrary result would require a permanent forfeiture of benefits on the basis of his original cessation of favored work, a consequence we have rejected today. For the foregoing reasons, we would hold that Zimmerman is entitled to wage loss benefits as of February 4, 1982, the date upon which his heart attack rendered him physically unable to perform favored work.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">We would hold that a voluntary cessation of favored work by a striking employee results in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>suspension of wage loss benefits. Neither a conditional offer to return by a worker\u2019s union nor the hiring of permanent replacement workers by the employer operates to automatically restore benefits to the striking employee. However, benefits will be restored once the employee expresses a good-faith willingness to return to favored work, provided such willingness is communicated to the employer within a reasonable period following the cessation of favored work. Additionally, we would hold that the resumption of such an employee\u2019s right to benefits upon the occasion of a supervening heart attack that renders such employee totally disabled depends on the certainty and extent of the injury, the length of the refusal to perform favored work before the injury, and the lack of a causal nexus between the refusal of favored work and the resulting heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Accordingly, we would affirm the decisions of the wcab and the Court of Appeals with respect to their findings that the plaintiffs have not established the requisite willingness to perform favored work and are therefore not entitled to wage loss benefits from the commencement of the strike. We would reverse the decisions with respect to Zimmerman, who is entitled to work loss benefits from the time of his totally disabling heart attack.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\"> The September 30, 1981, proposal contained a provision allowing seniority retention during layoff for only twenty-four months.

As we attempt to make clear in the following footnote, the hiring of permanent replacement workers <em>in conjunction with </em>an employer\u2019s refusal of an employee\u2019s offer to return to work <em>may </em>operate as a withdrawal of favored work, thereby triggering the resumption of benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> The opinion of Justice Boyle states that \"the striking workers in this case may well have viewed permanent replacement workers as eliminating their positions . . . .\u201d <em>Post </em>at 262.

I would hold that the hiring of permanent replacement workers may in fact and in law work to withdraw an employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>offer of favored work. Therefore, I would remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. I disagree with reaching and disposing of an issue not properly before this Court, namely, the adoption of a reasonable time limitation on an employee\u2019s ability to reestablish his right to favored work. The reach is unwarranted, and, in my view, the rule suggested is unjustified. If there is a justification for a rule that appears to provide an incentive to employers either to delay the settlement of a strike or to hire permanent replacement workers, it has not here been made by the employer, and the lead opinion should not provide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In March 1982, four months after the strike began, Cadillac Malleable acknowledged that the replacement workers it had been hiring were permanent. The employees who had been on favored work before the strike may have viewed Cadillac\u2019s announcement as a revocation of favored work positions. If a revocation could be proven to have occurred, the employees, would be entitled to resumption of benefits because the justification for the suspension (voluntary cessation from available favored work) would cease to exist. <em>Ante </em>at 254; <em>Kolenko v United States Rubber Products, Inc, </em>285 Mich 159; 280 NW 148 (1938). Nonfavored-worker strikers are presumed to be unemployed following the employment of permanent replacements. <em>Plymouth Stamping v Lipshu, </em>436 Mich 1; 461 NW2d 859 (1990). The lead opinion distinguishes favored-worker strikers from other strikers because the employer either must pay benefits or employ the worker within restrictions. From this distinction the lead opinion concludes that \"the rules for placing the burden of establishing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>readiness to offer or accept favored work should be the same as would obtain had there been a voluntary cessation of favored work outside a labor dispute . . . <em>Ante </em>at 254. Put plainly, the lead opinion would hold that the burden is on the employee to offer to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">While the lead opinion is correct in its assertion that the effect on favored-worker strikers and nonfavored-worker strikers of hiring permanent replacements is not identical, I do not agree with its conclusion that, as a matter of law, the hiring of such workers can never serve as a de facto withdrawal of the employer\u2019s offer of favored work. It is true that the threat to the latter worker is to the benefits sought by the union and to the possibility of permanent job loss. The threat to the favored worker, however, as this case illustrates, is the elimination of both the worker\u2019s job and benefits until such time as it is definitively determined that the strike is over or a reasonable time has passed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where, as here, there is a relatively high concentration of favored workers in the work force and the labor dispute is protracted, the proposed holding of the lead opinion, when combined with the reasonable time limitation, would improve the employers\u2019 bargaining leverage or encourage extension of the labor dispute and strikebreaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In <em>Plymouth Stamping v Lipshu, </em>the question was whether the labor disqualification provision of the Michigan Employment Security Act, MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.531(8), applied to striking workers who had been permanently replaced. In a plurality opinion, four members of the Court held \"that any striker who is permanently replaced is thereby entitled to benefits from that time forward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>unless and until some succeeding event again renders the labor dispute a substantial contributing cause of the unemployment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42 (opinion of Boyle and Cavanagh, JJ., concurring). My own view was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">[t]he fundamental assumption of the labor dispute disqualification provision is that there exists a job from which the striking employee has voluntarily absented himself because of a labor dispute and to which he will return at the end of that dispute. When, however, the striking employee is notified that his position has been filled \u2014 that he has been permanently replaced by another employee \u2014 that assumption no longer obtains. In the language of the statute, once the striker has been permanently replaced, his unemployment ceases to be \"due to\u201d the strike. At that juncture, the <em>only </em>\"substantial contributing cause\u201d [citations omitted] of the striker\u2019s unemployment is his permanent replacement. <em>[Id. </em>at 38.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Like the workers in <em>Lipshu, </em>the striking workers in this case may well have viewed permanent replacement workers as eliminating their positions, and the cause of the injured employees\u2019 failure to perform favored work might have been not a voluntary refusal, but a corporate revocation. While the nature of a favored work position might make this supposition more or less tenable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the fact that some favored workers could reasonably view the hiring of permanent replacements as the end of their employment counsels against adoption of the rule suggested by the lead opinion, which would require these employees to attempt to return to jobs they believe are no longer available.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Mere reliance on the possible availability of benefits if the offer of favored work is eliminated does not justify placing a burden on the plaintiff to return to the employer asking for favored work. In my view, it is reasonable to conclude that, if the employer can be shown to have revoked its offer of favored work with the hiring of permanent replacements, then, as in Lipshu, the cause of a worker\u2019s unemployment is no longer due to the strike.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">What is not clear in this case is whether Cadillac\u2019s act of hiring permanent replacement workers served to withdraw its offer of favored work. The wcab held that the hiring of replacement workers was not a de facto withdrawal of favored work. However, it did not have the benefit of the <em>Lipshu </em>analysis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, it is not obvious from the opinion whether the board understood that the hiring of permanent replacements <em>could </em>serve to withdraw an offer of favored work. Although the board may have considered the possibility and rejected it, such a decision is not explicit in the wcab\u2019s opinion. The wcab also seemed to place the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>burden of coming forward and the burden of proof on the plaintiff. It is likewise unclear where the burden would have been placed had it been understood that this Court would recognize application of the <em>Lipshu </em>analysis to the striking favored-work employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In the absence of a full evaluation by the administrative agency charged with implementing worker\u2019s compensation law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it is inappropriate to resolve the question whether the hiring of permanent replacement workers ended plaintiff\u2019s voluntary refusal to perform favored work. While I acknowledge again that the analogy between worker\u2019s compensation benefits and unemployment benefits is not perfect, the permanent replacement issue is so important that the Court should not act without a full record development and discussion of the rationale and effect of the holding of <em>Lipshu </em>on favored workers on strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">I would vacate the decision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board and remand this case to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission to assign the case to a magistrate for further consideration consistent with this opinion. On remand, the magistrate should be directed to consider the existing record and be authorized, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>out limitation, to consider any motions by the parties concerning the possible submission of additional proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The lead opinion observes that an employee\u2019s willingness to return to work \"should be expressed within a reasonable period in order to be effective.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 250. Because it does not decide whether a reasonable time has passed in this case, <em>ante </em>at 255, n 25,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the discussion of a reasonable time limitation is dicta. While it is unnecessary to address this question in today\u2019s opinion,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because it is discussed, I state my opposition to the adoption of the reasonable time limitation formulated by the lead opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Favored work is a judicially created doctrine, \"[t]he primary purpose\u201d of which is to allow an employer the opportunity to reduce work-loss damages by putting a partially disabled employee back to work. <em>Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172, 182; 312 NW2d 640 (1981). The favored work doctrine also \"encourages the employee to return to productive employment rather than to remain idle, thus also serving a rehabilitative function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the rehabilitative function is merely incidental, with each employer deciding whether to offer an individual employee favored work. Whether an employee will have the opportunity to rehabilitate is a decision left to his employer. In any event, the employer owes an employee the same minimum level of compensation whether he performs favored work or remains at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>It is therefore surprising that the lead opinion would determine that \"fairness,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 250, requires the adoption of the reasonable time limitation. Fairness is not offended when the employee takes away an employer\u2019s ability to reduce worker\u2019s compensation losses that do not exist. While the worker refuses favored work, the employer is relieved of its obligation to pay that employee. There are no damages to mitigate. Fairness is also not offended by the employee\u2019s loss of an opportunity to rehabilitate. With rehabilitation existing at the discretion of an employer who is under no obligation to offer favored work, it can hardly be argued that the desire to rehabilitate injured workers justifies cutting off future rights to worker\u2019s compensation benefits or favored work.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The only remaining justification is a generalized concern that it is somehow unfair to require employers \"to hold favored positions open indefinitely.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 250. However, the nature of favored work itself, as described by Cadillac Malleable\u2019s attorney at oral argument, provides the clearest rejoinder to this argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u2014By its very nature, favored work is work outside or different from the work that is offered to the general work force. It is work created or established by the employer to accommodate an injured employee\u2019s limitation. It can be an ordinary job that has been assigned the employee to accommodate his limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u2014The question here is not whether plaintiffs\u2019 favored work was replaced, because preferred favored work could not have been replaced. It was especially established to accommodate the injured worker.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Under the current system, an employer is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>quired to pay an injured employee worker\u2019s compensation if it does not offer a favored work position within the employee\u2019s limitations. <em>Bower, supra </em>at 182. If such an offer is made, the employee is required to accept it or face discontinuation of benefits. Consequently, when an employee fails to avail himself of favored work, the employer gains because it is relieved of the obligation either to pay that employee his worker\u2019s compensation benefits or to offer him favored work. For instance, when an injured employee does not present himself to his employer for ten years, the employer gains because he was relieved of an obligation to pay owed benefits or offer favored work for that period.

However, because I find that a striking favored worker fully disabled by a supervening event is not entitled to a reinstatement of benefits unless he shows that he would have returned to work but for the supervening event, I write separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The purpose of the worker\u2019s compensation act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\"is to provide compensation for disability resulting from an occupational injury.\u201d <em>Lynch v Briggs Mfg Co, </em>329 Mich 168, 171; 45 NW2d 20 (1950). In furtherance of this basic policy, this Court crafted the favored work doctrine, which permits an employer to offer a partially disabled employee work that he is physically capable of performing (at equal or greater preinjury wages) in lieu of providing worker\u2019s compensation benefits. <em>Hood v Wyandotte Oil &amp; Fat Co, </em>272 Mich 190, 193; 261 NW 295 (1935); <em>Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172, 182; 312 NW2d 640 (1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">The primary purpose of the doctrine is that of mitigation. It allows an employer to reduce or completely eliminate compensation payments by providing work within the injured employee\u2019s physical capacity. At the same time, it encourages the employee to return to productive employment rather than to remain idle, thus also serving a rehabilitative function.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In accordance with the principles of mitigation, \"if physically able to perform the favored work\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>an employee may not refuse such work and still be awarded compensation. Lynch, <em>supra </em>at 172.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Thus, a favored work employee who refuses to perform favored work because of his participation in a strike forfeits his right to compensation. <em>Pigue v General Motors Corp, </em>317 Mich 311; 26 NW2d 900 (1947). The <em>Pigue </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">In the case at bar plaintiff could have continued his employment under the same terms and condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>tions as existed prior to going out on strike. The incapacity of plaintiff to earn wages during this period was not occasioned by his previous injury, but by the intervention of a labor union of which he was a member. Employment for plaintiff was available under conditions existing prior to the strike. Plaintiff is thus in the position of having refused employment until those conditions were modified. Plaintiff\u2019s employment did not cease by reason of any overt act upon the part of his employer or because of his inability to work by reason of his accidental injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">Decision in this case is based upon the fact that work was available to plaintiff by his employer; that plaintiff was physically able to perform such work, but declined to do so because of a strike called by a labor union of which he was a member. <em>[Id. </em>at 318-319.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The lead opinion would hold that this forfeiture of benefits during a strike is only a \"temporary suspension of benefits\u201d during the refusal to work. <em>Ante </em>at 248. It also would find that if a worker fails to request or accept an offer of favored work within a reasonable time, the forfeiture of benefits becomes permanent. <em>Ante </em>at 250, 255. This is so because \"[a]n employer should not have to continuously bear the burden of initiating a renewal of favored work, nor should the employer be forced to hold favored positions open indefinitely.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 250. Hence, the lead opinion correctly concludes \"that an employee who has ceased to perform existing favored work should establish a good-faith willingness to accept or resume favored work that remains available in order to restore eligibility for benefits. Additionally, this willingness should be expressed within a reasonable period in order to be effective.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 250. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Furthermore, as recognized by the lead opinion, the reasonableness standard must apply to both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>parties to maintain the integrity of the favored work doctrine. <em>Ante </em>at 248-250, 254. See also <em>Bower, supra </em>at 182-185; <em>Russell v General Motors Corp, </em>172 Mich App 627, 632; 432 NW2d 738 (1988).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hence, a favored employee\u2019s unreasonable delay in accepting an oifer of employment relieves an employer of liability.

Although this Court may examine the wcab\u2019s findings of law, absent fraud its findings of fact are conclusive if any competent evidence on the record supports those findings. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28; MCL 418.861; MSA 17.237(861).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The wcab found that Nederhood was performing favored work and voluntarily left that work to participate in the strike. The wcab also found that defendant\u2019s hiring of permanent replacement workers did not constitute a de facto withdrawal of its offer of favored work, and that the union\u2019s proposals to return to work were merely negotiating tactics, not bona fide offers to return. Similarly, Nederhood failed to show that a replacement worker had taken his job, or that he could not find employment as a replacement worker. To the contrary, the record reveals that several former union members became replacement workers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moveover, most important, the wcab found that Nederhood never approached defendant to regain his job \u2014 in other words, he failed to tender an offer to accept a favored posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>tion once he voluntarily left favored work. In short, Nederhood failed to present a prima facie case. Thus, the lead opinion would appropriately deny Nederhood relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Like Nederhood, Zimmerman forfeited his entitlement to benefits when he participated in the strike. Zimmerman failed to show any evidence that he or the union ever offered to return to favored work. Again, like Nederhood, Zimmerman also failed to present any evidence showing that his position was taken by a replacement worker, or that he would have been unable to obtain another comparable position. Hence, Zimmerman is not entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Nevertheless, considering the \"remedial nature of worker\u2019s compensation, the certainty and extent of the total disability, the length of the refusal to perform favored work at the time of the heart attack, and the fact that Zimmerman\u2019s heart attack did not arise out of his refusal to perform favored work [and] that a contrary result would require a permanent forfeiture of benefits on the basis of his original cessation of favored work,\u201d without providing him a reasonable time within which to express his willingness to return, the lead opinion would hold that he is \"entitled to wage loss benefits as of February 4, 1982, the date upon which his heart attack rendered him physically unable to perform favored work.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The lead opinion\u2019s holding misconstrues the supervening event doctrine and the worker\u2019s compensation act by granting Zimmerman a windfall. It correctly notes that the \"basic rule of law ... is that a supervening event causing cessation of an employee\u2019s favored work will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>terminate his right to benefits as long as the event is not under the employee\u2019s control or attributable to him.\u201d <em>Bower, supra </em>at 187. This is so because \" '[a]n independent, intervening event, which follows a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment, does not alone justify the denial, suspension, reduction, or <em>increase </em>of disability benefits for a continuing work related injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Powell v Casco Nelmor Corp, </em>406 Mich 332, 354-355; 279 NW2d 769 (1979) (citation omitted; emphasis added). Hence, the favored work doctrine does \"not require compensation benefits to be <em>automatically </em>revived upon the happening of an intervening nonindustrial event which disables a favored-work employee .... Rather, . . . such an event [does] not <em>preclude </em>the payment of compensation for a prior injury.\u201d <em>Flynn v General Motors Corp, </em>162 Mich App 511, 517; 413 NW2d 444 (1987). Thus, to obtain benefits under the supervening act doctrine, a claimant must show that he \"was already performing favored work for his original employer and a supervening independent event rendered him unable to continue.\u201d <em>Bower, supra </em>at 187.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Zimmerman, however, was not performing favored work when he suffered the heart attack, but was voluntarily participating in a strike. There is no evidence that Zimmerman would have crossed the picket line had he been healthy, and a legal bar denied Zimmerman benefits at the time of his disability. This Court, therefore, must assume that even without the heart attack he would not have worked for defendant while the strike continued. Furthermore, he has failed to present any evidence that he would have returned to his position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>after the decertification of the union. Thus, Zimmerman\u2019s disability is irrelevant to his ability to receive benefits because he would have been ineligible for such benefits if he had not had the heart attack. Because the burden is upon Zimmerman to show that he is entitled to benefits in such circumstances, and he failed to produce any evidence that he would have returned to work despite the strike and consequent decertification of the union, Zimmerman is not entitled to benefits. <em>Pulley v Detroit Engineering &amp; Machine Co, </em>378 Mich 418, 425-426; 145 NW2d 40 (1966); <em>Flynn, supra </em>at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">On the other hand, if his union had returned to work, the wcab or the hearing referee could have fairly assumed he would have joined the union and he would be entitled to benefits. Because the union\u2019s actions could fairly have been impugned upon Zimmerman if it had returned to work, he would have been entitled to recover benefits beginning on the day the union returned to work, but no sooner.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nevertheless, this was not the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>with Zimmerman. In short, Zimmerman is not entitled to a windfall simply because of his unfortunate heart condition.</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-5\">Griffin, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b408-6\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1s\"><em>(separate </em>opinion). I agree with the author of the lead opinion that 1981 PA 200,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> codifying the favored work doctrine, should guide decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As set forth in that opinion, \u00a7 301(5)(a), added by the 1981 legislation, provides that if disability is established, and \"an employee receives a bona fide offer of reasonable employment from a previous employer, another employer, or through the Michigan employment security commission and the employee refuses that employment without good and reasonable cause, the employee shall be considered to have voluntarily removed himself or herself from the work force and is no longer entitled to any wage loss benefits under this act during the period of such refusal.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The last clause, \"during the period of such refusal,\u201d is inconsistent with the view that refusal of work results in a permanent forfeiture of worker\u2019s compensation benefits. This clause is also inconsistent with the view that, because it would be unreasonable to expect the employer to keep those positions open beyond the point that it announced that the jobs would be filled by permanent replace-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>merits,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nederhood may not recover worker\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">While the needs of the employer may justify the employer in not keeping the offer open beyond a reasonable time, the need of the employee to participate in a strike may justify his refusal to work during a strike. The disabled worker is nevertheless disabled, and, as set forth in the 1981 legislation, can properly be denied benefits only \"during the period of such refusal,\u201d without good and reasonable cause, of a bona fide offer of reasonable employment from a previous employer, another employer, or through the Michigan Employment Security Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The \"period of such refusal\u201d is, of course, a question of fact. The burden of showing refusal of work should be borne by the employer because the offer of favored work is in mitigation of damages, in the form of worker\u2019s compensation benefits, otherwise payable by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">When the union\u2019s representative offered to return the entire work force to work in January, 1982, that was in effect an offer on behalf of the favored workers to return to work. While the employer was not obliged to accept that offer, it should not be heard thereafter to assert that a particular injured worker, Nederhood, declined favored work unless it clarifies the situation by reoffering favored work to the injured worker, Nederhood, separately and apart from whatever was going on between the employer and the union, and other workers, at whatever wage the employer chooses to offer the particular injured worker. If the employer here had done so, and Nederhood had refused the offer, it would then be clear that, after the union\u2019s offer to return the entire work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>force to work in January, 1982, Nederhood had declined an offer of favored work at a definite wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In all events, the burden should be on the employer to show refusal of favored work from and after September 23, 1982, when Nederhood filed a petition for hearing before the Bureau of Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation. By filing that petition, Nederhood formally notified the employer that he was seeking a renewal of payment of worker\u2019s compensation benefits under the worker\u2019s compensation system. It was, or should have been, incumbent on this employer, claiming an offset in mitigation of damages on the basis of an offer, and the availability, of favored work, to show that it had, uncomplicated by the strike, the negotiations with the union, the interests of other workers (injured and uninjured), or other factors, made an offer of favored work to Nederhood after September 23, 1982, and that he had turned down the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">I join in reversal of the Court of Appeals in <em>Zimmerman. </em>I would also, for the reasons stated, reverse the Court of Appeals in <em>Nederhood </em>and remand to the wcac for the entry of an award of compensation to Nederhood, who was found to have been partially disabled. Under the circumstances that three justices would affirm in <em>Nederhood </em>with the result that Nederhood would be denied compensation, and three would remand for further proceedings, and remand would provide Nederhood with an opportunity on remand to recover worker\u2019s compensation benefits, I join in remand to the wcac.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\"> The favored-work doctrine is a purely judicial creation. Favored, or light, work can be loosely defined as less strenuous post-injury work. Wages from favored-work may be used as a setoff against an employer\u2019s compensation liability, MCL 418.361(1); MSA 17.237(361)(1), but favored-work wages do not establish an earning capacity, and when such wages cease, they neither suspend nor bar compensation. <em>Powell v Casco Nelmor Corp, </em>406 Mich 332; 279 NW2d 769 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\"> The rehabilitation function of the favored work doctrine should not be forgotten, for \"[i]n many instances from the highest motives of desire to rehabilitate the employee and restore him as a wage-earning member of society, some employers have retained injured employees in new jobs within their capacity to perform.\u201d <em>Pulley v Detroit Engineering &amp; Machine Co, </em>378 Mich 418, 423; 145 NW2d 40 (1966). Even without such high motives, favored work fosters rehabilitation by encouraging partially disabled persons to reintegrate into the workplace.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\"> The favored work doctrine is nothing more than the logical application of the axiomatic principle of mitigation to the worker\u2019s compensation scheme. As Justice Campbell noted, \"[i]t has always been considered incumbent upon any person subjected to injury to use such means as are reasonably in his power to make the evil consequences as light as possible.\u201d <em>Chandler v Allison, </em>10 Mich 460, 474-475 (1862). See also <em>Cubit v O\u2019Dett, </em>51 Mich 347, 350; 16 NW 679 (1883). A failure to mitigate by the injured party bars recovery, therefore, \" 'for any item of damage which could thus have been avoided.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shiffer v Gibralter School Dist Bd of Ed, </em>393 Mich 190, 197; 224 NW2d 255 (1974), quoting McCormick, Damages, \u00a7 33, p 127 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">The principle of mitigation is a thread permeating the entire jurisprudence. It is not solely a \"breach of contract\u201d or \"commercial\u201d doctrine; it is part of the much broader principle of \"avoidable consequences.\u201d <em>[Shiffer, supra </em>at 197.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">The rights protected by the mitigation doctrine are not just those of contracting parties, commercial litigants, tort victims or tortfeasors but, rather, the rights of all society: \"Legal rules and doctrines are designed not only to prevent and repair individual loss and injustice, but to protect and conserve the economic welfare and prosperity of the whole community.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 198, quoting McCormick, <em>supra.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Hence, mitigation is fully applicable in the employment context. See, e.g., <em>McClelland v Climax Hosiery Mills, </em>252 NY 347, 358; 169 NE 605 (1930) (Cardozo, C.J., concurring) (\"The obligation of the master is merely to pay whatever damages have actually been suffered, and these exclude damages that a servant, acting reasonably, would have diminished or avoided\u201d). In the favored worker context, therefore, \"interruptions of work caused by voluntary actions of the employee, such as abandonment of work to participate in a strike, failure to return without explanation at the end of a leave of absence, failure to notify the employer of medical restrictions, or discharge because of gambling or drunkenness, results in a forfeiture of benefits.\u201d <em>Bower, supra </em>at 188 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b403-4\"> A reasonableness test is applied to the actions of employees when determining whether they are entitled to worker\u2019s compensation benefits. <em>Bower, supra </em>at 182.

If the statute specifically requires that reasonableness not be taken into account, the courts must obey, no matter how unjust the result. But in the instant case, the doctrine to be applied, even though developed in a statutory context, is a judicially created one. Therefore, consistent with our approach to the common law, we refuse to consider application of the harsh forfeiture penalty without an assessment of the parties\u2019 reasonableness. <em>[Id. </em>at 184.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The Court of Appeals has divided over whether the reasonableness standard applies to the actions of employers. See, e.g., <em>Hartsell v Richmond Lumber Co, </em>154 Mich App 523, 535-536; 398 NW2d 456 (1986) (holding that the reasonableness standard is inapplicable); <em>id. </em>(MacKenzie, P.J., dissenting) (approving of reasonableness standard for an employer\u2019s conduct); <em>Russell, supra </em>at 632, and <em>Derr v Murphy Motor Freight Lines, </em>195 Mich App 333, 335; 489 NW2d 183 (1992) (holding that the reasonableness of an employer\u2019s actions should be evaluated).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The better view is to apply the reasonableness standard to the actions of employers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">It must be remembered that it is the employee\u2019s unreasonable refusal which triggers the initial forfeiture of benefits. There comes a point after which it is unreasonable to think that such employee might someday accept the offer that was originally spurned. It is at that point that a company should be permitted to withdraw its offer with no fear of disadvantage. <em>[Russell, supra </em>at 632.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b403-9\"> The obvious [corollary] to <em>[Bower] </em>is that the reasonableness of an employer\u2019s withdrawal of an offer of favored work must also be considered in determining whether benefits should be awarded.
