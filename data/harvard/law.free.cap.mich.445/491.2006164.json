After the prosecuting attorney disclosed the names of the witnesses he intended to call at trial and provided a copy of the laboratory report, the circuit court ordered the defendants to disclose their witnesses and to list any physical evidence that they were planning to introduce.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">The Court of Appeals reversed the order of the circuit court. However, we find that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion, and we therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the order of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">Sergeant Thomas G. Mullaney of the Alpena Police Department was working undercover in Alpena on September 14, 1990.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While watching the parking lot of the Dry Dock Bar, he saw defendants Terry Lemcool and Jean M. Mausolf enter a pickup truck, together with a codefendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>named David Sommerfeld. Mr. Sommerfeld was in the driver\u2019s seat and Mr. Lemcool was sitting on the passenger side. Ms. Mausolf sat between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Sergeant Mullaney approached the truck because the three appeared to be using a controlled substance. When he walked up to the vehicle, he saw a tray with white powder and a rolled dollar bill. A search of Mr. Lemcool produced a pack of Zigzag papers and a piece of metal that Sergeant Mullaney believed would be used to separate cocaine into lines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The defendants are charged with possessing less than 25 grams of cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> MCL 333.7403(2)(a)(v); MSA 14.15(7403)(2)(a)(v). Codefendant Sommerfeld evidently was also charged with the same offense, but his case is not before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Before the preliminary examination, counsel for defendants Lemcool and Mausolf filed in district court a December 11, 1990, appearance that included a demand for \"[c]opies of complaint, warrant, statements, police reports\u201d and a demand \"[t]hat witness names and statements be provided, in compliance with MCL 767.40a <em>et seq. </em>[MSA 28.980(1) <em>et seq.].\u201d </em>The file indicates that the prosecutor sent the police report to counsel the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">On January 2, 1991, defense counsel wrote to the prosecutor to say that, while he had received the police report, he did not have a copy of the laboratory report. Two days later, the prosecutor sent a copy of that report to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">After the defendants were bound over to circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>court, the circuit judge prepared a November 18, 1991, \"Arraignment Summary.\u201d It stated that the \"prosecutor has given defendant copy of statements)\u201d and that the \"prosecutor has or will disclose physical evidence and will allow examination of same upon a reasonable request made within 3 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">On December 6, 1991, the prosecutor filed a \"Motion for Reciprocal Discovery.\u201d The motion recited that the prosecutor had complied with his statutory<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> obligation to disclose the names of witnesses that he intended to call at trial, and that he had provided the defendants with copies of the police reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In his discovery motion, the prosecutor requested \"the names and addresses of all witnesses the defendant intends to call at trial, any written or recorded statements of the witnesses, any reports or statements of experts made in connection with the case and any real or tangible evidence the defendant intends to offer at trial.\u201d In support of the motion, the prosecutor cited <em>People v Richard P Johnson, </em>168 Mich App 581, 583-585; 425 NW2d 187 (1988), and <em>People v Tronti, </em>176 Mich App 544, 547-550; 440 NW2d 62 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">In their written response to the prosecutor\u2019s motion, the defendants admitted that \"the trial court has the authority to grant discovery,\u201d but urged that the prosecutor\u2019s request be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The circuit court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">This matter having come on for hearing and the Court being fully advised on the premises,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">It is hereby ordered that within twenty (20) days from the entry of this order the People will be furnished the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>1. Names and addresses of the witnesses the defendant intends to call at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">2. Names and addresses of expert witnesses the defendant intends to call at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">3. A list of tangible physical evidence the defendant intends to introduce at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">It is further ordered that the defendant disclose to the People any additional names and addresses and any additional tangible physical evidence in a reasonable time after the twenty (20) days as they become known.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">It is further ordered that the motion is denied as to furnishing any written reports or statements or any recorded statements of the witnesses in the possession of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">In an order denying the defendants\u2019 motions for reconsideration, the circuit court added this explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">Finally, the Court notes Defendant\u2019s claim that reciprocal discovery would tend to lead to revelation of the theory of the defense, but is not persuaded by it in this instance. If Defendant\u2019s argument is valid, then any mere assertion by defense that discovery would reveal their theories would prohibit a Court granting discovery. This Court cannot believe such was the intention of the Legislature, Court of Appeals and Court Rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">The defendants appealed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Reversing the circuit court\u2019s discovery order, the Court of Appeals held that, \"in the absence of specific authority [from a statute or court rule], the better policy is for trial courts to exercise judicial restraint and refuse to permit such prosecutorial discovery in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>potential and far-reaching effects on fundamental constitutional principles and rights.\u201d 200 Mich App 77, 80-81; 504 NW2d 7 (1993). The majority went on to call on the Legislature and this Court \"to define the scope of criminal discovery in Michigan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In dissent, Judge Mackenzie wrote that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">As noted by the majority, there is at present a split of authority in this Court regarding whether general discovery may be ordered in favor of the prosecution. In <em>People v Paris, </em>166 Mich App 276; 420 NW2d 184 (1988), this Court concluded that, in the absence of a court rule, the prosecution does not have a right to discovery except where statutorily mandated. In <em>People v [Richard P] Johnson, </em>168 Mich App 581, 584; 425 NW2d 187 (1988), and <em>People v Tronti, </em>176 Mich App 544, 550; 440 NW2d 62 (1989), however, this Court held that trial courts have inherent discretionary power to grant the prosecution discovery despite the absence of specific authorization by statute or court rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">Because the trial court\u2019s discovery orders are reviewed for abuse of discretion, <em>Tronti, supra, </em>defendants must establish that an unprejudiced person, considering the facts on which the trial court acted, would say that there was no justification or excuse for the ruling made. <em>People v Watkins, </em>176 Mich App 428, 430; 440 NW2d 36 (1989). Here, the trial court was entitled to follow the <em>[Richard P] </em>line of authority, see <em>In re Bay Co Prosecutor, </em>102 Mich App 543, 549; 302 NW2d 225 (1980), and defendants offered only their unsupported allegation that discovery would tend to reveal their defense theory and strategy. Under these circumstances, I would find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s order and accordingly would affirm. [200 Mich App 82-83.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The prosecutor filed applications for leave to appeal, which we granted \"limited to [the issue] whether the trial court properly ordered the defendants to provide discovery to the prosecution.\u201d 444 Mich 866 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We have long entrusted the question of discovery in criminal cases to the discretion of the trial court. <em>People v Herbert L Johnson, </em>356 Mich 619; 97 NW2d 739 (1959); <em>People v Maranian, </em>359 Mich 361, 368; 102 NW2d 568 (1960); <em>People v Wimberly, </em>384 Mich 62, 66, n 1; 179 NW2d 623 (1970); <em>People v Pearson, </em>404 Mich 698, 731; 273 NW2d 856 (1979) (opinion of Levin, J.); <em>People v Freeman (After Remand), </em>406 Mich 514, 516; 280 NW2d 446 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">However, panels of the Court of Appeals have reached differing conclusions with regard to whether the prosecutor may discover information known to the defense. Compare <em>Richard P Johnson </em>and <em>Tronti, supra, </em>with the opinions issued by the Court of Appeals in the present case and in <em>People v Paris, </em>166 Mich App 276, 278-280; 420 NW2d 184 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Extensive efforts also have been undertaken to formalize satisfactory rules of discovery in criminal cases. See, generally, proposed Subchapter 6.200 of the Michigan Court Rules, 422A Mich 65-106 (1985). In particular, proposed MCR 6.205 would have treated disclosure of information known to the defense. 422A Mich 79-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">After lengthy discussions, we decided not to adopt proposed Subchapter 6.200. Rather than promulgate a set of fixed rules, we were persuaded to allow some further development of this area through the resolution of appellate cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>A recent example of this case-by-case approach is <em>People v VanderVliet, </em>444 Mich 52, 89; 508 NW2d 114 (1993). There, we held that, to aid in the resolution of issues concerning \"similar acts\u201d evidence under MRE 404(b), a trial judge may require disclosure of the defendant\u2019s theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">These considerations underscore the wisdom of embracing an approach to discovery, undertaken by many state courts and the federal judiciary, which promotes reliable decision making. To assist the judiciary in this extraordinarily difficult context and to promote the public interest in reliable fact finding, we intend to adopt a modification to Rule 404(b). We require the prosecution to give pretrial notice of its intent to introduce other acts evidence at trial,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and <em>authorize the trial judge, consistent with the law in ten other states,</em><footnotemark><em>52</em></footnotemark><em> to require the defendant to articulate his theory or theories of defense.</em><footnotemark><em>53</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">[444 Mich 89. Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">As indicated above, the question of discovery in a criminal case is committed to the discretion of the trial court. Thus, the question is whether the circuit judge in this case abused his discretion. We are satisfied that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Before making any request for discovery, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>prosecutor provided defense counsel with police reports and laboratory reports. He then asked for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">1. Defendant\u2019s expert witnesses, their names and addresses, and any reports or statements of experts made in connection with the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">2. Defendant\u2019s witnesses, their names and addresses, and any written or recorded statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">3. Any real or tangible evidence the defendant intends to offer at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Properly exercising discretion, the circuit court ordered disclosure of the names and addresses of lay and expert witnesses, and a list of tangible physical evidence that the defendants will introduce at trial. The court denied the motion insofar as the prosecutor sought production of the written reports or statements of the defense witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">There are many potential issues in this area, but we need not address them all today.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are satisfied to say that the discovery order in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>case was not an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Where the prosecution had already disclosed its witnesses and laboratory reports, and had provided copies of police reports,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it was not error for the circuit court to order the defendant to provide names and addresses of expert and lay witnesses and a list of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the physical evidence that the defendants intended to use at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the orders of the circuit court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b633-6\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Boyle, Riley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-13\"> Because this case has not been tried, we are drawing the facts from the testimony given by the prosecution witnesses at the preliminary examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-10\"> The defendants initially refused to get out of the truck, and did so only after Sergeant Mullaney threatened to break the window.

Nevertheless, it is clear that the Court saw the Illinois discovery rule as beneficial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">The defendant\u2019s right to compulsory process is itself designed to vindicate the principle that the \"ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or speculative presentation of the facts.\u201d Rules that provide for pretrial discovery of an opponent\u2019s witnesses serve the same high purpose. Discovery, like cross-examination, minimizes the risk that a judgment w\u00fcl be predicated on incomplete, misle\u00e1ding, or even deliberately fabricated testimony. The \"State\u2019s interest in protecting itself against an eleventh hour defense\u201d is merely one component of the broader public interest in a full and truthful disclosure of critical facts.
