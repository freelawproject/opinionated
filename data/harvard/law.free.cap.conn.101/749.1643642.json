The principal purpose of these changes in and additions to the finding is to have it appear that the plaintiffs agreed to prepare plans and specifications for a dwelling which could be built for $30,000, and this they have never done. The main issue of the appeal is as to whether the plaintiffs did make such an agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>The trial court has found that the plaintiffs never made such an agreement. As we read the evidence upon this point it was conflicting and the trial court\u2019s finding in this particular is not unreasonable, hence this finding must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">None of the other findings, if changed as defendant desires, would affect the conclusions reached by the trial court. But since in most particulars they either follow the evidence or were made on conflicting evidence, the defendant\u2019s claimed errors are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
