In the event of the failure of the employer promptly to provide such physician or surgeon or medical, surgical or hospital service, the injured employee may provide such physician or surgeon or medical, surgical or hospital service at the expense of the employer.\u201d In this connection the commissioner finds that the respondents did not provide medical service and the claimant resorted to Dr. Andrus for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Thus, the single question presented by the reservation is whether upon the facts found Dr. Andrus was \u201ca competent physician or surgeon to attend the injured employee\u201d in this particular case. Each case is to be determined by its own facts. Undoubtedly certain diseases are incapable of treatment by osteopathic methods. The statute, we think, requires both legal competency and competency in the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">On the findings, Dr. Andrus was competent in both of these respects. He was licensed to practice the healing art by the lawful, though limited, methods of osteopathy, and he was competent to treat the claimant in this particular case for the injury in question, and did treat it with success. Apparently the only question remaining is whether he is a \u201cphysician.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">It has been intimated in one decision of a compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tion commissioner and held in another, that a licensed osteopathic practitioner is not a \u201cphysician.\u201d <em>Spain </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Furniture Co., </em>3 Conn. Comp. Dig. 37; <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Oddy, </em>4 Conn. Comp. Dig. 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We think these decisions were made without giving due consideration to the fact that osteopaths are described as \u201cphysicians\u201d in the statutes regulating the issuing of licenses to them. In \u00a7 2864, it is prescribed that the members of the examining board \u201cshall be resident osteopathic physicians of good standing,\u201d etc.; and in \u00a7 2866, that \u201c osteopathic physicians shall be subject to the. rules and regulations that govern other physicians in the making and filing of death certificates, \u201d etc. These provisions of the statutes long antedate the passage of \u00a7 5347, and it is to be.supposed that the General Assembly used the term physician in the latter section in the same sense as in prior statutes. It would be strange if a licensed osteopath acting within the limits of his school of practice were legally entitled to the name \u201cphysician\u201d except only when treating an injured employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">We are of opinion that Dr. Andrus, being a licensed \u201costeopathic physician,\u201d is a \u201cphysician\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5347, and that as he was competent to treat the claimant in this case, for the injury in question, the claimant had, upon the facts found, the right to resort to Dr. Andrus for treatment, at the expense of the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The Superior Court is advised to sustain the claimant\u2019s appeal and to enter judgment requiring the respondents to pay for the medical service rendered by Dr. Andrus.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
