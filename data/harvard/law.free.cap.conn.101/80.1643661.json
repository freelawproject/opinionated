The plaintiff claims that the finding discloses no other ground for a divorce than unfounded accusations that the defendant had been guilty of adultery; and that such accusations are not a sufficient basis for a decree, of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">In several recent cases we have defined cruelty as a ground of divorce. In <em>Van Guilder </em>v. <em>Van Guilder, </em>100 Conn. 1, 122 Atl. 719, we said: \"Intolerable cruelty has a subjective as well as an objective significance. There must not only be proof of acts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>cruelty on the part of the offending party, but proof that in their cumulative effect upon the other party, they are intolerable in the sense of rendering the continuance of the marital relation unbearable by him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>McEvoy, </em>99 Conn. 427, 432, 122 Atl. 100, we said: \u201cIt is only when the cumulative effect of the defendant\u2019s cruelty upon the suffering victim has become such that the public and personal objects of matrimony have been destroyed beyond rehabilitation, that the condition of fact contemplated by the intolerable-cruelty clause of the statute . . . should be found to exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">There are occasional statements in cases to the effect that unfounded charges of adultery do not constitute such cruelty as to warrant granting a divorce. A review of the cases, however, indicates that where unfounded charges of adultery are made with such aggravation and persistency, that their cumulative effect upon the victim is such as to endanger his physical or mental health, rendering the continuance of the marital relation intolerable, or such as to destroy the public and personal objects of matrimony beyond rehabilitation, they are a sufficient basis for a divorce. 18 L. R. A. (N. S.) 300 and note; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>1 Hagg. Consist. Rep. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The facts disclose that the unfounded accusations of adultery made by the plaintiff in the present case, were made with such aggravation and persistency as to endanger the mental and physical health of the defendant, rendering the continuance of the marital relation intolerable and amply justifying a divorce under the rules of law stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">In the case of <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>McEvoy, supra, </em>in dealing with the conduct of a party to a marriage which will entitle the other party to a divorce for intolerable cruelty, we say that \u201cto constitute ground for divorce, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>cruelty complained of must be of such a nature as to be intolerable, and to render a continuance of the relation by the suffering victim impracticable.\u201d The court has found in the instant case that the cruelty complained of was intolerable to the victim, and a continuance of the marital relation by him is impracticable. A mere review of the facts found as set forth above demonstrates the intolerable character of the plaintiff\u2019s cruelty, and shows that it amounts to \u201ca practical annulling and repudiation of the marriage covenant,\u201d and is \u201cnecessarily inconsistent with a reconciliation and a resumption of cohabitation as husband and wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The condition of fact called \u201cintolerable cruelty\u201d by the statute has been found by the trial court to exist as a reasonable and logical conclusion from the subordinate facts. Such conclusion forms a sufficient basis for the ruling that the victim is entitled to a divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">This ruling does not impair the statement in the <em>McEvoy </em>case that \u201cthere are trials causing much weariness and suffering, which parties to the marriage contract must bear; the policy of the State, as well as the sacred nature of the marriage covenant, requires patient endurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">In the instant case \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>the cumulative effect of the plaintiff\u2019s cruelty upon the defendant has become such that the public and personal objects of matrimony have been destroyed beyond rehabilitation,\u201d and the condition of fact contemplated by the intolerable-cruelty clause of the statute have been properly found to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
