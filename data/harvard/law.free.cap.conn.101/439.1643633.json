If you find this to be the fact, and you further find that the plaintiff and the defendants were arriving at the intersection of said Boulevard and Talcott Street approximately at the same instant, it follows that as a matter of law the plaintiff had the right of way and had a right to assume that the defendants, or anyone else who might have occasion to enter said Boulevard from the easterly side or on the left of the plaintiff, would, as they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>entering said Boulevard, be on the lookout for the approach of any vehicle passing through said Boulevard in a northerly direction, and that the defendants would give the plaintiff an opportunity to pass said Talcott Street in a northerly direction before they drove into the easterly side of said Boulevard and in the line of northbound traffic, and if you find from all the evidence that the defendants, or either of them, saw, or could have seen by the exercise of reasonable diligence, the car of the plaintiff approaching from the south, and they, or either of them, did not give the plaintiff a reasonable opportunity to pass before they, or either of them, drove into the easterly side of said Boulevard, and the plaintiff himself was in the exercise of due care, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We have repeatedly decided that \u201cin charging the jury the trial judge is not bound to use the language of the requests. It is enough if his instructions upon these points are correct and adequate.\u201d <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>86 Conn. 335, 85 Atl. 380; <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Woodstock Agricultural Soc., </em>88 Conn. 558, 92 Atl. 160; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tobin, </em>90 Conn. 58, 96 Atl. 312; <em>State </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>91 Conn. 6, 98 Atl. 346; <em>Warner </em>v. <em>McLay, </em>92 Conn. 427, 103 Atl. 113; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Page, </em>98 Conn. 141, 119 Atl. 44; <em>Salemme </em>v. <em>Mulloy, </em>99 Conn. 474, 121 Atl. 870. The charge as a whole covers this request fully so far as it is warranted by the evidence offered. There was, therefore, no error in this particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The second claimed error is that the court erred in instructing the jury as follows: \u201cThe Connecticut Boulevard and Talcott Street intersect, it appears, although Talcott Street does not cross the Boulevard; this, however, is an intersection within the meaning of the statute. Now this is important, gentlemen, the intersection contemplated by the statute is not the intersection of the centers of the street. It is the</p>\n<p id=\"At1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>rectangular space formed by continuing the curb lines, in this case of Talcott Street into and across the Boulevard, and any space within that rectangle is the intersection of the two streets.\u201d That this instruction was correct, a reference to the statutes of this State and our decisions will clearly show. An \u201cintersecting highway\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1 of Chapter 400 of the Public Acts of 1921, as follows: \u201c\u2018Intersecting highway\u2019 shall include any public highway which joins another at an angle whether or not it crosses the other.\u201d \u201cThe term \u2018intersection of a street or public highway\u2019 in the statute means the space of the street or highway common to both streets or highways.\u201d <em>Neumann </em>v. <em>Apter, </em>95 Conn. 695, 702, 112 Atl. 350. \u201cThe words \u2018such intersection,\u2019 reasonably construed, mean all the space included within the lines of both highways where \u2018any highway joins another at an angle,\u2019 if it crosses the other; or, if one highway joins but does not cross the other, all the space that would be included within the lines of both extended to cross each other.\u201d <em>Bettilyon </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Son, Inc., </em>96 Conn. 16, 20, 112 Atl. 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The plaintiff further assigns as error that \u201cthe court erred in instructing the jury as follows: \u2018Now the plaintiff himself has testified that he saw the defendants\u2019 car entering the Boulevard from Talcott Street when he was 100 feet away, and this position of the two cars at the time was further borne out by the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s brother. Any comment I may make upon the evidence is simply a comment and in no way binding on you. It is simply my opinion, not yours. Now, the intersection referred to in the statute, as I have said, is the rectangular space formed by the juncture of the two streets. It therefore appears from the plaintiff\u2019s own statement that while the plaintiff was 100 feet away from the intersection the defendants had already entered that intersection. Under such circumstances I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>instruct you the plaintiff would have no right of way over the defendants, for on his own statement it must have appeared not that the cars would have arrived at the rectangular space called the intersection at approximately the same moment but that the defendants had arrived before he reached the intersection. He had no right to assume that the right of way would be granted him under such circumstances and to proceed on this basis. His duty if he proceeded was to do so as a reasonably prudent person might under the circumstances without the right of way, as a reasonably prudent person would have proceeded in the knowledge that he had no right of way; that was his duty.\u2019\u201d Section 2 (a) of Chapter 334 of the Public Acts of 1921, reads in part as follows: \u201cEvery driver and operator of a vehicle approaching any intersecting public street or highway shall grant the right of way at such intersection to any vehicle approaching from his right, provided such vehicles are arriving at such intersection at approximately the same time.\u201d The finding discloses that the plaintiff offered evidence to prove and claimed that he had proven, among other facts, \u201cthat when he was about one hundred feet south of Talcott Street ... he saw the automobile of the defendants just as the front of it was about to pass from Talcott Street into the Boulevard.\u201d The court was therefore correct, in the light of this statutory duty, in charging the jury \u201cthat the plaintiff would have no right of way over the defendants, for on his own statement it must have appeared not that the cars would have arrived at the rectangular space called the intersection at approximately the same moment but that the defendants had arrived before he reached the intersection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Upon the trial when the defendant Grolms, the owner of the car but not the driver, was being cross-examined on behalf of the plaintiff, he was asked this question: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u201cYou have been convicted for driving under the influence of liquor, haven\u2019t you?\u201d and answered: \u201cThat was a long time after this accident. It does not bind on this at all.\u201d Counsel for the defendants objected, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered to put in the record. The court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the evidence entirely, stating that the question was highly improper. No exception was taken by the plaintiff. \u201cException to the ruling must be taken in order to make it a ground of appeal.\u201d Practice Book, \u00a7 151, page 276. Even had an exception been taken, the ruling must be supported, as a record of conviction for intoxication could not be introduced to affect the credibility of a witness. See <em>Drazen </em>v. <em>New Haven Taxicab Co., </em>95 Conn. 500, 111 Atl. 861, and cases cited in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
