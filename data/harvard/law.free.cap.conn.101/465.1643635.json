The allegations that the maker had this note in its possession with the payee\u2019s indorsement upon it, was equivalent to an allegation of notice to the plaintiffs and the Trust Company that the payee\u2019s indorsement was an accommodation indorsement. <em>Oppenheim </em>v. <em>Simon Reigel Cigar Co., </em>90 N. Y. Supp. 355. The defendant in his answer alleged that he was an accommodation indorser upon the note and that the plaintiffs were also accommodation indorsers; thus the allegations of complaint and answer agree as to this feature of the relations of the parties to the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The defendant in his answer further alleged, in substance, that the plaintiffs and the defendant agreed between themselves to indorse the note as accommodation indorsers and to become jointly liable in case the note was not paid by the maker. This allegation the plaintiffs denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">It is the law that \u201cin the absence of an agreement to the contrary, as between themselves, successive accommodation parties are liable in the order in which their names appear, even though later signers knew that prior parties signed for accommodation.\u201d (General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Statutes, \u00a7 4426, Negotiable Instruments, Law, \u00a7 68.) Brannan\u2019s Negotiable Instruments Law (3d Ed.) p. 117; Crawford\u2019s Negotiable Instruments Law (3d Ed.) p. 92; <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Beeman-Spaulding-Woodward Co., </em>65 Ore. 93, 131 Pac. 1006, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 162. The common law of this State is the same. <em>Kirschner v. Conklin, </em>40 Conn. 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The defendant, in attempting to prove the above further allegations of his answer, offered to prove what Shalett had said to him prior to his indorsement of the note about an agreement which Mr. Keefe and Mr. Davis had made regarding the liability of the three accommodation indorsers. Upon objection this evidence was excluded and an exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The statements claimed to have been made to Solomon by Shalett in the absence of the plaintiffs, and without proof connecting Keefe and Davis with the making of any such agreement, were mere hearsay statements as to the existence of such an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">There were no such offers of further proof accompanying the statements offered as would justify the court in admitting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The question is not involved in this case whether Shalett secured the indorsement of Solomon by false representations as to what his liability would be, nor was any offer made by the defendant to prove that Keefe and Davis had in fact made any such agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">By the terms of the note, as we have stated, the defendant, a prior indorser, would be liable to the plaintiffs. The defendant claims that this apparent liability was changed. As was said in <em>Hagerthy </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>83 Me. 336, 337, 22 Atl. 223: While oral evidence is admissible to prove that the accommodation indorsers have agreed to be jointly liable, the proof \u201cshould be clear and satisfactory, inasmuch as there is easily a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>temptation to attempt to pervert the truth in such a matter, and the note is itself strong evidence that it represents the contract correctly. The burden of proof lies heavily upon\u201d the party alleging such an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
