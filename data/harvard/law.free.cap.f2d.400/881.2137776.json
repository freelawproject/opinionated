He now appeals from the denial of a Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate the judgment. His claim is that he was not adequately represented by counsel and that his plea was not voluntarily made because of the misrepresentations made to him by counsel. After an evidentiary hearing the district court found against the defendant on both issues and entered judgment denying relief. This appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-21\">If only that portion of petitioner\u2019s testimony most favorable to him were considered, then petitioner was misled. However, we note that petitioner\u2019s testimony at the hearing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-22\">(1) was not entirely consistent,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-23\">(2) was contradicted by the lawyer who represented him at the time the plea was taken,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-24\">(3) was completely contrary to the statements made in response to a careful questioning by the district court at the time the plea was taken,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-25\">(4) was contradictory to a written statement signed by petitioner and given to his counsel prior to the entry of the plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-26\">There was ample support in the evidence for the district court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-27\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
