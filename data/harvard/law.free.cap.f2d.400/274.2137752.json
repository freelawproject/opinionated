The issue raised is whether the fact that the decedent carried a policy of liability insurance on his automobile excuses plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the Arkansas non-claims statute in pursuing their cause of action against decedent\u2019s estate. Arkansas has no direct action statute which could cover the situation herein. We hold, on the basis of a carefully considered and thorough opinion of the District Court, the Honorable John E. Miller, that the noncompliance is not excused and we affirm this appeal on the basis of that opinion. Swan v. Estate of Monette, D.C.Ark., 1967, 265 F.Supp. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b323-13\">LAY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AvC\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">I fully concur in the opinion. However, I cannot pass this opportunity to observe there is basic appeal to plaintiff\u2019s approach.</p>\n<p id=\"Aba\">In Byers v. McAuley, 149 U.S. 608, 620, 13 S.Ct. 906, 910, 37 L.Ed. 867 (1893), the United States Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-18\">\u201cA citizen of another State may establish a debt against the estate. Yonley v. Lavender, 21 Wall. 276 [22 L.Ed. 36]; Hess v. Reynolds, 113 U.S. 73, [5 Sup.Ct.Rep. 377, 28 L.Ed. 927]. But the debt thus established must take its place and share of the estate as administered by the probate court; and it cannot be enforced by process directly against the property of the decedent. Yonley v. Lavender, supra. In like manner a distributee, citizen of another State, may establish his right to a share in the estate, and enforce such adjudication against the administrator personally, or his sureties, Payne v. Hook, [7 Wall. 425, 19 L.Ed. 260,] supra; or against any other parties subject to liability, Borer v. Chapman, [119 U.S. 587, 7 S.Ct. 342, 30 L.Ed. 532,] supra; <em>or in any other way which does not disturb the possession of the property by the state court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8T\">See also Markham v. Allen, 326 U.S. 490, 66 S.Ct. 296, 90 L.Ed. 256 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-19\">This court made similar observations concerning the collection of a judgment outside of probate assets against a liability insurance carrier for a decedent in Brooks v. National Bank, 251 F.2d 37 (8 Cir. 1958). There we recognized that a non-claim statute of Kansas did not have an extraterritorial effect in an action against a Kansas executor sued in Missouri for an accident happening in Missouri, and the federal action could be pursued since the action itself otherwise was not disturbing to the assets of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-20\">It is also relevant to observe that a statute of limitations bars only the remedy and not the right. United States v. Whited &amp; Wheless, Ltd., 246 U.S. 552, 564, 38 S.Ct. 367, 62 L.Ed. 879 (1918); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Rock Island Plow Co. v. Masterson, 96 Ark. 446, 132 S.W. 216 (1910). And it has been held that if a \u201cright\u201d may lawfully be pursued through a different forum where the remedy is not otherwise barred, the statute of limitations relating to the remedy should not be applicable. Titus v. Wells Fargo Bank &amp; Union Trust Co., 134 F.2d 223 (5 Cir. 1943). Cf. Brooks v. National Bank, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">It has long been held that a creditor who can assert diversity jurisdiction has a right to establish his claim within the federal courts notwithstanding the fact that the state has placed the assets of the decedent-debtor within the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court. This is so because a state statute cannot proscribe or limit federal jurisdiction. Yonley v. Lavender, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 276, 22 L.Ed. 536 (1874); Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank &amp; Trust Co., 215 U.S. 33, 43-44, 30 S.Ct. 10, 54 L.Ed. 80 (1909); Harrison v. Moncravie, 264 F. 776 (8 Cir. 1920); Miami Co. Nat\u2019l Bank of Paola, Kan. v. Bankcroft, 121 F. 2d 921 (10 Cir. 1941); United States v. Swanson, 75 F.Supp. 118 (D.Neb.1947); Hellrung v. Lafayette Loan &amp; Trust Co., 102 F.Supp. 822 (N.D.Ind.1951); Falcon Seaboard Drilling Co. v. Cluck, No. 434, not reported (D.Neb.1954) (excellent opinion by Delehant, J.); cf. Prater v. Poirier, 134 F.Supp. 499 (D.Kan. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">However, plaintiff\u2019s approach meets difficulty in the basic reasoning set forth in Security Trust Co. v. Black River Nat\u2019l Bank, 187 U.S. 211, 23 S.Ct. 52, 47 L.Ed. 147 (1902), as followed by this court in Zuckerman v. McCulley, 170 F. 2d 1015 (8 Cir. 1948):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">\u201cAnother principle, equally well settled, is that the courts of the United States, in enforcing claims against executors and administrators of a decedent\u2019s estate, are administering the laws of the State of the domicile, and are bound by the same rules that govern the local tribunals. Aspden v. Nixon, 4 How. 467, 498, [11 L.Ed. 1074].\u201d 187 U.S. at 227, 23 S.Ct. at 58.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The Court relied on an old federal decision, Pulliam v. Pulliam, 10 F. 53, 78 (C.C.1881), which pointed out the distinction between general statutes of limitations and probate non-claim statutes limiting the time for creditors to prove their claims. The court of appeals there had held that the non-claim statutes are \u201crules of property\u201d as well as statutes of limitations. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Security Trust </em>held a Minnesota non-claim statute of limitations binding upon an action filed in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">However, upon analysis, the Court was bothered by this question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">\u201cBut can it be said that, if the foreign creditor delays proceedings in the Federal court until after the time fixed by the order of the probate court for the presentment of claims had expired and after the final distribution of the estate had been effected, and after the final account of the administrator had been allowed and his office had become <em>functus officio, </em>and after all claims of local creditors had thus been precluded, he can use the Federal process to devolve a new responsibility upon the person who had acted as administrator, and to interfere with the rights of other parties, creditors or distributees, which had become vested under the regular and orderly administration of the estate under the laws of the State?\u201d 187 U.S. at 230-31, 23 S.Ct. at 59.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">And the Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">\u201cIt is the policy of the State of Minnesota, like that of many of the States, to prescribe a shorter term of limitations to claims against the estates of decedents than claims against living persons. Can that policy be defeated by a ruling of the Federal courts that the provisions of the State in that regard do not apply to parties bringing suit in those courts? In that event, the very mischief pointed out and deprecated in Yonley v. Lavender would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ensue, that \u2018The rights of those interested in the estate who are citizens of the State where the administration is conducted are materially changed, and the limitation which governs them does not apply to the fortunate creditor who happens to be a citizen of another State.\u2019 The answer given to such a proposition by this court in the case just cited was: \u2018This cannot be so. The administration laws of Arkansas are not merely rules of practice for the courts, but laws limiting the rights of parties, and will be observed by the Federal courts in the enforcement of individual rights.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 231,23 S.Ct. at 59.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">However, this rationale must be weighed in light of the doctrine of Markham v. Allen, supra. Where a party is barred as a matter of state law from reaching the assets being administered in the probate court, it is difficult to understand how \u201cvested rights\u201d would otherwise be disrupted by plaintiff\u2019s delayed pursuit to a federal judgment. Cf. Pufahl v. Estate of Parks, 299 U.S. 217, 226, 57 S.Ct. 151, 81 L.Ed. 133 (1936). Here, all the plaintiff seeks to do is to obtain a judgment, not collect one. If the debt- or has no reachable assets, this should not act as justification to bar his right to assert a claim. The purpose of non-claim statutes, in most instances, is to promote the prompt and orderly administration of estates for all parties, including creditors and distributees. See e. g., Jones v. Arkansas Farmers Ass\u2019n, 232 Ark. 186, 334 S.W.2d 887 (1960); Hurlimann v. Bank of Am. Nat\u2019l Trust &amp; Sav. Ass\u2019n, 141 Cal.App.2d 801, 297 P.2d 682, 685 (1956); In re Peers\u2019 Estate, 234 Iowa 403, 12 N.W.2d 894 (1944); Minor v. Lillard, 306 S.W.2d 541 (Mo.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">So the basic policy underlying the non-claim statute will not be disturbed by allowing plaintiff\u2019s action, since plaintiff admittedly is not and cannot pursue assets in the estate once he obtains a judgment. He seeks only the insurance coverage presumably available outside the probate court. See discussion Brooks v. National Bank, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Nevertheless, <em>Security Trust Co. </em>has not been overruled, and in fact, takes on more significance after Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938) and Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945), as to the binding effect of state law on federal courts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">Following this principle to conclusion, then, plaintiff\u2019s case must fail here, as the district court pointed out, for the basic reason that all applicable statutes of limitations of local law governing his claim have expired. As discussed by the trial court, the common law of Arkansas has long been that upon the debtor\u2019s death the general statute of limitations governing claims ceases to run and its only successor is the non-claim statute which sets the time in which claims against the estate may be filed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> State Bank v. Walker, 14 Ark. 234 (1853); Walker v. Byers, 14 Ark. 246 (1853); Biscoe v. Madden, 17 Ark. 533 (1856); McGill v. Hughes, 84 Ark. 238, 105 S.W. 255 (1907); Goins v. Sneed, 229 Ark. 550, 317 S.W.2d 269 (1958). This rule may operate to allow an extension of time beyond that allowed by the general statute of limitations and thereby be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>beneficial to the creditor, see McGill v. Hughes, 84 Ark. 238, 105 S.W. 255 (1907), or it may work a hardship upon the creditor by shortening the period of the general statute of limitations, as is the case here. In any event, plaintiff\u2019s suit in the instant case was properly dismissed by the trial court because it was barred by the running of both the general statute of limitations and the non-claim statute, as determined by Arkansas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Plaintiff weakly argues, however, that the Arkansas courts have never ruled that the general statute of limitations relating to personal injury does not continue to run after the date of the death of the decedent<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> notwithstanding the running of the non-claim statute, as to claims removed from the probate court. Cf. Darrah v. Foster, 355 S.W.2d 24 (Mo.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Assuming for purposes of argument that the general statute of limitations has not run as plaintiff claims, there remains an even more serious objection to the federal suit. Plaintiff admittedly would be given \u201cprotection of the laws\u201d not otherwise available to a resident creditor in the state courts. Cf. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra, 304 U.S. at 74-75, 58 S.Ct. 817.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">In summary, there is an appealing rationale to plaintiff\u2019s approach. There is really little justification to bar his right under the non-claim statute since he would be too late to assert any claim against estate assets, even if he obtained his judgment. However, until the local law of the state recognizes a creditor\u2019s right to pursue his claim after a non-claim statute has run <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in courts of general jurisdiction,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the federal courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>must render the same inequitable justice, the only beneficiaries of which are insurers, now fortuitously relieved from obligations previously contracted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-15\">. In Yonley v. Lavender, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 276, 22 L.Ed. 536 (1874), it was early established that the satisfaction of any judgment must be by state procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-6\">. However, there has been distinction upon the literal application of the <em>Erie </em>doctrine when they conflict with federal rights and federal rules of procedure. See Pritchard v. Downie, D.C., 201 F.Supp. 893, aff\u2019d, 309 F.2d 634 (8 Cir. 1962) (excellent opinion by Judge Young, allowing an action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 to be revived in federal court against a decedent\u2019s administrator even though the Arkansas non-claim statute had run). See also, Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b325-13\">. In most states the general statute of limitations does not cease upon the debtor\u2019s death. See, e. g., Malone v. Averill, 166 Iowa 78, 147 N.W. 135 (1914); Steele v. Cross, 366 S.W.2d 434 (Mo.1963); In re Kaspari\u2019s Estate, 71 N.W.2d 558 (N.D. 1955). Cf. Lesieur v. Simon, 73 Neb. 645, 103 N.W. 302 (1905). See Annot. 112 A.L.R. 289.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b326-5\">. In the instant case the period allowed by the statute of non-claims for filing claims against the estate expired on May 30, 1966. The plaintiff filed his claim on January 10, 1967. Had the general statute of limitations still been in effect, it would have run until November 20, 1968, three years after the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action arose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\">. The basic rationale of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins and Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, supra, is that a nonresident in federal court should be in no better position than a local creditor attempting to establish his claim in the courts of a state. As pointed out in <em>Erie, </em>this raises equal protection problems under the Constitution. A resident plaintiff-creditor faced with the same problems as the creditor here, could not proceed in the state courts of Arkansas, since the Arkansas legislature confines the jurisdiction of such suits to the probate court and the non-claim statute governing that procedure has run. Wolfe v. Herndon, 234 Ark. 543, 353 S.W.2d 540 (1962); Turner v. Meek, 225 Ark. 744, 284 S.W.2d 848 (1955). So a resident plaintiff might be faced with a good claim, not barred by a general statute of limitations, but with no state forum in which to file it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\">. In Security Trust Co. v. Black River Nat\u2019l Bank, supra, there is the novel suggestion that a non-resident creditor might file a suit in equity in federal court alleging \u201cgood cause\u201d (quaere: the existence of assets outside the estate?) to extend the \u201cnon-claim filing date\u201d in federal court since a creditor, resident or otherwise, would also have such a right in the probate court of the state, assuming local law provided it. (This is not true under the Arkansas statute.) It is reasonable to assume the same considerations of \u201cgood cause,\u201d aside from the reason the plaintiff was delayed in filing his claim, cannot govern a federal district judge sitting as a court of equity and a probate judge of the state. In the latter situation, the probate court would be concerned over the orderly administration of the assets of the estates and the rights of the parties whose interests have perhaps already vested. Whereas the federal district court might only weigh the plaintiff\u2019s possible futility of collection under state law of assets outside the probate jurisdiction and the possible time of the federal court to hear the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b326-13\">. Of. Prater v. Poirier, supra, and Darrah v. Poster, supra. In Missouri the legislature obviously cognizant of the inequity of the rule in Zuckerman v. McCulley, supra, amended their claim statute, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">\u201cUnless written notice of actions instituted or revived under Section 473.-363 or 473.367 is filed in the probate court within nine months after the first published notice of letters, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>recovery may be had in any such action on any judgment therein against the executor or administrator out of any assets being administered upon in the probate court or from any distributee or other person receiving such assets.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
