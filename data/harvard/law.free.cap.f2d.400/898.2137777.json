In 1956 he became a member of the religious sect known as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. He has formal education through the eighth grade. On January 15, 1959, he registered with his local draft board. On the following August 11, he was classified 1-0, conscientious objector. Over four years later, on October 7, 1963, he submitted to the Armed Forces physical examination and was found to be acceptable for military service. On December 13, 1963, while he was living in Corpus Christi, the draft board, in writing, submitted to the registrant three types of civilian work at the Texas State Hospital at Austin deemed appropriate in lieu of military induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">In response thereto the draft board received a letter from Elizarraraz, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-13\">\u201cI appreciate the offer that was offered to me to perform a type of civilian work at the State Hospital. My religion and my conscience does not permit me to perform any type of civilian work. I do respect my country and what it stands for, but I still have to stay within God\u2019s laws. Your truly, Pablo Elizarraraz.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">This written refusal to work in lieu of induction stood up for nearly two years, until May 13, 1965. Elizarraraz was then duly directed to report to the Texas State Hospital at Austin to do hospital work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He reported as directed, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>upon arrival he refused to sign an employment form required of all individuals who go to work at that institution. He then left the hospital without entering upon, doing, or performing any work. Indictment, conviction, and sentence followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Mr. Elizarraraz testified in his own defense. Among other things he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-5\">\"I met this lady, that I identified myself to her, and she said that she was already waiting for me, and that she had already had a notice from the Draft Board, and she gave me an application and told me to walk out in the hall and fill it out, <em>and so I told her that I had already explained it to my Draft Board in San Benito, my reason for not filling out the application, </em>[emphasis supplied] and that they still directed me here to Austin, and told me to talk to that lady, or whoever it was over here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">This testimony was followed by these questions and answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-7\">\u201cQ. Did the order tell you to go to work at the Austin State Hospital ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-8\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-9\">Q. Were you at that time, and are you now willing to work at the Austin State Hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-10\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-11\">Q. All right. Would you explain why it is to the jury and His Honor, please, that you cannot in your conscience fill out the application ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-12\">A. Well, the main thing is that I couldn't compromise myself on doing a job that would be \u2014 well, keeping me from my religious services, and at the same time\u2014 well, sometimes by violating God\u2019s principles, that, I mean, I would believe, honestly believe it was a violation of God\u2019s law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-14\">Q. All right, sir. If you could go out to the Austin State Hospital and go to work without filling out the application, would you be willing to do so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-15\">A. Yes, sir, I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-16\">Q. Would you do it today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-17\">A. Yes, sir, I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-18\">**\u2022***\u2022\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-19\">Q. Mr. Elizarraraz, before you left for Austin you told the local Draft Board that you would not fill out any application; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-20\">A. Yes, sir, and I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-21\">Q. You also told the local Draft Board in that letter that is on page 37 [of the exhibits in evidence] that your religion and conscience does not permit you to perform any type of civilian work; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-22\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-23\">Q. You didn\u2019t say anything in that letter about an application, though, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-24\">A. No, sir, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-25\">Q. All right. And you stated that to sign the order would mean that you would be agreeing to compromise your position, to sign the application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-26\">A. I believe so, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-27\">Q. You said that to Mr. Eisenberg just now, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-28\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-29\">Q. And you have also stated that it is a violation of God\u2019s law to fill out the application form; is that right ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-30\">A. No, sir, not the application itself, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-31\">Q. All right. Is it a violation of God\u2019s law for you to perform work that you are ordered to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>by the United States Government, or any Government?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-5\">A. It depends upon the work, yes, sir, I would say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-6\">Q. Well, is this civilian work at the Austin State Hospital, is it a violation of your creed to perform that work when ordered to do so by the United States ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-7\">A. That particular job, you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-8\">Q. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-9\">A. No, sir, I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-10\">Q. What would you do if they told you you had to work on Sunday ? Would \u2014 let\u2019s say you are out there, and you haven\u2019t signed any application, and they told you that, \u201cToday you are going to have to work on Sunday;\u201d what would you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-11\">A. Well, that would \u2014 I would have to tell them <em>my conditions </em>[emphasis supplied] and I had those meetings I had to attend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">With particular reference to a meeting with the Draft Board on February 27, 1964, the appellant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-13\">\u201cQ. And you were informed of your rights and the purpose of the meeting, were you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-14\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-15\">Q. And you at that time stated you refused to agree on any type of work you would be willing to perform in lieu of induction, as you felt it would be in direct conflict with your religious work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-16\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-17\">Q. You told them that, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-18\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-19\">Elizarraraz contends on appeal that the Government failed to meet its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly failed, neglected, and refused to report to the Austin State Hospital and to perform two years of civilian work in lieu of military service. At the heart of the matter, he urges that he did not fail or neglect or refuse to work <em>but that he only refused to fill in the application form presented to him when he appeared at the Hospital </em>and that such refusal cannot constitute a violation of the statute. We find this contention to be without merit. The appellant freely admitted that he knew before he went to Austin that he would be expected to fill in a job application and that before he left San Benito he told his Draft Board that he would not fill in such an application. He admitted that there was nothing in the application form which violated \u201chis duty to God\u201d, even if that had been a justifiable excuse for not filling it in and signing it, cf. United States v. Kime, 7 Cir., 1951, 188 F.2d 677, cert, den., 342 U.S. 823, 72 S.Ct. 41, 96 L.Ed. 622. The decisive factor of the case is that when the registrant was first offered civilian work in lieu of induction he categorically stated that \u201cMy religion and my conscience does not permit me to perform any type of civilian work\u201d. Pri- or to trial, he ever afterward adhered to that attitude. We entertain no doubt that the requirement to do civilian work must, of necessity, carry with it the performance of any and all acts, such as appropriate record keeping, reasonably incident to that status.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-21\">It is most impressive that although the appellant was ably and energetically represented by appointed counsel at his trial below and on this appeal, the \u201capplication form\u201d, whatever its contents, was apparently considered to be so devoid of any legal significance that it was not offered in evidence at the trial in the District Court. Therefore, it is not a part of the record here.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-22\">From the evidence in this record it was clearly within the province of the jury to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Elizarraraz\u2019s refusal to fill in the form was simply a pretext in furtherance of his previously declared resolution not to do the civilian work required by law. Actually, so far as we know or can tell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>the \u201capplication form\u201d was, in fact, not a request for work, if we strip the matter of semantics. It was not within the contemplation of the parties that he was applying for a job; he was being assigned to a job. Everybody so understood it, including the balky assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">It is true that Elizarraraz at the trial testified that he would be willing to work at the hospital if he did not have to fill in and sign the application form, but this assurance was limited by his further testimony that if he began work without filing such an application he would feel free, at his personal discretion, to prescribe the conditions upon which he would perform assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">The requirement to do civilian work in lieu of military induction cannot be frittered away by such defenses as those raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">It is next contended that the District Court committed reversible error when it overruled an objection to the following argument of the prosecutor in his summation to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-7\">\u201c * * * Our country has gone to war now in two World Wars, as they are called, engaged right now in a conflict that in some instances staggers the imagination as to the number of men involved, the number of men that are giving their lives each day. The Government in this case regarding Pablo Elizarraraz has not asked him to place his life in jeopardy, has not asked him to go to boot camp, to shine his shoes, to drill, to march \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">The objection to this argument was couched in this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-9\">\u201cYour Honor, I want to object to this line of argument. There is no question, this man is entitled to his Constitutional protection as a conscientious objector. Any argument to the effect of what he \u2014 what the Constitution affords him and what the statutes afford him is not the question in this case. It is whether or not he failed, refused and neglected to report to the Austin State Hospital out here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">In the first place, there is no constitutional right to exemption from compulsory civilian duty in lieu of military service, Wood v. United States, 5 Cir., 1967, 373 F.2d 894. Appellant did not complain to the trial judge that the argument was prejudicial or that it was calculated to inflame the jury. He did not move for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">We therefore must consider this specification under the plain error rule. We hold that the argument, under all the facts and circumstances of this case, did not constitute reversible error. It contained no opprobrious denunciation of Elizarraraz. It simply alluded to that which is common knowledge \u2014 contrasting that which the registrant could lawfully have been compelled to do had it not been for the grace extended by Congress to those who conscientiously object to military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">One of the judges is of the view that the conviction ought to be reversed because, it is said, the application contained an unconstitutional loyalty oath. The majority is unwilling to consider this question because the accused form is not in the record and the objection was never raised below or in the briefs or oral arguments here. This issue, if there be one, should first be considered, if the appellant wishes to pursue it, in appropriate proceedings instituted under 28 U.S.C., section 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">It might be further noted that if this appellant is genuinely willing to perform the duty required of him by law he still has an opportunity to convince the District Judge of that fact pursuant to a motion filed under Rule 35, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-15\">. The Grand Jury Charges:</p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">That on or about June 2, 1965, PABLO ELIZARRARAZ was a male person subject to service under the Universal Military Training and Service Act, as amended, who had duly registered under said Act with Texas Local Board No. 16, San Benito, Texas, and had been classified as a conscientious objector (1-0), and had been notified of said classification; and that on or about May 28, 1965, the said PABLO ELIZARRARAZ was duly ordered by Texas Local Board No. 16, San Benito, Texas, to report to said local board where he would receive instructions to proceed to the Austin State Hospital, Austin, Texas, within the Austin Division of the Western District of Texas, to perform civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety and interest, and the said PABLO ELIZARRARAZ was further ordered to report for employment at the Austin State Hospital and to remain in employment there for twenty-four (24) consecutive months or until such time as he was released or transferred by proper authority, and the said PABLO ELIZARRA-RAZ did knowingly fail, neglect and refuse to perform a duty required of him under the provisions of said Act in that he knowingly failed, neglected and refused (1) to accept the employment available at the Austin State Hospital, and (2) to remain in said employment for a period of twenty-four (24) consecutive months or for any period whatsoever, pursuant to the order of the local board; in violation of Title 50, United States Code Appendix, Sections 456(j) and 462(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b947-24\">. We do not burden this opinion with a recitation of all the administrative actions, letters, notices, and orders of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>Local Board in this case. We have carefully examined the record and find that the Regulations were scrupulously complied with.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b950-17\">GODBOLD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AmNx\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b950-18\">I dissent. Appellant\u2019s conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>The local board order directing appellant to report to the Austin State Hospital for civilian employment in lieu of military service is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The charge against appellant is that he knowingly failed, neglected and refused \u201c(1) to <em>accept the employment available </em>at the Austin State Hospital, and (2) to remain in said employment for a period of twenty-four consecutive months or for any period whatsoever,\u201d pursuant to the order of the local board.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayi9\">The appellant did not fail, refuse or neglect \u201cto accept the employment available\u201d at the hospital. There was no em-payment available to him except upon a condition that the hospital could not constitutionally impose upon him. The employment application which appellant de-ciined to sign contained an invalid loyalty oath. See Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 6252-7 (Vernon ed. 1962), pertinent parts of which are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>The application form was not introduced into evidence. However, by motion to dismiss the appellant raised the point that to comply with the board\u2019s order he would be required to answer questions which he could not be required to answer, and in oral argument of the motion the questions were identified as relating to membership in the Communist or Fascist Party or front organizations. On oral argument before us counsel acknowledge the presence of the loyalty oath in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Section 1 of article 6252-7 was held unconstitutional on August 30, 1967, by a three-judge district court in Gilmore v. James, 274 F.Supp. 75 (N.D.Tex.1967), aff\u2019d per curiam, 389 U.S. 572, 88 S.Ct. 695, 19 L.Ed.2d 783 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Appellant\u2019s conviction stands or falls on his refusal to sign the application form and the refusal of the state to employ him unless he did so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He did not refuse employment but declined to perform the condition attached by the state to its willingness to take him into its employ. There did not purport to be (in fact there could not validly be) a board order directing appellant to sign the form.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Appellant\u2019s conviction is not made valid by the fact that the evidence does not show that he was motivated by or even knew of the presence of the oath in the application. The causes which did motivate him are discussed below. The American citizen is ofttimes the unwitting beneficiary of judicial decisions articulating constitutional principles of which he was unaware at the time he performed an act characterized as criminal or the source of alleged civil liability. This Circuit has summarily disposed of a host of cases controlled by Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) and Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In so doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>we have not at the appellate level concerned ourselves with the motivation impelling each defendant to wilfully fail to pay the excise tax on wagering, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4401, or the occupational tax, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4411. One can fairly assume that few, if any, of these defendants refused or failed to pay the tax because of motivation that execution of the return required to accompany payment was a violation of the Fifth Amendment. But in any event we have not paused to inquire into motivation, recognizing instead that all these defendants are entitled to the benefit of the constitutional principles articulated with respect to execution of the returns which, for whatever reasons, they would not sign. No case has been remanded for further trial, and possible conviction if it could be proved that when the defendant refused to sign the return his state of mind was not directed to the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Allowing this conviction to stand would be an erosion of the principle that waiver of constitutional protections must be made knowingly and intelligently. Eli-zarraraz did not knowingly and intelligently waive \u2014 he neither knew nor could predict the law, and insofar as the record shows, he was unaware of the presence of the loyalty oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">The examples are numerous. The right of an accused to counsel \u2014 pretrial, trial and appellate \u2014 is not lost by his not knowing of the right or not insisting upon it. In Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967), the Supreme Court analyzed the general state of the law to determine whether the average lawyer (or particular attorneys engaged in the earlier New York Times litigation) was possessed of sufficient knowledge and prescience that failure to assert constitutional objections before and at trial amounted to a knowing waiver. The Court concluded there was no waiver. Elizarraraz did not take a lawyer along when he reported to the hospital. There cannot be exacted of this defendant a higher standard to know and to assert the constitutional bases for his actions than was required of the distinguished attorneys in <em>Curtis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">Without regard to presence of the loyalty oath, appellant was justified in refusing to sign a document characterized to him as an application for employment. He could not refuse to give relevant employment data, verbally or in writing, such as that relating to job placement (former employment, skills, training, etc.) or that necessary to maintain proper employment records (home address, next of kin, Social Security number, etc.). But for the conscientious objector the difference between supplying necessary data and affirmatively requesting employment to which he is ordered in lieu of military service is as wide and deep as the Grand Canyon.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Stripped to the nerve, what happened in this case could not be plainer. And it is no less plain because couched in the halting language of a man with an eighth-grade education, seeking tcf. articulate to administrative agencies,\u2022/\u2022\u2022and then to courts and judges, the call of his conscience and his religion. Elizarraraz was not engaged in frivolous pretext. His refusal to sign an application for employment was justifiable. He <em>would </em>report for work, and did so. He <em>would </em>commence work, so long as he was acting pursuant to orders of the board. He <em>would not </em>by act and writing <em>affirmatively request </em>the employment that he was willing to, accept under compulsion. He would work but he would not apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>for work.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Repeatedly in his testimony appellant referred to his position that he could not <em>agree to compromise himself.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The majority view the application as reasonably incident to appellant\u2019s embarking on his duties. When stripped of the statutorily-required loyalty oath the requirement of an executed application loses its viability, for the same function can be performed by securing data from the registrant. Reception of conscientious objectors reporting to Austin State Hospital for employment is nothing new to the hospital, as the record in this case and prior decisions of this court show. Requiring the registrant, who is under orders to report to work, to request the job, as opposed to securing data, makes no sense except as a means for carrying out the invalid legislative command. The hospital could get as much information from a data sheet or an interview as from a request for employment. If the hospital gains some advantage in employer-employee relations by being able to say to its conscientious objector employees \u201cYou asked for the job,\u201d this is a benefit it may not exact of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">No one should understand better than prosecutors and judges the difference between acting by command and by consent. The Supreme Court recognized it in the flag salute case, West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943). The affirmative act of asking in writing, just as the salute to the flag, \u201crequires the individual to communicate by word and sign his acceptance of the political ideas it thus bespeaks. Objection to this form of communication when coerced is an old one, well known to the framers of the Bill of Rights.\u201d 319 U.S. at 633, 63 S.Ct. at 1183, 87 L.Ed. at 1635. \u201cTo sustain the compulsory flag salute we are required to say that [the] Bill of Rights * * * left it open to public authorities to compel him to utter what is not in his mind.\u201d Id. at 634, 63 S.Ct. at 1183, 87 L.Ed. at 1635.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Others have recognized the distinction between obedience to the power of the sovereign and affirmation. Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, would affirmatively recognize the authority of Henry II and of the concordat at Clarendon but with the qualification \u201csaving the honor of the Church and my order.\u201d Green, A Short History of the English People, 134-35 (1877). Sir Thomas More would die at the block not for unwillingness to recognize the power of the sovereign Henry VIII but for refusal to take the oath required of every person of legal age in England swearing allegiance to the Act of Succession. 2 Churchill, A History of the English Speaking Peoples 64-65 (1955). The mythological William Tell shot the apple from his son\u2019s head for refusal to salute the bailiff\u2019s hat.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">There is no constitutional right to exemption from military service or to status as conscientious objector. The United States may <em>order </em>the citizen to military service, or to the statutory substitute of acceptable civilian employment in lieu thereof, without violation of First Amendment rights. But it cannot without violation of those rights, <em>order him to consent, assent or ask for </em>either military service or the civilian job in lieu thereof. The conscientious objector can be required to obey notwithstanding his religious principles. But his First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>Amendment rights may not be overridden by requiring that he communicate by word or sign that he seeks what he can be compelled to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The statute and the regulations respond to the limits imposed by the Constitution. The statute does not require that the conscientious objector request civilian work, but that he may be ordered by the board to perform such civilian work as the board deems appropriate. 50 U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7 456(j). The regulations, while encouraging cooperation and assent, maintain a continuing distinction between consent and command. The registrant shall submit three types of civilian work he is qualified to do and offers to perform. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.20(a). He is not required to offer to perform any kind of work. This procedure is to give him an \u201copportunity to avail himself of a free choice of a place of employment.\u201d United States v. Simpson, 135 F.Supp. 802, 804 (N.D.Cal.1955). If he ails to submit types of work which he offers to perform, or if the local board finds none of the offered work appropriate, the board notifies him of three types of work it deems appropriate. The registrant files a statement with the board that he offers, or does not offer to perform any of the suggested types of work. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.20(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">If the registrant and the board are unable to agree on a type of civilian work to be performed, the State Director of Selective Service or his representative must meet with registrant and board and offer his assistance in reaching an agreement. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.20(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">If after the meeting the board and registrant are still unable to agree the board orders him to report for work it deems appropriate. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.20 (d). Throughout the process at the board level the registrant may act voluntarily, and if he does not the procedure moves to the next prescribed step, until the ultimate and inevitable subjection to board command. It is entirely inconsistent with the recognition throughout of the registrant\u2019s right to give or withhold his volition that after the board command issues he may be in violation of the statute for declining to make the offer to perform that at all prior stages he has been allowed but never required to make. The term \u201cconscientious objector\u201d carries within it the concepts of conscience and a congressionally-recog-nized privilege of objecting, with concomitant powers to command the objector, and excludes concepts stultifying in any degree recognition of the right of the human spirit to say \u201cI will obey but I do object.\u201d The distinction is no less applicable to the registrant ordered to military service. He must report as ordered, must take the step forward at the induction center, and must give relevant data. But no inductee is, or constitutionally may be, required to fill out and sign a form requesting induction. The exigencies of military life, or even of civilian employment at the hospital, may require the serving of non-kosher food to the orthodox Jew. But he cannot be forced to sign a request for such a diet.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">This case represents a greater infringement on the Bill of Rights than the <em>Barnette </em>case. <em>Barnette </em>did not turn upon possession by the school children of particular religious views but upon whether there was power vel non to make the flag salute a legal duty of any citizen regardless of his religious views, 319 U.S. at 634-635, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. at 1635-1636. Elizarraraz is sought to be required to request employment in spite of his particular religious views. Also the request is required of him in a context where his presence at the scene and participation as an actor in the events is by reason of a Congressional policy of allowing him status as a conscientious objector because of his particular religious views.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">The majority say the refusal to sign the form is not determinative but merely an element of and in furtherance of an earlier statement by appellant that his religion and his conscience would not permit him to do civilian work. Appellant is charged with refusing to accept described employment. He is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>charged with being contumacious or uncooperative or with making statements evidencing an unacceptable state of mind. The only significance of appellant\u2019s state of mind before he went to the hospital, or at the hospital, is in determining whether he knowingly failed or refused to accept the described and available employment. His state of mind could not make the employment available as charged in the indictment, and employment was not available unless appellant would do something he could not constitutionally be compelled to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Nevertheless let us look at appellant\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">The decisive factor in the case is said to be a letter written approximately 18 months before appellant was ordered to, and did, report to the hospital, and is described as a categorical position ever afterwards adhered to. It was written in response to the suggestion by the board of three types of civilian work, a submission the board is required to make by 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.20(b). The board\u2019s letter appropriately called for appellant to state whether he did offer or did not offer to perform any of the suggested types of work. Appellant refused, but he said too much. The reference to \u201cany type of civilian employment\u201d was not <em>ever </em>afterwards adhered to. It was <em>never </em>afterwards adhered to. Subsequent events make perfectly clear that if appellant ever intended his letter as a refusal of all civilian work that intent did not last long. The meeting required by \u00a7 1660.20 was held in February 1964, and appellant attended. The report thereof shows not that he refused any civilian work but refused to agree on any <em>type </em>of civilian work. This he is free to do. The board concluded hospital work at Austin State Hospital was appropriate. Thirteen months later a vacancy occurred at the hospital.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The hospital told the board when appellant was to report, and the board order was issued. Elizarraraz reported to the board as directed. He received his instructions, boarded the bus with his suitcase and work clothes and a one-way ticket and reported as and when ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">The emphasis on the letter, and the denigration of appellant\u2019s position taken throughout the administrative stages, a position he is allowed by the regulations to take, are an implicit approach that the conviction must stand not because he refused available employment as charged but because his motivations and his unwillingness to volunteer during administrative stages are viewed as unacceptable. He is to stand convicted for his state of mind and not for doing the act with which he is charged.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>It is helpful to see testimony additional to that quoted in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">\n<em>Miss Follette (Clerk of the Board).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">(After testifying that appellant reported to the board and was told to report to the hospital.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-7\">Q.

Had the clerk who dealt with appellant at the hospital sought to elicit from him, verbally or in writing, relevant and necessary data, without insistence that he affirmatively act to request employment, this case might never have arisen.

Comments of government counsel at the trial so denigrated appellant\u2019s authorized and voluntary actions that, though not objected to, they justify reversal as plain error. Appellant denied having received a voluntary form which the government contended he had not returned.

He didn\u2019t sign a form that was sent to him, a voluntary form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">Under the regulations the registrant is not required to sign the form referred to.

More of the same followed that quoted:</p>\n<p id=\"b956-15\">Q.
