California, No. 22,052A/F, in which our opinion has today been filed. The appeal is taken from the same order as was the <em>Gilmore </em>appeal \u2014 an order denying a motion for the convening of a three-judge court. Appellant in severing his appeal, has apparently done so in order to dissociate himself from the single issue which, in <em>Gilmore, </em>we found', to support three-judge-court jurisdiction,, and to confine his claim to what in <em>Gilmore </em>we described as \u201ccertain present practices allegedly followed at [the California State Penitentiary at] San Quentin which are not state-wide in application and not properly the subject of three-judge-court jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-20\">Accordingly, as to appellant Magee the order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
