Both drivers were interviewed by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police Officer, Constable Lakaehuk, at police detachment headquarters. Appellant stated to Constable Lakaehuk that he was the driver and owner of the vehicle. However, he could produce no evidence of ownership. The constable issued a summons under British Columbia\u2019s Motor Vehicle Act, naming the appellant as the owner of the car. Appellant signed the summons and paid the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">Subsequently, appellant was tried and convicted of the aforementioned offense. At the trial, Constable Lakaehuk testified as to appellant\u2019s statements and actions at the time of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">The indictment charged that the car was driven by appellant in interstate commerce between Las Vegas, Nevada, and Vernon, British Columbia. The trial court instructed the jury that it could return a verdict of guilty if it found that appellant transported the car in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-16\">Appellant appeals, asserting two errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-17\">1. It was error to admit Government\u2019s exhibit No. 1, a copy of the summons, and the testimony of Constable Lakaehuk, as such were derived from a period of custodial interrogation before or during which appellant was not informed of his \u201cMiranda\u201d rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-18\">2. It was error to instruct the jury that it could find appellant guilty if it found he transported the automobile \u201cin foreign commerce\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-19\">We turn briefly to appellant\u2019s assignments of error. They will be discussed in the order noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-20\">Appellant first contends that the statements which he made to Constable Lakaehuk and the summons which he signed were inadmissible under Miranda v. State of Arizona,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as he had not been informed of his legal rights as required by that decision. <em>Miranda </em>addressed itself to \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d, which was defined as questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after an accused had been taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-21\">We carefully have examined the transcript of the trial proceedings in this case, and particularly the direct and cross examination of Constable Lakaehuk. We find nothing in this record to indicate or even suggest that appellant was \u201ctaken into custody\u201d within the usual meaning of that phrase. Non-custodial interrogation dees not violate the ruling of <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-22\">During the brief interrogation appellant was asked nothing upon the general subject of a stolen vehicle, or whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>had stolen the car he was driving at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Since the record clearly reflects that appellant was not in custody, we do not find the circumstances to be such as to bring the case under the <em>Miranda </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Because of this finding, we need not discuss other aspects .of this assigned error urged by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We find little merit in appellant\u2019s second contention. The indictment charged that between the dates of October 6, 1965, and October 24, 1965, appellant \u201cdid transport or cause to be transported in interstate commerce from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Vernon, B. C., Canada, through the Northern Division of the Eastern District of Washington, a certain motor vehicle\u201d, knowing the same to have been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">It is well settled that an indictment following specifically the language of the approved form<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which charges the crime of transportation of a stolen motor vehicle from a point in one state to that in another is sufficient, without alleging the conclusion that the vehicle was transported \u201cin interstate commerce\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We see no reason to establish a critical distinction between the words \u201cin interstate commerce\u201d and \u201cin foreign commerce\u201d as such are used in the statute. No logical reason has been advanced by appellant which convinces us of the wisdom of such a rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In either case, the phrase is surplusage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">We have reviewed the indictment returned in this case and upon which appellant stood trial. It is clear and unambiguous and we cannot find that appellant could be misled by the terms thereof. The charge is clear, that he transported a stolen motor vehicle from a designated point in the United States to a designated point in Canada, between certain specified dates, knowing the same to have been stolen, and in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">Finding no error, the judment is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-14\">. 384 U.S. 436, S6 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-23\">.
