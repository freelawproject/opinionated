Liberty had moved for a dismissal of the enforcement action on the ground that the Accident Board\u2019s award was not \u201cfinal\u201d since Liberty had brought a suit in the state court to set aside the award. The United States claims that the award was \u201cfinal\u201d since it was not prosecuted within twenty days of its issuance. Vernon\u2019s Ann.Civ.St. art. 8307, \u00a7 5. If the award were \u201cfinal\u201d, then the summary judgment was properly granted. We find Digby v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, 5 Cir., 1957, 239 F.2d 569 dispositive as to finality. The award being final, the summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-19\">We find no abuse of discretion by the District Court in its award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
