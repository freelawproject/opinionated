Plaintiffs, appellees herein, are trustees of the Oregon-Washington Carpenters-Employers Pension, and Health and Welfare, Funds. They filed a complaint seeking specific performance of certain trust agreements which they alleged were incorporated by reference into a labor agreement signed by defendant. Defendant, appellant herein, is a small building contractor. He contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the District Court did not have jurisdiction because he is neither \u201cin commerce\u201d nor engaged in an \u201cindustry affecting commerce\u201d as required by Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We consider here only the issue of the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-16\">In support of his contention that the District Court lacked jurisdiction, appellant urges that he purchased all of his supplies and performed all of his contracts during the period in question in Oregon, and did no work for any company engaged in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-17\">The record notably lacks adequate evidence on behalf of appellees in support of the District Court\u2019s jurisdictional requirement. We find this evidence to be insufficient. We glean from the record in this regard only that the plumbing fixtures which appellant used in 1963, 1964, and 1965 were manufactured outside Oregon,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that cost of these items totalled, for both labor and materials, some $5,600 to $8,000 for the years in question,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that appellant\u2019s annual gross income averaged about $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-18\">The District Court determined that it had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-19\">The terms \u201cin commerce\u201d or \u201cindustry affecting commerce\u201d are broadly defined. Many authorities require a direct purchase of materials from another state, usually in comparatively substantial quantities, to find jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>size of a particular business <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or the actual dollar value of commerce conducted<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> alone is not determinative of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">The record establishes the following with regard to appellant\u2019s activities: He did not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-5\">1) construct outside Oregon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\">2) subcontract with contractors engaged in business outside Oregon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-8\">3) purchase materials or supplies from persons outside Oregon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-10\">4) contract with subcontractors outside Oregon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-12\">5) do any business with any firm or company in any other states;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-14\">6) work on any federal, state, or political subdivision projects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-16\">7) ever work on any defense projects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-17\">8) perform work on a facility directly utilized for the purpose of interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-19\">This manifest lack of interstate contact, considered with the significant insufficiency of appellees\u2019 affirmative evidence upon the jurisdictional question, distinguishes this case from those relied upon by appellees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-20\">Clearly, the evidence is insufficient to establish that appellant engaged in interstate commerce or in industry affecting commerce. We find the District Court lacked jurisdiction. . Because of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to reach the remaining issues raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-27\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to the District Court to vacate judgment and dismiss appellees\u2019 complaint for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-13\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a) (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-14\">. There was actually no evidence as to this, but the District Court took judicial notice of the \u2018fact.\u2019 In the light of our conclusion, we need not discuss the propriety of its having done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-21\">.
