The test to be applied in the determination of useful life is well established. Massey Motors, Inc. v. United States, 364 U.S. 92, 97, 80 S.Ct. 1411, 4 L.Ed.2d 1592 (1960); Treas. Reg. 1.167(a)-l(b). Despite some questionable language in the Tax Court\u2019s opinion with regard to this test, we believe that the Tax Court applied the established legal standards and reached a conclusion which is not clearly erroneous. As to the second issue, we agree with the reasoning set forth in the Tax Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
