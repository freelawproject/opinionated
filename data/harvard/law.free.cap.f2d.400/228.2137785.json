City of Redding, 304 U.S. 252, 58 S.Ct. 865, 82 L.Ed. 1323 (1938), and Ex parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L.Ed. 152 (1933).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOT5\">Appellants are 89 inmates of the California State Prison at San Quentin. The complaint names as defendants the Peo-pie of the State of California, various prison officials and the head of the State Department of Correction. Appellants seek an injunction against the enforcement of certain rules adopted by the State Director of Corrections and contained in Department of Corrections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Transmittal Letter No. 26/66, dated September 19, 1966, relating to the contents of prison law libraries and the future prison policy as to the obtaining and keeping by prisoners of private law books and court opinions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants contend that these regulations violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment in that they seriously infringe their rights of access to the courts and discriminate between indigent and affluent prisoners (in that the latter can obtain outside counsel for legal research, thus gaining effective access to the courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In our judgment the constitutional questions thus posed cannot be said to be plainly unsubstantial under the <em>Pore-sky </em>standards. Courts are currently struggling with the question of the extent of a prisoner\u2019s rights to have access to legal materials, e. g., our opinion in Hatfield v. Bailleaux, 290 F.2d 632 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 368 U.S. 862, 82 S.Ct. 105, 7 L.Ed.2d 59 (1961). The Supreme Court has not yet spoken on the subject and the law can hardly be said to be settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We conclude that the District Court was in error in its ruling that no substantial question of constitutional law was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-19\">Appellees urge affirmance upon two additional grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b278-20\">First, they contend that the regulations in question were not those of an \u201cadministrative board or commission\u201d under \u00a7 2281, but rather were promulgated by one man \u2014 the State Director of Correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-21\">We find no merit in this distinction. While the statute making provisions for three-judge courts is to be regarded as \u201can enactment technical in the strict sense of the term and to be applied as such,\u201d Phillips v. United States, 312 U.S. 246, 251, 61 S.Ct. 480, 483, 85 L.Ed. 800 (1941), still, as the Court in that case recognized, \u201cThe crux of the business is procedural protection against improvident state-wide doom by a federal court of a state\u2019s legislative policy.\u201d 312 U.S. at page 251, 61 S.Ct. at page 483.</p>\n<p id=\"AbP\">The regulation here is statewide in its application and is as effective and authoritative in its establishment of state policy as if it had been announced by a board of more than one member. See McCormick &amp; Co. v. Brown, 52 F.2d 934, 937 (4th Cir. 1931), aff\u2019d (without noting the particular point), 286 U.S. 131, 52 S.Ct. 522, 76 L.Ed. 1017 (1932) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Second, appellees contend that appellant\u2019s motion for a three-judge court was properly denied since the complaint not only attacks the regulation promulgated by the State Director of Corrections but also, and primarily, is directed at certain prison practices allegedly followed at San Quentin which are not statewide in application and not properly the subject of three-judge court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">This, however, is no justification for refusal to convene a three-judge court as to the tendered issues which are properly within its jurisdiction. Remaining issues can be withheld for single-judge determination. See Wright, Federal Courts, 165 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Reversed and remanded with instructions that the order be set aside and for further proceedings looking toward the convening of a three-judge court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ALu\">. \u201cAn interlocutory or permanent injunetion restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of any State statute by restraining the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution of such statute or of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under State statutes, shall not be granted by any district court or judge thereof upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute unless the application therefor is heard and determined by a district court of three judges under section 2284 of this title.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AXl\">.
