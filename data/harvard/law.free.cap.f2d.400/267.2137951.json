The District Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict, and Uniform Oil appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">Uniform Oil is a Montana corporation which operated a single retail gasoline and service station in Helena, Montana. Appellee Phillips Petroleum Company is a major oil producer and petroleum products retailer. Appellee Bridges is Phillips\u2019 jobber in Helena. He performs the function of Phillips\u2019 agent. He leases four service stations from Phillips in Helena, operating one himself and subleasing the others to appellees Cullen, Gardner, and Norwood, who each operates the station leased by him. Bridges purchases Phillips\u2019 products from Phillips and in turn sells them to his lessees. He receives no commissions from Phillips for performing the function of jobber. Phillips owns all the permanent fixtures which comprise the four stations in Helena, but the individual lessees own their respective inventories.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-18\">In its complaint Uniform Oil alleged that the appellees had conspired to restrain trade and eliminate competition, in violation of the Sherman Act, by engaging in price fixing in the retail gasoline market in Helena, Montana. In reviewing the District Court\u2019s directed verdict, we are required to decide \u201cwhether the evidence in its entirety would rationally support a verdict for the plaintiff, assuming that the jury took, as it would be entitled to take, a view of the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d Wilkerson v. McCarthy, 336 U.S. 53, 65, 69 S.Ct. 413, 93 L.Ed. 497 (1949) (Frankfurter, J\u201e concurring). Viewed in this light, the evidence would support the determination, had it been made, not only that the individual appellees entered into a price-fixing agreement among themselves, but also that Phillips was involved in the conspiracy. It is, of course, well settled that, within the scope of the Sherman Act, price fixing is illegal per se. Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 78 S.Ct. 514, 2 L.Ed. 2d 545 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-19\">The district judge believed that although there may have been an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ment among the individual appellees to fix prices, the fact that they agreed to <em>lower, </em>rather than raise, the prices negated any unlawful intent. He also concluded that there was absence of proof that Phillips was a party to whatever agreement or conspiracy the individual appellees may have undertaken. Uniform Oil\u2019s contentions on appeal with regard to these points appear to have merit, but we do not reach them. Nor do we need consider the appellees\u2019 contention that Uniform Oil failed to prove the amount of damages, if any, sustained by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The directed verdict was proper because Uniform Oil failed to offer adequate proof that the activity in question was in interstate commerce or had a substantial effect upon interstate commerce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has recently stated, \u201cit is well established that an activity which does not itself occur <em>in </em>interstate commerce comes within the scope of the Sherman Act if it substantially <em>affects </em>interstate commerce.\u201d Burke v. Ford, 389 U.S. 320, 321, 88 S.Ct. 443, 444, 19 L.Ed.2d 554 (1967) (emphasis in original). The alleged illegal activities of which Uniform Oil complained occurred only in the city of Helena and were, therefore, intrastate in nature. This being so, Uniform Oil was required to prove that the transactions in question had a \u201cnot insubstantial\u201d effect upon interstate commerce. Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 6, 78 Sup.Ct. 514, 2 L.Ed.2d 545 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">Uniform Oil established that it purchased some petroleum products \u2014 an undefined quantity \u2014 from a refinery in Billings, Montana. This refinery obtained its crude oil from the Elk Basin Field in Wyoming. Uniform Oil also made purchases from a refinery in the Kevin-Sunburst Field in Montana. There is no evidence as to the volume or dollar amount of the purchases which Uniform Oil made from these two refineries. Uniform Oil honored all major oil company credit cards under an arrangement to be paid for such credit sales through credit-card processing by an oil company located in Spokane, Washington. Submission of the accounts by Uniform Oil and payment by this other oil company was to be accomplished by mail. But Uniform Oil offered no evidence to establish its gross or net sales or the amount or portion of sales, if any, which were completed by credit-card payment through interstate commerce. Uniform Oil introduced no other evidence relating to the effect which its business, or any decline thereof, would have upon interstate commerce.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Therefore, assuming that there was involvement with interstate commerce in the appellant\u2019s operation, there was nothing upon which the jury might have based an assessment of the substantiality of that involvement. Such proof may have been, and probably was, readily available. Nevertheless, it was not produced, and speculation as to its probable availability cannot cure the manifest insufficiency of evidence upon the record and be held to supply the required proof that the effect was \u201cnot insubstantial.\u201d The absence of such indispensable proof deprived the District Court of jurisdiction over the Sherman Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u201cWhether a purely local or intrastate conspiracy unreasonably restrains interstate commerce is primarily a factual question, i. e. does the local price fixing conspiracy affect substantially the flow of interstate commerce? If the answer is yes, then only are we concerned with the effect of the price-fixing under the per se doctrine. In fact, unless there is a finding that the local and intrastate activities complained of and as alleged in the indictment, substantially affected interstate commerce, there is no jurisdiction in a district court over the alleged Sherman Act violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-17\">Las Vegas Merchant Plumbers Ass\u2019n v. United States, 210 F.2d 732, 747 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 348 U.S. 817, 75 S.Ct. 29, 99 L.Ed. 645 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-5\">. This issue was one of the grounds offered by the appellees to the District Court in support of their motion for a directed verdict. The District Court, however, apparently did not reach the point of ruling upon this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-6\">. The only evidence introduced at the trial with regard to the effect of the business upon interstate commerce is the following direct testimony of the president of Uniform Oil:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">\u201cQ Now, would you please describe your operation with regard to credit cards?</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">\u201cA We took all credit cards. We accepted the credit cards of all of the major companies, and they, in turn, were taken by our supplier, who charges us a flat rate of six percent of the cost of the purchases for handling the credit cards, and no recourse on the part of the supplier to us. Once we turned in the credit cards to our supplier, why, we were through with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-17\">\u201cQ And where was your supplier located?</p>\n<p id=\"b317-18\">\u201cA Well, the Big West Oil Company is a Montana corporation, its principal place of \u2014 its principal office, however, is in the Hutton Building in Spokane, Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-19\">\u201cQ And what kind of credit cards did you accept in the business?</p>\n<p id=\"b317-20\">\u201cA We accepted the Big West credit cards and all other credit cards \u2014 Phillips; Eneo; Standard Oil of New Jersey; Standard Oil of California \u2014 all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-21\">\u201cQ How were they processed?</p>\n<p id=\"b317-22\">\u201cA They were turned into the Big West Oil Company and credited against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>our account with them, less the six percent carrying charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u201cQ They were processed in Spokane, Washington?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u201cQ Now, John, do you know where the gas originated that came into your station?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u201cA We took gasoline from two places: We took directly from the refinery, which is located at Sunburst, up in the Kevin-Sunburst Field, and we took from the pipe line, which is the Yellowstone Pipe Line from Billings, Montana, and that has a station here in Helena. This is one of the points of the pipe line.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">\u201cQ Does the pipe line run interstate?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">\u201cA Yes, it does. It goes to Spokane.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">\u201cQ This Kevin Field, that is within Montana?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">\u201cA Yes, it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">\u201cQ Did they sell \u2014 do they handle a particular type gasoline like Conoco?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">\u201cA That is the Big West Refinery, they have exchanged it with the major companies and they draw from the pipe line here also.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-27\">\u201cQ What I was wondering, how do you know what kind of gas, how did you know what kind of gasoline you were getting from the pipe line?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-28\">\u201cA We had our choice. We would purchase lots of seven thousand gallons from the Big West Refinery at Kevin, and we would take in loads of eight thousand gallons from the pipe line. So it pretty well determined what we had in the way of storage at the time we ordered gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-30\">\u201cQ What other companies\u2019 gasoline are transmitted through the pipe line, or were at that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-31\">\u201cA Well, the pipe line was owned by the various major refineries. Carter at that time; now Hinkle, or Humble; Continental; Union, which also has its own refinery in Montana; En-eo, and I believe Husky. And the refined product which was going through that pipe line was refined in Billings, mostly from crude, from the Elk Basin Field in Wyoming.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
