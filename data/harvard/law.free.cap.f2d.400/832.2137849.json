After a number of unsuccessful applications for post-conviction relief in the New Jersey Courts, he filed a petition for habeas corpus<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that his State Court conviction was based upon illegally seized evidence, that he was denied counsel in the perfection of his appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>the trial judge\u2019s comments during the trial denied him a fair trial. This petition was denied upon the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-5\">(1) That the refusal by the New Jersey Courts to apply Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, [81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081] (1961), to the Petitioner\u2019s case when raised in a 1962 collateral proceeding was in accord with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, [85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601] (1965); and (2) the comments by the trial judge were cured in the charge so as not to affect the fundamental fairness of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In our view, the District Court misconceived the effect of <em>Linkletter, </em>supra. In that case, the Supreme Court held that <em>Mapp </em>is retroactive to the limited extent that it applies to those cases which were still not \u201cfinal\u201d as of June 19, 1961. Here, because Petitioner had not as yet been sentenced on June 19, 1961, it is clear that neither his right to appeal nor the time for an application for a writ of certiorari could have run and, thus, his conviction was not final as of June 19, within the meaning of <em>Linkletter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The second ground of the petition, that the comments by the trial judge denied the Petitioner a fair trial, is without merit for the reason stated by the District Court. Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed insofar as it disposes of this particular ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">However, as to the first ground of the petition, the District Court is directed to hold a hearing in order to determine whether Petitioner \u201cdeliberately bypassed the orderly procedure of the state courts\u201d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and if not, whether the evidence introduced was illegally seized. Further, we suggest that the Court consider the desirability of appointing counsel to represent Petitioner in such hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-12\">. He had filed an earlier petition for ha-beas corpus which was denied upon the ground that he had failed to exhaust his State Court remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-13\">. The gravamen of this phase of the ha-beas corpus petition is apparently that the Petitioner failed to take a timely appeal because he was not given counsel and, therefore, should not be denied the relief which he believes would follow from an application of Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), to his case. Thus, it appears that this ground is not separate from the <em>Mapp </em>question, discussed infra. If, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>ever, tlie Petitioner entertains a different view, he is free to raise it before the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"ang-dedup-1\">.
