SWEIGERT, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b198-12\">HAMLIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">Billy Joe Martin, appellant herein, was convicted after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California for a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (smuggling narcotics). He made a timely appeal to this court, which has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">Appellant was stopped by United States Customs Inspector Geiger at the San Ysidro port of entry while he was driving across the Mexican border into the United States. Geiger questioned appellant about his citizenship, the purpose of his trip, and whether or not he was bringing anything back from Mexico. Appellant appeared to be very talkative and Mr. Geiger advised him to drive into the secondary customs area, where he was asked to go into the office. Geiger then asked him to remove his coat; appellant did so and handed it to him. Geiger observed that the coat seemed to be bulky on one side and that there was a large amount of pink tissue paper in the inside pocket. As Geiger started to look inside the jacket to see what the bulky package was, appellant said, \u201cI bet I know what that is; somebody must have put that there.\u201d The package was opened and found to contain what was later stipulated to be five packets of heroin weighing a total of 4.30 ounces. A little later a customs agent with the Bureau of Customs, Treasury Department, one Mr. Jackson, took over and advised appellant \u201cthat he did have certain constitutional rights, that he had a right to remain silent, that he didn\u2019t have to make any statements, sign any papers unless he so desired, that he was entitled to and would be provided with an attorney of his choice, and if he couldn\u2019t afford one the government would provide one at any and all times of the proceedings relative to his interrogation.\u201d He was also advised that \u201cthe statements he did make if he chose to make any could and might be used against him.\u201d He was then given a \u201cRights of Waiver\u201d form which was read by the appellant and signed by him. This signed waiver is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Appellant then told Jackson that he had gone from Los Angeles to Mexico on a pleasure trip; that he had visited a house of ill repute in Tijuana; that he had become intoxicated and that he had been drugged. When he was questioned at length about the heroin found in his coat, he first stated that an unidentified Mexican had given it to him and told him where to deliver it. Later he changed his story and disclaimed any knowledge concerning the heroin found in his possession and stated that he could not remember or did not know whom it belonged to.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">A hearing was held before the district judge in the absence of the jury to determine whether the warning given to appellant either orally or in writing was sufficient under Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed.2d 694. The district judge held that the warning was not sufficient under <em>Miranda </em>and that nothing concerning the procuring of the heroin should be admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-19\">In the prosecution\u2019s case no attempt was made to introduce into evidence any part of appellant\u2019s story to the customs agents of his trip to Tijuana. However, when appellant himself testified he gave a rather bizarre and unusual story of having gone to Tijuana with a man known to him only as Jupiter, who gave him $1,000 while there. We have set out in the margin a summary of a portion of such testimony and excerpts of other testimony given by appellant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>On cross-examination government counsel asked appellant and received without objection the following question and answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\">\u201cQ. Did you tell the customs officials at the border about Mr. Jupiter?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201cA. Yes, I told them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">On rebuttal the government called Agent Jackson. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APE\">\u201cQ. Referring to the early morning hours of March 30th of this year did you have an opportunity to have a conversation with the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-23\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-24\">\u201cQ. Where did this conversation take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-25\"><em>\u201cA. </em>At the border port of entry, San Ysidro * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-26\">\u201cQ. During the course of this conversation did the defendant ever tell you anything about a man named Jupiter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-27\">\u201cA. Not to my recollection.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Appellant contends that the admission of this question and answer was error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The government contends that the warnings given to appellant were sufficient under the rule of Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, and that the district court was in error in not permitting the government to introduce the entire statement made by appellant to the customs officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In support of this argument counsel for the government points out that the oral warning given to appellant together with the written warning signed by him sufficiently complied with the requirements of <em>Miranda. </em>This is a very close question, particularly when we compare the warning given with some of the language found in <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The government\u2019s argument is persuasive. However, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the warning did not sufficiently comply with <em>Miranda, </em>the challenged question was still proper. The opinions in <em>Miranda </em>occupy over a hundred pages. The Court is there mainly concerned with preventing the introduction in evidence of any incriminating statement made by a defendant where the proper warning has not been given. Nowhere is there any reference to excluding evidence that the defendant <em>did not </em>say something. The nearest the decision comes to this matter is found in the following statement: \u201cThe privilege against self-incrimination protects the individual from being compelled to incriminate himself in any manner; it does not distinguish between degrees of incrimination. Similarly, for precisely the same reason no distinction may be drawn between in-culpatory statements and statements alleged to be merely \u2018exculpatory\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">In this case the question asked of Agent Jackson called for neither an in-culpatory nor an exculpatory statement. Indeed, it did not call for evidence of any <em>statement </em>at all, but merely pointed out that to the witness\u2019 recollection appellant had never mentioned the name Jupiter to the customs agents. It only reflected on the credibility of appellant\u2019s earlier testimony that he had told the agents about Jupiter. The facts in this case distinguish it from those in Gros-hart v. United States, 392 F.2d 172, 9th Cir., March 27, 1968. In <em>Groshart </em>the court dealt with statements that had actually been made by the appellant and were later used to impeach him. Here, however, the questioned impeaching evidence was not an earlier statement made by appellant. We therefore hold that the trial court did not err in allowing the question to and answer of Agent Jackson to be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">The only other contention made by appellant is his claim that the district judge committed reversible error in sentencing appellant more harshly because he had announced an intention to appeal. We see no merit in this contention.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the time of sentencing the record shows appellant had refused to make a statement to the probation officer, that he had a prior conviction and that he had spent a large part of his adult life in prison. Counsel for appellant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u201cMr. Ely: Well, certainly in order to \u2014 we have already discussed whether or not an intention to appeal is to be a factor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXq\">and the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">\u201cThe Court: Oh, that\u2019s not a factor at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The record does not show that there was any abuse of discretion on the part of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-17\">. \u201cSTATEMENT OF RIGHTS</p>\n<p id=\"b198-18\">\u201cBefore we ask you any questions, it is my duty to advise you of your rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-16\">\u201cYou have the right to remain silent. \u201cAnything you say can be used against you in court, or other proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-19\">\u201cYou have the right to consult an attorney before making any statement or answering any question, and you may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>have him present with you during questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u201cYou may have an attorney appointed by the U.

After the judge stated that appellant\u2019s conversation with Mr. Jackson was an admission or confession and would not be admissible under <em>Miranda, </em>counsel for appellant and counsel for the government had the following colloquy:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-21\">\u201cMR. ELY: Excuse me, your Honor, just for Mr. Jackson\u2019s guidance as much as anything when he does take the stand, there are several other matters in there that perhaps we ought to clear up. What I am particularly concerned about, amongst other things, is the fact that according to Mr. Jackson, he changed his story during the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I ruled that neither can come in.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-23\">\u201cMR.

At trial appellant related the following story concerning his trip to Mexico: He had been working as a musician in Los Angeles when he met a man named Jupiter who claimed to be a free lance agent. He met Jupiter on two or three occasions subsequent to their first meeting. On March 29 they again met by chance in Los Angeles and Jupiter asked if appellant had ever been to Tijuana. Appellant replied that he had not, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Jupiter asked if he would like to go. Appellant agreed to go, and the two men proceeded to drive down in appellant\u2019s car, with Jupiter doing the driving. Appellant had only taken $51 of his own money. When they got to Tijuana Jupiter asked appellant if he knew anything about dog racing. Jupiter also asked appellant if he would like to have a good time. Appellant replied, \u201cI would like that, that\u2019s what I come down here for.\u201d Jupiter then gave appellant some money. Appellant gave the following testimony concerning subsequent events in Mexico:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\u201cHe started counting out money in the seat. At this particular time I took the steering wheel over. He counted the money. He said, \u2018Help yourself.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\u201cI reached over and grabbed two twenties and said, \u2018Thanks a lot.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">\u201cHe said, \u2018All the money is yours.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">\u201cQ Did he tell you why?</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">\u201cA At no time did he mention anything about \u2014 he told me he understood about me being locked up, to have myself a ball and that all the money was mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">\u201cQ How much money did he give you?</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">\u201cA He gave me a thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">\u201cQ What did you do with it?</p>\n<p id=\"b200-16\">\u201dA I told him, \u2018I never had this much money in my life. I can start having fun right now by buying me some clothes and things.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b200-17\">\u201cI went down and bought gifts and some shoes, and had about a hundred and twenty-some dollars and stuck inside shirt pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-18\">\u201cQ About how much did you spend on clothes?</p>\n<p id=\"b200-19\">\u201cA Approximately $300, I would say.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-20\">\u201cQ You put a hundred and twenty-five dollars in your shirt.
