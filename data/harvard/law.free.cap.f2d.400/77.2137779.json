Once on the premises, according to Officer Crosswell\u2019s testimony, he detected a strong odor of alcohol which he traced to a barn located about one hundred yards from Mabe\u2019s residence. Upon entering the barn, he discovered a 250 gallon \u201csubmarine still\u201d containing approximately 200 gallons of mash, 23 one-gallon unstamped glass jugs containing distilled spirits and a number of sixty-pound Dixie Crystal Sugar bale wrappers. Immediately in front of the barn and in plain view stood six fifty-gallon barrels of water on a tobacco sled. Officer Crosswell further testified that empty sugar bale wrappers and glass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>jugs smelling of alcohol, identical to those seen at the still, were found in other buildings on Mabe\u2019s farm.</p>\n<p id=\"A9L5\">In his defense, Mabe insists that he had always thought that the barn, not clearly visible from his house, was in fact located on his neighbor\u2019s property. Appellant\u2019s lessor, however, testified that he personally pointed out the boundaries of the rented property.</p>\n<p id=\"A5B\">Admittedly the odor of distilled spirits, indicating the presence of a still, was discernible as one approached the barn. Appellant\u2019s contention is that, thinking the barn belonged to his neighbor, he had never used it for any purpose and there was no evidence that he was ever near it. One of his own witnesses testified, to the contrary, that a path ran from Mabe\u2019s house \u201cright down beside and around the barn\u201d to a vegetable garden appellant maintained on a plot'adjacent to the barn.</p>\n<p id=\"AsC\">At oral argument, both parties agreed that the large quantities of ingredients used in operating the still were most likely delivered by motor vehicle. Relying on this, appellant argued that the barn, situated on the border of the farm, , ,, . was more easily accessible through the adjoining property by means of a road leading from a main highway. The inference to be drawn from this, according to appellant, is that the still was probably operated by unknown third parties who surreptitiously entered his farm.</p>\n<p id=\"A7bN\">The record indicates, however, that only the path on his own farm actually ran to the barn. The road on the neighboring property terminated some 150 yards from the still, and the area between the barn and the road, which would, under Mabe\u2019s theory, have to be covered by foot, was heavily wooded. Significantly, tractor tracks were detected by Officer Crosswell on the path around the barn and a tractor was observed near appellant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"AR1\">, , , , ,, Smce Mabe was not at home the day Officer Crosswell discovered the still, the officer returned the following day to make an arrest. As he approached the house, Mabe ran from the back door, and when apprehended denied that he was Fred McKinley Mabe. In fact, not until after he had been placed under arrest did he reveal his true identity.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah5\">Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the Government as we must, Moore v. united States, 271 F.2d 564, 56g (4 Cir 1959). Reynolds v. United states, 289 K2d 698 (10 cir. 1961); we find abundant evidence, both direct and circumstantial, to support the trial court\u2019s judgment,</p>\n<p id=\"AKk\">Affirmed</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-16\">. More specifically, the indictment charged Mabe with (1) carrying on the business of distilling spiritous liquors without giving the required bond, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5173 and 5601(a) (4); (2) producing distilled spirits at a place not designated according to law, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5222 and 5601(a) (7); (3) distilling spirits without displaying a proper sign, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5180(a) and 5681(a); and (4) possessing distilled spirits in containers not bearing the required stamps evidencing tax payments, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5205(a) (2) and 5604(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-26\">Defendant was found guilty on counts one, two and four, and received a three-year prison sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
