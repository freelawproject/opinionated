In both cases, the executors of the decedents\u2019 estates (hereinafter \u201ctaxpayers,\u201d \u201cHugh,\u201d or \u201cEdna\u201d) resisted a deficiency determination made by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cI.R.S.\u201d) on the basis of the disallowance of certain charitable deductions claimed under \u00a7 2055 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2055).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In No. 16940 the taxpayer (Hugh) appeals from a decision for the Commissioner; in No. 17133 the Commissioner appeals from a decision for the taxpayer (Edna). Since these two appeals involve interpretation of the same section of the Tax Code, \u00a7 2055, and since they arise from the same underlying facts, they have been consolidated for argument and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-17\">Stipulated facts were filed in both cases and can be summarized for purposes of these appeals as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b456-18\">Edna Miller, wife of Hugh Miller, died February 10, I960.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She was survived by Hugh and a son, Allen. In her will, paragraph Seventh (a), she provided that her residuary estate be held in trust; that the trust corpus be divided into two shares, one equal to forty percent. thereof, the other sixty percent.; that the net income of the 40% share was to go to Hugh for his life; and that Hugh had the power to appoint by will the 40% share \u201cto or in favor of his estate * * * or to any person or persons.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If Hugh died without exercising this power of appointment, the income from the 40% share went to her son, Allen, for life, with the principal at his death going to \u201cThe Edna Allen Miller Foundation,\u201d a charitable corporation recognized by the I.R.S. as a qualified, exempt organization.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>On December 6, 1960, Hugh executed an affidavit complying with the directions of \u00a7 2055(b) (2) (C) of the Code,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in which he averred that he was 84 years old at Edna\u2019s death and that he declared his intent to exercise in his will the power of appointment given in Edna\u2019s will by appointing the income of the 40% share to their son, Allen, for life, with the principal (remainder) to the Edna Allen Miller Foundation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This affidavit was filed as part of Edna\u2019s Federal Estate Tax Return. On August 1, 1962, Hugh died, exercising the power of appointment in his will in the manner specified in his earlier affidavit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aly-dedup-0\">Edna\u2019s estate tax return claimed a marital deduction of $443,567.05<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> under \u00a7 2056 (the value of the corpus of the \u201cforty per cent share\u201d trust, plus per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>sonal effects left to Hugh valued at less than $2000.) and a charitable deduction of $229,761.00 under \u00a7 2055, the value of the remainder interest in the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Hugh\u2019s estate tax return included in his gross estate the trust assets (valued at $445,883.49) over which he had a general testamentary power of appointment as defined in \u00a7 2041, and claimed a charitable deduction of $246,627.08 under \u00a7 2055 for the value of the remainder interest Hugh appointed to the charitable foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The Tax Court held that Edna\u2019s estate was entitled to both the marital deduction under \u00a7 2056 and the charitable deduction under \u00a7 2055(b) (2). The Commissioner has appealed that decision (No. 17133). The Tax Court then held that Hugh\u2019s estate must include, pursuant to \u00a7 2041, the assets received from Edna over which he had a general testamentary power of appointment, but that he was not entitled under \u00a7 2055(b) (1) to any deduction for the remainder appointed to charity. The taxpayers have appealed that decision (No. 16940).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The decisions of the Tax Court attempted to decide the proper application of \u00a7 2055(b) (2) as related to the taxation of these two estates and as the subsection might affect the proper application of the other subsections of \u00a7 2055, and of \u00a7\u00a7 2056 and 2041. Neither counsel for the parties nor the courts have been able to discover a prior decision dealing with \u00a7 2055(b) (2) or any other decisions sufficiently related to the problem posed to provide authoritative guidance. The two opinions of the Tax Court were thorough, carefully prepared, and attempted to track the difficult path between application of the Tax Code as literally written and application according to Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Briefly summarized, in Edna\u2019s estate (48 T.C. 251) the Tax Court found no justification in the Tax Code or Congressional comments for ignoring the literal failure of \u00a7 2055(b) (2) to have any stated effect on \u00a7 2056 and, consequently, saw no basis for denying a full marital deduction for the value of the trust corpus, as well as an additional charitable deduction for the value of the remainder. In Hugh\u2019s estate, however (48 T.C. 265), they rejected a \u201cliteral\u201d argument of the taxpayer on the grounds that the \u201cliteral\u201d wording of \u00a7 2055(b) showed that a taxpayer\u2019s choice to proceed under the \u201cspecial rule\u201d of subsection 2055(b) (2) precluded any application of the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of subsection 2055(b) (1). Consequently, Hugh\u2019s claimed deduction under \u00a7 2055 (b) (1) would be denied despite the necessary inclusion of the trust corpus in his gross estate under \u00a7 2041.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">For the reasons stated below, we think that the courts have no choice in this case other than to apply subsection 2055 (b) (2) literally as it is worded. As the Tax Court so aptly stated,- \u201cwe are not aware of any authority which would give us the power to rewrite by judicial fiat an unambiguous statute in order to clear up ambiguities in its legislative history,\u201d 48 T.C. at 260. Aside from following the plain wording of the 1956 amendments to \u00a7 2055(b), no other principle of statutory construction can properly be employed in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We lack sufficiently reliable information of legislative intent, in addition to the printed statute, to use even the most common of interpretative aids. For instance, the possibly attractive principle that a literal interpretation should not be followed if it leads to absurd results,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> cannot be used to support the Government\u2019s contentions in this case, when there is no information from any source showing the purpose of subsection 2055(b) (2), showing its intended interrelationship with the rest of the estate tax sections or showing that it can be analyzed for any of the familiar touch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>stones of interpretation such as evil remedied, object sought, etc. The line of cases cited by the Commission descending from Charles Ilf eld Co. v. Hernandez, 292 U.S. 62, 68, 54 S.Ct. 596, 78 L.Ed. 1127 (1934), and allegedly supporting the rule of tax interpretation that double deductions are not permitted absent express statutory mandate, is merely a variation on the \u201cavoid absurd results\u201d rule. In addition, this tax \u201crule\u201d has rarely been applied outside the peculiar income tax<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> context of consolidated corporate income tax reporting and attempted double deductions of business losses, and it cannot be regarded as a legitimate canon of estate tax interpretation<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to assist the court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">Applying such a literal interpretation to this case, we agree with the Tax Court in Edna\u2019s estate that so many problems are left unsolved and so many solutions are possible for remedying what might be considered the absurd result of the multiple deductions resulting from a literal reading of \u00a7 2055(b) (2) that no court should attempt to write what Congress unfortunately omitted<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or invent the perhap more rational system that the Commissioner asks the court to supply.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And it is equally evident that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the cryptic legislative report accompanying passage of the 1956 amendments<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> raises even more possible \u201csolutions\u201d to the \u201cabsurd result\u201d of literally applying the badly drafted subsection.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For instance, the single example in the Senate Report of the 80-year-old spouse with a short life expectancy, plus the known favored position of charities throughout our Tax Code, may indicate that Congress fully intended double charitable deductions in its 1956 amendment. A great many other practical and legislatively justifiable tax results come to mind, and the statutory patterns for achieving them. This or any other court should consequently hesitate to select the single appropriate statutory scheme, particularly when such factors as the age requirement suggest that the \u201cloophole\u201d left open may be used by a very few taxpayers before Congress acts to close it if such is the legislative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">We disagree, however, with the Tax Court in Hugh\u2019s estate that the literal reading of the statute prevents any deduction under subsection 2055(b) (1). Hugh\u2019s deduction fell within the plain language as a deductible \u201cbequest\u201d and, as the Tax Court recognized, the trust corpus was fully taxable under \u00a7 2041. ,In,order to reach a different result, the Tax Court in effect ignored the fact that \u00a7 2055(b) (1) and (b) (2) refer to deductions for two separate decedents,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and then relied on the phrases \u201cgeneral rule,\u201d \u201cspecial rule,\u201d and \u201cfor purposes of this section\u201d to impute a Congressional intent to deny any double charitable deduction. While such a statutory interpretation may be said to avoid a possibly \u201cabsurd result,\u201d we can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>find no greater support for so deviating from the plain meaning of the statute than was present in Edna\u2019s estate and no greater assurance either that Congress did not intend a double deduction or that a double deduction was intended but only in a few specific instances.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The two decedent\u2019s estates referred to in \u00a7 2055(b) have no connection except via the bookkeeping provisions of requirement (D), \u00a7 6503(e),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the fact that the testamentary power of appointment must go to a \u201cspouse.\u201d One provides for a \u201cbequest,\u201d the other a \u201ctransfer\u201d [as the terms are also used in \u00a7 2055(a)]. The statute contains no suggestion that the tax assessments on the spouses\u2019 estates are to be connected or combined in any way in order to assess the tax consequences for the Miller family. In addition, the case cited by the Tax Court as authority for its crucial statuory construction conclusion applied to the Miller family\u2019s attempted use of subsection 2055(b), that a \u201cspecial\u201d rule used by the family precludes use of a \u201cgeneral\u201d rule, deals with a different type of statutory pattern. Marian Essen-field, 37 T.C. 117, 122-123 (1961), aff\u2019d 311 F.2d 208 (2nd Cir. 1962), is an example of the statutory pattern of a specific versus a general rule,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and appears inapposite in this case, where both subsections of 2055(b) are quite specific, apparently dealing with narrow situations outside the \u201cgeneral\u201d tax rule of subsection 2055(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">We cannot agree with the Tax Court that such draftsmanship shows an intent to have preclusive interplay between 2055(b) (1) and (b) (2) whenever a given husband and wife have the requisite powers of appointment, and to the contrary think that the phrase \u201cfor purposes of this section\u201d (referring to \u00a7 2055, see 48 T.C. at 270), appearing in both 2055(b) (1) and (b) (2), if anything, indicates a different statutory pattern, namely that (b) (2) is in addition to (b) (1)- \u2014 an item of special legislation for certain octogenarians. If Congress so clearly had the intent imputed by the Tax Court, they would have used the phrase \u201cfor purposes of this subsection\u201d (referring to \u201cpowers of appointment\u201d) as they did in the last sentence of subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Since we find Congressional guidance certainly no greater with respect to Hugh\u2019s claimed deduction than Edna\u2019s, we think the decision in Hugh\u2019s estate should be reversed. The Commissioner\u2019s .complaint of \u201ctriple deduction\u201d should be addressed to Congress, the only body that can adequately resolve the complex questions raised by the Miller family and currently unanswered in the \u201cspecial legislation\u201d of \u00a7 2055(b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Accordingly, the decision appealed from in No. 17133 (Estate of Edna Allen Miller, 48 T.C. 251) will be affirmed; the decision appealed from in No. 16940 (Estate of Hugh Gordon Miller, 48 T.C. 265) will be reversed, with instructions to enter a decision for the petitioners.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-12\">.

United States, 337 F.2d 637, 640, 167 Ct.Cl. 725 (1964), where the principle was labeled a \u201cfundamental principle of income tax\u201d and applied in the context of consolidated corporate returns and the problem of pre-issue interest deductions in a railroad reorganization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b459-6\">. The \u201crule against double deductions\u201d seems particularly unuseful in the present case since, with respect to one \u201cdoubling,\u201d we are presented with separate taxpayers seeking deductions and since we observe that Congress has acted explicitly on one occasion to prevent double deductions arising in an estate tax context. See \u00a7 642(g) with reference to \u00a7\u00a7 2053 and 2054. In addition, using broad equitable consideration, such as preventing multiple deductions, to solve problems raised by a tax statute is a dangerous course, e. g., Budd Company v. United States, 252 F.2d 456,458 (3rd Cir. 1957). This applies to the Commissioner\u2019s observation that his position of a marital deduction for Edna and a charitable deduction for Hugh will produce a lower total tax bill than that resulting from the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion. This ironic wrinkle in this case may simply result from the fact that a wealthier husband survived his wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\">. For instance, the Commissioner argues that Congress could only have intended (1) a special or limited power of appointment, making the trust nondeductible under \u00a7 2056 (additional situations are easily imaginable, however, which even the Commissioner\u2019s \u201cremedy\u201d does not repair, such as a i)ower of appointment to a class excluding the decedent and his estate, but including the creditors of his estate, and thus falling within \u00a7 2041 but outside \u00a7 2056(b) (5)); (2) a second implied condition that a deduction could result only when one could not be obtained by disclaiming a power of appointment and securing the deduction because a gift over in default gave the remainder to a charity [under \u00a7 2055(a)] (this is just one aspect, however, of the general failure to deal with the \u201ctax art\u201d concept of disclaimer, see note 14 below, and other possible trust terms such as a power of invasion, which normally prevents a charitable deduction [see Treas.Regs. \u00a7 20.-2055-2 (b) (1958)], are unmentioned in the statute); and (3) a third implied condition for \u00a7 2055(b) (2), namely, that it applies when a marital deduction trust exceeds the 50% limitation of \u00a7 2056(c), and \u00a7 2055(b) (2) could then properly retrieve any \u201cwasted\u201d portion of the trust up to the value of the remainder (this argument is a good example of the myriad acceptable legislative schemes that might be proper, depending upon factors that Congress apparently did not consider in the 1956 amendments).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b459-14\">. The failure to link the affidavit of requirement (C) \u2014 regardless of the affidavit\u2019s wording \u2014 to the estate tax concept of \u201cdisclaimer\u201d may be the most conspicuous omission. Such an affidavit as Hugh signed is not a \u201cdisclaimer\u201d as that word is used rather uniformly in \u00a7\u00a7 2055(a), 2056(d), 2041(a) (2). See, e. g., Seubert v. Shaughnessy, 233 F.2d 134 (2nd Cir. 1956). The I.R.S. contended that the affidavit made the trust a terminable interest under \u00a7 2056(b) \u2014 see 48 T.C. at 261-262 \u2014 but this argument was correctly rejected, particularly in light of the settled concept of disclaimers \u2014 see Treas. Regs. \u00a7\u00a720.2041-3(d) (6); 20.2055-2(c); 20.2056(d)-1(a) \u2014 and the principle that events at the time of decedent\u2019s death control.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b460-4\">.

This deduction also is allowed if an interest passes to such an organization by reason of a disclaimer made before the date prescribed for the filing of the estate-tax return. In some instances, however, it is not feasible for a legatee to allow a bequest to pass to charity by disclaiming it. For example, in the case of a bequest in trust where the income is payable to the surviving spouse of the decedent for life and the remainder to whomever the surviving spouse may appoint, the holder of the power of appointment could allow the property to pass to charity by disclaiming the power only if a charitable organization was named as the taker in default.

One experienced commentator has described \u00a7 2055(b) (2) as a \u201ccrassly conceived and crudely drawn statute [which] leaves many unsettled questions for the few taxpayers to whom it may apply.\u201d 4 Rabkin and Johnson, Federal Income, Gift and Estate Taxation, \u00a7 59.08(10) (1968). The commentators also seem to suspect strongly that the reason for inadequacies is that the section was a \u201cprivate relief measure\u201d and that, particularly in view of its retroactive character, it must be regarded as \u201cspecial legislation.\u201d 4 Rabkin and Johnson, ibid; 4 Mertens, Law of Federal Gift and Estate Taxation, \u00a7 28.06, n. 17 (1959); Rudnick and Gray, Bounty Twice Blessed: Tax Consequences of Gifts of Property to or in Trust for Charity, 16 Tax L.Rev. 273, 304, n. 120 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b460-13\">. While consideration of a combined husband-wife tax bill may play a key role in estate planning, Treasury analysis of proposed estate tax legislation, or a pedagogical approach to the Tax Code, this court is not aware of such an \u201cequitable\u201d analysis being a proper canon of construction of estate tax provisions, particularly in light of the fact that complete \u201cconsolidation\u201d does not occur throughout the estate and gift tax sections and that Congress explicitly calls for such consideration when necessary. See, e. g., \u00a7 2040.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\">. The combinations of deductions possible as \u00a7 2055(b) (1) and (b) (2) are or are not interrelated may have to vary with the proper solution of \u00a7 2055 (b)\u2019s consequences under other estate tax sections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6503(e) was amended at the same time as \u00a7 2055(b) (2) to suspend the running of the statute of limitations on the first dying spouse\u2019s estate until 30 days after the filing of the surviving spouse\u2019s estate tax return.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\">. <em>Marian Mssenfield </em>dealt with \u00a7 22(b) (1) of the 1939 Code. As the Second Circuit observed, 311 IT.2d at 209-210, even if they assumed that the contested payments were \u201cinsurance\u201d payments, they fell under two subsections at once, and the rule was that in such instances the more \u201cparticular\u201d one would control over the \u201cgeneral.\u201d The cases cited by the Commissioner in his brief similarly involve \u201cspecific\u201d vs. \u201cgeneral\u201d in resolving problems rather unlike that posed by the present case, e. g., Central Commercial Company v. C. I. R., 337 F.2d 387, 389 (7th Cir. 1964), a problem of mineral definition in a depletion case, and show that the normal context for using this rule is in resolving issues that ultimately turn on definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
