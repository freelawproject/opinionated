The record supports this finding. This being so, the District Court correctly applied the well-settled rule that a voluntary plea of guilty is an admission of all elements of the offense charged and is a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects in the prior proceeding. Busby v. Holman, 5 Cir. 1966, 356 F.2d 75; Cooper v. Holman, 5 Cir. 1966, 356 F.2d 82; Phillips v. United States, 5 Cir. 1963, 318 F.2d 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-23\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
