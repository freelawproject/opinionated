Zavatt, 2 Cir. 1961, 289 F.2d 46, the Second Circuit considered the same procedural issues that we face here. In that case Bernard and Olga Damsky, husband and wife, had been assessed for non-payment of income taxes during a period of several years. In addition, tax liens had been filed on property owned by Olga for all except three of the years in question. Following the Damsky\u2019s timely demand for a jury trial and the government\u2019s motion to strike such demand, the Honorable Joseph C. Zavatt, District Judge, issued a written opinion and order granting the government\u2019s motion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>full. United States v. Damsky, E.D. N.Y. 1960, 187 F.Supp. 404. The Dam-skys sought a writ of mandamus directing Judge Zavatt to vacate that order. In an opinion laden with thorough and exegetie historical credentials, Judge Friendly granted the writ with respect to these claims asserted solely against Bernard Damsky (only the years for which no tax liens had been filed). Judge Clark dissented as to this part of the opinion but concurred in the remainder of the majority opinion, in which the Court refused to issue the writ with respect to the claims arising from foreclosure of the tax lien on Olga\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Our concern at bar is with that part of the majority opinion in <em>Damsky </em>which denied the taxpayers\u2019 right to a jury trial in the years of foreclosure. We quote Judge Friendly\u2019s foundational analysis in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">\u201cAt the opposite extreme from the claims against Bernard just considered lies so much of the complaint as seeks to establish the validity of the tax liens against Ollie\u2019s real properties and the sale of the properties to satisfy them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\u201cMr. Justice Story pointed out in Parsons v. Bedford, 1830, [28 U.S. 433] 3 Pet. 433, 446-447, 7 L.Ed. 732, that in view of the use of the phrase \u2018all cases in law and equity\u2019 in Article III of the Constitution and the historic practice \u2018that courts of equity use the trial by jury only in extraordinary cases, to inform the conscience of the court,\u2019 the natural conclusion from the reference to suits at common law in the Seventh Amendment is \u2018that this distinction was present to the minds of the framers of the amendment\u2019 and that they did not intend the amendment to apply to proceedings \u2018where equitable rights alone were recognized, and equitable remedies were administered.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201cForeclosure of the mortgagor\u2019s equity of redemption was an established head of equity jurisdiction well before 1791, How v. Vigures, 1 Rep. Ch. 32, 21 E.R. 499 (1623); Emanuel College v. Evans, 1 Rep.Ch. 18, 21 E. R. 494 (1625); and this necessarily embraced the determination of the amount and validity of the mortgage debt. 1 Glenn, Mortgages (1943), 399-400. The more modern method of foreclosure through decree of sale, provided for United States tax liens by I.R.C. \u00a7 7403, is sufficiently akin to the historic equity practice to preclude successful contention for a right to jury trial with respect to the ascertainment of the amount of the tax lien as against taxpayer\u2019s property and enforcement of the lien by sale. See 5 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1951), pp. 81, 109. United States v. Malakie, D.C.E.D.N.Y. 1960, 188 F. Supp. 592.\u201d 289 F.2d at 52-53.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">In an equally scholarly analysis Judge Friendly upheld the right of the District Court to render a judgment against Olga personally for any deficiency which might have remained unsatisfied after judicial sale of the mortgaged premises. 289 F.2d at 54-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">The District Court in the case at bar followed other district courts in denying a jury trial primarily on the basis' of the <em>Damsky </em>decision. See United States v. Warren, W.D.N.C.1964, 235 F.Supp. 638 (which embellishes <em>Damsky </em>by interpreting the language of Section 7403(c) as a rejection of jury trials in tax foreclosures) ; United States v. Rentz, N.D. Iowa 1962, 213 F.Supp. 521. In accord, United States v. Malakie, E.D.N.Y.1960, 188 F.Supp. 592. See also Note, 46 Minn.L.Rev. 643 (1962) (an extensive and favorable review of the <em>Damsky </em>decision) ; Note, 110 U.Pa.L.Rev. 133 (1961) (a shorter review, also favorable) ; 5 Moore, Federal Practice [f 38.31 [1] at 34-35, and U 38.38 [4] at 45, (1967 Supp.) (which briefly summarizes the <em>Damsky </em>decision without evaluative comment); 2B Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 872 at 17, (Wright ed., 1967 Supp.) (a similar summary of the <em>Damsky </em>decision) ; James, Civil Procedure \u00a7 8.11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>at 378 n. 4 (1965, also published in 1963 at 72 Yale L.J. 655, 691 n. 203) (which quotes Judge Clark\u2019s dissent objecting to the partial granting of a jury trial in <em>Damsky </em>and refers to it as \u201ca wise and temperate judicial appraisal of the problem\u201d). We likewise agree that the historicity of foreclosure as a ward of equity is documented accurately in Judge Friendly\u2019s scholarly opinion. And although the classification of pre-1791 standards does not capture our unqualified enthusiasm, we follow <em>Damsky </em>until the Supreme Court frees us from its validated historical bondage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">II. <em>Gefen\u2019s Responsibility to Pay Taxes for Georgia Ship</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The following facts are undisputed. Gefen was a partner holding a 50% interest in MacDonnell Boats when on August 18,1952, a contract was executed with the Navy Department\u2019s Bureau of Ships for MacDonnell to build five motor gun boats. Thereafter, MacDonnell Boats was incorporated as Georgia Shipbuilding Corporation, with Gefen and his wife owning 50% of the capital stock. Gefen served as president of Georgia Ship and a member of its Board of Directors from the date of its incorporation until April 30, 1955, when he resigned and sold his entire interest in the corporation. During his tenure as president Gefen\u2019s signature was required on all checks drawn on the corporation\u2019s bank account. From July 1, 1954, until April 30, 1955, the period of time involved here, Georgia Ship accrued on its books and carried as a liability an accrued salary payable to Gefen of $2,000 per month. His accrual salary rate was the highest of any employee or officer of Georgia Ship, but he never received actual payment of any salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">As early as July, 1954, Gefen participated in negotiations with the Navy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>rescue Georgia Ship from financial difficulties. On September 23, 1954, these negotiations resulted in an amendment to the 1952 contract under which the Navy would make an advance payment of $172,-000 to the corporation. The following items from the corporation\u2019s balance sheets clearly show the immediate outflow of funds to creditors after receipt of the $172,000 payment:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Current Assets \u2014 Cash Current Liabilities \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"A0_\">Accounts Payable Accrued Payroll Taxes</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\"><em>SI Aug. 195Ip </em>$ 4,538.91</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">130,173.49 21,701.59</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\"><em>30 Sept. 195 </em>$45,678.54</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">26,451.47</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">20,919.53</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">On October 30, 1954, Gefen, as president of Georgia Ship, signed Form 941, Employer\u2019s Quarterly Federal Tax Return, in which he declared liability for the following tax payments: (1) $10,-508.54, representing federal income taxes of the employees which the corporation had withheld from their wages and salaries during the third quarter of 1954; and (2) $5,052.98, representing the corporation\u2019s liability under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (F.I.C.A.). This return, however was received by the office of the District Director of Internal Revenue without payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">On November 9, 1954, the Navy again amended its contract with Georgia Ship and agreed to loan the company an additional sum of $50,000. Unlike the advancement of $172,000 in September, the loan agreement expressly provided for the use of the funds, stating in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">\u201cThese funds shall not be used to pay any part of the Contractor\u2019s delinquent withholding taxes without prior written approval of the Administering Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">The loan agreement also required a Navy Special Account, and on November 10, 1954, such account was opened with Georgia Ship\u2019s bank in Jacksonville, with Gefen as the sole company officer authorized to make withdrawals on that account. On December 10, 1954, and on January 14, 1955, the company used funds presumably from that account to pay $17,431.99 and $8,971.66 for labor, material, and other expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">On January 24, 1955, Gefen sent a \u201cRequest for Amendment Without Consideration\u201d to the Navy seeking further advance payments. The request read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-16\">\u201cThe contractor is being pressed for payment by the local Director of Internal Revenue and the Georgia Employment Security Agency for withholding taxes, social security taxes, * * * in the amount of $43,508.07. Of this amount $18,728.15 represents taxes from the third quarter, 1954, the bal-lance is for the fourth quarter, 1954.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6p\">Seven days later, on January 31, 1955, Gefen signed Form 941 for the fourth quarter of 1954, declaring liability for that quarter in the sum of $19,844.62. The return was again received in the office of the District Director without payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-18\">Finally, on April 30,1955, Gefen signed Form 941 for the first quarter of 1955, declaring liability for that quarter in the sum of $12,165.02. The return was received in the office of the District Director without payment. It was upon the basis of these three quarters that the government sought and the District Court granted the 100% penalty tax against Gefen.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-19\">Gefen\u2019s defense to the penalty tax posits two factual challenges to the District Court\u2019s, findings. First, he asserts his initial ignorance of the above failure to pay taxes. Second, he claims that by the time he learned of the deficiencies, the company was financially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>unable to pay the taxes. In certain areas these two defenses are mutually inconsistent. For example, Gefen claims that on October 30, 1954, he signed a check for payment of taxes at the same time that he signed Form 941. According to Gefen, he was totally unaware that the tax had not been paid. However, at the conclusion of the last two periods in question, at which times Gefen admits knowledge of the tax deficiency but contends that the company was unable to pay (indeed he paints a picture of substantial but frustrated efforts on his part to raise money for paying the taxes), he also insists that he signed checks for payment of taxes at the same time that he signed Form 941.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Gefen, in his reconstructed image of his position as president of Georgia Ship, seeks the shelter of irresponsibility and naivete; however, the facts do not provide the foundation for such shelter. The evidence is without challenge! that there were economic distress signals all around Gefen. Gefen admittedly participated in conferences with the Navy as early as July, 1954, concerning Georgia Ship\u2019s need for advance payments. He\u00a1 admittedly requested additional funds on January 24, 1955, and expressly stated as a justfieation the company\u2019s failure to pay withholding taxes (which failure had also been mentioned in the November 9 amendment to the Navy contract). Moreover, he admittedly participated in conferences with Jack Durant from the Jacksonville office of the I. R. S. concerning the failure to pay such taxes. Durant testified that their first conference occurred in the latter part of November, 1954, and although Gefen recalled the meetings as beginning a couple of months later, his memory was extremely indefinite in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">In spite of the above indicia of financial awareness and responsibility, Gefen asserts that he was no more than a passive figurehead who never looked at a company balance sheet (which kept a monthly record of \u201cAccounts Payable-Accrued Payroll Tax\u201d), who concentrated mainly on his other business interests, and who used his spacious office at Georgia Ship merely to read his personal mail. He claims that the only officer who exercised fiscal responsibility in the company was the Vice President and Treasurer, R. F. Cottrell. Cottrell did indeed seem to be the most active day-to-day executive in the company, but he owned no stock in Georgia Ship, he was not a member of the Board of Directors, and he could not sign checks on corporate accounts. Furthermore, Durant testified that Cottrell did not participate in conferences concerning Georgia Ship\u2019s tax liability until the latter part of April, 1955 (shortly preceding Gefen\u2019s termination of his relationship with the company). Cottrell may have been the cicerone for Georgia Ship, but he was certainly not its master.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-18\">The District Court\u2019s findings of fact expressly provided that Gefen was the chief executive officer of Georgia Ship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>until April 30, 1955, and that he was a person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over the tax liabilities here involved. We conclude that Gefen\u2019s status in the company hierarchy and his authority, both apparent -and actual, in relation to the specific tax liability in question leave little doubt as to the validity of those findings. See Datlof v. United States, E.D.Pa.1966, 252 F.Supp. 11, 32-33, which lists criteria that courts have found useful in determining whether a taxpayer was a person required to pay over such taxes. See also Kelly v. Lethert, 8 Cir. 1966, 362 F.2d 629, 634, where the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\">\u201cThe appellant, though a young man of 26, was a principal officer of the corporation from which the unpaid withholding taxes are due, and he was admittedly authorized to sign checks in the corporate name. His defense that he spent most of his time in selling, rather than in executive and administrative operations of J. D. Davis Company, causes a sympathetic response from the Court but is factually no defense for failing to fulfill the duties of a corporate office of vice-president and treasurer authorized to make disbursements of corporate funds in discharge of corporate liabilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">There is perhaps a bit more room for doubt concerning the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Gefen <em>willfully </em>failed to collect or truthfully account for and pay over the taxes in question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this regard the case at bar is similar to United States v. Leuschner, 9 Cir. 1964, 336 F.2d 246, wherein that Court affirmed a District Court\u2019s refusal to penalize the failure of Leuschner, a director and general manager of Yosemite Creek Company, for the company\u2019s failure to pay over withholding taxes. At trial Leuschner had testified that he had left signed checks and returns with the company comptroller, and the District Court had accepted such testimony as conclusive. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, stating both that, \u201cthe question is one of fact,\u201d and that the evidence would support a finding that, \u201cLeuschner was negligent, which is not wilfulness.\u201d 336 F.2d at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The taxpayer at bar strives to attain the benefits of the <em>Leuschner </em>division, but for two important reasons such benefits do not lie within his grasp. First, the Ninth Circuit was careful to note that the controlling issues were those of fact and that the thrust of its opinion was determined in advance by the findings of the District Court. The findings in the case at bar, unlike those in <em>Leusch-ner, </em>go against the taxpayer. Second, the Ninth Circuit expressly held that any knowledge of tax deficiencies would automatically remove from the taxpayer his veil of innocence. Thus, as to the second part of the assessment against Leuschner, that covering his failure to pay over the taxes after Yosemite Creek Company had closed down its business and had reformed under the name of Kadota Creek Company, the Court reversed the District Court\u2019s findings and assessed the penalty. We quote that section of the opinion in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">\u201cWe think, however, that in the case of taxes withheld by Kadota the result must be different. When Kadota took over the business, Leuschner knew that Anders, on whom he relied, had failed to see that such taxes were paid and had preferred other creditors. Yet he did absolutely nothing to see that this did not happen again. He was Anders\u2019 superior in the company. He had a duty to see that the taxes were paid. He knew that the withheld moneys were a trust fund for the United States, and were to be paid to it. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>knew that Anders, to whom he looked to carry out that duty, had not done it. He could no longer, in good faith, look to Anders to do his duty for him. His complete failure to do anything to see that Anders, or he himself, performed that duty, is, we think, as a matter of law, a \u2018voluntary, conscious and intentional\u2019 failure. The court\u2019s contrary finding is clearly erroneous.\u201d 336 F. 2d at 248.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The District Court in the case at bar specifically found that in September, 1954, Gefen had participated in the decision to use the advance payment of $172,-000 to pay other creditors. (Gefen\u2019s testimony is contrary with this finding, but MacDonnell\u2019s testimony is consistent with it.) We accept this finding as correct and, combining it with the other facts mentioned above, conclude that the District Court was warranted in assessing the tax penalty against Gefen. It was certainly within the Court\u2019s bounds of factfinding to have rejected Gefen\u2019s protestations that, as to tax liability, he was merely an impotent and non-cognitive cog in Georgia Ship. We need not condone a game of blind mans buff in avoidance of a statutory duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-9\">. \u00a7 6672.
