The Service refuted their claims and the testimony of their expert witnesses with a letter from the State Department stating in effect that on the basis of information available it was not considered likely that the petitioners would be subjected to political persecution if deported to Formosa, but that they might well be prosecuted for violation of the Armed Forces Criminal Code of the Republic of China. The Board of Immigration Appeals found on the record that the evidence \u201cdoes not sustain a finding of persecution within \u00a7 243(h), either upon the merits or as a matter of discretion.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The record sustains that holding. Kasravi v. INS, 400 F.2d 675 (9th Cir. July 23, 1968); Hosseinmardi v. INS, 391 F.2d 914 (9th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Other than the claim of persecution no showing of hardship was made to support a claim for discretionary relief under \u00a7 244(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
