We remanded for a statement why the District Court, having found appellant a fit subject to be released on bail pending appeal nevertheless set his bail in an amount which it appeared he could not meet. In response the trial judge has supplemented the record with a statement of his reasons for an appeal bond in the amount of $7,500. These reasons all relate to insuring appellant\u2019s presence when required.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-23\">In view of the inconsistency in the trial court\u2019s determination that pending his appeal appellant was bailable and the fixing of his bail bond in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>amount which he could not meet, see Hairston v. United States, 120 U.S.App. D.C. 31, 343 F.2d 313<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>, we have undertaken a <em>de novo </em>consideration of appellant\u2019s motion, see Hansford v. United States, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 320, 353 F.2d 858 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">We conclude that \u201cno one or more conditions of release will reasonably assure that [appellant] * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or to the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">We vacate the order of the district court setting $7,500 appeal bond and deny appellant\u2019s motion for release.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b797-27\"> See, also, order of this court filed April 12, 1968, in Rogers v.
