The Board, after a hearing as required by Section 9(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c),.directed the Regional Director to conduct a representation election among the Company\u2019s employees on or before March 7, 1968. Modern Plastics filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan asking that the election be enjoined because the Board had not, prior to its election hearing, conducted an investigation as required by Section 9(c) to determine if there was \u201c* * * reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation affecting commerce exist[ed] * * * \u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c). The District Court enjoined the Board from conducting the scheduled election and the Board has appealed. We reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand the case with directions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-16\">After almost twenty-four years of apparently harmonious labor relations with the Modern Plastics Employees\u2019 Committee, the labor problems of the Company began on June 16, 1964, when District 39, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO (hereinafter \u201cIAM\u201d), filed a representation petition with the National Labor Relations Board. A hearing on the petition was set for July 15, 1964; but, after a conference with counsel for the Company, the Regional Director notified all parties of his intention to dismiss the petition because an existing contract between Modern Plastics and the Employees\u2019 Committee would act as a bar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>any representation proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before the petition was dismissed, however, IAM filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging that the Company dominated the Employees\u2019 Committee in violation of Section 8(a) (1) and (2) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (2). Following established Board procedure, the Regional Director notified all parties that he would suspend action on the representation proceeding pending the outcome of the unfair labor practice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">A complaint was filed on the charge, and after the usual hearings the Board found that the Company had violated Section 8(a) (1) and (2) in its dealings with the Employees\u2019 Committee and ordered the Committee to be disestablished. On petition to review, we disagreed with the Board and set aside its order, finding that substantial evidence did not support the Board\u2019s determination that the Committee was company-dominated. Modern Plastics Corporation v. National Labor Relations Board, 379 F.2d 201 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Issuance of our mandate, however, did not resolve Modern Plastics\u2019 labor difficulties. On June 13, 1967, IAM requested that its representation petition filed in 1964 be reopened; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and shortly after the Board closed the unfair labor practice case on September 13, 1967, the Regional Director reactivated the representation petition and scheduled a hearing for October 3, 1967. The Company then filed a motion requesting a current showing of interest, in response to which IAM submitted approximately 145 authorization cards that allegedly had been recently signed by Modern Plastics employees. But when the Company offered a list of employees against which to check the cards, the Regional Director refused the list stating that he was administratively satisfied that IAM had made a sufficient current showing of interest. Finally, on October 24, 1967, a hearing was held on the representation petition. After the usual procedures, the Board issued a Decision and Direction of Election on February 6, 1968, directing that an election be held on or before March 7, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Before the date of the election the Company sought the instant injunction alleging several grounds for relief. The District Court found all the grounds without merit except one. Relief was granted because the Board had \u201c * * * failed to conduct the investigation required by Section 9(c) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159 (e), and Sections 101.17 and 101.18 of the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s Statements of Procedure, Series 8, as amended * * * \u201d. We agree with the District Court\u2019s disposition of the other grounds for relief, but hold that the Court should have also dismissed the complaint as to the alleged failure to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Before proceeding to the merits of the case, we must dispose of the Company\u2019s contention that this appeal is moot since the date of the scheduled election passed before the notice of appeal was filed. It is clear from the District Court\u2019s order that the Board was enjoined from conducting any election among the Company\u2019s employees unless it conducted a new representation investigation. If we dismissed this case as moot and the Board attempted to set a new date for election based on the findings of its previous hearings, it would stand the risk of being held in contempt of court; or, at the least, its efforts would be frustrated by the issuance of another injunction. Under the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>stances, the question of the election remains unresolved; therefore the merits of the case are before us and must be decided. Division 1287 of Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of Street, Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees v. State of Missouri, 374 U.S. 74, 78, 83 S.Ct. 1657, 10 L.Ed.2d 763 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">On the merits, both parties ask us to make slight variations on the established law concerning direct judicial review of Board actions. In Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d 210 (1958), the Supreme Court held that a federal district court had subject matter jurisdiction of a suit \u201c * * * to strike down an order of the Board * * * contrary to a specific prohibition in the Act.\u201d 358 U.S. at 188, 79 S.Ct. at 184. Modern Plastics asks us to extend \u201c* * the painstakingly delineated procedural boundaries of <em>Kyne </em>* * * \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to include cases where the Board fails to perform a mandatory requirement of the Act. Miami Newspaper Printing Pressmen\u2019s Union Local 46 v. McCulloch, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 243, 322 F.2d 993, 997 (1963); Cf. Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, etc. v. Association For Benefit of Non-Contract Employees, 380 U.S. 650, 85 S.Ct. 1192, 14 L.Ed.2d 133 (1965). Conversely, the Board argues that the Leedom v. Kyne procedure is available only to unions since an employer can almost invariably obtain review of the Board\u2019s action by refusing to bargain with the certified representative. But see Boire v. Greyhound Corporation, 376 U.S. 473, 84 S.Ct. 894, 11 L.Ed.2d 849 (1964).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find it unnecessary to reach either of these questions since it is clear to us that the pre-hear-ing investigation by the Board in this case satisfied the statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">A merely erroneous or arbitrary exertion of authority by the Board will not ordinarily justify injunctive intervention, Eastern Greyhound Lines v. Fusco, 323 F.2d 477 (6th Cir. 1963); American Metal Products Company v. Reynolds, 332 F.2d 434 (6th Cir. 1964); Uyeda v. Brooks, 365 F.2d 326 (6th Cir. 1966); but Leedom v. Kyne indicates that the District Court at least had jurisdiction to determine if the contested Board action was plainly beyond the bounds of the Act, or clearly in defiance of it. Cf. McCulloch v. Libby-Owens-Ford Glass. Co., 403 F.2d 916 (D.C.Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">In this case, the Board allegedly ignored that part of Section 9(c) that provides: \u201cWhenever a petition shall have been filed * * * the Board shall investigate such petition * * But the required investigation need only be sufficient to give a \u201c* * * reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation affecting commerce exists * * 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c). So the question immediately arises as to the limitations on the extent of the District Court\u2019s inquiry into the Board\u2019s investigation. It is doubtful that limitations on the review of a standard set so plainly within the discretion of the Board can ever be clearly delineated. Perhaps the plenary review sought here is even less appropriate since the only purpose of the investigation is to determine whether to hold a hearing where the issues of the existence of a question of representation will be further examined in an adversary type proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>statute requires an investigation, and in light of the language in the analogous case of Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, etc. v. Association For Benefit of Non-Contract Employees, 380 U.S. 650, 85 S. Ct. 1192, 14 L.Ed.2d 133 (1965), we will \" assume without deciding, that a complete failure to investigate would invalidate the Board\u2019s direction of election and that the District Court could inquire to some limited extent into the sufficiency of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">On our first assumption, we do not read the District Court\u2019s opinion as finding that the Board conducted absolutely no investigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If such a finding was made, it would be clearly erroneous; for this is not a case where the Regional Director was totally unfamiliar with the Company or its employee setup. Modern Plastics had been involved in Board litigation for several years. The Regional Director was familiar with the Company\u2019s collective bargaining agreement situation and also knew that in May, 1967, a petition signed by 171 of the Company\u2019s employees had been filed with the Board asking for an election to select a new bargaining representative. We cannot say that with the information available to him the Regional Director could not reasonably find that a question of representation existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The Board is not required to go through the formality of redetermining facts already within its knowledge. The nature and quality of evidence justifying a conclusion that there is reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists will vary from case to case and likewise so will the nature and quality of the investigation required. In the <em>Railway Clerks </em>case the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">\u201cAn investigation is \u2018essentially informal, not adversary\u2019; it is \u2018not required to take any particular form\u2019. * * * These principals are particularly apt here where Congress has simply told the Board to investigate and has left to it the task of selecting the methods and procedures which it should employ in each case.\u201d 380 U.S. at 662, 85 S.Ct. at 1198.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">The District Court found, however, that the Board\u2019s prehearing investigation must take the \u201cparticular form\u201d outlined in the Board\u2019s own Statement of Procedure. Sections 101.17 and 101.18, National Labor Relations Board\u2019s Statement of Procedure, Series 8, as amended (C.F.R., Title 29, Chapter 1, Part 101). The investigation in the instant case was held insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Act solely because the Regional Director\u2019s refusal to compare the authorization cards with the proffered employees list was contrary to the part of Section 101.18 that provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">\u201c* * * The evidence of representation submitted by the petitioning labor organization or by the person seeking decertification is ordinarily checked to determine the number or proportion of employees who have des<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ignated the petitioner, it being the Board\u2019s administrative experience that in the absence of special factors the conduct of the election serves no purpose under the statute unless the petitioner has been designated by at least 30 percent of the employees. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">That holding of the Court was erroneous, for we have recently held that a showing of interest is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to the Board\u2019s direction of an election. National Labor Relations Board v. Louisville Chair Co., Inc., 385 F.2d 922, 926-927 (6th Cir. 1967).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the statement of procedure is simply a guideline for Board personnel; it does not constitute formal rules or regulations that could appropriately serve as a standard binding the Board to a particular form of pre-hearing investigation in every case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">A determination of whether there is reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists is essentially a factual issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whatever might be the outer limits of the Board\u2019s discretion in making the investigation and determination of that issue, they were not reached in this case. The facts before the Regional Director at the time he ordered the October 3d hearing were not so plainly insubstantial that he could not reasonably conclude that a sufficient question of representation existed to justify further inquiry through the usual adversary hearing. Therefore, his action in setting a hearing date was not plainly beyond the bounds of the Act, nor clearly in defiance of its provisions. Hence, the District Court should have dismissed the complaint as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">We would feel remiss if we concluded this case without noting our concern at the apparent arbitrariness of the Regional Director\u2019s action. While we can appreciate the Board\u2019s desire not to be harassed by \u201cdilatory tactics in representation proceedings\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and its desire to have this question of district court jurisdiction finally determined, we are constrained to note that this entire controversy and the long delay of the election could probably have been avoided if the Regional Director had taken ten minutes to check the authorization cards against the Company\u2019s employee list. More important to us, the Board would not have burdened the already over burdened docket of this Court with yet another of its many cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\">. Under Board decisions a valid collective bargaining agreement acts as a bar to a representation petition. Leonard Wholesale Meats, Inc., 136 NLRB 1000 (1962). The Board found that the direction of election in this case was not barred, however, because the decision issued after the expiration date of the contract that was in existence at the time the representation petition was filed, citing United Fruit Company, 134 NLRB 286, n. 23 (1961) as authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-12\">. The petition had not been acted upon because of the pending unfair labor practice proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b65-7\">. Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 376 U.S. 473, 481, 84 S.Ct. 894, 899, 11 L.Ed.2d 849 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\">. In two other exceptional circumstances plenary district court review of Board orders has been upheld. But this is not a case where Board action has denied plaintiff a constitutional right, Fay v. Douds, 172 F.2d 720 (2d Cir. 1949); nor is it a case involving \u201cquestions particularly high in the scale of our national interest because of their international complexion * * McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras, 372 U.S. 10, 17, 83 S.Ct. 671, 675, 9 L.Ed.2d 547 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b65-18\">. In this case, the Company participated in the representation hearing and objected to the Board\u2019s failure to investigate the petition only after losing that contest. The only damage that a failure to investigate could have caused the Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>was the expense and inconvenience of participating in a needless hearing, but the direction of election shows that the hearing was not needless. Therefore, it might be suggested that by participating in the hearing the Company waived any defects in the Board\u2019s previous procedure that did not substantially affect any rights of the Company. But in view of the holding in Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, etc. v. Association For Benefit of Non-Contract Employees, 380 U.S. 650, 85 S. Ct. 1192, 14 L.Ed.2d 133 (1965), we will not decide whether the District Court is thus deprived of jurisdiction to determine the sufficiency of the investigation since we can decide this case on other grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\">. The Board erroneously cites <em>Louisville Chair, </em>for the proposition that a pre-hearing investigation is not required. That case was clearly limited to the holding that a showing of interest is not invariably required to justify the Board\u2019s direction of an election; but even that narrow holding precludes a determination that the failure to investigate a showing of interest invalidates a direction of election.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b67-8\">. The procedures involved in cases such as United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 409, 98 L. Ed. 681 (1954), and Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1957), cannot be profitably compared with the procedure involved in this case. In those cases the procedure provided by the agency was the only method for contesting the agency action. The Supreme Court held those procedures binding in order to avoid the due process issue. We have no questions of such great moment involved in this case, nor an agency procedure or action that is subject to no other method of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b67-15\">. Plenary district court review of the method of making such determinations must be carefully scrutinized in view of Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 376 U.S. 473, 84 S.Ct. 894, 11 L.Ed.2d 849 (1964), where the Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe <em>Kyne </em>exception is a narrow one, not to be extended to permit plenary district court review of Board orders in certification proceedings whenever it can be said that an erroneous assessment of the particular facts before the Board, has led it to a conclusion which does not comport with the law.\u201d 376 U.S. at 481, 84 S.Ct. at 899.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b67-17\">. See statement of Senator Robert A. Taft in Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 194, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d 210 (1958) (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b66-12\">. The Company goes so far as to suggest that the Board had not even investigated to determine the \u201ccommerce\u201d question or the appropriateness of the unit. It is patently unrealistic to contend that the Board would have carried on three years of unfair labor practice litigation without first determining that the Company came within the jurisdictional limitations or that the Company over that long period would have overlooked such a fundamental flaw in the Board\u2019s case. Furthermore, the Board could have hardly prosecuted the unfair labor practice charge without learning something of the Company\u2019s employee situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
