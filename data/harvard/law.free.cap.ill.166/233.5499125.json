The contract was drawn and executed in the office of J. R. Wickersham, a brother of D. L. Wickersham, and was in the handwriting of the former. The Wickershams and the attesting witness, Wright, testified that the contract was read over and explained to the defendant Willig and his wife, and then signed by the parties; but the Willigs testified that when the contract was read in the form in which it now appears they objected to its running longer than one year, and that J. R. Wickersham then said he would change it; that he came back and read it over \u201cfor one yea'r,\u201d and that they signed it with the understanding that it was to run only for one year. The evidence showed that after a year bad passed Willig declared that the time had expired and that he would not carry out the contract, and so stated to D. L. Wickersham. Afterward, in December, 1891, D. L. Wickersham sent to Willig by registered letter the following notice:</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\" pgmap=\"236\">\u201cGarl K Willig, Esq.: \u201cChicago, December 18, 1891.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\" pgmap=\"236\">\u201cDeae Sib\u2014Under your proposition under date May 28, 1890, I hereby notify you that I will take the property therein described on the terms mentioned in said proposition, and will arrange the details at any time when convenient to you.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\" pgmap=\"236\">Very truly yours, DB x,A]y[0IN]B Wickeesham. \u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\" pgmap=\"236\">No attention was paid' to this notice by Willig, and nothing further was done in the matter until March 31, 1893, when H. W. Helmer, on behalf of appellant, Crandall, made a tender to the Willigs of the first payment in the case, and of the notes and a tr\u00fast deed securing them, as provided for in the contract, and also of a warranty deed for the Willigs to sign,\u2014all of which was refused by them. While the contract recited the payment of the nominal consideration of one dollar by Wicker-sham, no consideration whs in fact paid.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-9\" pgmap=\"236(95) 237(54)\">The cause was referred to the master to take the proofs, and to report the same, with his conclusions, to the court. The master reported and recommended that the prayer of the complainant\u2019s bill be granted. The appellees filed their objections to the master\u2019s report, which were overruled by him, but which were afterwards allowed to stand as exceptions in the circuit court. The tenth exception was as follows: \u201cFor that the said master finds that the contract of May 28, 1890, is a valid contract and binding upon the parties, whereas he should find that the contract in question is without consideration, uncertain and vague, and not such a contract as a court of equity will enforce.\u201d The court struck out all the exceptions except the tenth, which was sustained, and the bill was dismissed for want of equity. The appellant appealed to this court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-5\" pgmap=\"237\">Smith, Helmer, Moulton &amp; Price, for appellant:</attorneys><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-6\" pgmap=\"237\">A completed contract may be specifically enforced, even though it originated in an offer which remained open some time before acceptance.

It rests in the sound legal discretion of the court whether it will or not compel the specific performance of a contract. True, that discretion must be exercised according to the settled principles of equity, and not arbitrarily. (Allen v. Woodruff, 96 Ill. 11.) But to entitle the complainant to a decree the contract must be founded on a sufficient consideration, and must be reasonable, fair and just. Relief will not be granted unless it will subserve the ends of justice. (Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Co. v. Reno, 113 Ill. 39.) And in the case of unilateral contracts the courts will exercise their discretion with great care, and will view any delay of the purchaser with especial strictness. Estes v. Furlong, 59 Ill. 298; Harding v. Gibbs, 125 id. 85.</p> <p id=\"b239-4\" pgmap=\"239(200) 240(14)\">The contract in the case at bar was a mere option given by the Willigs to Wickersham to purchase the land in question within the time mentioned, and there was, before its acceptance, no consideration to support the contract. It was therefore within the power of the Willigs to withdraw this option at any time before their offer to sell was accepted. True, the contract was under seal, and purported to be based upon the nominal consideration of one dollar; but the evidence showed that there ..was in fact no consideration whatever, and it is well settled that in equity the real consideration may be inquired into, and the parties are not concluded by the recitals in the contract, though under seal. \u201cEquity,\u201d says Mr. Pomeroy, \u201cwill never enforce an executory agreement unless there was an actual valuable consideration, and, unlike the common law, it does not permit a seal to supply the place of a real consideration. Disregarding mere forms and looking at the reality, it requires an actual, valuable consideration as essential in any such agreement, and allows the want of it to be shown, notwithstanding the seal, in the enforcement of covenants, settlements and executory contracts of every description.\u201d 3 Pomeroy's Eq. Jur. sec. 1293.</p> <p id=\"b240-4\" pgmap=\"240\">It is clearly proved in this case that after the expiration of one year,\u2014the period which the Willigs claimed they understood the contract was to run,\u2014and before its acceptance by Wickersham, the Willigs refused to perform but declared it to be at an end, and so notified Wickersham. After they had repudiated it and had declared to him that they would never perform it, he sent them his written acceptance, to which they paid no attention, and still later he assigned the contract to appellant. When, therefore, appellant received the contract it had no binding force. It could not have been enforced by Wickersham, and Crandall was in no better position than he. More than this, Crandall did not tender the purchase money necessary to be paid until several months after the time of payment as fixed by the contract, if it could be regarded as still in force. Appellees were not bound to hunt up the assignee of the contract and tender him a deed, but appellant should himself have offered to pay if be wished to enforce the contract. In Mix v. Balduc, 78 Ill. 215, it was held that where the purchaser delays the offer of payment for five months after the stipulated time without any excuse therefor, his right to call for a specific performance will thereby be precluded, unless the time stipulated for payment has been waived. There c? can be no pretense of a waiver here.</p> <p id=\"b240-7\" pgmap=\"240\">There were several mistakes and imperfections in the contract which we have not thought it necessary to notice.</p> <p id=\"b240-8\" pgmap=\"240\">The decree of the circuit court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b240-9\" pgmap=\"240\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
