While there he contracted scarlet fever, in consequence of which he was sent to an isolation hospital. The sole question upon this appeal is whether the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the expense of his treatment for scarlet fever at the isolation hospital. Had the plaintiff contracted scarlet fever, a contagious disease, at his regular work, he would not have been entitled to compensation. Public Acts of 1921, Chap. 306, \u00a711. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>That he contracted it while in the hospital for treatment for a compensable injury does not alter the situation in his favor. On the contrary, it is clear that the disease, contracted under such circumstances, bore no causal relation to the plaintiff\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
