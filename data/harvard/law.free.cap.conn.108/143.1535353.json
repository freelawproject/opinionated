The error of\u00ab the trial court is alleged in the writ of error to have been in rendering judgment for the defendant through having failed to measure a distance from a fixed and visible monument.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The alleged error does not appear on the face of the record; the plaintiff attempts to remedy the defect by his bill of exceptions. This has not been allowed by the trial court, and no attempt has been made to require its allowance. Moreover, the defect is of the same character as those referred to in <em>State </em>v. <em>Caplan, supra, </em>hence the only remedy open to the plaintiff was by appeal. The motion to erase has been pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>since April 6th, 1927. The bill of exceptions was not filed until June 3d, 1927. The plaintiff is without remedy; his time for appeal has long since passed. But had a remedy been open to him by way of a bill of exceptions, he would have forfeited his right to this remedy through his delay in securing its allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"AMb\">The motion to erase the appeal is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
