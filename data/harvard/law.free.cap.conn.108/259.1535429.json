This the parties concede, but unite in contending that it is afforded under \u00a76070 as now amended by Chapter 264 of the Public Acts of 1921. Section 6070 was originally adopted in 1880 (Public Acts, Chap. 42) and provided as follows: \u201cIn all cases where real estate is held by a trustee under a trust created by deed, and by reason of a change of circumstances, or in the condition of such real estate, since the creation of such trust, the execution thereof in exact accordance with the terms of such deed has or shall become impossible, or must necessarily fail to secure the objects manifestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>intended by the grantor in said deed, the Superior Court in the county wherein such real estate is situated may, on the complaint of the trustee or any party beneficially interested in the trust, order the sale of such real estate, or any part thereof, and the investment of the proceeds, either in other real estate or as trust funds generally may be by law invested, for the benefit of the party beneficially interested in such trust, in such manner as said court may deem the most proper to secure the object for which said trust was originally created, as near as may be, according to the intent of the original grantor appearing in the original deed.\u201d Thereby the Superior Court, in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, was \u201cexpressly authorized to apply the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine to trusts created by deed.\u201d <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>63 Conn. 125, 136, 26 Atl. 846. This statute remained unchanged until 1921, when it was so amended as to extend in all respects the application of the powers therein specified to real estate held under trusts created by will as well as by deed. The obvious intent and necessary effect of this amendment was to expressly extend to trusts created by will, whether charitable in object or otherwise, the application of the modified doctrine of <em>cy pres </em>or of approximation which the statute had theretofore applied to \u00a1trusts created by deed, and which our courts, under th\u00e9ir general equitable powers, had applied to charitable trusts created by will. <em>Bristol Baptist Church </em>v. <em>Connecticut Baptist Convention, </em>98 Conn. 677, 683, 120 Atl. 497; <em>First Congregational Society </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>99 Conn. 22, 31, 121 Atl. 77. It gives statutory recognition to the principle that the doctrine of approximation, whereby the general intent of the donor is carried out as nearly as may be, even if the particular method pointed out by him cannot be followed, is \u201c \u2018not at all confined to the administration of charities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>but is applicable to all devises and contracts wherein the future is provided for.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Connecticut Hospital for Insane, </em>64 Conn. 320, 325, 30 Atl. 50; <em>Philadelphia </em>v. <em>Girard\u2019s Heirs, </em>45 Pa. St. 9; Perry on Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7376, 728. When the specific method adopted by the donor for carrying his general intent into effect cannot, because of changed conditions, be executed* there is justified the substitution of a method which is as nearly approximate as existing conditions will permit. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Healy, Attorney General, </em>100 Conn. 5, 10, 11, 122 Atl. 654, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The prerequisite of an order of sale under \u00a76070 as amended is that, by reason of a change of circumstances, or in the condition of the real estate, the execution of the trust in exact accordance with the terms of the deed or will creating it has become impossible, or would fail to secure the objects manifestly intended by the donor. It is manifest that the paramount intention of the testatrix here in making the provisions contained in paragraph one of Article Ninth of her will was to insure to her husband, during his lifetime, and to her son and his family until he attained the age of thirty years if he lived so long, a right of occupancy of the family residence and estate, as a home, without cost, charge or expense to them. A prime essential to the accomplishment of this intention is the desire and willingness on the part of the beneficiaries, or some of them, to utilize the property as such home. The lack of a disposition on the part of any of them to avail of this privilege is unequivocally manifested by their conduct in failing to occupy the premises as such home and by their formal abandonment and renunciation of their rights to do so. The object intended and sought, by the testatrix, therefore, cannot be accomplished, and the sole reason for the retention of the residence property by the trustees thereby becomes nonexistent. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>is not conceivably within the intention of the testatrix that, notwithstanding, the property should be retained and maintained, unoccupied, not only without benefit to the intended beneficiaries or to the estate, but involving a continued useless expenditure for care and upkeep and a substantial loss through unavoidable depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The unwillingness and refusal of the designated beneficiaries to occupy the premises as a home may well be regarded as such a \u201cchange of circumstances,\u201d not contemplated by the testatrix, by reason of which the execution of the trust in accordance with its terms would signally \u201cfail to secure the objects manifestly intended\u201d by the testatrix, and would give the Superior Court jurisdiction, under \u00a76070 of the General Statutes as amended, to authorize a sale of the real estate in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The proceeds of such sale, if made, are to be invested for the benefit of the party beneficially interested in the trust, in such manner as the court may deem the most suitable to secure the object for which the trust was originally created, as nearly as may be, according to the intent of the testatrix appearing in the will. Section 6070 of the General Statutes as amended by Chapter 264 of the Public Acts of 1921. This intent was, first, as we have seen, to provide a home for testatrix\u2019s husband, if he so desire, during his life, and for her son, if he so desire, and his family, until he attains the age of thirty years, or until the death of the husband should he live thereafter; second, as appears by paragraph seven of the same (Ninth) article of the will, that, when the son shall attain the age of thirty years, or upon the death of the husband if he live beyond the son\u2019s thirtieth birthday, the son shall take absolute title to the residence property. The interest of the husband in this specific property has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>been abrogated by his election to take his statutory share and his renunciation of his right to occupy it. The right of the son to utilize it as a home was dependent upon his desire to do so, which has been negatived by his renunciation. The privilege of Mrs. Bartels was dependent upon the occupancy of this property, as a home, by the husband or the son, or both. The trustees, because of the declination of the husband and the son to so occupy it, have elected not to maintain the residence as such home.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">If, notwithstanding such declination on the part of the son, any intention on the part of the testatrix to provide him with a home elsewhere were to be discerned and effectuated, such, it seems, will be adequately met by other provisions of the will and by the disposition of the proceeds of the sale as hereinafter indicated. Having attained the age of twenty-one years, the son is entitled, under paragraph four of Article Ninth, to the net income from the New York real estate, which income, if the sale is made, will be freed from the charge, imposed upon it in paragraph one, for the expenses, conduct, and maintenance of the residence property. Under paragraph five he is assured, until he reaches the age of twenty-six, of sufficient income to pay the reasonable expenses of his support, plus $5,000 annually, and from and after twenty-six he will be entitled, under paragraph six, to the net income of the entire residue, freed from the burden of the expense of upkeep of the residence property, which would be deductible were it retained unsold. Under the advice given below, he will also receive, upon attaining the age of twenty-six, the accumulated income from the proceeds of the sale, and thereafter, until thirty, the current income therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">We are of the opinion that the intent and object of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the testatrix will be most suitably secured and effectuated by the proper investment and maintenance of the proceeds of the sale as a separate fund until the son, Gerard Greims, attains the age of thirty years, whereupon such principal should be transferred to him in lieu of the specific real estate as devised to him under paragraph seven. The net income of this fund should be accumulated until he reaches the age of twenty-six years, thereupon such accumulated income should be paid over to him, and thereafter the net income from the fund should be paid over to him, semiannually or oftener, until he attains the age of thirty years, in like manner as the net income of the residuary estate is directed, by paragraphs five and six of the Ninth Article of the will, to be accumulated and paid over to him. If he dies before attaining the age of thirty years, this fund will pass in accordance with the provisions of Article Tenth of the will, as part of the residuary estate \u201cnot already paid, transferred or conveyed\u201d to him prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Our answer to the first question is yes; to the second, that the proceeds of the sale, if made, should be held, managed, and disposed of as above indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">No costs will be taxed in this court to any of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
