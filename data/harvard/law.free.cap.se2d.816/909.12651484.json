Because the trial court had no authority under North Carolina General Statute Chapter 50C to order defendant not to possess or purchase any firearms, to surrender his firearms, or to revoke his concealed carry permit, we reverse and remand the portion of the order with these provisions. We affirm the remaining portions of the order.\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On or about 23 May 2017, plaintiff filed COMPLAINT FOR NO-CONTACT ORDER FOR STALKING OR NONCONSENSUAL SEXUAL CONDUCT on form AOC-CV-520, Rev. 8/14 against defendant under North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 50C-2. Plaintiff alleged defendant grabbed her breasts without her consent, came to her house \"making false accusations\" and refused to leave, and had his erectile dysfunction medication delivered to her home. Plaintiff marked boxes on the form requesting an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   temporary order and a permanent no-contact order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also marked all of the boxes 4 through 9 on the form which request that defendant be ordered not to visit her or interfere with her in various ways and to stay away from her children's schools. Plaintiff made no request in the blank areas under box 10 entitled \"Other: (specify)[.]\" Plaintiff also made no allegations regarding firearms or any threat of physical violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The trial court entered an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   TEMPORARY NO-CONTACT ORDER FOR STALKING OR NONCONSENSUAL SEXUAL CONDUCT, form AOC-CV-523, rev. 10/15, granting the relief as plaintiff requested and setting a hearing on the permanent no-contact order on 2 June 2017. On 2 June 2017, the trial court held the hearing on the permanent no-contact order; plaintiff and defendant were both present and defendant was represented by counsel. Plaintiff did not mention guns or make any request related to guns during her testimony. Defendant mentioned during his testimony he was a former FBI agent, retired police officer, and a veteran; he owned a firearm, and was \"authorized to be armed in fifty states twenty-four seven.\" The trial court entered a NO-CONTACT ORDER FOR STALKING OR NONCONSENSUAL SEXUAL CONDUCT on form AOC-CV-524, Rev. 4/17 under North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 50C-7. The order included findings of fact regarding nonconsensual sexual conduct by defendant and concluded that defendant had \"committed acts of unlawful conduct against the plaintiff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the decree portion of the order, the trial court checked boxes 1 through 6, ordering defendant not to commit various acts such as visiting or stalking the plaintiff. The trial court also checked box 7, entitled \"Other: (specify)\" and made a handwritten notation ordering:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant shall surrender to the NH Sheriff's office any and all firearms that he owns, to be held by NH Sheriff\n   for the duration of this order.

Surrender of Firearms\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    Defendant first contends that the trial court exceeded its authority as granted in North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 50C-7 by ordering him to surrender his firearms, not to purchase or possess any firearms, and revoking his concealed carry permit. The order was entered under North Carolina General Statute, Chapter 50C, and presents a question of statutory interpretation. \"Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law, which are reviewed\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    by an appellate court.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

No permanent civil no-contact order shall be issued without notice to the respondent. Hearings held to consider permanent relief pursuant to this section shall not be held via video conference.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Nothing in North Carolina General Statute Chapter 50C addresses surrender of firearms.

Stat. \u00a7 50C-11 (2017).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    This case presents the question of what \"other relief\" or \"additional\" remedies the trial court has statutory authority to order, and in particular, whether the court may order surrender of firearms. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 50C-5 ; -11. Because Chapter 50B is a similar statutory scheme which addresses orders issued to protect against acts of domestic violence (\"DVPO\") arising in a \"personal relationship\" it is useful to compare the language of the two Chapters and consider the types of relief allowed under Chapter 50B to determine whether surrender of firearms is also a proper remedy under Chapter 50C.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     Compare generally\n    </em>\n    N.C.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 50B-3 ; 50C-5 (2017). North Carolina General Statutes 50B-3 and 50C-5 are not identical, since Chapter\n    50B includes provisions needed to address possession of a residence, child custody and support, and property issues common between those in a \"personal relationship[.]\"\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    N.C.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 50B-3.1 (2017).

Upon conducting the search directed by the DVPO, law enforcement officers discovered a marijuana growing operation in the defendant's home, leading to criminal charges.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=773%20S.E.2d%2051\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In his criminal case, our Supreme Court held that the trial court should have allowed the defendant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained from their search of his home under the DVPO because the district court did not have authority to order a search of a home without probable cause or a search warrant:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    Our General Assembly enacted the Domestic Violence Act, N.C.G.S. Chapter 50B, to respond to the serious and invisible problem of domestic violence. Subsection 50B-3(a) states that if a court finds a defendant committed an act of domestic violence, the court must grant a DVPO restraining the defendant from further acts of domestic violence. The statute then lists thirteen types of relief that the court may order in a DVPO. The first twelve are specific prohibitions or requirements imposed on a party to the DVPO. The last type of relief is a catch-all provision that authorizes the court to order any additional prohibitions or requirements the court deems necessary to protect any party or any minor child.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    We disagree with the State's contention that the General Assembly intended a broad interpretation of the word \"any.\" The plain language of section 50B-3 does not authorize courts to order law enforcement to search a defendant's person, vehicle, or residence under a DVPO. The word \"any\" in the catch-all provision modifies \"additional prohibitions or requirements,\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50B-3(a)(13), and this provision follows a list of twelve other prohibitions or requirements that the judge may impose on a party to a DVPO. For example, the court may prohibit a party from harassing the other party or from purchasing a firearm, and it may require a party to provide housing for his or her spouse and children, to pay spousal and child support, or to complete an abuser treatment program. It follows, then, that the catch-all provision limits the court to ordering a party to act or refrain from acting; the\n    provision does not authorize the court to order law enforcement, which is not a party to the civil DVPO, to proactively search defendant's person, vehicle, or residence.\n    Not only is this interpretation demanded by the plain language of the statute, but it is consistent with the protections provided by the Federal and State Constitutions. The Federal and State Constitutions protect fundamental rights by limiting the power of the government. Yet under the State's broad interpretation here, district courts would have seemingly unfettered discretion to order a broad range of remedies in a DVPO so long as the judge believes they are necessary for the protection of any party or child. This interpretation contravenes the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 20 of the North Carolina Constitution.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=773%20S.E.2d%2051\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=773%20S.E.2d%2051\">\n     at 72-73\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=773%20S.E.2d%2051\">\n     773 S.E.2d at 53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citations and quotation marks omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Although the particular issue in\n    <em>\n     Elder\n    </em>\n    is different, the same sort of analysis applies here.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Elder\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187585\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/368/70/\">\n     368 N.C. 70\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=773%20S.E.2d%2051\">\n     773 S.E.2d 51\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
