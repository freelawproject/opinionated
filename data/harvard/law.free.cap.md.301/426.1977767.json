McDonnell, a Maryland orthopedic surgeon, was sued for medical malpractice by Alvin Meyer, a former patient. Shortly before trial, which was scheduled for May 9, 1977, Meyer retained Drs. Robert Nystrom and Frank Pizzi to testify as medical experts against Dr. McDonnell. Counsel for Dr. McDonnell thereafter quickly deposed both witnesses. It was not until after trial had begun that the depositions were transcribed and Dr. McDonnell was able to read them. He expressed concern to his lawyer at that time that the physician witnesses were inexperienced, had never examined Meyer, and possessed little knowledge of the surgical procedure involved (use of Harrington instrumentation for fixation of the spine). After discussion with his attorney, Dr. McDonnell decided to communicate to Drs. Nystrom and Pizzi his intention of having transcripts of their depositions disseminated to their local and national medical societies. According to Dr. McDonnell, his purpose in doing so was to make certain that the testimony of the witnesses would be honest, reasonable and medically accurate. To this end, Dr. McDonnell initiated a phone call to Dr. Robert Keyser whom he knew to be highly regarded by Dr. Nystrom and from whom Dr. Nystrom had received his training in orthopedic surgery. For the same purpose, Dr. McDonnell also initiated a phone call to Dr. Thomas Langfitt, a physician who had trained Dr. Pizzi in neurosurgery and whom Dr. McDonnell knew to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>highly respected by Dr. Pizzi. Dr. McDonnell\u2019s message was thereby conveyed to Drs. Pizzi and Nystrom during the progress of the malpractice trial. While each of the witnesses felt intimidated by the phone calls, they nevertheless testified against Dr. McDonnell at the trial. Upon learning of the phone calls, the trial judge chastised Dr. McDonnell for his misconduct, although he found no improper intent on the physician\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The jury returned a verdict in Dr. McDonnell\u2019s favor. On appeal, the judgment was reversed for error in the jury instructions with respect to Dr. McDonnell\u2019s attempt to intimidate the two expert witnesses. <em>Meyer v. McDonnell, </em>40 Md.App. 524, 392 A.2d 1129 (1978). In its opinion in that case, the Court of Special Appeals characterized Dr. McDonnell\u2019s actions as \u201coutrageous\u201d and as \u201ctampering\u201d with the witnesses. The instant medical disciplinary proceedings were thereafter instituted against Dr. McDonnell.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">At the time of the disciplinary proceedings in this case, the Commission on Medical Discipline, a part of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, was authorized by Art. 43, \u00a7 130(h) to hear charges of \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d brought against a physician on any of nineteen enumerated grounds; and to \u201creprimand a physician or place him on probation, revoke or suspend his license, or dismiss the charges.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The charge against Dr. McDonnell under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u00a7 130(h)(8) \u2014 \u201c[ijmmoral conduct of a physician in his practice as a physician\u201d \u2014 was heard by the Commission on April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>7, 1981. After an evidentiary hearing, the Commission found as a fact that even if Dr. McDonnell did not intend to influence the testimony of Drs. Nystrom and Pizzi, he should have known that his conduct in having Drs. Keyser and Langfitt contact the two medical experts \u201cwas clearly intimidating and was improper.\u201d The Commission concluded as a matter of law that Dr. McDonnell violated \u00a7 130(h)(8) as charged and reprimanded him.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">On Dr. McDonnell\u2019s appeal to the Baltimore City Court (now the Circuit Court for Baltimore City), that court held that the Commission\u2019s decision was based on an erroneous application of the law to the facts found by it and thus required reversal. The court said that under applicable dictionary definitions Dr. McDonnell\u2019s conduct was not immoral, it being neither \u201cso inherently evil that one\u2019s conscience recognizes it as wrong or [because] community standards condemn it as wrong.\u201d It found a complete absence of evidence of immoral conduct on Dr. McDonnell\u2019s part. The court also held that the Commission reached an erroneous legal conclusion when it found that Dr. McDonnell\u2019s conduct occurred \u201cin his practice as a physician.\u201d It said that conduct, to fall within \u00a7 130(h)(8), must be shown to have a \u201cdetrimental effect\u201d on the performance of a physician\u2019s activities in the practice of medicine. The court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">\u201cthe censured conduct arose only after Dr. McDonnell and his patient were in the adversary position of defendant and plaintiff in a malpractice action. The court has no difficulty in finding that the question of whether or not it was proper to contact witnesses in a law suit was primarily an issue related to the practice of law and was clearly not a decision made by Dr. McDonnell in his practice as a physician.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, in reversing the judgment of the circuit court, concluded that the Commission, which consisted primarily of physicians, had special expertise in assessing \u201cthe effect that the telephone calls initiated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Dr. McDonnell would have upon the prospective expert witnesses for Meyer.\u201d <em>Com\u2019n on Medical Discipline v. McDonnell, </em>56 Md.App. 391, 467 A.2d 1072 (1983). It said that \u201cthe seemingly innocuous message that transcripts of [the expert witnesses\u2019] testimony would be forwarded to appropriate medical societies, delivered by the recipients\u2019 mentors, would naturally tend to intimidate Drs. Nystrom and Pizzi and constrict their testimony.\u201d 56 Md.App. at 402, 467 A.2d 1072. The intermediate appellate court said that the Commission had sufficient evidence before it to support a finding that Dr. McDonnell \u201cinitiated the telephone calls in question with the intention of intimidating witnesses in a lawsuit and constricting their testimony against him\u201d; that such conduct \u201cis clearly morally wrong\u201d and \u201camounts to an endeavor to obstruct justice,\u201d a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>Id. </em>56 Md.App. at 403, 467 A.2d 1072. The court disagreed with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the asserted immoral conduct was not committed by Dr. McDonnell \u201cin his practice as a physician.\u201d The court rejected the argument that a physician\u2019s conduct, to be immoral \u201cin his practice as a physician,\u201d must be shown to have had a detrimental effect upon the performance of such activity. To come within the proscription of \u00a7 130(h)(8), the court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9D\">\u201cthe physician\u2019s misconduct need not be confined to his actions in diagnosing or treating a patient but must be directly related to some aspect of the practice of medicine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>56 Md.App. at 404, 467 A.2d 1072.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">What was involved, the court emphasized, was Dr. McDonnell\u2019s effort to suppress evidence that he failed to use adequate skill in treating a patient, a matter which implicated his professional reputation. Affording deference to the Commission\u2019s expertise in interpreting that which constitutes or is in \u201cthe practice of medicine,\u201d the court concluded that the Commission could legally find \u201cthat a physician\u2019s attempt to protect and preserve his professional reputation is conduct \u2018in his practice as a physician\u2019 because his future practice may well depend upon his reputation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>granted certiorari to consider the important issue involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Before us, Dr. McDonnell admits that his actions were wrong, improper and injudicious. But that is not the issue, he asserts; rather, the primary question is whether his actions were those of <em>\u201ca </em>physician in his practice as a physician,\u201d as charged in the disciplinary petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He maintains that his misconduct had nothing to do with the practice of medicine. Moreover, he notes that the patient-physician relationship which he had with Meyer terminated long before the Meyer trial. He argues that it is not <em>any </em>immoral conduct which subjects a physician to sanction under \u00a7 130(h)(8) but only that conduct which reflects adversely upon the physician\u2019s fitness to practice medicine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No evidence was adduced, he says, to show that his conduct adversely affected his ability or fitness to practice medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The Attorney General argues that Dr. McDonnell\u2019s misconduct was inextricably related to the practice of medicine and consequently is within the purview of \u00a7 130(h)(8). He contends that the provisions of this subsection encompass not just a physician\u2019s technical competence in the practice of medicine but moral character and integrity considerations as well. He relies on a raft of cases from other jurisdictions which, he suggests, indicate that acts done by a physician which are not directly in the course of patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>care and treatment, but which are otherwise connected to a present or former patient-physician relationship, fall within the ambit of medical disciplinary provisions similar to \u00a7 130(h)(8). The Attorney General maintains that Dr. McDonnell\u2019s misconduct occurred in the utilization of his medical office and while he was acting as a physician and thus occurred \u201cin his practice as a physician.\u201d He stresses that Dr. McDonnell\u2019s actions were calculated to protect his professional reputation and ultimately his ability to practice and accept future patients. At the least, therefore, the Attorney General says that Dr. McDonnell\u2019s conduct indicated a lack of morality and integrity required of a physician \u2014 conduct which constitutes \u201c[ijmmoral conduct of a physician in his practice as a physician.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Although we agree that Dr. McDonnell\u2019 conduct was improper and not to be condoned, we hold that it is not censurable under \u00a7 130(h)(8). We think that \u201cimmoral conduct\u201d under that provision must occur while in the performance of a physician\u2019s practice within the contemplation of the \u201cPractitioners of Medicine\u201d subtitle of Art. 43 and specifically \u00a7 119 thereof. That definitional section, which is applicable to \u00a7 130(h), defined practice of medi\u2019cine\u201din subparagraph (f) to mean the exercise of \u201cthe art of science and medical diagnosis, healing, or surgery\u201d including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u201c(1) Operating on, professing to heal, prescribing for or otherwise diagnosing or treating any physical, mental or emotional or supposed ailment of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">(2) Undertaking by appliance, test, operation, or treatment to diagnose, prevent, cure, heal, prescribe for, or treat any bodily, mental or emotional ailment or supposed ailment of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">(3) Undertaking to treat, heal, cure or remove any physical, emotional or mental ailment or supposed ailment of another by mental, emotional or other process exercised or invoked on the part of either the physician, the patient, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>(4) Assisting, attempting, inducing, or causing by any means whatsoever the termination of a human pregnancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">(5) Performing acupuncture.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">It is readily evident that the legislature, in authorizing disciplinary sanctions against physicians for \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d under \u00a7 130(h), did so with great particularity. <em>See </em>footnote 1, <em>supra. </em>It expressly outlined and defined nineteen forms of physician misconduct, some of which had no immediate connection with the diagnosis, care or treatment of patients or the practice of medicine, such as habitual intoxication, conviction of a crime of moral turpitude, or the personal use of illegal drugs. In only two of the nineteen described types of misconduct are the disciplinary infractions explicitly limited to a physician\u2019s act \u201cin his practice as a physician,\u201d <em>i.e.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201c(8) Immoral conduct of a physician in his practice as a physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">(9) Willfully making and filing false reports or records, in his practice as a physician.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">It is thus clear, as Dr. McDonnell points out, that it is not <em>any </em>immoral conduct of a physician, or <em>any </em>willful filing of a false report which constitutes \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d; rather, the misconduct must occur in the physician\u2019s \u201cpractice as a physician.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1055 (5th ed. 1979) defines the \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d as the \u201ctreatment of injuries as well as the discovery of the cause and nature of disease, and the administration of remedies, or the prescribing of treatment therefor.\u201d Similarly, \u00a7 119\u2019s definition of \u201cpractice of medicine,\u201d which we think controls the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>meaning of the phrase \u201cpractice as a physician\u201d in \u00a7 130(h)(8), limits its reach to matters pertaining essentially to the diagnosis, care or treatment of patients.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The cases relied upon by the Attorney General, which we have reviewed, are thus inapposite in construing the import and application of \u00a7 130(h)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The purpose of disciplinary proceedings against licensed professionals is not to punish the offender but rather as a catharsis for the profession and a prophylactic for the public. <em>See Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 318 A.2d 811 (1974); <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 307 A.2d 677 (1973). <em>See also Unnamed Physician v. Comm\u2019n, </em>285 Md. 1, 400 A.2d 396 (1979), quoting <em>In re Kindschi, 52 </em>Wash.2d 8, 319 P.2d 824 (1958). Nevertheless, because there is a punitive aspect to the proceedings, statutes which authorize the imposition of sanctions against the licensed professional should be strictly construed against the disciplinary agency. <em>See Maul v. State Bd. of Dental Examiners, </em>668 P.2d 933 (Col. 1983); <em>New Jersey State Board of Optometrists v. Nemitz, </em>21 N.J.Super. 18, 90 A.2d 740 (1952); <em>Snell v. Com., State Examining Bd., </em>490 Pa. 277, 416 A.2d 468 (1980); <em>Schireson v. Shafer, </em>354 Pa. 458, 47 A.2d 665 (1946); 61 Am.Jur.2d <em>Physicians and Surgeons, Etc. </em>\u00a7 103 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">It is thus clear that the legislature did not intend that a physician\u2019s general moral character would be subject to sanction under \u00a7 130(h)(8). In other words, it is not any immoral conduct of a physician committed during the time of his licensure which is within the terms of \u00a7 130(h)(8). Nor would that subsection embrace immoral conduct simply because, in some manner, it had a general or associative relationship to the physician in his capacity as a member of the medical profession. On the contrary, as we have indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>cated, the application of \u00a7 130(h)(8) is directly tied to the physician\u2019s conduct in the actual performance of the practice of medicine, i.e., in the diagnosis, care, or treatment of patients. Unquestionably, Dr. McDonnell\u2019s act in initiating the improper phone calls was related to his professional practice. But his act was not done in the course of the actual practice of medicine, as defined in \u00a7 119(f). Consequently, the imposition of the sanction of reprimand upon Dr. McDonnell must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND THE MATTER TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT REVERSING THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION ON MEDICAL DISCIPLINE AND DISMISSING THE DISCIPLINARY PETITION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\">.
