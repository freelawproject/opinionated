We shall hold that the employer is responsible for so much of the award as equals compensation payable for that disability which the subsequent injury would have caused, absent the prior impairment, and that the Fund is responsible for the balance of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The claimant, James Paul Kraus (Kraus), had been employed by the City as a firefighter beginning in 1964. He was diagnosed as having high blood pressure in 1972. On March 11, 1978, Kraus suffered the first of two myocardial infarctions and has been unable to return to work. His average weekly wage was $287.17. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission (the Commission) found that Kraus was permanently totally disabled and that \u201c70% of such disability is reasonably attributable to the occupational disease and 30% is due to the pre-existing condition.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Commission ordered the City, a self-insurer, to pay Kraus \u201ccompensation for permanent total disability at the rate of $192.00 per week beginning March 14, 1978 not to exceed the sum of $63,045.00 allowable under 'Other Cases\u2019____\u201d The Fund was ordered to pay Kraus \u201ccompensation for permanent total disability at the rate of $192.00 per week and continuing during the period of permanent total disability; beginning at the end of compensation to be paid by the [City].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Prior to 1973 total compensation payable for permanent total disability was limited to $45,000. Chapter 671 of the Acts of 1973 eliminated any ceiling by adding a proviso which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">[Provided, however, that if the employee\u2019s total disability shall continue after a total of $45,000.00 has been paid, then further weekly payments at the rate previously paid shall be paid to him during such disability. [Md.Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 36(1)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Under the Commission\u2019s award to Kraus the City\u2019s portion is limited to $63,045 while the Fund\u2019s portion is open ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The Fund appealed, contending that employer and Fund should pay compensation concurrently, so that in this case the Chy and the Fund should pay Kraus 70% and 30%, respectively, of the required weekly payments. The circuit court affirmed the Commission and the Fund appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion that court affirmed the circuit court. We granted the Fund\u2019s petition for certiorari, which advanced the argument, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Commission\u2019s method of allocating permanent total disability awards in subsequent injury cases was at odds with the allocation in death cases approved in <em>C &amp; P Telephone Co. v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>297 Md. 339, 466 A.2d 39 (1983). There we affirmed for the reasons set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>forth in the opinion for the Court of Special Appeals by Judge Adkins, 53 Md.App. 508, 453 A.2d 1243 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">We affirm the Court of Special Appeals in this case. The Fund\u2019s position contradicts the express language of the first unnumbered paragraph of the controlling statute, \u00a7 66(1). In relevant part \u00a7 66(1) para. 1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">Whenever an employee who has a permanent impairment due to previous accident or disease or any congenital condition, which is or is likely to be a hindrance or obstacle to his employment, incurs subsequent disability by reason of a personal injury, for which compensation is required by this article resulting in permanent partial or permanent total disability that is substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of the impairment and subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer or his insurance carrier shall be liable only for the compensation payable under this article for such injury. However, in addition to such compensation to which the employer or his insurance carrier is liable, and after the completion of payments therefor provided by this article, the employee ... shall be paid additional compensation from [the Fund], it being the intent of this section to make the total payments to which such employee shall become entitled equal to the compensation that would be due for the combined effects of the impairment and subsequent injury resulting in permanent total disability or a substantially greater permanent partial disability.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The essence of the Fund\u2019s argument, quoted from its brief, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">Where such injury in conjunction with prior impairment results in the combined effects of permanent total disability, then each factor contributes to the total disability. The previous impairment does not, standing alone, render the claimant permanently totally disabled and the compensable injury alone does not render the claimant permanently totally disabled. The combined effects, however, do. Therefore, the Employer should be charged with the percentage of permanent total disability which is caused by the injury, and the Subsequent Injury Fund should be charged with the percentage contributed by the pre-existing condition, or prior permanent impairment. Payments by both parties should be simultaneous and begin from the first payment for permanent total disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-Y\">Paragraph 1 of \u00a7 66(1) clearly states that the Fund pays after the employer has paid. The payments are not concurrent. The system which the Fund urges has the employer and the Fund paying their shares of each weekly payment to the claimant throughout the period of permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Further, the employer\u2019s obligation is \u201conly for the compensation payable under this article for such injury.\u201d The \u201cinjury\u201d referred to is the disability that \u201cwould have resulted from the subsequent injury alone .... \u201d The step-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>by-step calculation of the Commission\u2019s award reflects how compliance with this aspect of \u00a7 66(1) para. 1 was achieved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The Commission attributed 70% of the permanent total disability to the subsequent injury. In the words of \u00a7 66(1) para. 1, 70% is the extent of disability \u201cwhich would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone____\u201d The Commission then looked to \u00a7 36(4)(a), the \u201cOther Cases\u201d section. It generally provides that in certain permanent partial disability cases the Commission is to determine the percentage of loss of industrial use of the employee\u2019s body \u201cand shall award compensation in such proportion as the determined loss bears to 500 weeks, the said compensation to be paid weekly at the rate of [66%%] of the average weekly wages, in no case to exceed [33%%] of the State average weekly wage____\u201d As of March 11, 1978, one-third of the State average weekly wage was $68. Because the Commission found a 70% disability attributable to the subsequent injury and because 70% permanent partial disability converts to 350 weeks under \u00a7 36(4)(a), the Commission treated Kraus\u2019 subsequent injury as a \u201cserious disability\u201d under \u00a7 36(4a). In serious disability cases \u201c[t]he weeks for such award shall be increased by one third ... and the compensation shall be for [66%%] of the average weekly wage____\u201d The latter limitation as of March 11, 1978, was $135. Increasing the 350 weeks by one-third, or 117 weeks, to a total of 467 weeks and multiplying 467 weeks by the maximum serious disability rate of $135 per week, the Commission arrived at $63,045 as the total amount payable by the City to Kraus.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">By this method the Commission correctly honored the limitation of \u00a7 66(1) para. 1 that \u201cthe employer ... shall be liable only for the compensation payable under this article for such injury.\u201d Having determined that a 70% permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>partial disability \u201cwould have resulted from the subsequent injury alone,\u201d the Commission computed the City\u2019s liability by using \u00a7 36(4)(a) and (4a) as if the injury were one for an \u201cOther Cases\u201d permanent partial disability. The Commission\u2019s calculation comports with the rationale of <em>Reliance Ins. Co. v. Watts, </em>16 Md.App. 71, 293 A.2d 836 (1972), the Maryland appellate decision most nearly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Watts had lost his left leg in an earlier accident and lost his right leg in the subject accident. Absent \u201cconclusive proof to the contrary\u201d loss of both legs is a permanent total disability under \u00a7 36(1)(a) for which compensation was limited to $45,000 when Watts lost his second leg. The Commission attributed 50% of the disability to the loss of each leg and ordered compensation accordingly. In support of the award the Fund argued \u201cthat it is \u2018the percentage of industrial loss of use of the body as a whole <em>due to </em>the [second] injury\u2019 which is chargeable to the claimant\u2019s current employer .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74, 293 A.2d at 838 (emphasis added). The court rejected that argument as conflicting with the policy behind \u00a7 66(1) which is to encourage employers to hire handicapped individuals by limiting the employer\u2019s liability. <em>See Subsequent Injury Fund v. Pack, </em>250 Md. 306, 308, 242 A.2d 506, 508 (1968). Section 66(1) para. 1, properly applied, required the Commission first to compute the employer\u2019s liability for loss of one leg as if there were a permanent partial disability under the \u201cscheduled injuries\u201d provisions of \u00a7 36(3), enhanced by the serious disability subsection, and then to subtract that amount from the $45,000 maximum for permanent total disability to arrive at the Fund\u2019s share. Judge Jerrold V. Powers, writing for the court, explained its holding with the following illustration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">If one should assume that a person with perfect sight in one eye, though blind in the other, may retain 90% of the industrial use of his body as a whole, it would be clear that loss of his remaining sight would render him totally disabled. It could be said as a medical fact that the subsequent injury resulted in the loss of the 90% industri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>al use of the body as a whole which he had before the second injury. If the contention of the Subsequent Injury Fund were sound, the current employer and his insurer would be responsible for this 90% loss. The risk of this responsibility is precisely the risk against which \u00a7 66(1) protects the employer. If.it did not afford that protection, the purpose of the legislation, \u201cto persuade the employer to employ the handicapped individual by limiting the liability, which the employer may otherwise have incurred\u201d would be defeated at the start.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">We hold that \u201cthe compensation payable under this article for such injury\u201d, referring to a subsequent injury which calls for the application of \u00a7 66(1), must be determined upon- the assumption that the employee had no pre-existing \u201cpermanent impairment due to previous accident or disease or any congenital condition, which is or is likely to be a hindrance or obstacle to his employment\u201d. [16 Md.App. at 75, 293 A.2d at 838.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">This Court, in <em>Anchor Motor Freight, Inc. v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>278 Md. 320, 325, 363 A.2d 505, 509 (1976), <em>affg Subsequent Injury Fund v. Compton, </em>28 Md.App. 526, 346 A.2d 475 (1975), expressed the rule laid down by \u00a7 66(1) to be that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">the Fund is directed to contribute to the employee\u2019s compensation an amount equal to the difference between the award payable for the subsequent injury <em>alone </em>and that payable for the second injury combined with the previous impairment. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">We then cited <em>Reliance Ins. Co., supra, </em>as \u201c[a] graphic demonstration of this general principle----\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Further, the background of <em>Leach v. John T. Clark &amp; Son, Inc., </em>20 Md.App. 109, 314 A.2d 689, <em>cert. denied, </em>271 Md. 739 (1974), like <em>Reliance, </em>reflects rejection of a stream of causation analysis for allocating directly to the total payable under \u00a7 36(1)(a) the percentage shares between employer and Fund in cases of permanent total disability incurred prior to the repeal of a limit on compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>actually payable in permanent total cases. Under the statutes in effect at the time of Leach\u2019s subsequent injury, there was a $30,000 limit on compensation for permanent total disability. The Commission attributed 10% disability to the current injury and 90% to a pre-existing condition. The award against the employer was $3,000, apparently computed by applying 10% to $30,000. On appeal the circuit court modified the award against the employer to $1,250. That represented 10% of the then $12,500 maximum allowable under \u201cOther Cases\u201d and treats the hypothetical 10% disability as a permanent partial disability. The modification is consistent with the Commission\u2019s methodology in the instant matter. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion did not address this point because the employee conceded that the modified award was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Indeed, the parties seem to be in accord that following the elimination of a ceiling on the amount of compensation ultimately payable for permanent total disability the practice of the Commission has been to compute the amount for which the employer is liable by reference to the statutory provisions governing the amount of award in permanent partial disability cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The only way for the Fund to prevail in this case is to establish an implied repeal of those provisions of \u00a7 66(1) which call for (1) finding the disability that \u201cwould have resulted from the subsequent injury alone\u201d; (2) payment of \u201cthe compensation payable under [Art. 101] for such injury\u201d first by the employer; and (3) consecutive payment of the balance of the compensation for the combined disability by the Fund. Statutes are to be construed harmoniously, and repeals which have not been expressed by the General Assembly \u201cwill not be found unless demanded by irreconcilability or repugnancy.\u201d <em>Board of Education v. Lendo, </em>295 Md. 55, 63, 453 A.2d 1185, 1189 (1982). And <em>see Carroll County Education Ass\u2019n v. Board of Education, </em>294 Md. 144, 448 A.2d 345 (1982); <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>282 Md. 641, 387 A.2d 260 (1978); <em>Harden v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>277 Md. 399, 354 A.2d 817 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>In an effort to surmount the terms of \u00a7 66(1), the Fund presents a two-step argument. First, it attempts to make \u00a7 36(l)(a) control shares as well as the total compensation to be paid in permanent total cases. At the next level of the argument the Fund submits that the proviso added to \u00a7 36(l)(a) impliedly repeals the \u00a7 66(1) obstacles to its position. But the argument does not demonstrate any irreconcilable conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The Fund\u2019s submission begins by asserting that it is illogical, when Kraus has been found totally and permanently disabled, for the Commission to look to the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provisions of \u00a7 36(4)(a), which deal with permanent partial disability. It says that the Commission should have turned to \u00a7 36(1), which deals with permanent total disability, and simply apportioned the payments as they are made on the basis that the prior and subsequent injuries have contributed to the combined disability. But nothing in that analysis prevents \u00a7\u00a7 36(4)(a) and 66(1) from standing together.' The Commission\u2019s methodology takes it through the steps of permanent partial awards because \u00a7 66(1) directs that the disability from the subsequent injury \u201calone\u201d be determined, and the percentage of disability must be converted into a dollar amount in order to determine how much of the total award is payable by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Step two of the Fund\u2019s argument emphasizes \u00a7 36(1) as controlling the entire methodology in permanent total disability cases and sees an implied repeal of part of \u00a7 66(1) para. 1 by the 1973 removal of any limit on compensation for permanent total disability. This approach assumes that the employer\u2019s contribution is a percentage of the total award equal to the extent to which the subsequent injury caused the disability under consideration and assumes that the Fund\u2019s contribution is a percentage of the total equal to the extent to which the prior impairment contributes to the present disability. This approach further assumes that, prior to the revision of 1973, the percentages were applied directly against the $45,000 limit to produce the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>compensation to be paid by the respective interests. When the limit was repealed, so the argument goes, the total amount of compensation to be paid became indefinite, the percentages could not be applied against a known number as had been done previously, and it became necessary to have the employer and the Fund respectively pay their portions concurrently beginning with the first week of payments and at those shares on into the future. The argument ignores \u00a7 66(1), which is not irreconcilable with amended \u00a7 36(l)(a). The sections are compatible under <em>Reliance </em>and the other cases discussed <em>supra </em>which reject the notion that the percentages are determined by streams of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The Fund also bases an argument on para. 2 of \u00a7 66(1). That paragraph requires the previous impairment and the subsequent injury each to be compensable for not less than 125 weeks before the Fund is liable. See <em>supra </em>note 2. The Fund says that the General Assembly did not intend para. 2 to apply to cases where the combined disability is permanent total. As a corollary to the Fund\u2019s claim that employer and Fund are mutually obliged indefinitely to make concurrent payments under \u00a7 36(l)(a), all permanent total cases should be deemed to exceed 125 weeks as to both payors. The Fund considers it improper to apply para. 2 to a case of permanent total disability, as if the claim were divisible into two permanent partial segments. The Fund says there will be cases where so large a number of weeks of compensation will be attributed to the employer, either on the \u00a7 36(4)(a) scale under which 500 weeks represents permanent total disability or on that scale enhanced under \u00a7 36(4a), that fewer than 125 weeks will remain to be attributed to the Fund. Consequently, as the argument goes, there will be no Fund liability, and a permanent total case will result only in compensation for permanent partial disability paid by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The question of how \u00a7 66(1) para. 2 is to be interpreted and applied is not directly before us for decision in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Here, 70% permanent partial disability was attributed to the subsequent injury alone, so that the remaining 30 percentage points represent 150 weeks on the \u201cOther Cases\u201d scale, even before applying the \u201cserious disability\u201d provision. We also note, without intimating any view on the matter, that there is commentary which denies the Fund\u2019s premise as to the legislative intent. <em>See </em>Maryland Institute for Continuing Professional Education of Lawyers, Inc., <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Manual </em>178-79 (1981 &amp; Supp.1984).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any event, even if we assume that indefinite liability in permanent total cases should always be considered to exceed 125 weeks, that does nothing to assist the Fund in finding an implied repeal of the express language in \u00a7 66(1) para. 1. The assumption does not lead to the conclusion that the employer\u2019s contribution cannot be calculated by reference to the permanent partial disability sections or that employer and Fund payments must be concurrent.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Next, the Fund asserts that <em>C &amp; P Telephone Co. v. Subsequent Injury Fund, supra, </em>controls the interpretation of \u00a7 66(1) para. 1. <em>C &amp; P </em>involved allocation between employer and Fund of the award in a death case. It was controlled by the third paragraph of \u00a7 66(1). See <em>supra </em>note 2. Where \u201cdeath was due in part to the previous impairment and in part'to the subsequent accidental injury, the Commission [is to] determine the proportion of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>death which is reasonably attributable to\u201d each. We interpreted the para. 3 language essentially to call for a stream of causation analysis much like the analysis which the Fund contends applies when the combined disability is permanent total. Nevertheless, the para. 3 language differs materially from the para. 1 language. The judicial construction of para. 3 does not alter what para. 1 says.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The Fund also complains of the rate of payment specified in the Commission\u2019s order in this case. After the Commission used $135 per week to compute the total of $63,045 payable by the City, the Commission ordered the City to pay at the rate of $192 per week. The latter figure was two-thirds of Kraus\u2019 average weekly wage. Payment to Kraus at the rate of $192 per week is consistent with \u00a7 36(1)(a), where the maximum weekly payment for a permanent total disability claim is 100% of the State average weekly wage. That was $202 as of March 11, 1978. One hundred and ninety-two dollars ($192) per week, however, exceeds the $135 per week ceiling then applicable to \u201cOther Cases,\u201d even when the serious disability provision was also applied. This is cited by the Fund as further illustrating the illogic of the Commission\u2019s method. We have approved the prior steps of that method <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The Fund alternatively argues that use of the permanent total rate of payment improperly accelerated by more than 138 weeks the time when the Fund\u2019s payments would begin, even if the Commission\u2019s basic methodology was correct. The Court of Special Appeals did not address this point because it had not been raised before the circuit court. We do not address the point for the further reason that it was not raised in the Fund\u2019s petition for certiorari. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 813 a.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The claimant could conceivably get more than 125 weeks of compensation from the Fund, if he lives long enough. Would, therefore, this 5% pre-existing disability qualify under the 125 week statute? We would strongly urge that this would defeat the intention of the 125 week statute, which is to rule out Fund payment for both insignificant accidents and insignificant pre-existing causes. We would urge the Court to apply the same 25% disability (125 weeks under ordinary rates for the \"other cases\" schedule) on the pre-existing portion as is applied on the accident for the simple reason that there is no other possible means of calculating the pre-existing 125 weeks in permanent total cases if it is not done that way.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
