We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">It appears that on October 14, 1980, a \u201cWiretap Order\u201d was issued by the Criminal Court of Baltimore authorizing electronic surveillance of certain telephones ordinarily used by appellants. As a result of evidence obtained through the wiretaps, criminal lottery charges were filed against the appellants. A Baltimore City judge of the District Court of Maryland granted the appellants motion to suppress the wiretap evidence and the State entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to all charges. Thereafter the wiretap evidence was treated as \u201csealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Later the appellants were indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland for alleged offenses arising from the wiretaps. In September, 1983, the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City \u201cpursuant to Courts Article 10-408(g)(2) seeking unsealing of Original Tapes and Logs.\u201d In the petition it was stated that appellants \u201cwere indicted in the Federal District of Maryland for offenses arising from the wiretap\u201d <em>(sic) </em>and that the \u201cAssistant United States Attorney needs to disclose the logs and tapes to the defense counsel for purposes of discovery and to use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>in evidence at trial.\u201d Judge Milton B. Allen signed an order granting the petition on September 28, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Under date of January 24, 1984, the appellants filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a \u201cMotion for Recision of September 28, 1983 Order unsealing Wiretap Evidence.\u201d The State filed an answer in opposition and after a hearing, Judge Allen signed an order on February 22, 1984, denying the appellants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">It is at once apparent that the appellants\u2019 Motion to rescind the order of September 28, 1983, was filed after the expiration of the September Term 1983, that term having ended on the second Monday in January, 1984 (January 10th). Md.Rule 1206 c. Since there was no allegation or evidence of any fraud, mistake or irregularity, it is clear that Judge Allen was without authority to grant the motion to rescind and, accordingly, the motion was properly denied. <em>Ayre v. State, </em>291 Md. 155, 159-160, 433 A.2d 1150 (1981). <em>See </em>also <em>Hardy v. Metts, </em>282 Md. 1, 381 A.2d 683 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
