See <em>State v. Collins, </em>296 Md. 670, 464 A.2d 1028 (1983), for our leading case on the subject, and <em>Simkus v. State, </em>296 Md. 718, 464 A.2d 1055 (1983), for an application of <em>Collins </em>to the co-defendant of Charles William McCoy, the appellant in this case. Other applications of <em>Collins </em>are found in <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. 563, 574-78, 468 A.2d 45, 49-51 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 2374, 80 L.Ed.2d 846 (1984); <em>State v. Metscher, </em>297 Md. 368, 464 A.2d 1052 (1983), and <em>Grimes v. State, </em>297 Md. 1, 464 A.2d 1065 (1983). We shall hold that, as in <em>Simkus, </em>there was sufficient evidence of a prehypnotic base for the testimony in question to permit its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">At issue here is the identification of McCoy at trial by Deborah Hurdel over the defendant\u2019s objection. She had been hypnotized previously. The judge who heard the motion to suppress specified that her testimony would \u201cbe confined to testimony not hypnotically induced.\u201d The record shows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-13\">\u201cQ. Okay. Ms. Hurdel, I\u2019m going to ask you a series of questions, and I\u2019d like you to recall now only what you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>knew prior to that day that you met Dr. Stern on March 3rd, 1981. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">\u201cA. I think so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">This was followed by an objection and the ruling of the judge presiding at trial based upon the ruling of the judge who had heard the motion to suppress. He specified that counsel should ask questions based only on what was recalled prior to hypnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">McCoy was convicted by a Howard County jury of murder in the first degree. The Court of Special Appeals reversed the conviction in an unreported opinion. It held \u201cthat it was error to have admitted into evidence the testimonial identification by Mrs. Hurdel.\u201d We granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and ordered \u201cthat the case be remanded to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland for reconsideration in light of <em>State v. Collins, </em>[296 Md. 670, 464 A.2d 1028 (1983)].\u201d <em>State v. McCoy, </em>297 Md. 5, 464 A.2d 1067 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">On remand the Court of Special Appeals reviewed the evidence before the trial judge on the motion to suppress. It affirmed the conviction in an unreported opinion. That court referred to our opinion in <em>Collins, </em>296 Md. 670, 464 A.2d 1028, where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">\u201cWe see no reason why a person should not be permitted to testify in court in accord with statements which it clearly can be demonstrated he made prior to hypnosis. Such is not then hypnotically enhanced testimony. This seems to be in accord with the majority view. We do not go so far as to spell out the exact procedures which must be followed to clearly demonstrate that such statements were made prior to hypnosis. One method certainly might be to follow the guidelines laid down by the Arizona court in <em>[State ex rel.] Collins [v. Superior Court, etc.], </em>132 Ariz. 180, 210, [644 P.2d 1266 (1982),] which we have heretofore quoted. Since one cannot possibly envision all possible situations in which statements prior to hypnosis might be demonstrated to accord with posthyp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>notic testimony, we deem it wise not to attempt to spell out each and every condition or possibility for demonstrating reliability. To do otherwise is to risk omission of acceptable solutions which do not occur to us.\u201d 296 Md. at 702-03, 464 A.2d at 1044-45.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The Court of Special Appeals went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cThe appellant in <em>Simkus v. State, supra, </em>was a co-defendant of the appellant, McCoy, although he was tried separately and convicted of the murder of Ms. Napieralski. Simkus appealed to this Court and the Court of Appeals granted certiorari prior to argument in this Court. In affirming Simkus\u2019 conviction the Court of Appeals said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\u2018 \u201cIt is clearly demonstrated in this case that Mrs. Hurdel\u2019s identification of Simkus does not depend upon hypnosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">The trial judge\u2019s ruling was in accord with <em>Collins.\u201d </em>\u2019 \u201cSince the evidence adduced at McCoy\u2019s trial was substantially identical to that adduced at Simkus\u2019 trial, we are compelled to conclude that it was clearly demonstrated in McCoy\u2019s trial that Mrs. Hurdel\u2019s identification of McCoy does not depend upon hypnosis. The trial judge\u2019s ruling admitting her testimony was in accord with <em>State v. Collins, supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">We granted McCoy\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">Background is provided in a portion of the agreed statement of facts which the parties have entered into pursuant to Maryland Rule 828 g:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-12\">\u201cOn February 15, 1981, Debbie Hurdel came to the Woodlawn Police Station in Baltimore County to report that her friend, Debbie Napieralski, was missing. Hurdel told the police that she and Napieralski had been approached by two men as they were leaving the Hidden Valley Country Club at approximately 1:45 a.m. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>man came up to Napieralski and said: \u2018Hey, where\u2019s my valentine\u2019s kiss?\u2019 Napieralski gave him a kiss. The other man came up to Hurdel and asked her if they wanted to go to breakfast. Hurdel declined, but Napieralski agreed \u2018to go to breakfast with them.\u2019 The two men then followed Hurdel and Napieralski to Hurdel\u2019s house. Before leaving with the two men, Napieralski told Hurdel that \u2018if my mother calls in the morning, just tell her I\u2019m sleeping.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Officer Schaeffer of the Baltimore County Police Department testified at the suppression hearing that the descriptions given by Mrs. Hurdel to him on the morning of February 15 were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">\u201cThe first subject was described as a white male, twenty-five or twenty-six years old, approximately five eight, thin build, blonde hair and blonde mustache. The second gentleman was described as a white male, twenty-five or twenty-six years old, five seven, thin build, with short, curly blonde hair, wearing black rimmed glasses.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6k\">Admitted into evidence at the suppression hearing was a copy of the report written by Officer Schaeffer on February 15, 1981, which contained these descriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">At the request of a friend of the family, Officer Hamel of the Baltimore County Police Department became involved, while off duty, in investigation into the disappearance of Deborah Napieralski. He talked to Mrs. Hurdel by telephone on February 17, 1981. He testified as to the description given to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">\u201cA. She said one of the subjects had dirty blond hair and a mustache, with the hair parted in the middle and further back, in his twenties, approximately between twenty-four and twenty-five years. The second subject had curly tight dirty blonde hair with black rimmed glasses rounded at the bottom with thick frames, and looked goofy, in her words, and had real crooked teeth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>\u201cQ. Okay, did she indicate what race these people were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\">\u201cA. Both were white males.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Introduced as evidence were his notes of the telephone conversation. As to one individual the notes state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">\u201cDirty blonde curly hair</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">Thick blk rim glasses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">Lt. colored pants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">Clean shaven [-] 20\u2019s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">Looked crazy &amp; goofy [-] crooked teeth\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">As to the other individual the notes reflect:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-12\">\u201cParted in middle dirty blond</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXj2\">Feathered back</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuU\">5.8/5 \u2014 9 [-] Thin \u2014 20\u2019s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWh\">Mustache no beard\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">Officer Hamel submitted a written report of his telephone conversation, admitted into evidence, in which the descriptions appear as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-14\">\u201cHurdel described subject # 1 as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-15\">\u201cA white male with dirty blonde hair which was parted in the middle and feathered back. Also a light mustache. 5'07\" to 5'08\" very thin approx 24 to 25 yrs. No further description.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-16\">\u201cSubject # 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-17\">\u201cA white male with dirty blonde hair which was a tight curie [sic] wearing glasses.. Shorter than the first subject. Thin build. Goofy looking approx 22 yr of age.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-18\">On February 18 Officer Hamel spoke with Hurdel at her home. He again had her describe the two men. His notes, which were admitted into evidence, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-19\">\u201cSubject # 1: Dirty blonde hair &amp; mustache parted in middle feathered back 5-07 to 5-8 very thin approx 24-25 yrs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-20\"><em>\u201c# </em>2: Curly tight dirty blonde hair black rim rounded at bottom thick frame. Looked goofy. Approx 23 yrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>old thin build shorter than first subject light tan cordory [sic] pants real crooked teeth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">On February 19 Officer Hamel and Officer Collins showed Hurdel a photograph of Ronnie Alder. It was a single photo, not in an array. Officer Hamel testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">\u201cQ. Okay, and was any identification made of that photo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">\"A. Debbie Hurdel said that the subject looked similar to the one that she had seen that evening, but she wasn\u2019t positive it was the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">\"Q. Did she indicate any discrepancies with that photo and the person she had seen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">\u201cA. The hair was different, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Officer O\u2019Brian, assigned to the plain clothes street crimes unit at the Woodlawn Station of the Baltimore County Police, interviewed Mrs. Hurdel on February 18 and again on February 22. On the latter occasion he visited the Hurdel residence to notify her of the discovery of Napieralski\u2019s body. He took a written statement from Mrs. Hurdel at that time which statement was admitted into evidence. The descriptions contained in it are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">\u201c# 1 \u2014 W/m, tall, thin, about 5/10-6/00, blondish hair with some brown, style back, about collar length, 23/24 yrs., slight acne below sideburns &amp; lower jaw, I\u2019m pretty sure he had a mustache.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">\u201c# 2 \u2014 W/m, 5/08, 23/24 yrs., thin, no mustache, curly blondish hair, wide nose, glasses, poss. wire frame, (not sure), he acted weird. Poss. wearing an unk [sic] nylon quilted type jacket.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">After Napieralski\u2019s body was found in a corn field near Columbia in Howard County, the investigation was turned over to Detective Richard Witte of the Howard County Police Department. He testified as to the description she supplied of the two individuals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-14\">\u201cShe described the driver of this vehicle as a white male with a dirty blond mustache, hair parted in the middle, the haircut was like collar length, approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>twenty-four years old, six foot tall, thin build, and she described the passenger that was in the vehicle as a white male about twenty-four years old, five foot eight, medium build, possibly wearing a long-sleeved insulated vest, which was dark in color, wearing glasses, which were possibly brown or wire-framed, that he possibly had crooked front teeth, that he had dirty, curly hair, and he was clean-shaven.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Detective Witte\u2019s original notes as to this interview were introduced into evidence and are consistent with his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">On February 25, 1981, the Howard County Police acquired the services of Detective Rolf J. Wysock, a composite sketch artist with the Delaware State Police. He met with Hurdel on that day for the purpose of preparing a composite sketch of the two individuals. Prior to preparing the sketch Wysock took a description from Hurdel which was incorporated into his \u201ccomposite sketch report.\u201d It shows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">Upon completion of the sketches she was asked to give a rating as to accuracy. As to the first drawing, later identified as Simkus, the officer testified that \u201cshe gave it between an eight and a half to a nine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">Wysock testified as to Hurdel\u2019s description of the second individual (McCoy):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>\u201cThe second subject as a white male between the ages of twenty-two to twenty-six; five feet eight inches; medium build; light brown hair, below the ears; complexion, pale; she does not recall seeing any scars, marks or deformities; eyes, light; beard or mustache, clean-shaven; outstanding features would be curly hair.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">As to his sketch of that individual Wysock testified that he \u201casked her to rate it on a scale from one through ten, and she gave it between a nine and a half and a ten.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">On February 27 Hurdel made a photographic identification of Simkus as the driver of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">On March 3 Hurdel was shown an array of seven photographs including one taken two years before of McCoy. The transcript relative to Detective Witte\u2019s testimony on that subject reflects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">\u201cQ. Was Miss Hurdel able to make an identification from that array that you showed her March third, 1981?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">\u201cA. She did not identify Mr. McCoy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">\u201cQ. Did she make any positive identification of anyone involved in the array?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">\u201cA. No positive identification, no, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">\u201cQ. What, if any, identification did she make?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">\u201cA. She just said that the photograph of the first individual in the array looked similar to one of the two individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-13\">\u201cQ. And was that a subject involved as a suspect to this investigation at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-14\">\u201cA. No, ma\u2019am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-15\">Mrs. Hurdel was hypnotized by Dr. Daniel Stern, a Baltimore clinical psychologist, after she was unable to identify photographs in the array. The proceedings were recorded on videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">Motions to suppress any in-court identification by Mrs. Hurdel and the testimony of Mrs. Hurdel in Simkus\u2019 and McCoy\u2019s cases were heard simultaneously. We have referred in <em>Simkus, </em>296 Md. at 722-24, 464 A.2d at 1058-59, to the trial judge\u2019s discussion of <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>391 A.2d 364 (1978), and its requirement that the standard enunciated in <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir. 1923), be applied to hypnotically enhanced testimony; his discussion of <em>State v. Mack, </em>292 N.W.2d 764, 769-70 (Minn. 1980), and his mention of <em>State v. Hurd, </em>173 N.J.Super. 333, 414 A.2d 291 (1980). <em>Hurd </em>was affirmed in <em>State v. Hurd, </em>86 N.J. 525, 432 A.2d 86 (1981), but a short time before the trial judge\u2019s opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In his opinion Judge Fischer referred to each of the descriptions provided by Mrs. Hurdel which we have previously discussed, the composite sketches, and the failure of Mrs. Hurdel on March 3 to select the two-year old photograph of McCoy from the array. It must be^remembered, of course, that at the time of the writing of his opinion Judge Fischer did not have available to him our opinion in <em>Collins, </em>296 Md. 670, 464 A.2d 1028, which was not filed until about two years later. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">\u201cThis Court, however, does not believe that it necessarily follows, in light of the factual situation existing in this case, that Miss Hurdel\u2019s testimony must be excluded from the trial. It is clear to the Court that any evidence obtained through the use of hypnosis must be excluded. However, Miss Hurdel- gave numerous statements prior to the hypnotic session and her recollection of the events given prior to the hypnosis is well documented. In view of this, the Court finds that she should be permitted to testify as to only those matters related by her in statements prior to the hypnosis and not to new information gained through hypnosis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">He then took up the issue of \u201cwhether or not the testimony of the State\u2019s witness, Debra Hurdel, [was] admissible in light of the concern of the defense that their right of cross-examination [had] been impaired by the hypnosis.\u201d He compared the facts with <em>Mack, </em>292 N.W.2d at 769-70, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">\u201cIn the case before this Court the hypnotic subject, Debra Hurdel, had significant independent recall that was verified and preserved by the five interviews and reports with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the police. In addition, she had a session with a police artist for the purpose of compiling composite drawings and two photo identification sessions, all prior to the hypnotic session. Further, proper safeguards were imposed on the hypnotic session which was conducted by a qualified clinical psychologist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Judge Fischer concluded, after discussion of <em>Hurd, </em>173 N.J.Super. 333, 414 A.2d 291, and other material:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>review of the content of the witness interviews and witness\u2019s statements prior to the hypnosis and the recorded hypnosis session shows that there is no material deviation. The hypnosis session added scant information with no discernable value. The Court finds that the witness\u2019s statements, police reports and composite drawings are sufficient to determine a recollection independent from the hypnosis, and, in any event, the State met its burden of clear and convincing evidence that the hypnotic session was not unnecessarily suggestive. It is the opinion of this Court that the State would be severely handicapped if Debra Hurdel could not testify that she was with the victim, Deborah Ann Napieralski, in the accompaniment of the defendants on the night of the victim\u2019s disappearance. The testimony of the witness, Debra Hurdel, will however be confined to testimony, not hypnotically induced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In <em>Watson v. State, </em>282 Md. 73, 382 A.2d 574, <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 908, 98 S.Ct. 3100, 57 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1978), we quoted a trial judge\u2019s statement to the effect that he did not \u201cbelieve the sequence of events as described to [him] by the defendant in th[at] case\u201d relative to the administration of a polygraph test. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">\u201cAs Chief Judge Brune observed for the Court in <em>McDowell v. State, </em>231 Md. 205, 211, 189 A.2d 611 (1963), \u2018The credibility of witnesses is primarily for the determination of the trier of facts. <em>McKenzie v. State, </em>230 Md. 513, 514, 187 A.2d 885 [(1963)].\u2019 <em>Accord, Cunningham v. State, </em>247 Md. 404, 417, 231 A.2d 501 (1967), <em>cert. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>390 U.S. 908 [, 88 S.Ct. 832, 19 L.Ed.2d 877] (1968). Under Rule 886 'the judgment of the lower court will not be set aside on the evidence unless clearly erroneous____\u2019 \u201d 282 Md. at 78, 382 A.2d at 577.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">We find that standard applicable here to the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the evidence relative to Mrs. Hurdel\u2019s prehypnotic identification of McCoy. Although he made no comment relative to the similarity between the actual photograph of McCoy, taken immediately after his arrest in this case, and the composite picture of McCoy, to which Mrs. Hurdel assigned a higher degree of accuracy than the one of Simkus, the similarity is striking.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">McCoy relies upon <em>Metscher, </em>297 Md. 368, 464 A.2d 1052. We reversed the conviction in that case saying, \u201cIn this case we have no demonstration that the testimony is in accordance with statements made prior to hypnosis.\u201d 297 Md. at 374, 464 A.2d at 1055. The cases are factually distinguishable. It does not appear in <em>Metscher </em>that the victim ever provided the type of detailed description of her assailant that Mrs. Hurdel here provided on a number of occasions. In this case the trial judge specified that Mrs. Hurdel\u2019s evidence was to be restricted to that which she observed prior to hypnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">We observe that the only difference between this case and <em>Simkus </em>is that in <em>Simkus </em>Mrs. Hurdel did prior to hypnosis identify a photograph of Simkus while here she did not identify one of McCoy when given the opportunity. This case is distinguishable from a case such as <em>Collins, </em>296 Md. 670, 464 A.2d 1028, where at the first trial a witness testified that he was not in the victim\u2019s car at the time of the shooting, but after hypnosis was able to recall that he was actually in the car at the time of the shooting. In other words, here we do not have other facts coming to the surface subsequent to the hypnosis. We think there was an adequate base for the trial judge to conclude, as we believe he did conclude, that the identification of McCoy by Mrs. Hurdel was, to use the words of <em>Collins, </em>296 Md. at 702, 464 A.2d at 1044, \u201cin accord with statements which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>clearly can be demonstrated [s]he made prior to hypnosis.\u201d Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\">.
