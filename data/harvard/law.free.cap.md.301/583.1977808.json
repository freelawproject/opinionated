ALBERT MENCHINE, Associate Judge of the Court of Special Appeals (retired), Specially Assigned.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b627-4\">COUCH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In this appeal we are principally concerned with whether the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County erred in overruling appellant\u2019s demurrer to appellee\u2019s Bill of Complaint for Declaratory Judgment. We conclude that it did and thus reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The appellee, Time-Out Family Amusement Centers, Inc. (Time-Out), owns and operates family amusement centers in various Maryland locations. In doing so it derives funds from amounts charged for the use of coin operated games and amusement devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">By sections 402 through 411 of Article 81, Annotated Code of Maryland, entitled \u201cAdmissions and Amusement Tax,\u201d the General Assembly has provided a comprehensive scheme, should any county so resolve, for the levy and collection of taxes on the admission to certain specified places where performances are furnished (cabaret); for the use of sporting or recreational facilities or equipment; and for games of entertainment. The maximum rate is spelled out in \u00a7 403. Section 404 requires that any such tax levied is to be collected by the Comptroller of the State. Section 405 requires anyone subject to the tax to make a return to the Comptroller. What gives rise to the present controversy is \u00a7 406, which provides for certain exemptions, to be discussed later. Section 407A provides the mechanism for assessment of taxes due and for relief to the taxpayer in the form of revision of the assessment, refund application, formal hearing before the Comptroller, and appeal to the Maryland Tax Court. The remaining sections are not pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Time-Out, aggrieved by its assessment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a declaratory judgment action (later amended) against the Comptroller, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, seeking to have the court declare Section 406 and one of the Comptroller\u2019s implementing regulations, COMAR 03.01.01.01, unconstitutional as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The Bill also sought a declaration that the statute and regulations violated the provisions of Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights regarding uniformity of taxation; we understand this contention to have been abandoned and thus do not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The appellant demurred to the Amended Bill, specifically raising the failure of appellee to \u201cexhaust all statutory procedures provided by law for administrative and judicial review of admissions and amusement tax <em>assessments.. ,fl\u201d </em>The court passed an order, after hearing counsel and considering memoranda, by which the demurrer was overruled and dismissed; no reason therefor was given in the order, nor was the hearing transcribed, and we are thus unable to discern from the record the court\u2019s reasoning. In any event, the appellant duly answered the Bill and subsequently moved for a summary judgment; this was denied and the matter proceeded to hearing on the merits. The trial judge ultimately rendered a written declaration which essentially held that exemption sub-sections 406(3), (5), and (6) of Article 81 were unconstitutional. It was further found that these exemption sub-sections were to be severed from \u201cthe rest of the Admissions and Amusement tax law in Article 81, Section 402 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>Finally, the court declared \u201cthe regulation in COMAR 03.01.01.01 allowing a particular class of persons charging admissions to pay the tax on a \u2018tax includ\u00e9d\u2019 basis is unconstitutional as it is in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Thereafter, the appellant appealed and a cross-appeal was noted by Time-Out. We granted certiorari before consideration by the Court of Special Appeals in order to determine questions of public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The Comptroller\u2019s brief presents the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai2\">\u201cI. Should the Circuit Court have dismissed the declaratory judgment action brought to challenge a taxation statute for which the General Assembly has provided a specific statutory remedy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">II. Did the Circuit Court, in finding certain exemptions to the Admissions and Amusement Tax Act to be unconstitutional, ignore the well-established principle of avoidance of unnecessary constitutional adjudications?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">III. Do the exemptions to the Admissions and Amusement Tax Act set forth in \u00a7 406(3), (5) and (6) of Article 81 of the Maryland Annotated Code violate the Equal Protection Clause or Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">Did the Circuit Court incorrectly place the burden on the State to defend the classifications contrary to the well-established standard set forth by the Supreme Court and the Maryland Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">IV. Does COMAR 03.01.01.01 which permits certain vendors which charge admission to a place to operate on a \u201ctax included basis\u201d, violate the Equal Protection Clause or Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Time-Out raises two issues by its cross-appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">\u201cI. Did the Circuit Court, having found \u00a7 406(3), (5), and (6) and COMAR 03.01.01.01 to be unconstitutional, correctly sever those provisions from the remainder of the Admissions and Amusement Tax Act and regulations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-12\">II. Did the Circuit Court, having found portions of \u00a7 406 to be unconstitutional, correctly sever the allegedly unconstitutional portions and uphold the remaining por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>tion of \u00a7 406 and the Admissions and Amusement Tax Act?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The Comptroller\u2019s first issue addresses the trial court\u2019s denial of its demurrer to Time-Out\u2019s declaration. The Comptroller may properly argue against that ruling on appeal. Former Rule 345(d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; <em>Inter-City Co. v. Baltimore County, </em>218 Md. 80, 85, 145 A.2d 263, 265 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In the view we take as to the Comptroller\u2019s first issue we need not consider his remaining issues nor those raised by Time-Out; this is so because we hold that the trial court erred in overruling the Comptroller\u2019s demurrer. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation v. Clark, </em>281 Md. 385, 403-04, 380 A.2d 28, 39 (1977) [footnotes omitted], Judge Orth wrote for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">\u201cWe have indicated, <em>supra, </em>that when an administrative remedy is provided by statute, relief provided under those statutory provisions must be exhausted before a litigant may resort to the courts. That is, such a remedy is exclusive, and the administrative body must not be by-passed by pursuing other remedies. <em>Du Bois v. City of College Park, supra </em>[280 Md. 525, 533, 375 A.2d 1098, 1104 (1977)], and cases therein cited. However, \u2018[t]here are few absolutes in the law, and the rule that an administrative remedy must be exhausted before recourse is had to the courts is not one of them.\u2019 <em>Poe v. Baltimore City, </em>241 Md. 303, 308, 216 A.2d 707 (1966). There are general statements in past opinions of this Court, which taken apart from the actual decisions involved, appear to support the claim that even though there be an adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>trative remedy, a court of equity may intervene and act when a constitutional question is involved. <em>See Schneider v. Pullen, </em>198 Md. 64, 68, 81 A.2d 226 (1951); <em>Kracke v. Weinberg, </em>197 Md. 339, 343, 79 A.2d 387 (1951). The law on the matter was made clear in <em>Poe. </em>It declared that where there is full opportunity for a property owner to protest an assessment to administrative agencies and adequate provisions for judicial review of the agencies\u2019 action, a court shall not take jurisdiction unless the administrative remedies have been exhausted. This is so even though a constitutional issue has been raised, when that issue goes to the application of a general statute to a particular situation, as contrasted with a constitutional attack upon the validity of a general enactment as a whole, which is reviewable in any event. <em>Id. </em>at 308-309 [216 A.2d 707]. The <em>Poe </em>rule was fully in accord with prior decisions of this Court, and has since been affirmed and consistently applied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Reaffirming this rule in <em>Harbor Island Marina v. Calvert County, </em>286 Md. 303, 308, 407 A.2d 738, 741 (1979), Judge Digges said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">\u201cIn explaining our reasons, we initially recognize that when an administrative remedy is statutorily directed, the nature of the relief specified by the enactment must ordinarily be utilized as a prerequisite to court action. <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. v. Wash. Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 594-95, 386 A.2d 1216, 1222 (1978); <em>State Dep\u2019t of A. &amp; Tax. v. Clark, </em>281 Md. 385, 403, 380 A.2d 28, 39 (1977). However, as we pointed out in <em>Clark, \u2018 </em>\u201c[t]here are few absolutes in the law, and the rule that an administrative remedy must be exhausted before recourse is had to the courts is not one of them.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>(quoting from <em>Poe v. Baltimore City, </em>241 Md. 303, 308, 216 A.2d 707, 709 (1966)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">s[s s\u00a1s s*s s*s s*s s*s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">Although there is language in <em>Soley v. St. Comm\u2019n on Human Rel., </em>277 Md. 521, 527-28, 356 A.2d 254, 258 (1976) that arguably could be said to indicate otherwise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>we here explain that the \u2018constitutional exception\u2019 to which we have just alluded permits a judicial determination without administrative exhaustion when there is a direct attack upon the power or authority (including whether it was validly enacted) of the legislative body to adopt the legislation from which relief is sought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Thus it is apparent that to come within the \u201cconstitutional attack\u201d exception to the general rule concerning the exhaustion of administrative remedies, the attack must be made to the constitutionality of the statute as a whole and not merely as to how the statute has been applied. In our view the constitutional attack here was not to the statute as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Although Time-Out originally claimed to attack the exemption statute in its entirety, it is clear to us that its real protest focused upon the statutory exemptions granted to recreational businesses,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and not upon the exemptions for non-profit and charity institutions which are also contained in \u00a7 406. At trial, Time-Out conceded it was not attacking the non-profit and charity exemptions. Thus, we believe Time-Out was not attacking the General Assembly\u2019s legislative power to enact exemptions to a general taxation scheme. It merely attacked certain exemptions granted to businesses similar to its own. Absent an attack upon the legislative power, Time-Out must exhaust its administrative remedies (pursuant to \u00a7 407) before seeking a judicial determination. <em>Harbor Island Marina, supra, </em>286 Md. at 308, 407 A.2d at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Time-Out next attacks CO MAR 03.01.01.01, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201cLiability for the tax exists on every person, firm, or corporation deriving gross receipts from the amounts charged for admissions, etc., as defined in the Act. These persons, firms, or corporations may, however, charge and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>collect from the purchaser of any of these admissions the amount of the tax imposed on the gross receipts derived from these admissions as part of the purchase price charged for the admissions. If the tax is collected by any person, firm, or corporation, the tax imposed on the gross receipts shall be separately stated or the words, \u2018tax included,\u2019 shall be stated on any of these admissions as to the amount of tax paid by the purchaser on any of these admissions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Once again Time-Out relies upon the \u201cconstitutional attack\u201d exception to the administrative remedies doctrine. TimeOut claims a violation of its right to equal protection based upon the Comptroller\u2019s decision to allow some businesses to use the \u201ctax included\u201d option while denying Time-Out that economic advantage. Time-Out\u2019s Bill of Complaint alleges that the Comptroller construed the regulation \u201cto allow one class of persons to pass on the tax while prohibiting another class of persons from passing on the tax____\u201d Thus TimeOut disagrees with the Comptroller\u2019s interpretation of the regulation. In reality what Time-Out attacks, then, is the application of the regulation to itself, and when the attack is upon the application of a regulation to a particular situation, administrative remedies must be exhausted first.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation v. Clark, supra, </em>281 Md. at 404, 380 A.2d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Finally, Time-Out maintains that the statutory administrative remedy does not provide it with an adequate remedy since neither the Comptroller nor the Maryland Tax Court can decide constitutional issues. Time-Out\u2019s argument is without merit. <em>See Apostol, supra, </em>288 Md. 667, 421 A.2d 582 (1980) and <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>282 Md. 641, 387 A.2d 260 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Thus this case does not present a matter which falls within the exception to the general rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY WITH DIRECTION TO DISMISS THE BILL OF COMPLAINT. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-5\">. Time-Out makes no claim for refund, however. See <em>Apostol v.
