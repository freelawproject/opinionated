Still was a nurse\u2019s aide at the Heritage Hall South Nursing Home in Agawam when she was fired for violating a nursing home policy by cursing a splenetic patient who had insulted her. She filed a claim for unemployment compensation benefits with the Department of Employment and Training (DET). After a hearing, a DET review examiner determined that she was disqualified from receiving any benefits because, the review examiner concluded, her conduct, while not \u201cdeliberate,\u201d nonetheless constituted a \u201cknowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy of the employer.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The DET board of review adopted the review examiner\u2019s findings and conclusion denying Still benefits as its final decision. A judge of the Springfield District Court affirmed the board\u2019s decision on Still\u2019s action for review pursuant to G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The parties propound differing interpretations of the statutory words \u201cknowing violation,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which is the sole issue in controversy. Still contends that an employee cannot be deemed in \u201cknowing violation\u201d of an employer\u2019s rule or policy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> unless the offending conduct is found to have been inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>tional, i.e., the employee not only must be aware of the existence of the rule or policy but must also be aware at the time she acted that she was violating it. DET submits that the employee\u2019s intent is irrelevant; all that is necessary for disqualification is, as the review examiner found here, that the employee had been informed of the existence of the policy and that its violation could result in discharge. We adopt Still\u2019s construction of \u00a7 25(e) (2) and reverse the decision of the District Court judge upholding the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The review examiner committed error of law, see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7) (c); G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42, because, on the facts as found and under applicable legal principles, Still was not, when she uttered the offending words, sufficiently aware of her act or of its culpable character to be considered in \u201cknowing violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The pertinent facts, based upon the review examiner\u2019s findings and uncontroverted testimony credited by the review examiner, are not in dispute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Still, an African-American woman, was employed as a senior nurse\u2019s aide at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Agawam nursing home from January, 1989, to January 12, 1993. The nursing home\u2019s employee handbook, a copy of which Still was given at the time of employment, set forth the facility\u2019s patient care policies and the rules for employee conduct. The handbook stressed that patients were \u201cat all times [to] be treated with consideration [and] respect\u201d so as to allow them \u201cto retain their dignity and self-respect.\u201d Patients were to be free from \u201cmental and physical abuse\u201d (neither of which term was defined). Employees were warned that \u201cnegligence and inconsiderate treatment\u201d of patients \u201cmay result in . . . termination\u201d; while \u201crude, discourteous or uncivil behavior\u201d or \u201cfighting\u201d with anyone at the facility \u201cmay result in disciplinary action and/or termination.\u201d Still received early in-house instruction and education regarding these rules and avoidance of their violation (including sessions on \u201cHow to handle a combative patient\u201d and \u201cDealing with the demanding resident\u201d). She was aware that employees had been discharged for unspecified \u201cpatient abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Prior to her discharge on January 12, 1993, Still had enjoyed an unblemished record of service, and no disciplinary actions or warnings had ever been lodged against her. Her problems began on the morning of January 9, 1993, while she was working a double shift because the facility was short staifed. One of the residents she was caring for was an irascible elderly man who regularly uttered abusive, racially offensive remarks. That morning the patient made particularly rude remarks to Still. She had earlier been instructed \u201cjust to walk away if he got to her.\u201d Still was so upset by the choleric comments uttered on January 9, 1993, that she arranged to be relieved from working with the fractious resident at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Later that day, however, well into her tenth straight hour of work, Still had to attend to the roommate of the snappish resident. While she was doing so behind a partially drawn curtain, the resident called her \u201ca fat lazy black bitch.\u201d Instead of ignoring the comment, Still was, the review exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>iner found, immediately \u201cprovoked\u201d into a loud \u201coutburst,\u201d consisting of the words \u201cmother fucker.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She continued caring for the roommate without further comment. Still\u2019s outburst was reported by a fellow employee to her employer, who investigated the incident (without confronting Still) and determined that Still had verbally abused the patient \u201cafter being provoked.\u201d She was discharged as of January 12, 1993, for \u201cswearing at a resident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The review examiner found that the employer\u2019s policy against \u201cpatient abuse\u201d had, to Still\u2019s knowledge, been uniformly enforced by terminating all employees \u201cinvolved\u201d in such conduct. (No factual details were presented as to the nature of the previously punished \u201cabuse\u201d or of the \u201cinvolvement\u201d of the penalized employees.) The review examiner accepted Still\u2019s testimony that her outburst \u201cwas not done with forethought.\u201d Consequently, he concluded that it could \u201cnot be considered to have been deliberate.\u201d Further, he agreed (as did the employer) that Still\u2019s reaction \u201cwas provoked by the patient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Nonetheless, the review examiner determined that by her conduct Still had \u201cknowingly violated\u201d the employer\u2019s reasonable and uniformly enforced rule. He particularly emphasized as the basis for his determination the fact that Still \u201cknew of the rule or policy by having been issued a copy of them [j/c] and having been instructed regarding them and avoidance of violations thereof.\u201d In so concluding, the review examiner acquiesced in the employer\u2019s position that, if it is found that an employee with the prior knowledge and information attributable to Still violates a patient\u2019s rights, the employee is to be penalized with maximum severity even if the conduct constituting the violation was \u201can involuntary act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>We agree with Still that the 1992 amendment to \u00a7 25(e) (2) was not intended to deny benefits in such a situation. Prior to the amendment, the only ground for disqualification from receiving unemployment compensation benefits (other than by voluntary leave or on account of incompetence) was for \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest.\u201d Several paramount principles emerge from the authorities that have applied this provision. First, it is construed in light of \u201c[t]he purpose of unemployment compensation ... to provide compensation for those who are thrown out of work through no fault of their own.\u201d <em>Leone </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>397 Mass. 728, 733 (1986). Second, \u201cthe critical issue in determining whether disqualification [from receiving unemployment benefits] is warranted is the claimant\u2019s state of mind in performing the acts that cause his discharge.\u201d <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 94, 97 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Third, in making the critical determination regarding the employee\u2019s state of mind, the review examiner \u201cmust . . . take into account ... the presence of any mitigating factors,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>including disease, such as alcoholism, <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>399 Mass. 737, 740 (1987), as well as stress, \u201cserious personal problems\u201d or other factors \u201ccausing an employee to be unusually fatigued at a particular period.\u201d <em>Wedgewood </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 30, 31-33 (1987). Because of the critical nature of the employee\u2019s state of mind and surrounding mitigating circumstances, mere violation of an employer\u2019s rule does not \u201cautomatically justif[y] a disqualification from unemployment benefits, the general principle being that \u2018[w]hile the violation of a work rule may well justify the discharge of an employee, such a violation does not necessarily amount to misconduct for unemployment compensation purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>387 Mass. 776, 780 n.3 (1982), quoting from <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>376 Mass. 563, 566-567 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Fourth, in the absence of sufficient specific, subsidiary findings on the issue of the claimant\u2019s state of mind, see <em>Lycurgus </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 623, 626-627 (1984); <em>Starks </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 640, 641 (1984); <em>Conloaras </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>394 Mass. 817, 820 (1985), which findings are supported by substantial evidence, <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>375 Mass. 434, 436 (1978), an agency decision disqualifying the claimant \u201ccannot stand.\u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>387 Mass, at 779. Fifth, the employer has the burden of proving all of the facts required to establish disqualification. <em>Cantres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>396 Mass. 226, 231 (1985). Finally, the entire compensation scheme must be \u201cconstrued liberally\u201d in favor of the employee, given the overriding purpose of c. 151A \u201cto lighten the burden which . . . falls on the unemployed worker and his family.\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 74. <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass, at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">No legislative history appears to illumine the General Court\u2019s intent in amending \u00a7 25(e) (2) to make discharge for \u201cknowing violation\u201d of an employment rule or policy a ground for benefit disqualification in addition to discharge for \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful violation\u201d of the employer\u2019s interest. It seems evident that the intent was at least in part to restrict the availability of unemployment compensation benefits in cases of discharges for cause. That intent can be seen in the deletion of the word \u201csolely\u201d from the former phrase modifying \u201cdischarge\u201d \u2014 \u201cattributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of\u2019 the employer\u2019s interest. It may also be reflected in the fact that a \u201cknowing violation\u201d of a work rule must mean something different than \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard\u201d of the employer\u2019s interest. See <em>Chatham Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>362 Mass. 216, 219 (1972) (\u201cevery word of a legislative enactment is to be given force and effect\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 354 (1974) (\u201c[n]o portion of the statutory language may be deemed superfluous\u201d). That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>something would appear to involve, at the very least, a somewhat lesser burden of proof on the employer, since even if \u201cknowing\u201d were construed to be synonymous with \u201cdeliberate\u201d (see Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 1252 [1968] [\u2019\u2019knowing . . . [t]hat [which] is done with . . . deliberateness\u201d]), proof of the new disqualification does not require proof of the additional elements of \u201cwilful disregard\u201d or adverse effect on the employer\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">There is, however, nothing in the 1992 amendments to suggest, and no reason to suppose, that the Legislature intended to change or make inapplicable any of the basic analytical principles set forth above. See <em>Ferullo\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 635, 637 (1954); <em>Cousineau </em>v. <em>Laramee, </em>388 Mass. 859, 862 (1983). This seems particularly true given the continued applicability of the rule of liberal construction, see G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 74, as well as the legislative use of a modifier, \u201cknowing,\u201d that mandates investigation of the employee\u2019s thought process and state of mind at the time of the violative conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>399 Mass, at 739 (\u201c[i]n making findings regarding the employee\u2019s state of mind, the review examiner must \u2018take into account the worker\u2019s knowledge . . . \u2019\u201d). See also <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>375 Mass, at 436; <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>387 Mass, at 781; <em>Starks </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass, at 643; <em>Quintal </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept, of Employment &amp; Training, </em>418 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>855, 860 (1994); <em>Computer Sys. Engr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Qantel Corp., </em>571 F. Supp. 1365, 1373-1377 (D. Mass. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The key question, as Judge Keeton so aptly put it in <em>Qantel, </em>is: Assuming that the term \u201cknowing\u201d refers to a state of mind existing at the time of the relevant activity, \u201cwhat is it that [the employer] must prove that [the employee] knew when acting, in order to establish a \u2018knowing violation?.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1374. Giving the word \u201cknowing,\u201d or its adverbial functional equivalent, \u201cknowingly,\u201d its usual and ordinary meaning, see <em>Naples </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept, of Employment &amp; Training, </em>412 Mass. 631, 633, 634 (1992), we hold that what must be proved at an irreducible minimum is intentionality in the form of (a) consciousness on the part of the employee of what it is she is doing and (b) awareness that she is in the process of violating a rule or policy of the employer. The dictionary definitions and decisional precedent agree in according \u201cknowing\u201d that basic intentional, cognitive content. It cannot apply, as contended by the employer and determined by the review examiner, to conduct that is unintentional by virtue of being involuntary, accidental, or inadvertent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Such is, in fact, the interpretation of \u201cknowing violation\u201d that the Commissioner of DET recognizes. Adopting the construction utilized by the Palmer District Court in the case of a worker who fell asleep at the job because of bad air quality (Carliell vs. Commissioner of the Dept, of Employment &amp; Training, No. 9343 CV0062 [March 31, 1994], relied upon by Still in her brief), the commissioner has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201c[A]n employee must be aware of his conduct in violating a [workplace] rule. . . . [T]he employee\u2019s conduct did not constitute a \u2018knowing\u2019 violation of a workplace rule, for the simple reason that an unconscious person is not in a position to be aware of his actions. . . . [I]n order for a rule violation to be considered \u2018knowing\u2019, the employee must be found to have been \u2018aware that he or she was engaging in the conduct that violated the rule.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Although Still was not unconscious, the review examiner\u2019s findings, based upon Still\u2019s unrebutted testimony, reveal that her conduct \u2014 an \u201coutburst\u201d \u201cprovoked\u201d by a vicious insult and made while fatigued and without \u201cforethought\u201d or delib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>eration \u2014 was in the nature of a spontaneous, emotional reaction rather than culpable conscious action performed with an awareness of its character, circumstances and consequences. Cf. <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass, at 97 (\u201cgood faith lapse in judgment or attention\u201d does not constitute the sort of \u201cintentional disregard of standards of behavior which [the] employer has a right to expect\u201d that results in disqualification); <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>387 Mass, at 779, 781 (use of a vulgar, insulting epithet by employee to his superior might or might not be a disqualifying act of misconduct depending on the employee\u2019s state of mind at the time of the deed, including his \u201cknowledge . . . and the presence of any mitigating factors\u201d); <em>Wedgewood </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 33 (falling asleep might constitute disqualifying misconduct unless brought on by stress and fatigue from personal problems or other mitigating circumstances depriving the act of a voluntary quality).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The examiner\u2019s findings as to the extent of Still\u2019s knowledge (i.e., a prior awareness of the existence of the rules against \u201crudeness\u201d and \u201cmental abuse\u201d toward patients and of the potential consequences of any violation) and the evidence as to the impulsive, provoked character of Still\u2019s response while fatigued and under stress do not support the conclusion that Still should be denied unemployment benefits. In conjunction with the acknowledged mitigating circumstances, the principles enunciated in decisional law, and the \u201cliberal construction\u201d mandate of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 74, they rather establish that Still\u2019s conduct did not, as matter of law, constitute a \u201cknowing violation\u201d of a work rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Requiring the modicum of intent consisting of conscious awareness as an element of a \u201cknowing violation\u201d under \u00a7 25(e) (2) does not create a merging or blurring of the two misconduct situations that disqualify a discharged employee from unemployment benefits. \u201cDeliberate\u201d and \u201cwilful,\u201d while also denoting intentional conduct, have meanings distinct from \u201cknowing\u201d which connote more purposeful and wrongful action or inaction on the part of the employee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>See <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass, at 97. In that respect, the original provision of the statute presents an employer with a more difficult burden of proof; on the other hand, it covers a broader spectrum of employee conduct, not being confined to breaches of an established rule or policy. The distinction, in a nutshell, is between an employee\u2019s willing that a particular act and result take place and her merely being willing that it does take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">We therefore vacate the judgment. A new judgment shall be entered in the Springfield District Court remanding the proceeding to DET for entry of a decision in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-9\">General Laws c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e)(2), as amended by St. 1992, c. 26, \u00a7 19, provides, in pertinent part, that no unemployment benefits shall be paid to any individual if he or she has \u201cleft work ... by discharge shown to the satisfaction of the commissioner [of DET] by substantial and credible evidence to be attributable to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest, or to a knowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy of the employer, provided that such violation is not shown to be as a result of the employee\u2019s incompetence. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-16\">The statute provides no definition of the term \u201cknowing violation,\u201d and no relevant legislative history has been cited by the parties.

She contends that it is unreasonable to fire an employee with a spotless personnel record for a single incident, particularly one resulting from stress and provocation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>However plausible this point might be in a proper context, we do not address it. It was not raised below. See <em>Royal Indent. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>372 Mass. 86, 87-88 (1977); <em>M.H.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Contreras, </em>105 R.I. 523, 536-537 (1969). That meaning may range from connoting \u201can evil state of mind,\u201d <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 264 (1952), or \u201ccallous and intentional violations of the law,\u201d <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr.
