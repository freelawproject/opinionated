We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The undisputed facts are as follows. DiNatale commenced employment as a traffic supervisor for the police department of the city of Cambridge (city) in 1979. On February 1, 1983, DiNatale, while on duty, was struck by a motor vehicle, sustaining injuries to her back, neck, an arm, and a leg. She received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for nine months and returned to work in November, 1983. In November, 1987, DiNatale requested and received a position as a clerical aide in the police department. She requested this indoor position because the weather bothered her back and arm. In 1988, DiNatale requested a reduction in hours so that she could babysit her grandchild and because her injured arm and leg were bothering her. The request was denied. DiNatale resigned from the police department on November 9, 1988. On that date, DiNatale was fifty-two years old and had nine years and one month of creditable service. After ten years of service, she would have been eligible for a superannuation retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">On November 10, 1988, DiNatale submitted a form to CRB, requesting a return of the accumulated total deductions that she had made to the city\u2019s retirement system. In completing the form, she did not seek the advice of an attorney or anyone else, and she did not ask for or receive an explanation of the form. At that time, DiNatale was not receiving workers\u2019 compensation, and she had not submitted any new application for such benefits to the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Industrial Accidents (DIA). DiNatale received her refund from CRB on December 29, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On July 25, 1990, the DIA approved an agreement concerning the city\u2019s liability for compensation resulting from DiNatale\u2019s February 1, 1983, accident which provided DiNatale with a lump sum payment pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48. Under the agreement, the amount of the settlement,' when reduced to weekly payments, was intended to give to DiNatale the amount of \u201cadditional creditable service necessary to qualify for superannuation retirement and health insurance benefits.\u201d CRB was not a party to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">After receiving the settlement, DiNatale attempted to pay back her accumulated total deductions to the city\u2019s retirement system so that she could then file an application for superannuation or disability retirement. On March 29, 1990, CRB issued a decision denying DiNatale\u2019s attempt to pay back her deductions for the purpose of immediately qualifying for retirement benefits. On October 15, 1990, the city solicitor sent a letter to CRB with a copy of the lump sum payment agreement between the DIA and DiNatale stating that, pursuant to the agreement, DiNatale would be eligible for superannuation retirement if she paid back her deductions. CRB then sought an advisory opinion from the Public Employee\u2019s Retirement Administration (PERA) on whether the settlement agreement entitled DiNatale to additional creditable service thereby qualifying her for superannuation retirement. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 21(4); <em>Plymouth County Retirement Assn. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Employee Retirement, </em>410 Mass. 307, 310-312 (1991). PERA\u2019s response was that CRB properly refunded DiNatale\u2019s accumulated total deductions, thus terminating her membership in the retirement system and that, because CRB was not a party to the lump sum agreement, CRB was not bound by its terms. PERA confirmed that CRB acted properly in denying DiNatale\u2019s request to redeposit her refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">DiNatale appealed CRB\u2019s decision to CRAB. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4). CRAB assigned the appeal to the Division of Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ministrative Law Appeals (DALA) and after a hearing, the administrative magistrate issued a decision reversing CRB\u2019s decision and allowing DiNatale to pay back her accumulated total deductions. CRB objected and requested that CRAB review the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">CRAB adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact but rejected her conclusion and recommendation. CRAB ruled that upon terminating her employment with the city and requesting a return of her accumulated total deductions, DiNatale terminated her membership in the city\u2019s retirement system and could only reenter the system by completing two years of active employment as required by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(6) (e). DiNatale appealed CRAB\u2019s decision to the Superior Court. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The Superior Court reversed CRAB\u2019s decision. The court, relying on <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>345 Mass. 692 (1963), held that under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14, DiNatale had retained her membership in the retirement system, despite her withdrawal of her accumulated total deductions, and allowed her to redeposit her deductions and apply for superannuation retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The defendants raise the following arguments on appeal: (1) the Superior Court judge improperly applied G. L. c. 32, \u00a714, which concerns retention of membership in the retirement system while receiving workers\u2019 compensation, rather than G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(6), which concerns reinstatement in the retirement system after membership has terminated; and (2) the workers\u2019 compensation agreement between DiNatale and the DIA is not binding on CRB.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>1. <em>Retention of membership in the retirement system. </em>The Superior Court judge reversed CRAB\u2019s decision on the ground that it was based on an erroneous interpretation of the law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7) (c). The judge correctly ruled that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(6),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> governing an employee\u2019s reinstatement to active service following a leave of absence and re-qualification for retirement benefits, was inapplicable in this case because DiNatale was entitled to retain membership in the retirement system pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(1),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number><em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>345 Mass. 692 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(1), an employee receiving a lump sum settlement for a workers\u2019 compensation claim retains membership in the retirement system and continues to accrue creditable service for the period of time over which the lump sum settlement is allocated. During this period, the employee should not withdraw his or her accumulated total deductions. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(1) <em>(a). </em>See note 4, <em>supra. </em>The question presented by this appeal is whether DiNatale\u2019s premature withdrawal of her total accumulated deductions in violation of the prohibition of \u00a7 14(1) (o) resulted in her loss of membership in the retirement system. This precise issue has been reached before.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>McCormick, supra, </em>a nurse in the Boston hospital department received a compensable injury in the course of her employment. After taking a leave of absence for illness from 1955 to 1958, she failed to return to work, and was terminated. McCormick requested and received repayment of her accumulated retirement deductions in 1958. <em>Id. </em>at 693. In 1960, she received a lump sum workers\u2019 compensation payment from the city of Boston for her 1955 injury. <em>Id. </em>at 696. Her attempt to redeposit her retirement funds with interest was denied by the retirement board. <em>Id. </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The court held that McCormick was entitled to retain her membership rights in the retirement system for two reasons. The first, not applicable to this case, was that McCormick had been entitled to accidental disability retirement benefits at the time her employment was terminated. <em>Id. </em>at 695-696.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The second reason, pertinent to this case, was that at the time McCormick requested the return of her accumulated total deductions, she was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation payments which she later received in a lump sum payment. <em>Id. </em>at 696. The lump sum payment was allocated over a period of time pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(1) (c). \u201cDuring that period [McCormick] retained by virtue of \u00a7 14(1) <em>(a), </em>first paragraph, \u2018all the rights of a member in service\u2019 until a retirement allowance should become effective for her.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The <em>McCormick </em>court further held that c. 32 impliedly prohibits payment of accumulated total deductions to members of retirement systems except under express statutory authorization, and that the board had no such authority. <em>Id. </em>at 696-697. But the refund \u201cwas excusable error, if, as the record strongly indicates, the board had no cause to know of Mrs. McCormick\u2019s potential claim and reasonably thought it was refunding the accumulated deductions to an employee who was resigning and who had no claim to a retirement allowance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 698. The court saw \u201cnothing in the statute which prevents a member from receiving those benefits because of an honest error which can readily and fairly be corrected.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>Bianchi </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Somerville, </em>359 Mass. 642, 650 (1971). The court held that McCormick was entitled to redeposit her accumulated total deductions in order to file for retirement benefits. <em>McCormick, supra </em>at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">DiNatale, like McCormick, was potentially entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits when she filed for the return of her accumulated retirement deductions. Her subsequent lump sum payment entitled her, under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(1) (a), to retain her membership in the retirement system retroactively for the period over which the lump sum was allocated. The amount of the lump sum settlement was calculated so that, when reduced to weekly payments pursuant to G. L. 32, \u00a7 14(1) (c), it would extend over the period necessary to qualify her for superannuation retirement. Thus, as a result of the retroactive application of her workers\u2019 compensation benefits, DiNatale was potentially entitled to a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>tirement allowance when she filed for the return of her accumulated total deductions. Under these circumstances the CRB could not, as it contends, properly refund DiNatale\u2019s pension funds pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The final sentence of \u00a7 14(1) <em>{a), </em>first paragraph, appears to put the burden on the workers\u2019 compensation recipient not to withdraw his or her funds. It provides: \u201cDuring such periods [of entitlement to worker\u2019s compensation payments] . . . no deductions . . . shall be made from payments such members shall receive under the provisions of chapter one hundred and fifty-two <em>nor shall he withdraw his accumulated total deductions </em>therefrom\u201d (emphasis supplied). A similar provision, however, was present in \u00a7 14 (1) (a) at the time McCormick applied for her refund. See St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1; <em>McCormick, supra </em>at 696 n.3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>McCormick </em>recognizes that errors are bound to occur because of the retirement system\u2019s complexity, and implies that a good faith error on the part of either a member or the board should be remedied absent a statutory provision prohibiting it. <em>McCormick, supra </em>at 698-699 &amp; nn.5 &amp; 6. Section 14(1) (a) contains no punitive sanction to be applied to a member who mistakenly withdraws her funds while entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and such a mistake should not result in her forfeiting all the protections afforded by the remainder of the section. This is so especially where \u201can honest error . . . can readily and fairly be corrected\u201d by allowing the member to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>redeposit the funds mistakenly withdrawn, with interest. <em>McCormick, supra </em>at 698. As in <em>McCormick, </em>DiNatale may refund her accumulated total deductions with interest in order to file for retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">2. <em>Lump sum settlement agreement. </em>The Superior Court judge correctly held that CRB is not bound by the \u201copinion\u201d contained in the settlement statement to which it was not a party,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but that CRB is nevertheless \u201cbound by the terms of the settlement awarding DiNatale worker\u2019s compensation benefits allocable to a specified period of time\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(c). Section 14 requires CRB to allocate a lump sum settlement over a statutorily defined period of time and to provide any retirement benefits which accrue as a result of additional creditable service. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>338 Mass. 628, 634 (1959); <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>McCormick, supra </em>at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\">CRB and CRAB also argue that the judge should have deferred to CRAB\u2019s expertise in applying the complex retirement provisions for public employees set forth in G. L. c. 32. Although we agree that a reviewing court should consider an agency\u2019s \u201cexperience in the area and its function in applying the controlling statute,\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 487 (1985), we must ensure that the agency \u201cadhered to statutory requirements\u201d and acted rationally. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>390 Mass. 208, 228 (1983). See <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fedn. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>410 Mass. 890, 892 (1991) (no judicial deference to agency\u2019s disposition of matter where agency commits error of law).
