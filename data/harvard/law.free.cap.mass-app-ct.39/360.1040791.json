L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 37 &amp; 38. Immediately, Figueroa requested a hearing to contest her termination. Approximately one year later, on September 16, 1987, the hearing took place before the police commissioner\u2019s designee. On September 25, 1987, the police commissioner notified Figue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>roa that he had found that her unauthorized absences were in violation of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 37 &amp; 38, and \u201cthat just cause exist [ed] to . . . uphold the termination of [her] employment.\u201d Figueroa appealed to the Civil Service Commission (commission). The police commissioner objected to this proceeding, claiming that the commission lacked jurisdiction to review terminations pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 37 &amp; 38. The commission asserted jurisdiction and found for Figueroa.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The police commissioner then filed an action in the nature of certiorari (G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4) in the Superior Court. That court affirmed the decision of the commission. On appeal, this court concluded that the commission did not have jurisdiction over terminations for unauthorized absences in violation of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 37 &amp; 38, and remanded the case to the proper reviewing authority, the personnel administrator, for immediate review limited to the issues of whether proper notice of absence was given and whether the failure to give proper notice was reasonable. See <em>Police Commr. of Boston </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 470, 473-474 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Thereupon, the personnel administrator found that despite Figueroa\u2019s failure to provide proper notice to the police department, her actions were not unreasonable under the circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Again, the commissioner brought an action in the nature of certiorari in the Superior Court. This time, a Superior Court judge found that the administrator erred, \u2022that his decision was based upon an error of law, and was unsupported by substantial evidence. The judge then ruled that the termination was lawful. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The relevant facts are not disputed by the parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Figueroa was appointed a police officer in March of 1983. In March, 1984, she attained permanent tenured status. Between July 27, 1986, and August 26, 1986, she did not report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>for work. During this period, Figueroa\u2019s work schedule consisted of four days on duty, two days off. She telephoned the department on the first day of each four-day shift (July 27, August 2, August 8, August 14, and August 20) to report her absence for that work period. Department regulations require that an officer report absences on a daily basis. As a result of these absences, the commissioner informed Figueroa, by letter dated August 20, 1986, that her employment had been terminated pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 37 &amp; 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 38, creates a truncated termination procedure for civil service employees who have unauthorized absences of fourteen or more days. A person aggrieved by their termination pursuant to this section may seek review by the personnel administrator. Such review, however, is \u201climited to a determination of whether such person failed to give proper notice of the absence to the appointing authority and whether the failure to give such notice was reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 38, as inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11. See <em>Police Commr. of Boston </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. at 473-474. The question thus presented is whether the Superior Court judge has exceeded the scope of judicial review by reversing the decision of the administrator. See <em>Yerardi\u2019s Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 300 (1985). See also <em>Cambridge Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 587-588 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The Superior Court judge based his reversal of the administrator\u2019s decision on an error of law, which he failed to identify, and upon the lack of substantial evidence. The purpose of an action in the nature of certiorari is \u201cto correct substantial errors of law apparent on the record adversely affecting material rights.\u201d <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct. of Boston, </em>369 Mass. 84, 90 (1975), quoting from <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Committee on Rules of the House of Representatives, </em>331 Mass. 135, 139 (1954). The appropriate standard of review under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, \u201cmust be determined according to \u2018the nature of the action sought to be reviewed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 877 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>(1983), quoting from <em>McSweeney </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Lexington, </em>379 Mass. 794, 800 (1980). See also <em>Mayor of Revere </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 315, 321-322 (1991). Where an agency has been granted broad, discretionary authority \u201cthe standard of review is error of law or abuse of discretion, measured by the \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. for Brockton, supra </em>at 878. But where, as here, the authority of the personnel administrator is limited by narrow and objective criteria, \u201cjudicial review, becomes \u2018an assessment of the strength of the evidence supporting the agency\u2019s action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mayor of Revere </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., supra </em>at 322, quoting from <em>Yerardi\u2019s Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, supra </em>at 300. Under either standard the personnel administrator\u2019s decision must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The Superior Court judge based his reversal of the administrator\u2019s decision, in part, upon an unidentified error of law. Because the judge did not point out the administrator\u2019s error (and because we perceive none on this record), it appears that he may merely have substituted his opinion for that of the administrator; in this instance, the reasonableness of the employee\u2019s conduct in failing to provide proper notice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As Figueroa and the commission assert, such a practice is contrary to the basic principles of judicial review of actions by an administrator or an administrative agency. See <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>University Hosp., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 516, 521 (1971) (\u201c[a] court may not displace an administrative board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo\u201d). A court may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrator entrusted by statute with the responsibility for making the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>determination. <em>Embers of Salisbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 526, 529 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The judge also concluded that the administrator\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree. Substantial evidence is \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>355 Mass. 75, 92 (1968). <em>Mayor of Revere </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 32. A careful review of the record indicates that there was ample evidence before the administrator to support his findings which in turn justified his . conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">As the record reveals no \u201csubstantial error of law\u201d committed by the personnel administrator, and because his decision was supported by substantial evidence, the Superior Court judge erred in vacating the administrator\u2019s decision. The judgment is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of a new judgment reinstating the decision of the personnel administrator.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The personnel administrator appears to have found significant the department\u2019s failure to warn Figueroa that her practice of calling in once for each four-day shift violated the department\u2019s rules and regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The factual background is set out in more extensive detail in the prior opinion of this court. 29 Mass.
