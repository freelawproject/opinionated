See <em>United Truck Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Geltman, </em>406 Mass. 811, 816-817 (1990); <em>Wright </em>v <em>Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children, </em>412 Mass. 469, 476 (1992); <em>Boothby </em>v. <em>Texon, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 468, 487 (1993); <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>418 Mass. 576, 587 (1994); <em>Seren\u00ed </em>v. <em>Star Sportswear Mfg.

In those cases, the courts determined that the necessary element, which for shorthand purposes we may call \u201cmalevolence,\u201d was missing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The case now before us illustrates the harboring of an improper purpose and the use of improper means.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Melo-Tone Vending, Inc., the plaintiff (Melo-Tone), is in the business of installing coin-operated vending machines (e.g., cigarette machines, jukeboxes, games, amusements, and pay telephones) in locations such as barrooms and restaurants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among its accounts was Bentley\u2019s Steak House at 570 Southern Artery, Quincy, an establishment owned by Sherry, Inc. (Sherry), of which the controlling figure was Brian Leonard. On June 22, 1989, Melo-Tone and Sherry entered into a contract under which Melo-Tone was to install at Bentley\u2019s a jukebox and two pool tables, in addition to a cigarette machine already in place. Sherry was to receive a \u201ccommission\u201d of 22.75% on each package of cigarettes sold and 50 % of the net yield from the jukebox and pool tables. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>For a term of eight years (i.e., until June 21, 1997), Melo-Tone would have the \u201csole and exclusive right\u201d to operate vending machines in a \u201cprominent part\u201d of Sherry\u2019s premises. Melo-Tone identified its machines by large green labels, bearing its name and telephone number, that were placed on the fronts of the machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Business between Melo-Tone and Sherry was uneventful until January, 1992, when Sherry was approached on behalf of James Indelicato, proprietor of Park Square Vending (Park Square), with a proposition for making Bentley\u2019s over into a sports bar, for which \u2014 not incidentally \u2014 Park Square\u2019s machines would replace Melo-Tone\u2019s. Sherry\u2019s principal officer, Leonard, gave the word to Park Square\u2019s advance man that there was a small matter of a contract with Melo-Tone, but that did not derail the sports bar project. Late in January or early in February, 1992, Melo-Tone\u2019s principal officer, Jack D. Kerner, got wind that Park Square was going to install an air hockey game at Bentley\u2019s. Kerner called Park Square and mailed to Park Square a copy of his \u201cexclusive\u201d contract with Sherry regarding 570 Southern Artery. Nevertheless, on February 11, 1992, Park Square moved its air hockey game machine onto the Sherry premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">By letter dated February 18, 1992, Melo-Tone\u2019s lawyer informed Park Square that it had exclusive rights to place vending machines at Sherry\u2019s establishment and demanded immediate removal of Park Square\u2019s air hockey machine. Park Square instead added two pool tables and a cigarette machine, as well as some other machines, at Sherry\u2019s place of business. Space was a problem that Park Square solved by furnishing funds to Sherry to move Melo-Tone\u2019s machines out. On March 6, 1992, Melo-Tone brought an action against Indelicato, Sherry, and Leonard. Indelicato provided for Sherry\u2019s and Leonard\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">As to the defendants Sherry and Leonard, the plaintiff Melo-Tone stipulated dismissal well before trial, by a filing made February 1, 1993. There had been a reconciliation: Melo-Tone was back in and Park Square was out. Melo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Tone\u2019s common law claims and c. 93A claims were tried to a jury (the trial judge having elected to have the jury find the facts on the c. 93A question). The jury returned a verdict that the defendant Indelicato had intentionally interfered with the contractual relationship between Melo-Tone and Sherry; that the defendant committed an unfair act or practice in respect of the plaintiff; and that he had done so wilfully. The jury set the damages at $21,000, which the judge, exercising his discretion under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, doubled and to which he added $11,255 in legal fees. Indelicato has appealed, raising multiple issues, among them that intentional interference with contractual relations had not been proved because there was no evidence of an exclusive contract or of improper purpose, i.e., that he was entitled to a directed verdict on the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations and, logically, on the charge of unfair practice as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">1. <em>Intentional interference with contract. </em>To make out a case of intentional interference with a contract, a plaintiff must prove that \u201c(1) he had a contract with a third party; (2) the defendant knowingly induced the third party to break that contract; (3) the defendant\u2019s interference, in addition to being intentional, was improper in motive or means; and (4) the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>G.S. Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Falmouth Marine, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 262, 272 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">As the summary of the facts the jury could have found demonstrates, there was more than sufficient evidence to permit the jury to find that (1) Sherry had entered into an eight-year contract with Melo-Tone to have Melo-Tone operate vending machines on Sherry\u2019s premises; (2) Indelicato had induced Sherry to get vending machines from him and to push Melo-Tone\u2019s out the door; and (3) Melo-Tone lost profits while its machines were excluded from Sherry\u2019s place. Although obliged to concede by the overwhelming evidence that Melo-Tone had entered into a contract with Sherry, Indelicato urges that the contract was not exclusive for the entire Sherry premises but only for that which was a \u201cpromi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>nent part of the premises,\u201d a vague provision which failed to warn Indelicate what portion of Sherry\u2019s premises was off limits to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In context, as the evidence tended to prove, \u201cprominent part of the premises\u201d meant where the public would go in Sherry\u2019s establishment. An exclusive supplier of vending machines would wish to avoid having his equipment relegated to locations where the customers were unlikely to come across them. Indeed, the schedules pertaining to the details of amusement, music, and cigarette machines, which are part of the agreement, modify the phrase \u201cprominent part of said premises,\u201d with the words, \u201caccessible to the public and the customers of the owner.\u201d The judge correctly ruled that the agreement was not ambiguous on this score.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We arrive at the crux of the matter. Indelicate argues that his motives were competitive and financial, not to harm Melo-Tone, and that his conduct was not improper. See <em>United Truck Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Geltman, </em>406 Mass, at 817; <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>418 Mass, at 587. In assessing whether interference with a contract is proper we consider general factors such as \u201cthe nature of the actor\u2019s conduct,\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 767(a); \u201cthe interests of the other with which the actor\u2019s conduct interferes,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 767(c); and \u201cthe social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the actor and the contractual interests of the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 767(e). For competition and for the rough and tumble of the world of commerce, there is tolerance, see <em>W. Oliver Tripp Co. </em>v. <em>American Hoechst Corp., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 753, even though the fallout of that rough and tumble is damage to one of the competitors. See <em>Leigh Furniture &amp; Carpet Co. </em>v. <em>Isom, </em>657 P.2d 293, 307 (Utah 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">It is one thing to lure a customer away from someone with whom it has been doing business by means of a better product, service, or prices but quite another to abet the repudiation of solemn contractual obligations of which the party interfering is well aware. Indelicate not only knew Melo-Tone\u2019s contract with Sherry still had five years to run but received a copy of it. Indelicate went beyond inducing Sherry to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>a breach of contract, itself sufficient to make out the tort<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; he abetted the breach by paying to have his competitor\u2019s machines unlawfully moved from Sherry\u2019s premises and subsidized Sherry\u2019s legal defense when Melo-Tone asserted its legal rights. The means were improper and spoke eloquently to Indelicato\u2019s purpose, although it is enough to prove either improper means <em>or </em>motive. <em>Draghetti </em>v. <em>Chmielewski, </em>416 Mass, at 808, 816 n.11 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">2. <em>Other points raised on appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"><em>a. </em>The motion to dismiss the c. 93A claim was properly denied. Read in its entirety, the amended complaint informs the reader that the unfair business practices claim is predicated on the tortious interference claim. The defendant had notice of the theory of Melo-Tone\u2019s case. See <em>Pederson </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 14, 17 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\"><em>b. </em>There was evidence of a \u201cpurposeful level of culpability,\u201d <em>Wasserman </em>v. <em>Agnastopoulos, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 672, 681 (1986), that supported the jury\u2019s finding that Indelicato had acted wilfully and the judge\u2019s decision to double the damages found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\"><em>c. </em>The damages found by the jury were not speculative. The jury could look to the evidence of Indelicato\u2019s tainted profits as a measure of the profits that Melo-Tone was capable of generating at Sherry\u2019s establishment. See <em>Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crampton, </em>377 Mass. 159, 179 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\"><em>d. </em>A Superior Court judge other than the trial judge imposed sanctions on Indelicato for obdurate noncompliance with postjudgment discovery. Indelicato failed to appear at two scheduled depositions despite court orders so to do. Although the judge who imposed sanctions made no express finding of wilfulness, Melo-Tone\u2019s motion had been pitched on \u201ca pattern of recalcitrance in violation of court orders and the rules of civil procedure.\u201d The judge\u2019s determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>wilfulness was implicit and warranted. Compare <em>Gos </em>v. <em>Brownstein, </em>403 Mass. 252, 256-257 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\n<em>Order allowing motion for sanctions, costs and attorney\u2019s fees affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Compare <em>Draghetti </em>v. <em>Chmielewski, </em>416 Mass. 808, 816-817 (1994), in which the record left the question of \u201cmalevolence\u201d fairly in dispute and was, therefore, sufficient to put the question to a jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\">For an earlier example, see <em>Comey </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>387 Mass. 11, 19-20 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\">We take our facts on the basis of the evidence seen in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.
