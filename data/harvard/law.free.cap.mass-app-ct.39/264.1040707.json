A* judge of that court ordered the entry of a judgment directing the board \u201cto endorse the plaintiff\u2019s plan in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 41, [\u00a7] 81P.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board appeals from that judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The plan submitted for ANR endorsement shows a division of the plaintiff\u2019s land in Dracut into three parcels, 3-57, 3-57-1, and 3-57-2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These parcels have a common border with two parcels in Pelham, New Hampshire, owned by others. Parcels 3-57-1 and 3-57-2 do not have frontage on a way, and the plan contains notations that each is \u201cnot a building lot\u201d and is \u201cto be conveyed to\u201d the owners of the adjacent New Hampshire parcel. For lot 3-57, the plan shows the proposed location of a house with access from a proposed easement across the adjacent New Hampshire parcel. The easement leads to LeBlanc Road (in Pelham, New Hampshire), which becomes Island Pond Road after crossing into Dracut. There it cuts across the western boundary of parcel 3-57, providing about twenty feet of frontage for the parcel in Dracut. Prior to the plaintiff\u2019s submission of the plan to the planning board, the Dracut board of appeals granted the plaintiff a variance from the applicable zoning by-law frontage requirement of 175 feet. The lack of sufficient frontage was cited by the planning board as the basis for its denial of the ANR endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The Superior Court judge determined that the plaintiff\u2019s plan \u201ccannot be considered to be a subdivision plan within the meaning of [G. L. c. 41,] \u00a7 81L,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because parcels 3-57-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>1 and 3-57-2 are not buildable lots and that the plan, therefore, is entitled to an ANR endorsement. The board argues that this d\u00e9termination is erroneous because the plan cannot be so endorsed if no lot depicted has adequate frontage. We conclude that the judge\u2019s decision is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Anyone who desires to record a plan of land in a city or town in which the subdivision control law (G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81K-81GG) is in effect and believes that the plan qualifies for ANR treatment may submit it to the planning board of that city or town pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P. Section 81P provides that an ANR endorsement \u201cshall not be withheld unless such plan shows a subdivision.\u201d For purposes of the subdivision control law, a \u201csubdivision\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81L, as \u201cthe division of a tract of land into two or more lots . . . .\u201d See note 4, <em>supra. </em>A \u201clot\u201d is defined as \u201can area of land in one ownership, with definite boundaries, used, or available for use, as the site of one or more buildings.\u201d G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81L, inserted by St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7. By expressly disavowing, on the face of the plan, any claim of availability of parcels 3-57-1 and 3-57-2 for building purposes, the plaintiff, in effect, submitted a plan of land that, notwithstanding its division into three parcels, did not constitute a subdivision under the subdivision control law because it did not represent a division of the land into two or more \u201clots.\u201d <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Brookline, </em>346 Mass. 278, 283-284 (1963). See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 156 (1983) (\u201cThe court [in Bloom] reasoned that a division of land into two parcels, one of which clearly could not be used for building under the zoning law, was therefore not a division into two \u2018lots\u2019 and, a fortiori, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>a subdivision\u201d). See also Bobrowski, Massachusetts Land Use and Planning Law \u00a7 14.5.4 (1993) (\u201cIn <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Brookline, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court created an exemption for those plans depicting only one \u2018lot\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u201c[T]he public\u2019s right not to be misled by endorsements on recorded plans,\u201d <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, supra, </em>is well protected by the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s plan not only depicts two of its three parcels as landlocked and therefore without frontage but also clearly identifies each of those parcels as \u201cnot a building lot.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 157. \u201cThe indication \u2018Not A Building Lot\u2019 is a customary method of stating the deficiency.\u201d Bobrowski, <em>supra </em>at 582 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Given the limited extent of its function when reviewing a single lot plan, the board\u2019s concern with the adequacy of the frontage of parcel 3-57 is misplaced. \u201cIn acting under \u00a7 8 IP, a planning board\u2019s judgment is confined to determining whether a plan shows a subdivision.\u201d <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Harwich, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 599, 604 (1980). See Eno &amp; Hovey, Real Estate Law \u00a7 24.3 (3d ed. 1995) (\u201cIn exercising its powers under the subdivision control law, a planning board\u2019s first determination must be whether or not a plan presented to it shows a \u2018subdivision\u2019. . . . [I]f a plan does not show a \u2018subdivision\u2019, a board may \u2014 or rather must \u2014 endorse the plan as not requiring subdivision approval, so that it may be recorded\u201d). Had it been presented with a plan that ostensibly depicted a division of land into two or more \u201clots,\u201d each of which had sufficient frontage on a way so as to place the plan outside of the definition of a subdivision under \u00a7 81L, the board properly could have concerned itself with whether the frontage depicted was actual or illusory. <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>376 Mass. 801, 807-808 (1978). See <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Sudbury, </em>406 Mass. 248, 250-251 (1989); <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Milton, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 572, 574-575 (1987). Similarly, if the plaintiff\u2019s plan had depicted a subdivision rather than what is, in effect, a single lot under the subdivision control law, the board could have addressed the adequacy of the frontage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>any lot independent of the variance. <em>Seguin </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Upton, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 374, 375-376 (1992).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We do riot share the board\u2019s concern that an ANR endorsement, of itself, imparts \u201cbuildable lot\u201d status to parcel 3-57. \u201cAn endorsement under \u00a7 81P does not mean that the lots within the endorsed plan are buildable lots.\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Harwich, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 148, 152 (1981). See <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Harwich, supra </em>at 603-604; <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 519, 522 (1993). Any lot depicted on an endorsed plan remains subject to all pertinent regulatory provisions other than the subdivision control law. See <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Sudbury, </em>406 Mass, at 251-252. As contended by the plaintiff, an ANR endorsement may serve merely to permit the plan to be recorded, preliminary to the sale of the unbuildable parcels to the owners of the abutting land. See <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Harwich, supra </em>at 604; G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81X (regulating the recordation of plans of land in municipalities in which the subdivision control law is in force). See also <em>SMI Investors (Delaware), Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Tisbury, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 408, 411 (1984). Moreover, in the circumstances of a single lot plan with frontage on a public way, there is no occasion for concern with the statutory objective of the subdivision control law of \u201cregulating the laying out and construction of ways in subdivisions providing access to the several lots therein . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M, inserted by St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>There is no merit to the board\u2019s contention that the judge failed to exercise independent judgment.

App. Ct. at 375, treats a plan showing a division of land into two parcels, one of which did not meet the frontage requirement of the applicable zoning by-law, as showing a subdivision and thus requiring planning board approval. Apparently, nothing on the submitted plan indicated that the parcels could not be used for building, while in the case before us there are clear statements on the face of the plan that two of the parcels are not buildable. Similarly, in <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Brookline, </em>346 Mass, at 284, the plan in question \u201cshow[ed] that lot B [one of the two parcels depicted] is not an area which .. . can be built on.\u201d The <em>Bloom </em>court also noted that \u201c[i]f the owners had proposed lot B as a lot for building, notwithstanding its deficiencies, the division of their parcel into two lots as shown on the plan would, of course, have been a subdivision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283-284.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
