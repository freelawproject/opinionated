The case began with a claim for personal injuries by Gary DeSousa, described in the first paragraph of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b30-9\">Kass, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AH\">At issue is the enforceability of an indemnification provision in a written agreement for construction services between M. DeMatteo Construction Co. (DeMatteo), a general contractor, and A.C. Dellovade (Dellovade), a subcontractor. DeMatteo hired Dellovade to perform roofing and siding work on a building in Saugus owned by Refuse Energy Systems Company. On December 24, 1990, an ironworker employed by Dellovade, Gary DeSousa, fell after stepping to a lower section of the roof, where he had been making repairs, onto an \u201cimproperly set\u201d metal beam. DeSousa was hurt and brought a tort action against DeMatteo and Wheelabrator Air Pollution Control, Inc., another subcontractor, for negligent maintenance of the work site. DeMatteo, in turn, served a third-party complaint on Dellovade to enforce an indemnification provision (Article IV) contained in its subcontract with Dellovade.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">Dellovade moved for judgment on the pleadings, Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c), 365 Mass. 756 (1974), on the ground that Article IV was \u201cvoid\u201d under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C. DeMatteo opposed the motion and simultaneously requested judgment on the basis of the contract language. By this time, DeMatteo had offered an affidavit and exhibits in support of its position, and we may take its cross motion as having been made under Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1978). A Superior Court judge denied Dellovade\u2019s motion and allowed DeMatteo\u2019s, interpreting the contractual language as valid and enforceable under the statute. A single justice of this court granted Dellovade leave to take an interlocutory appeal under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, and stayed further proceedings in the trial court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C, a general contractor may require indemnification by a subcontractor only in connection with harm \u201ccaused by\u201d the subcontractor, its employees, agents, or subcontractors. <em>Harnois </em>v. <em>Quannapowitt Dev., Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 286, 288-289 (1993) (indemnification clause void because it required the subcontractor to indemnify the general contractor for injuries not necessarily caused by the subcontractor, its employees, agents, or subcontractors).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The disputed language in Article IV of the subject agreement reads, in part, as follows: \u201cThe Subcontractor shall fully indemnify and hold harmless the Contractor and any of its agents and employees from all claims, liabilities, liens, demands, damages, expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, and causes of action for or on account of any injury to persons or damage to property <em>arising out of or in consequence of the performance of the Subcontractor\u2019s work under this Contract. </em>Subcontractor further indemnifies and holds harmless the Contractor from any and all claims . . . which relates [szc] to the <em>performance, </em>quality, acceptability or fitness of the work performed ... by the Subcontractor\u201d (emphasis added). We interpret that language as limiting the subcontractor\u2019s obligation to indemnify to cases in which there is a causal connection between the subcontractor\u2019s work and the injury. The contractual language, therefore, avoids the nullifying effect of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The roofing subcontractor attempts to differentiate the statutory language \u201ccaused by,\u201d from the language \u201carising out of or in consequence of\u2019 used in Article IV of the parties\u2019 subcontract, but there is no meaningful distinction. See, e.g., <em>Speers </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood, Inc., 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 598, 600 (1986); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi &amp; Co., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 79-81 (1989). Dellovade suggests support for its position that the indemnification clause in the DeMatteo contract is void may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>be found in <em>Harnois </em>v. <em>Quannapowitt Dev., Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 286-287 n.l. There, the indemnity clause in the subcontract, held void, used the phrase \u201carising out of or in connection with the work,\u201d language somewhat resembling a parallel clause in the instant case. In <em>Harnois, </em>however, the parallel clause was followed by the words \u201cor by reason of the operations under this contract, whether such liability be the result of the alleged active or passive negligence of the Owner or Contractor, their agents, servants, employees.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It was the latter clause in <em>Harnois </em>that gave to the subcontract the \u201ccome what may\u201d quality that offended the statute. The <em>DeMatteo </em>subcontract clause, in contrast, ties indemnity to \u201cthe performance of the Subcontractor\u2019s work under this Contract\u201d and \u201cthe performance ... of the work performed,\u201d an equivalent of the statutory \u201ccaused by.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">As we observed in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi, supra, </em>and in <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>A.J. Welch Equip. Corp., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 611-612 (1994), the 1986 amendment to \u00a7 29C allowed greater scope to general contractor subcontractor indemnity agreements than an earlier, 1984, version of \u00a7 29C had permitted. That earlier rendering, as appearing in St. 1984, c. 484, \u00a7 43, had declared indemnity clauses in construction contracts which absolved indemnitees from their own negligence to \u201cbe against the public policy . . . void and unenforceable.\u201d The subcontractor also seeks to reintroduce negligence as an integral part of the statutory scheme, a complexity that the Legislature eliminated from \u00a7 29C by the 1985 amendment. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi &amp; Co., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 81-82; <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>A. J. Welch Equip. Corp., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 611-612 (1994). The language of \u00a7 29C no longer requires a finding of neligence in order to trigger indemnity provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b31-6\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 29C, as appearing in St. 1986, c. 557, \u00a7 135, provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny provision for or in connection with a contract for construction . . . which requires a subcontractor to indemnify any party for injury to persons or damage to property not caused by the subcontractor or its employees, agents or subcontractors, shall be void.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
