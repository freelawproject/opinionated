The trust was not only irrevocable, but also gave the agent a beneficial interest in the corpus, which consisted entirely of that real property. A judge of the Superior Court found nothing legally amiss about this transaction, even though the agent was aware that the principal had, prior to the creation of the trust, himself contracted to sell the real property to a third party. After a bench trial, the judge entered judgment for the agent on the principal\u2019s suit to set aside the agent\u2019s conveyance. We conclude that the principal should have prevailed. The agent\u2019s authority to deal with the property had been effectively revoked by the principal\u2019s precedent purchase and sale contract. Reversal is also in order because the transaction violated basic agency principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The relevant facts are not in dispute. On November 27, 1990, eighty-five year old Francis W. Gagnon (Gagnon) and his wife executed durable powers of attorney, each naming their elder daughter, Joan Coombs (Joan), their attorney in fact. There was no immediate need or purpose for the power of attorney. It was executed in recognition of the two principals\u2019 advanced years and general deterioration of health associated with old age. At the time, Gagnon and his wife lived in a house on the property at issue, a 184-acre \u201cfarm property\u201d in Shelburne.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Shelburne property was not a functioning farm and produced no income. Gagnon also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>owned a smaller parcel of real estate in Hillsborough, New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Under the power of attorney, Joan was broadly empowered \u201cto act in and concerning all of my affairs as fully and effectually as I might do if personally present. . . .\u201d Her specific powers included the authority \u201cto sell any of my real estate and to [execute any documents] . . . necessary in order to carry out the proper sale or transfer of real estate,\u201d and \u201cto add property to or withdraw property from any trust of which I am the grantor or beneficiary.\u201d The document did not, however, contain any provision authorizing the agent to acquire interests adverse to those of the principal or to seek or derive personal advantage, profit, or benefit from the agency or from any transactions undertaken pursuant thereto. The instrument was also silent as to any compensation for the attorney in fact. Gagnon did not discuss with Joan the handling of any particular property or financial matter before or at the time he signed the power of attorney. Its execution was simply a precaution in the event Gagnon became unable to attend to his affairs personally.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The document was shortly thereafter recorded in the Franklin County registry of deeds. See G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In February, 1991, Gagnon\u2019s wife had to enter a nursing home. While she was being admitted, Gagnon\u2019s son Frank learned of Joan\u2019s power of attorney for the first time. Following discussions between Gagnon and Frank (who had moved from his trailer into the Shelburne house because his father was now alone), Gagnon decided to revoke the power of attorney he had given to Joan. He did so in a document executed on February 28, 1991, with the assistance of a Greenfield lawyer whom Frank had found for him. He did not, however, send a copy of the revocation to Joan or anyone else, nor did he or anyone else orally advise Joan of the revocation, at least not prior to the activities of Joan that precipi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>tated the instant litigation. The revocation was not recorded in the Franklin County registry of deeds until a year after those events.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In April, 1991, Gagnon was hospitalized, and his wife died soon thereafter. In light of these developments, Joan consulted the lawyer who had drafted the power of attorney, for probate and estate planning advice. The lawyer prepared a so-called \u201cMedicaid Qualifying Trust\u201d that provided Gagnon, as beneficiary, with income for life and divided all of his property at his death among his three children, who were named as trustees. The trust draft (which is not part of the record on appeal) was sent to Gagnon, who had been discharged from the hospital, in May, 1991. Gagnon never responded to the draft, never discussed it with the lawyer or his children, and never signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Following his discharge, Gagnon improved in health and by the fall of 1991 had resumed interest, which he had first manifested in December, 1990, in selling the Shelburne property. During the earlier part of 1991, Gagnon had authorized Joan\u2019s husband, Allyn Coombs (Allyn), a seasoned real estate investor, to investigate the possibility of such a sale. In May, 1991, Allyn had identified one Camille Cosby, whom he had previously helped purchase other land in the area, as a potential buyer. When Cosby offered $600,000 for the property, Gagnon responded that it was worth $1,000,000. Allyn obtained an appraisal establishing a fair market value of $760,000 as of July, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">At that point, Gagnon told Allyn to \u201ctalk to Frank\u201d regarding future negotiations with Cosby as to the Shelburne property. Frank authorized a sale for the price of $750,000. Further negotiations (without Allyn\u2019s involvement) ensued in the fall of 1991. They culminated on December 5, 1991, in the signing by Gagnon and Cosby of a purchase and sale agreement for the Shelburne property at a price of $750,000. Under the agreement, Cosby placed an escrow deposit of $75,000 with Gagnon\u2019s attorney, to be paid to Gagnon and applied to the balance of the purchase price at a closing that the agreement specified would be held on January 21, 1992. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Gagnon promised in the agreement to convey good and clear title and to deliver a warranty deed for the premises at the closing. One week later, on December 12, 1991, Gagnon executed a deed conveying his Hillsborough, New Hampshire, property to Frank.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">At some time after December 12, 1991, but before December 26, 1991, Gagnon told Joan about his having executed the purchase and sale agreement with Cosby. He also revealed to her that he was moving to Hillsborough, New Hampshire, to live with Frank. What ensued was the result of Joan\u2019s learning of these developments. On December 26, 1991, without discussing it with Gagnon, Joan created and executed the \u201cFrancis W. Gagnon Trust,\u201d with a stated corpus of $1,000.00 (although no money was ever actually placed in the trust). She was both the \u201c[d]onor\u201d and the sole trustee of the trust, with Gagnon designated as the \u201c[p] rimary [b]eneficiary.\u201d The trust was made irrevocable, with one exception: Joan reserved to herself as settlor the right at any time to amend or revoke any provision relating to the powers and duties of the trustee and the appointment or removal of additional or successor trustees. Joan expressly empowered herself as trustee to deal with both real and personal trust property \u201cwhether or not personally interested in the exercise of any such power and without approval of any Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">As primary beneficiary, Gagnon was entitled to the net income of the trust for life (although the trust never saw any income, its sole asset being the unproductive Shelburne property). Joan, however, as trustee reserved sole discretion not only as to when such income should be paid, but also whether it should be paid directly to Gagnon or rather \u201capplied\u201d for his benefit. Additionally, Joan as trustee could alone determine what should be deemed income and what should be credited to principal, \u201cnotwithstanding any determination by the Courts.\u201d Any income not paid to Gagnon was to be added to principal of the trust, which at Gagnon\u2019s death was to be divided into equal shares among Joan, Jeanne, and Frank. Gagnon had no right to call upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>principal during his lifetime; rather, Joan as trustee had the \u201csole discretion\u201d to apply so much of the principal for his support, maintenance, and health as she deemed \u201cadvisable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">On December 26, 1991, simultaneously with the creation of the Francis W. Gagnon Trust, Joan conveyed the Shelburne property, purportedly pursuant to the terms of the November 27, 1990, power of attorney, to herself as trustee of that trust. The conveyance was without consideration and by quitclaim deed, recorded in the Franklin County registry the next day. Joan also recorded with the deed an affidavit, which stated that at the time of the execution of the deed she did not have \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the termination of her power of attorney by revocation, death, disability, or incapacity of the principal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">By letter dated December 26, 1991, Joan notified Frank of her actions. She asserted that they had been taken for \u201cthe preservation of our father\u2019s assets and estate\u201d and to make the sale of the Shelburne property \u201ceasier\u201d by eliminating buyer \u201cconcern\u201d about Gagnon\u2019s \u201ccompetence\u201d and \u201cability to fully understand the nature and extent of the transaction.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Joan proposed to make Frank a cotrustee, along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>herself and Jeanne. Frank rejected this offer. Jeanne may have received and accepted a similar offer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In early January, 1992, after he had learned of her conveyance to the trust, Gagnon demanded (through his lawyer) that Joan return the Shelburne property to him. (The attorney\u2019s letter to Joan also informed her that Gagnon had revoked her power of attorney.) When she refused, Gagnon immediately filed the instant action seeking to set aside the conveyance. After a three-day trial in May, 1993, the judge ordered judgment for the defendants upon findings of fact and rulings of law that upheld Joan\u2019s authority under the power of attorney to convey the Shelburne property to the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The judge\u2019s disposition rested upon his conclusion that Joan had neither actual nor constructive notice \u201cthat her authority to act on [Gagnon\u2019s] behalf had been terminated prior to December 26, 1991.\u201d The judge further ruled that Joan\u2019s affidavit denying \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of any revocation of her agency, along with the December 26, 1991, letter to Frank, \u201cprovide [d] conclusive proof that, as of December 26, 1991, [Joan] did not reasonably believe that her power of attorney had been terminated\u201d; and that Gagnon\u2019s execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>of the purchase and sale agreement \u201cwas not an act in derogation of the power of attorney such that [Joan] had constructive notice that her authority to act on Gagnon\u2019s behalf had been revoked prior to the disputed conveyance . . . .\u201d We reverse, because Joan should have realized that her authority to dispose of the Shelburne property had been effectively revoked when she learned Gagnon had contracted to sell it. Even if there was no revocation, however, Joan\u2019s conduct was inconsistent with well-established doctrines of the law of agency that require her to undo the challenged transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">2. <em>Joan\u2019s authority to act regarding the Shelburne property was revoked by Gagnon\u2019s purchase and sale agreement. </em>The judge\u2019s conclusion as to the effect of Gagnon\u2019s purchase and sale agreement on Joan\u2019s authority cannot stand. It is subverted by Joan\u2019s knowledge of that agreement prior to the December 26, 1991, conveyance and her concession that she undertook the trust arrangement in response to learning of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">A principal may manifest his termination of his agent\u2019s authority, either in whole or in part, by conduct that is inconsistent with its continuance. Examples of such implicitly countermanding conduct are \u201cwhere [the principal] retakes possession of goods which he had authorized the agent to sell, or where he sells or disposes of the subject matter or of his interest therein, or voluntarily causes its loss or destruction.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 119 comment b &amp; illustration 4 (1958). See <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>189 Mass. 377, 388-390 (1905) (principal impliedly revoked power of attorney of agent authorized to pursue legal action by commencing action on her own behalf). \u201c[A]ny form of manifestation made known to the [agent] is effective\u201d if, \u201creasonably interpreted, [it] indicates that the principal no longer consents to have the agent act for him . . . .\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 119 comment a.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u201cAn agent is authorized to do, and to do only, what it is reasonable for him to infer that the principal desires him to do in the light of the principal\u2019s manifestations and the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>as [the agent] knows or should know them at the time he acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 33. \u201cWhatever the original agreement or authority may have been,\u201d if the agent \u201cknows facts which should lead him to believe that his authority is restricted or terminated, he has a duty to act only within the limits of the situation as it is currently known to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 33 comment a. The \u201cwill [of the principal] may change .... Whatever it is at any given time, if the agent has reason to know it, his duty is not to act contrary to it. The fact that in changing his mind the principal is violating his contract with the agent does not diminish the agent\u2019s duty of obedience to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a733 comment b. See also <em>id. </em>\u00a7 108(1) &amp; comments b, c, &amp; f.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Finally, an \u201cagent has notice that authority to do an act has terminated or is suspended if he knows, has reason to know, should know, or has been given a notification of the occurrence of an event from which the inference reasonably would be drawn ... by the agent, that the principal does not consent to the act or would not if he knew the facts . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">These objective principles were activated by Joan\u2019s knowledge prior to December 26, 1991, of Gagnon\u2019s December 5, 1991, purchase and sale agreement. Joan was thereby on notice, see <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9(1) &amp; (2), and should have known that (a) Gagnon desired to sell the Shelburne property himself to Cosby no later than January 22, 1992, and (b) Gagnon would not have consented either to losing the opportunity to complete that sale or to any conveyance of the property that would deprive him of all control over the property and the right to immediate enjoyment of the proceeds from its sale. His prompt demand for return of the property and swift litigation upon Joan\u2019s refusal constitute ample evidence of his contemporaneous wishes. Indeed, Joan was not just passively on notice of Gagnon\u2019s desires with respect to the Shelburne property: her trust arrangement was deliberately effected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>frustrate those desires, by preventing the consummation of Gagnon\u2019s purchase and sale contract.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Joan had engaged in a number of real estate transactions over the years with her broker-investor husband, Allyn, and was trustee of a realty trust. She must or should have realized that by conveying title to the Shelburne property from Gagnon to herself as trustee, she was preventing Gagnon from performing his promises under the purchase and sale agreement and thereby exposing him to a suit for specific performance and possibly damages (see infra) \u2014 undesirable consequences that she reasonably should have known Gagnon (and any seller of land under favorable contract) would want to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In these circumstances, Joan must be deemed to have had, prior to her conveyance of the Shelburne property to herself as trustee, constructive (if not actual) notice that Gagnon had effectively terminated her authority with respect to that property. Her affidavit disclaiming \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the termination or revocation of her power of attorney was irrelevant to the issue of constructive notice. The judge\u2019s determination that the affidavit was \u201cconclusive proof\u2019 that Joan remained empowered to convey the Shelburne property was erroneous<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in light of the undisputed facts, as well as applicable agency principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>3. <em>Joan violated the basic fiduciary duties of an agent. </em>Gagnon\u2019s effective revocation of the power of attorney with respect to the Shelburne property is not the only reason for reversal. The power of attorney created (as Joan acknowledges) a traditional principal-agent relationship. That relationship has one supreme characteristic: as his agent, Joan stood in a <em>fiduciary </em>relation to Gagnon with respect to all matters within the scope of the agency. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7 1, 13, 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">a. <em>Joan violated her fiduciary duty of loyalty by impairing Gagnon\u2019s rights with respect to the Shelburne property. </em>Like all fiduciaries, Joan owed Gagnon the duty of utmost good faith and absolute loyalty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The quintessential mandate of that primal fiduciary duty obligated Joan to act, in the absence (as here) of language in the power of attorney to the contrary, <em>solely </em>in and to further Gagnon\u2019s interest, even at the expense of her own interest in matters connected with the agency. See <em>Spritz </em>v. <em>Brockton Sav. Bank, </em>305 Mass. 170, 172 (1940); <em>Jerlyn Yacht Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wayne R. Roman Yacht Brokerage, </em>950 F.2d 60, 66 (1st Cir. 1991); Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7 39, 387, 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Joan\u2019s conveyance of the Shelburne property to herself as trustee of an irrevocable trust would have injured Gagnon\u2019s interests in several respects, were it upheld.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Gagnon was divested of the power to revoke the agency as to the property.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He was prevented from ever regaining title to or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>trol over the property.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He was deprived of enjoyment of the proceeds of the sale for which he had contracted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He was precluded from conveying the property to successors of his choosing through testamentary disposition. See <em>Dolbeare </em>v. <em>Bowser, </em>254 Mass. 57, 61 (1925) (fiduciary should not be concerned, let alone interfere, with succession to property subject to his power). Finally, he was exposed to suit by Cosby and to liability for breach of his purchase and sale agreement, which was specifically enforceable in equity, and of his warranties made therein. See <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>359 Mass. 711, 717, 720 (1971); <em>Yiakas </em>v. <em>Savoy, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 310, 313 (1988). See also <em>Limpus </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 19, 22, 24 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">b. <em>Joan violated her fiduciary duty of loyalty by refusing to honor Gagnon\u2019s request for reconveyance of the Shelburne property. </em>An agency differs from other fiduciary relations in the fact that it is the agent\u2019s duty to obey the will of the principal, to respond to the principal\u2019s wishes, and not to act contrary to the principal\u2019s directions. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7 14, 33, 385. \u201c[I]n no event must [the agent] act contrary to what ... the principal desires him to do,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 33 comment a, even if the principal\u2019s directions amount to a breach of the agency contract. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 118 comment b.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Whether or not Joan\u2019s power to act with respect to the Shelburne property had been effectively terminated when she learned of Gagnon\u2019s purchase and sale agreement, she remained his agent in all other respects subsequent to December 26, 1991. As such, Joan continued to be subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>duty to respond to his wishes. Her refusal to reconvey the Shelburne property upon his request in early January, 1992, or to take steps that were within her power to achieve his expressed desire, plainly violated Joan\u2019s fiduciary duty of obedience to her principal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">c. <em>Joan violated her fiduciary duty of loyalty by failing to inform Gagnon of material facts. </em>An agent\u2019s duty to make full disclosure to the principal of all material facts relevant to the agency is a necessary corollary to the fundamental agency obligations of undivided loyalty and utmost good faith. See <em>Gage </em>v. <em>Boston Natl. Bank, </em>257 Mass. 449, 452 (1926); <em>Spritz </em>v. <em>Brockton Sav. Bank, </em>305 Mass, at 172. As set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 381, \u201can agent is subject to a duty to use reasonable efforts to give his principal information which is relevant to affairs entrusted to him and which, as the agent has notice, the principal would desire to have and which can be communicated without violating a superior duty to a third person.\u201d Whenever facts known to the agent but not to the principal may affect the desires and conduct of the principal, the agent must communicate that information to the principal, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 381 comment a, particularly if the agent is engaging in \u201cany arrangement . . . adverse to the [principal\u2019s] interest.\u201d <em>Spritz </em>v. <em>Brockton Sav. Bank, </em>305 Mass, at 172. See Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 390 comment a. In short, an agent, \u201cmust be \u2018upfront\u2019 with his principal at all times.\u201d <em>Jerlyn Yacht Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wayne R. Roman Yacht Brokerage, </em>950 F.2d at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Joan\u2019s conveyance of the Shelburne property to an irrevocable trust created and controlled by her alone came at a time when she knew of Gagnon\u2019s firm desire to sell the property. Her failure to inform him of her purpose regarding the trust transaction and of its consequences \u2014 most notably, its effective elimination of Gagnon\u2019s ability to control either the property or the proceeds of its sale \u2014 was incompatible with the full and faithful discharge of the disclosure obligation she owed Gagnon. Her breach of duty in this respect was espe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>daily objectionable in light of her virtual admission (on cross-examination) that the entire December 26, 1991, arrangement was motivated by an intent to block Gagnon\u2019s imminent sale to Cosby.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Even if the conveyance-to-the-trust transaction was, as Joan argues, literally authorized by the power of attorney (but see note 11, <em>supra), </em>Joan remained under and violated the duty to disclose all relevant facts that she as agent \u201cshould realize would be likely to affect the judgment of the principal in giving his consent to the agent to enter into the particular transaction on the specified terms.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 390 comment a. The existence of the purchase and sale agreement and the fact of this litigation underscore the materiality that advance information about the December 26, 1991, transaction would have had for Gagnon.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">d. <em>Joan violated her fiduciary duty of loyalty by self-dealing. </em>The upshot of Joan\u2019s creation of the trust and conveyance to it of the Shelburne property was that not just title to, but also control over the parcel and its disposition, during and after Gagnon\u2019s lifetime, passed from Gagnon to Joan. The transaction also provided her with a remainder interest in the Shelburne property (or its proceeds). Joan thus benefited personally from the transaction in a manner directly opposed to Gagnon\u2019s interest and manifested desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Such self-dealing by an agent, in the absence (as here) of distinct authority from the principal expressly granted in the empowering instrument, has been continuously and uniformly denounced as one of the most profound breaches of fiduciary duty, irrespective of the agent\u2019s good faith and however indirect or circuitous the accomplishment of the benefit to the agent.

The case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of a new judgment declaring that the plaintiff-appellant, Francis W. Gagnon, is the fee simple owner of the 184-acre Shelburne property; declaring that the defendant Joan Coombs\u2019 deed to herself recorded on December 27, 1991, at the Franklin County registry of deeds, book 2596, page 69, is null and void; and directing the defendant Coombs to reconvey the property to Gagnon, to record the deed and a copy of the new judgment in the grantor\u2019s index under her name, both individually and as trustee, and to take any other steps, as reasonably requested by Gagnon\u2019s attorney at law, which may be necessary to insure that these declarations and Gagnon\u2019s restored title are properly reflected on the appropriate records of the Franklin County registry of deeds. (A copy of the new judgment may also be recorded in the Registry by Gagnon or his attorney.) Gagnon\u2019s request for appellate legal fees against the defendant Coombs is de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>nied; her resistance to his appeal cannot be characterized as frivolous in light of the decision in her favor below.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-18\">See G. L. c. 201B, \u00a7 1. A \u201cdurable\u201d power of attorney provides that the agent\u2019s power will not be affected by the subsequent disability or incapac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ity of the principal. Those events would terminate the agency under common law principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Joan lived in Amherst, approximately twenty miles from Shelburne. Gagnon\u2019s other daughter, Jeanne Rowe (Jeanne), lived in Arizona. His only son, Francis A. Gagnon (Frank), resided in a trailer on a remote part of the Shelburne property. Jeanne and Frank were not aware of Joan\u2019s power of attorney until sometime after its execution. The trial testimony indicated considerable disharmony, if not hostility, between Frank and the two sisters, with an exchange of recriminations regarding the proper care of their parents and alleged misuse of their assets, as well as mutual intimations of undue influence on Gagnon in connection with the power of attorney and its revocation. The judge found no undue influence on anyone\u2019s part and concluded that Gagnon had at all relevant times acted competently and with sufficient understanding in connection with the several transactions at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The only information that the attorney who prepared the power of attorney had was provided to him by Joan. The attorney did not discuss the document\u2019s contents with Gagnon except to ask whether Gagnon \u201cfully understood it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">This affidavit was not included in the record on appeal. The judge\u2019s finding regarding the affidavit indicates that it stated that at the time of the execution of the deed, Joan did not have actual knowledge of the termination of the durable power of attorney by revocation, death, disability, or incapacity of the principal. It thus closely tracked the language of G. L. c. 201B, \u00a7 5, inserted by St. 1981, c. 276, \u00a7 2, which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">\u201cAs to acts undertaken in good faith reliance thereon, an affidavit executed by the attorney in fact under a power of attorney, durable or otherwise, stating that he did not have, at the time of exercise of the power, actual knowledge of the termination of the power by revocation or of the death, disability or incapacity of the principal shall be conclusive proof of the nonrevocation or nontermination of the power at that time. If the exercise of the power of attorney requires execution and delivery of any instrument that is recordable, such affidavit when authenticated for record shall be likewise recordable. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The record contains nothing to suggest that Cosby or any other potential buyer had ever expressed any such concern. The judge found, based upon a psychiatrist\u2019s expert testimony, that Gagnon was competent and understood the business relationships he entered or engaged in during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>relevant time period. On cross-examination Joan admitted that she had set up the trust and conveyed the Shelburne property to it upon learning of, and in direct response to, Gagnon\u2019s having contracted to sell the property. See also note 8, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b178-11\">The \u201cFrank W. Gagnon Trust\u201d in the record appendix specifies and was signed by only one trustee, Joan G. Coombs. Documents entitled \u201cAcceptance of Trust\u201d for the appointment of Frank and Jeanne as trustees along with Joan are unexecuted, unwitnessed, and unnotarized. The December 26, 1991, quitclaim deed for the Shelburne property identifies only Joan G. Coombs as trustee of the trust. The naming of Jeanne as a party defendant in this litigation in her capacity as trustee and her designation as such in the judge\u2019s opinion suggest that she may have agreed to become a cotrustee with Joan prior to the commencement of this litigation on January 15, 1992. (The pleadings are not, however, contained in the record on appeal.) No separate allegations or claims against Jeanne appear to have ever been advanced. Gagnon\u2019s appellate prayer for relief \u2014 declarations that the December 26, 1991, conveyance is null and void because of Joan\u2019s misconduct as agent and that Gagnon continues to own the Shelburne property and an order that Joan pay his costs and legal fees \u2014 is indicative of Jeanne\u2019s marginal, essentially immaterial role in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b181-7\">It is evident from her testimony that Joan was motivated by a concern that the proceeds of the sale would be \u201cin peril\u201d because Frank, whom she accused of misusing Gagnon\u2019s assets and unduly influencing Gagnon\u2019s actions, would somehow obtain them \u201cfor his own benefit.\u201d See also note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Gagnon is correct in pointing out that the G. L. c. 201B, \u00a7 5, affidavit does not support Joan\u2019s position, since such a document is intended as protection for third parties dealing with an agent who rely thereon, not as a self-serving mechanism to validate the acts of an attorney in fact who is chargeable with constructive notice of the pro tanto termination of her authority. See comment to Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act \u00a7 5, 8 U.L.A. 327 (Master ed. 1979) (on which G. L. c. 20IB, \u00a7 5, was based).

This general principle does not advance Joan\u2019s position, however, since the object and purpose of her power was to act for Gagnon\u2019s benefit and in his stead should he become incapacitated (see discussion <em>supra). </em>Neither that purpose nor the terms of the document itself endow Joan with extraordinary agency powers such as the right to reap personal benefit without the principal\u2019s consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We have considered but rejected Joan\u2019s cross appeal, asserting that it was error to allow Gagnon to file his appeal late. The February 3, 1994, notice of appeal was timely filed, following the judge\u2019s denial of Gagnon\u2019s posttrial motions for a new trial and amended findings and conclusions, pursuant to the lower court\u2019s authority under Mass.R.A.P. 4(c), as amended, 378 Mass. 929 (1979). It was, in any event, filed well within the one-year period permitted under Mass.R.A.P. 14(b), 378 Mass. 939 (1979). The egregiousness of the fiduciary violations involved provides ample good cause for acceptance of that filing. See Mass.R.A.P. 2, 365 Mass. 845 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
