T. Rich Company, Inc. (Rich), to recover damages for injuries sustained by Angelos when he fell from a scaffold. Rich had contracted with the city of Boston to serve as the general contractor on a project involving the renovation of three Boston school buildings. Angelos was employed by Chios Painting &amp; Contracting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>(Chios), a subcontractor on the project. Eva and Ianoula Dilaveris joined as loss of consortium .plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Following a trial, a jury found Angelos comparatively negligent in the accident and allocated fifty-five percent of the fault to him. Rich\u2019s negligence for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries was pegged at forty-five percent. The jury further assessed damages of $355,000 for Angelos, $10,000 for Eva and $4,500 for Ianoula.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appeal from the judgment and from the denial of their motion for a new trial, alleging various errors in the conduct of the trial and in the jury deliberation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Rich has cross appealed and contends that, under a directed verdict standard, there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that Rich owed a duty to Angelos in the first instance, or that any existing duty was breached. Accordingly, Rich argues that the trial court improperly denied its motions for directed verdict and its motion against the consortium claimants for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">We summarize the facts. In 1990, Rich contracted with the city of Boston to renovate three public schools. Chios, who was responsible for scraping and painting the ceilings and walls in the schools, was a subcontractor on the project chosen directly by the city. Angelos was employed by Chios. On the morning of the accident, Angelos was engaged in scraping the ceilings of classrooms at one of the schools. He worked standing on six foot high scaffolding in order to reach the ceilings in the rooms. The scaffolding belonged to his employer. When he got to the fifth room that he worked on that morning, he noticed two scaffolds already set up in the room. Rather than replacing them with his employer\u2019s scaffold, he decided to use the ones already there. The parties agree that this scaffold (like those owned by Chios) was not equipped with a guardrail as required by Federal safety regulations and by Rich\u2019s own internal standards. Once on the scaffold, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Angelos began to scrape the ceilings in the room. Shortly thereafter, he fell from the scaffold and sustained injuries to his head, arms, pelvis, and lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">1. <em>Duty of care. </em>Because it is potentially dispositive of the entire action, we first take up Rich\u2019s claim that its contractual relationship with the city and with Chios did not confer upon Rich a sufficient right of control over the safety aspects of the job as to create a duty of reasonable care toward Angelos. At trial, following presentation of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, Rich moved for a directed verdict on the question of duty owed and renewed that motion at the close of evidence. Rich followed this with a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as against the consortium claimants. Rich now contends that its motions were improperly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In deciding the propriety of the denial of either a motion for directed verdict or one for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we are to \u201cconsider the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff and inquire whether upon any reasonable view of the evidence, there is a combination of facts from which a rational inference may be drawn in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>416 Mass. 825, 826 (1994) (citations omitted). If Rich owed a duty to Angelos, it must have its origins either in its general contract with the city of Boston or in its subcontract with Chios. The narrow question, then, is whether under either or both contracts Rich retained sufficient right to control Chios\u2019s work. See <em>Corsetti </em>v. <em>Stone Co., </em>396 Mass. 1, 11 (1985) <em>(Corsetti). </em>\u201cOne who entrusts work to an independent contractor, but who retains the control of any part of the work, is subject to liability for physical harm to others for whose safety the employer owes a duty to exercise reasonable care, which is caused by his failure to exercise his control with reasonable care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, quoting from and adopting as Massachusetts law Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 414 (1965). In <em>Corsetti, </em>as here, an employee of a subcontractor who fell from scaffolding brought suit against the general contractor. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The court upheld the jury\u2019s determination that, under the provisions of the general contract and the subcontract, the general contractor had re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>tained the authority and control over \u201call safety precautions and programs in connection with the [w]ork.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. The subcontract expressly reserved to the general contractor the right to initiate \u201call safety measures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">By contrast, in <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Rust Intl., </em>901 F.2d 183, 185 (1st Cir. 1990) <em>(Foley), </em>the First Circuit Court of Appeals applied the reasoning of <em>Corsetti </em>to a diversity case, and reached an opposite result. Like <em>Corsetti, Foley </em>involved a suit for personal injuries against a general contractor by an employee of a subcontractor. The subcontract in <em>Foley </em>explicitly shifted control of safety issues to the subcontractor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to the <em>Foley </em>court, the general contractor had much less control over the work than did the general contractor in <em>Corsetti. Foley, supra </em>at 185. The court relied on comment c, reprinted below,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to \u00a7 414 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, and held that the general contractor merely retained a general right to control the work, while the subcontractor clearly retained the specific right and duty to control the safety aspects of the job under the terms of the subcontract. <em>Foley, supra </em>at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The general contract between Rich and the city of Boston is \u201crelevant as evidence of control over the safety aspects of the work,\u201d but \u201ccannot vary or heighten any duty\u201d Rich may have already owed to Angelos under its contract with Chios. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>Corsetti, </em>396 Mass, at 11 n.8. Therefore, we begin with the subcontract, itself a standard preprinted two-page form which provides little conclusive guidance. The only relevant provision calls for Rich to \u201cassume to the Subcontractor [Chios] all the obligations and responsibilities that the Awarding Authority [the City of Boston] by the terms of the hereinbefore described documents [the general contract] assumes to the Contractor [Rich].\u201d This provision makes Chios\u2019s and Rich\u2019s duties coextensive. Hence, the provision does not reserve exclusive control over safety either to Rich, as in <em>Corsetti, </em>or to Chios, as in <em>Foley. </em>Overall, we think it clear that the subcontract merely allows Rich and Chios jointly to engage in all aspects of the work, including safety, but does nothing to confer on Rich such a degree of control that Chios is \u201cnot entirely free to do the work in [its] own way.\u201d <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>411 Mass. 615, 622-623 &amp; n.11 (1992), quoting from Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 414 comment c. See also <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 718-719 (1991). That Chios may do the work \u201cits own way\u201d is further suggested in \u00a7 (b)2 of the subcontract, which obligates Rich to \u201cprosecute and complete\u201d its portion of the work under the general contract \u201cso that [Chios] will be able to begin, prosecute and complete\u201d its work, upon notice from Rich to begin performance. That section goes on to obligate Chios to complete its work \u201cwith due consideration\u201d to the general contract\u2019s stated completion date. The subcontract, however, says nothing about Rich\u2019s actually overseeing or directing Chios\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Our reading of key provisions of the general contract between Rich and the city also leads us to conclude that Rich merely retained a general right to control the work. As in <em>Foley, </em>the general contract does not give Rich the degree of control that the general contractor had in <em>Corsetti. </em>While the general contract requires Rich to \u201csupervise and direct the work\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to \u201cbe responsible for the entire project opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tions and . . . coordinate the work of all trades and give all customary and proper assistance to all Subcontractors,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> these provisions, unlike the <em>Corsetti </em>contract, do not confer \u201csole\u201d responsibility over \u201call\u201d safety aspects of the. work. They merely require Rich generally to oversee the project operations and to assist subcontractors. Article 9 of the general contract which requires Rich to \u201ctake all proper precautions to protect persons from injury, unnecessary interference or inconvenience, and be responsible for the results of any failure in doing so,\u201d holds Rich liable under general principles of negligence for its own acts and omissions, but is not, by itself, evidence of a heightened duty owed to the employee of a subcontractor. The provision, at article 4.7, which requires Rich to have on the job site a superintendent \u201cwho shall have <em>general </em>charge of the project operation,\u201d merely recognizes Rich\u2019s general right to oversee the project, while leaving undisturbed Chios\u2019s right to control the safety aspects of its own work.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">We note further that the behavior of Rich and that of Chios and its employees makes clear the respective degrees of control Rich and Chios actually retained. Rich had no knowledge that Angelos would be on the job on the day of the accident. Had Rich actually retained control over Chios, it would have required Chios\u2019s employees, including Angelos, to \u201ccheck in\u201d with a foreman or superintendent employed by Rich upon commencing work each morning. Compare <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Merwin, </em>456 Pa. 516, 520 (1974) (in finding control under \u00a7 414 of the Restatement [Second] of Torts, the court relied on the actual behavior of the parties by pointing out that the defendant told the subcontractor when and where to begin work). Angelos also testified that, instead of using Chios\u2019s scaffolding when he was injured, he used Rich\u2019s scaffolding without Rich\u2019s approval, even though the general contract re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>quired Chios to provide its own equipment. If Rich had retained actual control over Chios\u2019s work, it would have known of, or controlled, such aberrations from the terms of the general contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Under these circumstances, we conclude that Rich did not retain a sufficient right of supervision, such that Chios was \u201cnot entirely free to do the work in [its] own way.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 414 comment c. See <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>411 Mass, at 620; <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 719. We hold that Rich\u2019s contractual relationships with the city and with Chios did not confer sufficient right of control over the work so as to create a duty of reasonable care toward Angelos. Rich\u2019s motions for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, therefore, should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">2. <em>Other claims. </em>Because Rich owed Angelos no duty of reasonable care, the issue of Rich\u2019s possible breach is moot. We need not take up this claim. In addition, the plaintiff\u2019s various claims of error (most concerning questions of juror behavior and the manner in which portions of the verdict were arrived at) are no longer relevant: the matter should not have been submitted to the jury for deliberation in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Judgment was entered in the Superior Court against Angelos Dilaveris on the basis that he was more than fifty percent responsible for his own injuries. We affirm that judgment, but for the reasons discussed in this opinion. Judgment for the consortium plaintiffs, Eva and Ianoula. Dilaveris, is reversed with instructions that judgment shall enter for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b144-8\">As Angelos was more than fifty percent responsible for his injuries, judgment was entered in favor of Rich.
