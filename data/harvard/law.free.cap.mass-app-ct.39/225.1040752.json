L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, after a jury-waived trial in the jury session of the Dedham District Court. He claims the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, but disregarding evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>we decide was erroneously admitted at trial, we conclude that no rational trier of fact could have found an essential element of the crime charged \u2014 the identity of the victim\u2019s assailant \u2014 beyond a. reasonable doubt, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), and, therefore, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The judge could have found the following facts on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. On October 5, 1993, about 4:15 p.m., John Burke<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was driving on East Hoyle Street in Norwood when he came upon a car parked perpendicular to the sidewalk in an area where cars are usually parked parallel to the sidewalk. Both doors to the automobile were open. The victim, Kathleen Whalen, was standing on the sidewalk in front of the parked car. She was holding one hand with her other hand. She was crying, very upset, and very dishevelled. Burke stopped his car, and asked Whalen what had happened, in response to which she \u201cjust came out \u2014 she came out and blurted out the statement that \u2018My boyfriend just beat me up.\u2019 \u201d Burke saw that Whalen had puffy eyes, \u201cshe had been crying for some time. Her face was red . . . and she was very frightened.\u201d Whalen told Burke that \u201cher boyfriend had grabbed her wrist, and that she had had a previous injury, and she said he was aware of it, and had hurt her in that manner.\u201d Burke asked her if she wanted to go to the hospital; she declined. Burke then asked her if she would like to go to the police station. She said she would. Whalen, in her own car, followed Burke to the police station. Up to this point, Whalen had not identified her \u201cboyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">About fifteen minutes had elapsed between the time Burke . first saw Whalen and the time they arrived at the police station. Burke helped Whalen into the police station, gave the police his name and phone number, and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Officer David Eysie was at the Norwood police station when Whalen arrived. He saw that Whalen was \u201cteary-eyed, and I also observed her left wrist to be red and swollen . . . she was crying on-and-off and she was frightened.\u201d Officer Eysie, together with Lieutenant King, spoke to Whalen in the conference room. Whalen later signed a complaint for protection from abuse, see GJ L. c. 209A, \u00a7 4, and an affidavit in support of the complaint. The affidavit described the assault and battery, and named the defendant in the accompanying complaint as her assailant. Lieutenant King completed the information required by the court\u2019s form of a temporary order (the 209A order) and, with the papers in hand, went to his office and called a judge. The 209A order was signed by a judge,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> following which Officers Eysie, Finch, and Brown went to the defendant\u2019s apartment and, with some difficulty, arrested the defendant on the charge brought in this case. The defendant was brought to the police station where he was served with the 209A order.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Whalen did not testify at the trial. Her statements to Burke were admitted as spontaneous exclamations. The judge ruled, however, that Whalen\u2019s statements to Officer Eysie at the police station did not come within that exception. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, Whalen\u2019s complaint, her supporting affidavit, and the 209A order, including the return of service upon the defendant, were admitted in evidence as one exhibit. The Commonwealth\u2019s stated purpose in offering the documents was to provide the element missing from Whalen\u2019s statement to Burke \u2014 the identity of her \u201cboyfriend.\u201d Without competent evidence identifying the defendant as Whalen\u2019s boyfriend, the Commonwealth could not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The judge did not abuse his discretion in ruling that Burke\u2019s testimony of what Whalen said to him was admissible as a spontaneous exclamation. When Burke came upon Whalen, the positioning of her car and her physical ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>pearance bespoke someone who was frightened and in turmoil because of a recent event. Here, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>399 Mass. 678, 683 (1987), \u201cthe judge acted within his discretion in determining that the statements were made in circumstances which reasonably negated premeditation and were sufficiently proximate to the event so as to be admissible as spontaneous utterances.\u201d Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joubert, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 943, 945 (1995), where there were insufficient indicia of reliability. See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.4.1 (6th ed. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Whalen\u2019s statement to Burke, however, did not identify the defendant, or anyone else, as her boyfriend. Thus, the pivotal question at the trial was whether Whalen\u2019s affidavit and the 209A order were competent to identify the defendant as the \u201cboyfriend\u201d referred to in Whalen\u2019s statement to Burke.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Whalen\u2019s affidavit, which asserts that the defendant physically abused her, is hearsay, and the Commonwealth concedes this to be so. To the extent that the affidavit contains assertions that are merely cumulative of Whalen\u2019s statements to Burke, which were admissible, the point is of no consequence. What is of consequence is whether those statements in Whalen\u2019s affidavit which identify the defendant as her assailant, and the ensuing service of the 209A order upon him, provided competent evidence for the judge to find that the defendant was Whalen\u2019s boyfriend. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The Commonwealth argues, without citation to authority, that the judge could properly consider the affidavit and 209A order for the limited purpose of showing that the defendant was the \u201cboyfriend\u201d who assaulted her. Given that the identity of the \u201cboyfriend\u201d was the live issue at the trial, and that evidence that the defendant was the boyfriend was essential for his conviction, the use of the affidavit to resolve the identification issue would mean that the affidavit would be used, impermissibly, for the truth of the matter asserted therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">The Commonwealth also argues that the 209A order was admissible by way of judicial notice (which the judge <em>may </em>have taken, although the record is not entirely clear), as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>as under the official records exception to the hearsay rule. Again, the purpose of the evidence was to resolve the factual issue of the assailant\u2019s identity, but judicial notice, which is ordinarily reserved for matters of common knowledge and \u201cmatters verifiable by authoritative sources,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> cannot be taken of material factual issues that can only be decided by the fact finder on competent evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Kingsbury, 378 Mass. 751, 754-755 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Nor is the official records exception to the hearsay rule available to the Commonwealth. The identification of the defendant in the 209A order is merely a replication of Whalen\u2019s assertion in her affidavit that the defendant was the abuser, and it cannot be regarded as a record of a \u201cprimary fact made by a public officer in the performance of official duty,\u201d as required by the rule. See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.13.1, at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Similarly, Officer Eysie\u2019s testimony regarding the service of the 209A order upon the defendant, while not hearsay, provides no help to the Commonwealth. Without the admissibility of the antecedent information in Whalen\u2019s affidavit and the accompanying complaint in which Whalen names the defendant as her abuser, evidence of the service of the 209A order upon the defendant is relevant only upon the theory that the judge would be entitled to inf\u00e9r that service was made upon the defendant because Whalen had identified him in her affidavit and complaint. In a remarkably similar case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Mitchell v. Hoke, 745 F. Supp. 874, 876 (E.D.N.Y. 1990),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Justice Jack B. Weinstein wrote that such reasoning presents \u201ca classic example of indirect hearsay.\u201d Paraphrasing Judge Weinstein: the acts of Officer Eysie (serving the 209A order) leads by direct inference to the precise words of Whalen. Since Whal\u00e9n\u2019s credibility must be evaluated to determine the probative force of this line of identification proof, the hearsay rule applies. <em>Ibid. </em>This analysis is hardly new. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>108 Mass. 471, 472 (1871). See also Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.1, at 436 (\u201cThe principal reason for the hearsay rule is that extrajudicial statements, unlike statements in court, are not immediately tested by cross-examination\u201d). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seminara, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 789, 796 (1985) (Commonwealth may not bootstrap into a category of substantive evidence extrajudicial identification of a photo where witness not asked to confirm the identification at the trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">To sum up, the Commonwealth fails to refer us to any authority, and we know of none, which would permit the judge to consider the prior identification evidence appearing only in Whalen\u2019s extrajudicial affidavit, absent any supporting testimony, as competent evidence of the required identification of Whalen\u2019s \u201cboyfriend.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While it is true that an extrajudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>identification may, in certain circumstances, be admitted as probative evidence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 61 (1984); Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 10.1, at 609, admissibility in such circumstances continues only so long as the defendant\u2019s due process and confrontation rights are satisfied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>367 Mass. 737, 739 &amp; n.2 (1975). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>368 Mass. 268, 273 n.3 (1975). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 408-409 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Here, the defendant was identified \u2014 and later charged and convicted \u2014 as Whalen\u2019s assailant solely by means of an extrajudicial identification made by an available witness who did not \u201cconfront\u201d the defendant, did not testify, and was not subject to <em>cross-examination</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant\u2019s conviction was in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 193 (1970) (\u201cThis Court has already explicitly held in <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 419-420 [1965], that the Confrontation Clause forbids the substantive use at trial of a prior extrajudicial statement, when the declarant . . . [is] unwilling to testify about the events with which his prior statement dealt .... [The defendant\u2019s] inability to cross-examine [the absent declarant] as to the alleged confession plainly denied him the right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause\u201d). The conviction also violated art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, </em>402 Mass. 534, 544 (1988) (\u201c[W]e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>have never interpreted art. 12 as permitting introduction of an available witness\u2019s testimony outside a defendant\u2019s presence. Indeed, an unbroken chain of decisions mandates the opposite conclusion\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Johnson, 417 Mass. 498, 503 (1994) (\u201cUnlike the Sixth Amendment, however, art. 12 contains an indispensable element of face-to-face confrontation of witnesses appearing at trial\u201d). <em>Bergstrom </em>also emphasizes the second element of the confrontation clause \u2014 that \u201cconfrontation requires cross-examination in addition to a face-to-face meeting .... [C] ross-examination reinforces the importance of physical confrontation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, </em>402 Mass, at 542 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We recognize that the right to confront witnesses is not absolute. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 357 (1992) (confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment not violated where the proffered hearsay comes within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule, such as spontaneous exclamations); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>417 Mass. 358, 364 (1994). But here, the Commonwealth presented no evidence that Whalen was unavailable, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>385 Mass. 733, 744 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colin C., </em>419 Mass. 54, 63 (1994) (\u201c[t]he prosecution bears the burden of showing the necessity for admitting the out-of-court statement by establishing the declarant\u2019s unavailability to testify during the trial\u201d), and, as we have seen, no \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exception to the hearsay rule is available as to the critical identification issue. In these circumstances, the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation is paramount. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, </em>402 Mass, at 545-546; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>406 Mass. 1201, 1209-1210 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colin C., </em>419 Mass, at 63. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>385 Mass, at 741 (confrontation right extends beyond contours of the hearsay rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The defendant, without justification, was deprived of the right of cross-examination of Whalen and the right to a face-to-face confrontation. The judgment must be reversed and the verdict set aside. However, the conclusion we reach does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>not bar the retrial of the case. Since the evidence admitted at trial was sufficient to send the case to the jury, but was insufficient to send the case to the jury if the complaint, affidavit, and 209A order are disregarded, double jeopardy principles do not bar a retrial. <em>See Kater </em>v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 17, 18 (1995). See also <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>488 U.S. 33, 40-41 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kater, </em>409 Mass. 443, 445 (1991), <em>S.C., </em>412 Mass. 800 (1992) (\u201c \u2018[W]e agree with those cases which hold that the double jeopardy principle does not automatically bar retrial \u201cwhere an insufficiency of evidence appeared only when material held on appellate review to have been erroneously admitted was notionally removed from the case\u201d \u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The testimony of John Burke was introduced during a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion in limine held immediately prior to trial. The purpose of the hearing was to determine whether certain statements made by the victim came within the spontaneous exclamation exception to the hearsay rule. At the conclusion of the hearing on the motion, the judge ruled that the statements were admissible. The transcript of the hearing on the motion, by agreement, was subsequently incorporated into the trial record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The 209A order required the defendant not to abuse the plaintiff, not to contact the plaintiff in any manner, and to stay at least 200 yards away from her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">While the judge, or this court, may take judicial notice of the records and files of the court in the same case or in ancillary proceedings, see Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 2.8.1, at 43, such records ordinarily may not be used for substantive purposes.
