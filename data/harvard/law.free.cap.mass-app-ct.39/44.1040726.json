L. c. 266, \u00a7 18). A conviction for larceny in a building (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 20) was filed and is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>before us.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The charges arose from allegations that the defendant broke into the office of the Yarmouth town dump and stole a safe. Because the two issues raised in this appeal have a narrow focus, we will extract relevant facts from the record as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">1. <em>Temporary closure of the courtroom. </em>Before resuming the testimony of a prosecution witness<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the second day of trial, the judge, referring to the provisions of <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>457 U.S. 596 (1982), and in the absence of the jury, stated that because of information before the court \u201crelative to [that witness\u2019s] concerns about intimidation,\u201d and in order to conduct an \u201cappropriate hearing,\u201d she would close the courtroom and that \u201call persons, unless they are employees of the office of the district attorney or employees of defense counsel, are to be removed from the courtroom and public entrances locked.\u201d Defense counsel stated, \u201cThe defendant wanted to know if his mother could remain,\u201d and the judge answered, \u201cNot at this time.\u201d Counsel made no objection. A voir dire examination of the witness by the prosecutor covering less than five pages of transcript then was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In a discussion with counsel and the prosecutor following the voir dire examination, the judge, before deciding to allow the Commonwealth to \u201creopen certain areas\u201d of the witness\u2019s testimony, noted that James Martin, a brother of the defendant, apparently had pleaded guilty to witness intimidation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>that a District Court determination of intimidation by the defendant had been appealed, and that both of these proceedings involved intimidation of the present witness along with others. Before asking the witness to wait outside, the judge indicated that defense counsel could make further inquiry of the \u201cstate of mind\u201d of the witness. Neither defense counsel responded. The judge expressed her perception that the witness\u2019s \u201clack of ability to recollect facts\u201d was based on fear related to the intimidation to which she testified at the voir dire hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge then announced she would allow the Commonwealth to \u201creopen and redirect on [the witness]\u201d and further would exercise her discretion to continue the exclusion of all persons with the exception of any employees of the two defense counsel, employees of the district attorney, court employees, and \u201cthe press.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She denied the request of defense counsel to allow the defendant\u2019s mother \u201cto sit in the courtroom,\u201d notwithstanding his claim that there had been no evidence presented that the defendant\u2019s mother \u201cintimidated\u201d or otherwise made any remarks to the witness. No further request or any objection appears in the record. The witness then was recalled to testify before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The defendant argues that the exclusion of his mother from the voir dire and during the reopened testimony of the witness violated his constitutional right to a public trial whether or not the judge was justified in excluding others. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Our courts have \u201calways recognized the right of a criminal defendant to be tried in an open court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stetson, </em>384 Mass. 545, 549 (1981). \u201cClosing criminal proceedings from public attendance potentially implicates either of two rights guaranteed by the First and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>417 Mass. 187, 192 (1994). \u201cThese two constitutional rights, however invaluable, are not absolute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193. See also <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>457 U.S. at 606; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohmer, </em>374 Mass. 368, 380 (1978). While \u201cthe two rights . . . serve to protect two distinct classes \u2014 the First Amendment right protects the public and the press, the Sixth Amendment protects criminal defendants \u2014 the constitutional analysis as to each is the same. See <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 46-47 (1984). . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 193 n.8. \u201c[T]he party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra </em>at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">As to the brief voir dire hearing, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stetson, supra </em>at 548-549, there was nothing improper in the judge\u2019s order excluding persons generally from the courtroom, including the defendant\u2019s family and supporters, in order to explore the sources and nature of the witness\u2019s concerns about intimidation. However, in order to justify continued closing of the courtroom, and in determining whether \u201cthe right to an open trial may give way in certain cases to other rights or interests,\u201d <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra </em>at 45, \u201c[t]he presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The interest is to be articulated along with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984). <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra </em>at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The defendant does not argue error based upon the admission of the reopened testimony,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the duration of the closure, or the exclusion of certain persons, but only that the exclusion of his mother was improper. While we think the judge should have expressly rather than implicitly determined whether the witness would have had difficulty testifying with the defendant\u2019s mother present, it was not constitutional error requiring a new trial not to do so in the particular circumstances of recent intimidation by other family members and persons sympathetic to the defendant. See <em>Fayerweather </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>749 F. Supp. 43, 45 (D.R.I. 1990) (\u201cThe Sixth Amendment does not guarantee a defendant an audience. It merely guarantees that members of the public will have a right to attend a defendant\u2019s trial unless there are compelling reasons for excluding them\u201d). We do not believe that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>356 Mass. 432 (1969), dictates that the defendant\u2019s convictions be reversed, as he argues, since that case involved the exclusion of all spectators, including the relatives of the defendant, from the entire trial. Compare <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Kuhlmann, </em>977 F.2d 74, 77 (2d Cir. 1992) (affirming order excluding all members of the family of person who threatened witness during testimony of that witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In applying the <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>requirements, we first must determine whether there was an overriding interest which likely would have been prejudiced if the courtroom had remained open. The authority to exclude spectators whose presence intimidates a witness has been recognized as a corollary to a judge\u2019s power to maintain order in court proceedings to assure that criminal trials be fair and just. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohmer, </em>374 Mass, at 380. Here, the evidence of intimidation constituted an overriding factor justifying, in the interests of a fair trial, the limited closure imposed by the judge. Moreover, where there was only a temporary and par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>tial closure of the courtroom for the reopened testimony of a single witness, and where members of \u201cthe press\u201d were not excluded, we agree with the reasoning in <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Kuhlmann, supra </em>at 76, in accord with three other Federal circuits, that a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d rather than an overriding interest may justify such a closure. We believe this approach to be supported by the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s recognition of the psychological well-being of a minor complainant as constituting \u201ca compelling interest which may warrant closure.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Martin, 417 Mass, at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Given the previous courtroom intimidation of the witness by the defendant\u2019s brother and two female spectators (see note 4, <em>supra) </em>the exclusion of the defendant\u2019s mother during the remaining testimony of that witness, was a reasonable, and not overly broad, measure to protect the integrity of the proceedings. Also, by opting to exclude all family members but not \u201cthe press\u201d as an alternative to full closure, the judge appears to have given adequate consideration to and did not violate the third <em>Waller </em>requirement. Lastly, the judge\u2019s articulation on the record of the relationship between the witness\u2019s ability to recollect and the evidence of intimidation meets the <em>Waller </em>requirement of findings supporting the partial closure sufficient to permit review.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">2. <em>Witness intimidation-consciousness of guilt instruction. </em>The defendant characterizes certain of the witness\u2019s recall testimony, including her explanation that intimidation was the reason for some untruthfulness in her earlier testimony, as having a prominence which was highly dramatic and enhanced by the closing of the courtroom. He argues that since evidence of threats or intimidation is admissible to demonstrate consciousness of guilt, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montecalvo, </em>367 Mass. 46, 52 (1975), the trial judge should have given, sua sponte, an instruction pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 584-585 &amp; nn. 4-6 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>416 Mass. 27, 29-30 (1993). The present case was tried before the <em>Cruz </em>decision and at a time when the <em>Toney </em>charge \u201cwas usually left to the sound discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>tion of the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>419 Mass. 426, 435 (1995). In view of a limiting instruction given during the witness\u2019s testimony at the request of counsel for the codefendant<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the focus on the witness\u2019s truthfulness, we do not agree that any issue of consciousness of guilt remained in the case requiring a <em>Toney </em>instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, supra </em>at 434-435. In light of substantial circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, the judge, by responding as she did, and in not giving a <em>Toney </em>instruction sua sponte, exercised her discretion in a manner consistent with the \u201cbetter practice\u201d later articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, supra </em>at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-17\">The appeal of the codefendant, Niles L. Hinckley, to this court resulted in an unpublished memorandum decision, 38 Mass. App. Ct. 1103 (1995), upholding judgments against him. Further appellate review has been granted by the Supreme Judicial Court, 419 Mass. 1110 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The defendant asserts the sentencing transcript is \u201cdevoid of any evidence that [he] consented to the filing,\u201d that the docket entry \u201cappears to be erroneous,\u201d and that the conviction therefore is before us in this appeal. However, the record is also devoid of any indication that the defendant objected to the filing. In the circumstances, and in view of our decision on the merits, we need not reach the larceny conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 698, 703-704 (1986). We note that the defendant makes no argument particularized to the larceny conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\">The witness began her testimony on the first day of trial and then was cross-examined by counsel for the defendant. The prosecutor was allowed to ask her leading questions because the witness had difficulty in recalling certain events. During a jury recess the prosecutor stated that the witness was \u201cquite obviously nervous\u201d and \u201cquite obviously scared.\u201d No disagreement concerning the witness\u2019s demeanor appears in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\">During the voir dire hearing, the witness stated that some of her testimony on the first day of trial was not entirely truthful, and that she felt \u201c[s] cared\u201d when the defendant\u2019s brother, James, in the back of the courtroom was pointing at her that day, and two women (one of them the defendant\u2019s girlfriend) were \u201clooking at me hard. I mean, scaring me, scaring me from testifying.\u201d She also acknowledged that she had been approached earlier in the year by the defendant and another man and also by the defendant and his brother, James, when the defendant asked her to testify that the codefendant, Niles Hinckley, acted alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The record does not reveal whether media representatives or any members of the public were present at any of the relevant times before or during the closing of the courtroom. In view of the judge\u2019s not excluding \u201cthe press\u201d and the fact that the judge\u2019s order was not made under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 16A, we do not consider expressly the public exclusion issues raised in <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., supra, </em>and related cases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 953, 955 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The defendant concedes that the testimony of the witness during the reopened direct examination did not substantially differ from the version of events she described during her first day of testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The judge stated in pertinent part: \u201c[T]he witness . . . has indicated some reference to her state of mind as she was testifying [and certain questions asked to determine the basis for her state of mind] as to whether she was truthful or not truthful . . . and the reasons for it. . . . And as far as [the defendant] is concerned, whatever statements were elicited through the assistant district attorney is simply for the basis of permitting the witness to explain what her state of mind was or to give reasons for it, and [the defendant] is here specifically on trial on certain charges, and again, you cannot draw any negative inference against him on whatever came out through the questioning of this witness. It would strictly be whether or not he committed the acts complained of now here at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Although not stated expressly as a consciousness of guilt instruction, \u201cwe shall not assume that jurors will slight strong and precise instructions\u201d of this kind. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>356 Mass. 598, 604 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
