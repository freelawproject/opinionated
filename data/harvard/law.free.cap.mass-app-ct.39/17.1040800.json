L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, fourth par. We also rule that the Land Court had jurisdiction to enter a judgment granting Silver Leaf zoning relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The locus is a forty-acre parcel of land bordering Main Street in Tewksbury. Silver Leaf, the parcel\u2019s owner, proposed to expand an existing 60,000 square-foot shopping center to include an additional 130,000 square feet of retail space, the expanded center to be known as Heath Brook Plaza. In February, 1989, the planning board, acting as the special permit granting authority under \u00a7 4.11 of the town\u2019s zoning by-law, approved Silver Leafs site plan for Heath Brook Plaza. Subsequently, Silver Leaf secured Shaw\u2019s Supermarket as a future tenant. At Shaw\u2019s request, minor modifications were made to the site plan, which was then resubmitted to the planning board for its approval. The planning board was shown a rendering of Heath Brook Plaza designating Shaw\u2019s as one of the anchor stores. The planning board\u2019s engineering consultant recommended approval of the minor changes in the revised site plan. In July, 1990, the planning board again approved Silver Leafs site plan application but imposed additional conditions, not present on the first approval, requiring that Silver Leaf make certain off-site road improvements to portions of Route 38 not adjacent to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Silver Leaf appealed from the decision with new conditions to the Land Court and also sought a declaration that the proposed shopping center expansion could not be subject to special permit requirements, as the retail business uses planned there were allowed as of right within the zoning district. In a decision dated August 5, 1991 (not under appeal here), the Land Court judge held that the conditions exceeded the plan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ning board\u2019s authority under site plan review and also held \u201cthose portions of [\u00a7 4.11 of the by-law that] require the discretionary special permit standards to be applied to the proposed shopping center ... are void.\u201d The matter was remanded to the planning board with the suggestion that site plan review \u201cshould probably be limited\u201d to the minor on-site changes already proposed for the previously approved site plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Following additional public hearings on the site plan, at which the planning board was again shown a rendering of Heath Brook Plaza indicating a Shaw\u2019s Supermarket, the planning board, on February 5, 1992, voted to deny approval. The decision states no reasons for the denial. Silver Leaf timely appealed from the planning board\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. First Colonial, the owner of commercial property across from the locus, was permitted to intervene. In the decision and judgment that is the subject of this appeal the Land Court judge held that, once again, the planning board\u2019s denial exceeded its authority and annulled the decision. Rather than remanding the matter to the planning board for a second time, the Land Court judge granted site plan approval without conditions and also ruled that the planning board had acted in bad faith. Subsequently, Silver Leaf moved for costs, which were awarded in the amount of $1,295.28. The planning board\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">1. <em>Exhaustion of administrative remedies. </em>First Colonial now raises for the first time a jurisdictional question, arguing that Silver Leafs proper recourse as a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d was first to appeal th\u00e9 planning board\u2019s decision to the town\u2019s board of appeals, pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 14, before seeking judicial review pursuant to \u00a7 17. Silver Leafs failure to exhaust administrative remedies, according to First Colonial, meant that the matter was not properly before the Land Court and that the resulting judgment, therefore, is invalid. Hence, First Colonial urges us to dismiss the action leaving Silver Leaf to begin the entire appeal process anew. Though not raised below, we address the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The statutorily required submission of zoning disputes to local authority is so central to the architecture of G. L. c. 40A that we have required the exhaustion of administrative remedies as a prerequisite to judicial review. See <em>William C. Bearce Corp. </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Brockton, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 930, 931 (1981); <em>McDonald\u2019s Corp. </em>v. <em>Seekonk, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 351, 353 (1981). Within the zoning context, therefore, principles of exhaustion require that a person aggrieved by the action of a local zoning administrator (the building inspector in most municipalities) must first attempt to redress the grievance through the local board of appeals before seeking judicial review. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 13, 14, and 17; <em>Neuhaus </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Marlborough, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 230 (1981). See- also G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7, as inserted by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3 (\u2018Tn]o action, suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court . . . except in accordance with the provisions of this section, section eight and section seventeen\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">As noted above, the Land Court judge in a 1991 judgment decided that, since the shopping center use was allowed as of right, those portions of \u00a7 4.11 of the by-law that required the application of discretionary special permit standards by the planning board were void.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> From this, First Colonial argues, we think mistakenly, that the issuance of a special permit by the planning board was not called for \u2014 \u201c[t]he site plan review process was a condition precedent to a building permit, not a . . . special permit\u201d \u2014 and the planning board was therefore not acting as a \u201cspecial permit granting authority.\u201d Since the only decisions of the planning board that are appealable to the courts directly are those in which the plan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>ning board has acted as a \u201cspecial permit granting authority,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the planning board\u2019s disapproval of the site plan had to be run through the board of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Section 4.11 of the by-law, pertaining to site plan special permits, however, contains no separate provision that calls for more limited site plan review of uses available as of right not requiring a special permit. Contrast <em>McDonald\u2019s Corp. </em>v. <em>Seekonk, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 352 (parking plan had to be submitted for approval by planning board before a building permit \u2014 not a special permit \u2014 could be issued). Section 4.11 details various procedural and substantive requirements for site plan special permits. The 1991 Land Court judgment that invalidated some of the <em>substantive </em>requirements of \u00a7 4.11 did not have the effect of rendering the entire site plan special permit by-law invalid. When passing on the validity of a particular ordinance or by-law, a reviewing court should strike only the offending provisions, leaving the remainder intact if, as here, the nonoffending provisions contain a clear expression of the planning board\u2019s authority to issue special permits. <em>Gage </em>v. <em>Egremont, </em>409 Mass. 345, 349 (1991), citing <em>Del Duca </em>v. <em>Town Admr. of Methuen, </em>368 Mass. 1, 13 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">We hold, therefore, that the <em>procedural </em>framework of \u00a7 4.11 of the by-law, including the designation of the planning board as a special permit granting authority, survived the 1991 Land Court judgment intact. Site plan special permit applications should be handled in exactly the same manner as they were prior to the 1991 judgment, except that where the proposed use is one permitted by right the planning board may only apply substantive criteria consistent with <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Westwood, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 278 (1986) (i.e., it may impose reasonable terms and conditions on the proposed use, but it does not have discretionary power to deny the use). Approval of a site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>plan special permit application under these circumstances would still lead to the issuance of a special permit by the planning board as the designated special permit granting authority under \u00a7 4.11. Conversely, denial of a site plan application constitutes a decision by the special permit granting authority, which is directly appealable under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. The Land Court had jurisdiction to hear the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">2. <em>Annulment of the planning board\u2019s decision and the grant of site plan approval without </em>conditions. Since the site plan involved a permitted use, the judge\u2019s proper role at trial was to inquire whether the public interest could be protected to a degree consistent with the reasonable use of the locus for retail business purposes. See <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Westwood, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 281-282. The judge correctly ruled that, in denying the application without reasons, the board had made no effort to impose reasonable and appropriate conditions on the permitted use. More important, the board presented no competent evidence at trial, either through a properly qualified expert or an independent traffic study, of a traffic problem \u201cso intractable that it could admit of no reasonable solution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">There also was no error by the judge in refusing to remand the matter for a second time. In the first remand, the board ignored the judge\u2019s suggestion to limit the site plan to minor on-site changes but chose instead to deny the approval outright with no reasons stated for the denial. On two prior occasions, in 1989 and in 1990, the board had approved the site plan but then added conditions to its approval, which the Land Court judge later held invalid. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a717, second par., as inserted by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, specifically empowers the court to \u201cmake such other decree as justice and equity may require.\u201d Where, as here, \u201cthere is a record of consistent obstruction of lawful use . . . \u2018justice and equity would not be served by [another]. remand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Newbury Jr. College </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 197, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>208 (1985), quoting from <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>369 Mass. 512, 520 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">3. <em>Bad faith. </em>The judge\u2019s finding of bad faith on the part of the planning board must also have played a part in his decision not to remand for a second time. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 17, fourth par., as inserted by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, provides that \u201c[cjosts shall not be allowed against the board or special permit granting authority unless it shall appear to the court that the board or special permit granting authority in making the decision appealed from acted with gross negligence, in bad faith or with malice.\u201d In finding that the board acted in bad faith, the judge made subsidiary findings of fact, including that: (1) the site plan \u201cin its essentials\u201d had twice before been approved by the board; (2) the proposed revisions to the site plan were minor in nature, as stated by the board\u2019s own engineer; (3) the board failed to follow guidelines given it by the court in the first remand concerning permissible limits of site plan review; (4) the board\u2019s concerns about traffic problems were not advanced in good faith as it failed to put forth any credible evidence at trial regarding the likely effect that a supermarket on the site would have on traffic; and (5) the board failed to state reasons for denying the site plan and also failed to propose reasonable conditions that might be attached to approval. The judge\u2019s subsidiary findings are amply supported in the record and thus are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The judge\u2019s finding that the board acted in bad faith was particularly justified in this instance. The proposed project, which involves a permitted use under the town\u2019s by-law, has been side-tracked for more than six years since the site plan was first approved in 1989.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Silver Leaf has been at least three times before the planning board, twice before the Land Court, and now before this court. Along the way, Silver Leaf has lost several prospective tenants for the proposed shopping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>center. We are also unimpressed by the tactics of First Colonial, the owner of commercial property across from the locus and, therefore, a potential competitor, who has sat back until appeal, only now raising a jurisdictional question designed to send the property owner back to \u201csquare one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Following entry of the appeal in this court, the planning board filed a stipulation of dismissal of its appeal. We are therefore left with only First Colonial\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Where, as here, \u201cthe specific area and use criteria stated in the by-law [are] satisfied, the [planning] board [does] not have discretionary power to deny . . . [approval], but instead [is] limited to imposing reasonable terms and conditions on the proposed use.\u201d <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Westwood, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 278, 281-282 (1986), quoting from <em>SCIT, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Braintree, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 105 n.12 (1984). See also <em>Y.D. Dugout, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Canton, </em>357 Mass. 25, 29-31 (1970). In short, the planning board is confined to \u201cregulation of a use, rather than its prohibition.\u201d <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 282.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 17, as amended through St. 1989, c. 649, \u00a7 2, provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by a decision of the board of appeals <em>or any special permit granting authority . . . </em>may appeal to the land court . .
