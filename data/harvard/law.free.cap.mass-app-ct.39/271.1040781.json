Because G. L. c. 175D precludes reimburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>ment by the contributors to the amount settled upon Semedo-Anacleto, that is, by the Fund and the insured of the insolvent insurer, and because Semedo-Anacleto is not thereby \u201cin a better position than she would have been in if the [tortfeasor\u2019s] liability insurer had remained solvent,\u201d <em>Gaeta </em>v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co. of Hartford, </em>410 Mass. 592, 595 (1991), we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">1. <em>The undisputed facts. </em>We relate the undisputed facts. In 1984, Semedo-Anacleto was employed by Helen Walsh Associates, a placement service. She was injured while working at a packaging plant owned by Howard Johnson\u2019s, Inc. That corporation has since been merged into the Marriott. Semedo-Anacleto claimed that Marriott, the third-party defendant, negligently allowed her to work unprotected and improperly clothed for a protracted period of time in an area of extreme cold temperature, causing her serious injury, including severe frostbite, leading to gangrene of the toes of the left foot, transmetatarsal amputation of the right foot, and permanent nerve damage to both lower extremeties.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">For her injuries, Semedo-Anacleto received $80,451.27 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits from her employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier, CNA. Thereafter, she brought suit against Marriott, which had primary liability insurance through American Mutual Insurance Company (American), with limits of $500,000.00. Prior to trial on that tort claim, American was declared insolvent, and the Fund, pursuant to G. L. c. 175D, took over American\u2019s obligations to defend Marriott and to indemnify it up to the Fund\u2019s statutory limit of $300,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Marriott offered Semedo-Anacleto a settlement in the amount of $395,000.00. She and her attorney refused the offer on the basis that if any settlement amount was to be subject to a workers\u2019 compensation lien by CNA under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, she would accept no less than $475,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Prior to trial, Semedo-Anacleto and her attorney settled her tort claim for $395,000.00, to which Marriott contributed $175,451.27 and the Fund paid in $219,548.73, that is, the difference between $300,000.00, the Fund\u2019s statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>maximum, and $80,451.27, the amount of the workers\u2019 compensation payments. Semedo-Anacleto also entered into a separate agreement with the Fund which provides that the Fund will indemnify her in the event that CNA is found to have a valid lien on any of the settlement proceeds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The settlement agreement, which detailed CNA\u2019s payments to Semedo-Anacleto while remaining silent on the matter of any lien, was approved by a Superior Court judge pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The present action seeking reimbursement was then commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">On these undisputed facts, all the parties sought summary judgment. CNA argued that c. 152, \u00a7 15, creates a statutory right of reimbursement from settlement proceeds contributed by responsible third parties even if the Fund contributes to the total settlement pursuant to c. 175D, while Semedo-Anacleto and Barrett contended that c. 175D precludes CNA from enforcement of any lien against them. As we construe the decision of the Superior Court judge, she determined that because Semedo-Anacleto would be indemnified by the Fund for any money she was required to pay CNA, there was, for all intents and purposes, a $300,000.00 contribution by the Fund to the settlement. Had American remained solvent and contributed that amount to the settlement, CNA would be entitled to reimbursement, which, therefore, was not precluded by c. 175D.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>2. <em>Discussion. </em>In deciding that CNA was not precluded from reimbursement by G. L. c. 175D, the Superior Court judge appears to have proceeded upon the assumed but undetermined validity of the indemnity agreement between Semedo-Anacleto and the Fund. Until it is first determined that CNA has a right to reimbursement from the settlement proceeds received by Semedo-Anacleto, that agreement and the troublesome question of whether its performance would be a prohibited payment by the Fund of a claim of an insurer are not relevant. To determine whether CNA has a right of reimbursement from Semedo-Anacleto\u2019s settlement proceeds, we look to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, and G. L. c. 175D.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">CNA\u2019s claim of a right to reimbursement arises under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15 (as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 39<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>), which, as here pertinent, provides that any money recovered in any action against a third party \u201cshall be for the benefit\u201d of the workers\u2019 compensation insurer and that any amount recovered which exceeds the amount due the compensation insurer \u201cshall be retained by\u201d the employee. The purpose of this provision is to prevent double recovery by the employee, that is, \u201conce by way of compensation and once by way of damages.\u201d <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp., Ltd., </em>288 Mass. 170, 174 (1934). See also <em>Percoco\u2019s Case, </em>418 Mass. 136, 139 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">We turn to the third-party action, Semedo-Anacleto\u2019s negligence claim against Marriott. As a result of the insolvency of Marriott\u2019s liability insurer, American, the Fund became obligated, under G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 5(1) <em>(a) </em>(as inserted by St. 1970, c. 261, \u00a7 1), to pay \u201ccovered claims\u201d against Marriott up to the statutory amount of $300,000.00, less the amount of the workers\u2019 compensation payments which, by definition, cannot be part of a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d As defined by c. 175D, \u00a7 1(2) (as amended by St. 1975, c. 341, \u00a7 1), a \u201c \u2018Covered claim\u2019 shall not include any amount due any ... in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>surer . . . .\u201d Notwithstanding the fact that Marriott\u2019s primary liability policy with America had limits of $500,000.00, the Fund contributed to the settlement as much as allowed by c. 175D.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Recognizing these statutory limitations and relying upon <em>Gaeta </em>v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co. of Hartford, </em>410 Mass, at 595, CNA argues that because the total amount of the settlement is well in excess of the amount of the compensation benefits paid Semedo-Anacleto and because the third-party defendant, Marriott, also contributed to the settlement, it can be reimbursed independent of the money paid by the Fund. In <em>Gaeta, </em>however, several parties contributed to the settlement, and the compensation insurer could be reimbursed in full from the contribution to the settlement made by a party other than the insured of the insolvent insurer. The difference is, in our view, crucial in light of the proviso in \u00a7 1(2), that \u201cin no event\u201d may any claim for any amount due an insurer be \u201casserted against the insured of such insolvent insurer.\u201d In the present case, there were only two contributors to the settlement, the Fund and Marriott, the insured of the insolvent insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Our conclusion, that CNA is precluded in this case from reimbursement by the provisions of c. 175D, is not inconsistent with the purpose of either G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, to prevent double recovery, see <em>Percoco\u2019s Case, </em>418 Mass, at 139, or G. L. c. 175D, \u201cto indemnify injured persons.\u201d <em>Ferrari </em>v. <em>Toto, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 487 (1980), <em>S.C., </em>383 Mass. 36 (1981). Semedo-Anacleto sought recovery from Marriott in the amount of $475,000.00. Had American not become insolvent and had Marriott settled with her, CNA would have been reimbursed, and Semedo-Anacleto would have been in no better position than the one in which her settlement of $395,000.00 placed her.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If she were now required to reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>burse CNA, and if the indemnity agreement were determined to be null and void, her settlement would be in an amount far less than what she had bargained for, that is, about $315,000.00. Compare <em>Gaeta </em>v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co. of </em>Hartford, 410 Mass, at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Although CNA will sustain a loss as a result of our conclusion, that G. L. c. 175D precludes it from reimbursement of the compensation benefits it paid to Semedo-Anacleto, that conclusion is, in the present case, \u201cconsistent with the legislative intent [of c. 175D] and is not inconsistent with any demonstrated public policy.\u201d <em>Ferrari </em>v. <em>Toto, </em>383 Mass, at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of summary judgments for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The parties to this appeal agreed that the question whether the indemnity agreement is null and void is not before us. In any event, any concerns about the enforceability of that agreement need not be addressed in view of our conclusion that CNA is precluded from seeking reimbursement from Semedo-Anacleto.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">There is some difference of opinion among the parties concerning CNA\u2019s knowledge of the settlement of Semedo-Anacleto\u2019s tort claim and its opportunity to be heard. CNA makes no argument before us that this disagreement is material and would prevent summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Specifically, the Superior Court judge stated: \u201c[T]he structure of the settlement deprives the workers\u2019 compensation insurer of the protection guaranteed by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15. Under the analysis in <em>Gaeta </em>[v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co. of Hartford, </em>410 Mass, at 595], if American Mutual had remained solvent and had contributed $300,000 to the settlement, the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefit payments would \u2018very clearly\u2019 be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>long to CNA. . . . Accordingly, G. L. c. 175D does not preclude recovery by CNA from the defendants who are indemnified by the Fund.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\">See St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 107. The section prior to its rewriting contained the same provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">CNA suggests that the figure of $475,000.00 is \u201cfraught with speculation.\u201d Aside from the undisputed allegations concerning the severity of Semedo-Anacleto\u2019s injuries, we think that CNA\u2019s view of the amount of recovery she sought is irrelevant. The undisputed fact of the matter is that if Semedo-Anacleto was required to reimburse CNA, she was not going to settle for less than $475,000.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
