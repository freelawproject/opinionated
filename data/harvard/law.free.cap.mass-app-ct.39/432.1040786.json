The buildings were insured by the defendant, and the loss, which was covered by the defendant\u2019s policy, was substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The parties were unable to resolve their differences about the amount of the trustees\u2019 loss, and the trustees commenced suit against the defendant on April 30, 1991. A partial summary judgment was entered on June 1, 1992, and, following a jury-waived trial, final judgment was entered on July 6, 1993, awarding the trustees, under G. L. c. 93A, double the amount of their damages (as claimed in their proof of loss), plus attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We affirm but remand on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The material facts, either undisputed or as found by the judge after trial and not clearly erroneous, are these.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The trustees hired an independent public adjuster. He estimated a loss of $64,379.78, which was forwarded to the defendant on July 12, 1990. By way of counteroffer, on or about August 21, the defendant\u2019s adjuster wrote that \u201c$32,055.84 ... is the best I can do.\u201d On August 23, 1990, the trust submitted a \u201cSworn Statement in Proof of Loss\u201d in precisely the same amount suggested by the defendant\u2019s adjuster: $32,055.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">On September 14, 1990, the defendant, in a timely fashion, notified the trust of its election to exercise its right to repair or replace the damaged property, as permitted by the terms of its policy. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 99. The judge found that the defendant failed to perform in good faith its obligation to restore the property. In particular, the judge found that \u201cGulf did not effectively follow through with its election to repair or replace the damage to the premises. It did not obtain specifications for repair nor did it request bids or let contracts for the repair and replacement of the damage in question. The response that Gulf was denied access to the premises for the purpose of implementing its repair and replace option was not supported by the evidence. The court finds that Gulf did not effectively and forcefully pursue any right of access, nor [was] its right to replace or repair thwarted by any refusal of access to the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>There is ample support in the record for these findings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the trustees, having resorted to repairing the property themselves, are entitled to be reimbursed the full measure of their contract damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In his order on the motion for partial summary judgment, the judge had ruled that the trust\u2019s damages were established by the trust\u2019s proof of loss. On this point we agree with the defendant: the judge was in error in establishing the trust\u2019s proof of loss as its damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The defendant\u2019s election to restore the property superseded the defendant\u2019s obligation under the terms of its policy either (i) to pay an agreed amount or the amount set forth in the proof of loss within thirty days of the defendant\u2019s receipt of the proof of loss or, failing agreement on the amount of the loss, (ii) to refer the dispute to a three-member board of referees for a final and binding decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>exercise of the insurer\u2019s option to restore the property alters the agreement between the insured and the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">While the briefs do not refer us to any Massachusetts decision on the point, and we have found none, the prevailing view is \u201cthat an election to rebuild or repair converts the insurance agreement into a building contract, the consideration for which has been received in advance, and causes the amount of the policy to cease to be the rule of damages.\u201d 15 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 54:34, at 436 (2d ed. 1983), where the cases are collected. See also 6 Appleman, Insurance Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 4003, at 707-708 (1972) (the election to rebuild and repair constitutes \u201ca new and independent undertaking on the part of the insurer to replace the property, restoring it to its former condition\u201d). Once the election is made, Massachusetts law requires that the repairs or replacements be made with \u201creasonable expedition.\u201d See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The measure of damages, in the event of the insurer\u2019s breach of its undertaking to restore the damaged property, is the cost of repairing or rebuilding the property. See Couch, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 54:47; Appleman, <em>supra </em>at 714. See also <em>Ficara </em>v. <em>Belleau, </em>331 Mass. 80, 81 (1954); <em>Colangeli </em>v. <em>Construction Serv. Co., </em>353 Mass. 527, 530 (1968) (\u201cit is enough to show the extent of damage by just and reasonable inference\u201d); <em>Trinity Church in the City of Boston </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>399 Mass. 43, 49 (1987), <em>S.C., </em>405 Mass. 682 (1989) (replacement or restoration costs is an allowable measure of damages in cases involving property damage). The case must be remanded to the Superior Court to determine the trust\u2019s actual damages caused by the defendant\u2019s failure to restore the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">There remains to be considered the judge\u2019s conclusions that the defendant violated G. L. c. 176D and c. 93A, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The defendant claims, first, that the c. 93A demand letter of the trust, dated October 29, 1990, was inadequate. That letter charges the defendant with the failure to \u201ceffectuate a prompt, fair and equitable settlement ... in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>with our Sworn Statement in Proof of Loss dated August 30, 1990 and your adjuster\u2019s Statement of Loss. . . .\u201d General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 2(a), covers insurance practices described in G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9) (f), as inserted by St. 1972, c. 543, \u00a7 1 (\u201cfailing to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear\u201d). <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 723, 726 (1979). The resolution of the claim \u201cdepends upon a factual determination of . . . [the insurer\u2019s] knowledge and intent.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Here, liability was certain and not contested. The loss occurred on June 2, 1990, and the proof of loss claiming the same amount suggested by the defendant\u2019s own adjuster was received on August 27, 1990. On September 14, 1990, the defendant rejected the proof of loss and exercised its option to proceed with restoring the property. By the date of the trust\u2019s c. 93A demand letter, October 29, 1990, the defendant had not commenced the work of repair; the judge found, as we have noted, that the defendant did not obtain specifications, or request bids, or let contracts, thereby violating its statutory obligation to proceed with \u201creasonable expedition\u201d under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 99. The judge concluded that the defendant had exercised its option merely to obtain a better settlement figure \u2014 that the defendant\u2019s conduct and intentions were designed to achieve an <em>unfair </em>settlement. The defendant chose not to pay the loss within thirty days of the receipt of the proof of loss, as provided in the \u201cLoss Payment\u201d provision of the defendant\u2019s policy, and it chose not to refer the dispute to a board of referees for resolution. These were all matters known to the defendant, and constituted its strategy in dealing with this claim. In this particular context, the letter of the trust charging the defendant with having failed \u201cto effectuate a prompt, fair and equitable settlement\u201d was sufficient to satisfy c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Based on his findings of fact, which are not clearly erroneous, the judge found that the defendant had engaged in a pattern of conduct designed \u201cfor the purpose of substantially reducing the amount it had to pay under its policy obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>tions,\u201d had failed to conform to its obligations to proceed with the work of repair with reasonable expedition, and had not acted in good faith in purporting to exercise its option to restore the property, having \u201cnever seriously pursued that option\u201d other than to use the exercise of the option \u201cto force a settlement by the plaintiff for an amount less than was otherwise rightly due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument that its response to the demand letter of the trust was \u201clegally sufficient\u201d is without merit. General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3), provides that one who receives a demand letter may, within thirty days, make \u201ca written tender of settlement,\u201d which, if reasonable, and if rejected by the claimant, will limit any subsequent recovery to the relief tendered. Although the defendant did respond to the trustees\u2019 demand letter within the required thirty-day period, the response stated only that the defendant would \u201creimburse the Trustees for whatever bills have been paid to repair or rebuild\u201d following a review of the invoices submitted by the trustees. The judge concluded that the defendant\u2019s response to the demand letter \u201cwas not made in good faith and was an insufficient response to such demand.\u201d This finding, especially when read with the judge\u2019s findings as a whole, indicates that the judge concluded the defendant\u2019s response was part of its continuing plan of \u201ccompelling an insured to accept an amount that was less than what the insured was rightfully entitled to receive under the provisions of the governing policy.\u201d In the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that this finding was clearly erroneous. Thus the defendant missed the opportunity, provided by \u00a7 9(3), to avoid multiple damages, and the defendant\u2019s settlement efforts after the expiration of the thirty-day period have no bearing on this case insofar as liability under c. 93A is concerned. Contrast <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>Silver Lake Motors, Inc., </em>369 Mass. 795, 803 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The judge concluded that the defendant had not acted in good faith, that the defendant had violated both G. L. c. 176D and c. 93A, and that those violations were \u201cboth willful and knowing.\u201d We see no error in these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Finally, the judge concluded, without error, that the plaintiff trustees were entitled to double damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. See <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 475 (1991). Thus, on remand, after determination of the trustees\u2019 actual damages, a judgment shall be entered in an amount that is double the actual damages, plus costs, attorney\u2019s fees (but not fees of appellate counsel), and interest at the legal rate from September 26, 1990 (thirty days following the defendant\u2019s receipt of the proof of loss). Compare <em>Ben Elf man &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Home Indem. Co., </em>411 Mass. 13, 19 (1991) (\u201cinterest begins to run when the insurer fails to make timely payment of a loss\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\">For example, Berman, the trust\u2019s adjuster, notified defendant\u2019s counsel on September 25, 1990 (eleven days after the defendant elected to repair and restore the property), that the \u201cinsured will gladly provide access to the premises at any reasonable time. . . .\u201d On October 12, 1990, Berman wrote defendant\u2019s counsel that, in a conversation on September 26, defendant\u2019s counsel agreed to contact the defendant\u2019s representative promptly regarding the payment of the loss. No response was forthcoming, and Berman states in the same letter that he called and left messages on October 1, October 4, October 9, and that on October 11 he was placed on \u201chold\u201d for more than twelve minutes when counsel refused to take his call. Again, no response was forthcoming, and on October 29 counsel to the trustees wrote defendant\u2019s counsel a demand letter under c. 93A. That did provoke a response, but not until November 21, 1990, when defendant\u2019s counsel replied that the defendant \u201cis still prepared\u201d to make the repairs, and that the \u201crepairs would be done by competent contractors . . . .\u201d No repairs were undertaken, and it was not until April 16, 1991, that defendant\u2019s counsel offered to settle the claim for $25,000. Suit was filed on April 30, 1991, and the first decision of the judge on the summary judgment motion (which was favorable to the plaintiff) was entered June 1, 1992. It was only after this decision that the defendant tendered a settlement check on June 17, 1992, in the amount of $32,055.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The defendant\u2019s briefs make no claim on appeal that repairs were ever undertaken by the defendant. Consistent with its argument below, the defendant\u2019s sole response is that it was denied access to the property. As noted, however, the judge did not credit that testimony, and we give it no weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-9\">In deciding the motion for partial summary judgment, the judge ruled that, because the defendant had not referred the controversy to a board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>referees, the defendant is bound by the proof of loss submitted by the trust. For the reasons stated in the text, we disagree.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
