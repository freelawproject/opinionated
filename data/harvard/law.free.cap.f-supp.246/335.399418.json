Shortly after the complaint was filed upon motion of the plaintiff a teipporary restraining order was entered enjoining the Commission from enforcing the suspension order. Thereafter the Commission filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to vacate the tempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>rary restraining order. Certain interested parties were allowed to intervene as defendants. They join in the motion to dismiss and to vacate the temporary restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The record indicates that the Commission\u2019s Board of Suspension<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> suspended the tariffs filed by plaintiff. Plaintiff failed to petition for reconsideration as provided by the Commission\u2019s Special Rules of Practice, \u00a7 1.200(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This was essential before review could be sought in this Court. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 17(9). Plaintiff, having failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, cannot now secure relief in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">It is ordered that plaintiff\u2019s complaint is hereby dismissed at plaintiff\u2019s costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">It is further ordered that the temporary restraining order heretofore entered is hereby vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-5\">. The \u201cBoard of Suspension\u201d is an employee board which is under the supervision of Division 2 of the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-12\">. Petition for reconsideration may be filed within twenty days after the date of the service of the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
