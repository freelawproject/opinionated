Said defendant further attacked the complaint on the grounds of ambiguity and unintelligibility. Defendant Lloyds of London likewise demurred generally and specifically upon the grounds that the court had neither jurisdiction of the persons nor of the subject matter of the action insofar as said defendant was concerned. Defendant Sequeira moved to strike from plaintiff\u2019s complaint all reference to Lloyds of London and to the particular municipal ordinance referred to upon the ground that said allegations were irrelevant and redundant and upon the further ground that such allegations would tend to influence a verdict by prejudice and sympathy. In addition Sequeira demurred generally to the complaint. The trial court, by a minute order dated April 14, 1949, ordered \u201cthat the demurrers of Lloyds of London and Clyde Owens be sustained, with leave to amend within ten days after legal notice; that the motion to strike be granted; that the demurrer of Sequeira be overruled, with leave to answer within ten days after legal notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The order of the trial court does not specify as between the general and special demurrers of the defendants Lloyds of London and Owens. Approximately one month thereafter, on motion by plaintiff, judgment on the demurrers was entered in favor of defendants Lloyds of London and Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">We turn first to the demurrers of defendant Owens. There can be no question, and it is admitted by said defendant, that the complaint as to him states a cause of action and is good as against a general demurrer. The only debatable issue raised by said defendant is that which is contained in his special demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">It is the well established rule that a special \u201cdemurrer should not be sustained where the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to meet. <em>(Jacobson </em>v. <em>Oakland Meat &amp; Packing Co., </em>161 Cal. 425, 433 [119 P. 653, Ann.Cas. 1913B 1194] ; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Iverson, </em>131 Cal. 101, 104 [63 P. 135]; <em>Hurwits </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>5 Cal.App. 614, 617 [91 P. 109]; 21 Cal.Jur. 102.)  A special demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach the failure to incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>but is directed at the uncertainty existing in the allegations actually made. <em>(Callahan </em>v. <em>Broderick, </em>124 Cal. 80, 83 [56 P.2d 782]; <em>Brea </em>v. <em>McGlashan, </em>3 Cal.App.2d 454 [39 P.2d 877]; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hollander, </em>85 Cal.App. 535, 542 [259 P. 958] ; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>128 Cal.App. 736 [18 P.2d 354].) \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lim, </em>18 Cal.2d 872, 882-3 [118 P.2d 472].)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Applying the rule as stated to the record before us we cannot say there is any uncertainty as to what the plaintiff meant by the allegations previously quoted, that is, that without provocation he was attacked and beaten by the defendant Owens, causing him to suffer injuries to his head and body and severe physical pain. It would seem somewhat absurd to compel a plaintiff in such a situation to render a blow by blow account of the assault and to indicate with medical certainty the exact injuries suffered to his head and body. For the same reason it cannot be said that the allegations are ambiguous or unintelligible. Additionally it may be observed that it is the statutory rule that pleadings <em>must </em>be liberally construed with a view to \u201csubstantial justice between the parties\u201d; in other words, to dispose of matters on their merits and not upon mere technicalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention as regards the joinder of Lloyds of London as a party defendant is predicated upon the rule as enunciated in the recent case of <em>Grier </em>v. <em>Ferrant, </em>62 Cal.App.2d 306, 314 [144 P.2d 631], wherein it is stated that the \u201cinsurance carrier may be joined as a party defendant whenever the policy itself or the municipal ordinance, in compliance with which the policy is issued, provides that the policy should inure to the benefit of the public <em>(Fraher </em>v. <em>Eisenmann, </em>94 Cal.App. 48, 51; 52 [270 P. 704], and cases therein cited).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Defendants Lloyds of London and Sequeira concede that the ordinance of the city of Modesto gives plaintiff the right to join the insurance company in a proper case, but they contend, this is not a proper case \u201cfor the reason that the policy under consideration with the ordinance as incorporated therein . . . does not inure to the benefit of the public where an assault and battery is involved.\u201d The ordinance, they say further, \u201cis written so as to apply to the ordinary automobile accident situation.\u201d Thus they argue that since Lloyds of London only assumed responsibility for injuries to persons caused by the operation of the taxicabs by the defendant taxi company, and since Owens could not have been operating his cab when he jerked plaintiff therefrom and assaulted him that there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>fore the alleged acts do not come within the provisions of said policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We are not particularly impressed with the three cases from other jurisdictions cited and relied upon by said respondents. Rather we are convinced that the conclusion reached by the district court in <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>88 Cal.App.2d 941 [200 P.2d 26], where the precise question was raised, should be applied likewise to the situation presented in the instant case. There the court in disposing of the contention that a policy covering damages to persons or property arising out of the 11 conduct of the business of a taxicab operator\u201d did not cover injuries received by a passenger as the result of an assault by the driver, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\u201cThe contention of the insurance company that the ordinance has reference only to injuries resulting from traffic accidents is fallacious. While it may be true that the most common loss or damage resulting from the operation of a taxicab is that occasioned by traffic accidents, the ordinance specifically requires insurance against any loss or damage that may result from the operation of any taxicab. That the damage in question resulted from the operation of a taxicab is too patent to be susceptible to argument. Plaintiff was a passenger for hire and did not cease to be one when he was dragged out of the cab by the driver. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">We are unconvinced that the import of the language \u201cconduct of the business of a taxicab operator\u201d is so different from the words chosen by respondents \u201coperation of taxicabs\u201d as to warrant a recovery against an insurer in the first but would deny a recovery in the second. It would seem that the contentions of the insurer herein are just as fallacious in the present case as were those of the insurer in the Connell case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">By reason of the fact that no discussion is made by any of the parties relative to the demurrer of defendant Lloyds of London upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the persons or of the subject matter it becomes unnecessary to discuss these issues as raised by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Respondents\u2019 argument in support of the order of the trial court granting the motion of defendant Sequeira to strike all reference to Lloyds of London and all mention of the particular municipal ordinance under which the taxi company was operating is merely that if the demurrer was properly sustained then the motion to strike was likewise properly granted. However, as we are convinced to the contrary, that is, that defendants\u2019 demurrers were improperly sustained by the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>reasoning it necessarily follows that the motion to strike was improperly granted. This must be so since any other conclusion under the circumstances would result in an obvious anomaly.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The judgment and the order are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Adams, P. J., and Van Dyke, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
