M. Klein and from Mrs. Jessie Klein and caused said shares of stock to be reissued by plaintiff in defendant\u2019s own name.\u201d It is then alleged that on April 1, 1946 the preferred stock was called for redemption, respondent receiving $26,250 therefor; that prior to redemption respondent had received $20,125 in dividends on said preferred stock. Respondent is alleged to havOreceived $28,434 in dividends on the common stock so acquired, which common stock still stands in the respondent\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The complaint then alleges that respondent concealed the facts from the corporation and its directors who had no information concerning \u201csuch use of Plaintiff\u2019s funds by defendant until the month of March, 1947\u201d when, \u201can- audit of the plaintiff\u2019s books of account revealed the aforementioned transaction.\u201d The prayer is that \u201cdefendant be declared the. constructive trustee of said 1,354- shares of the common stock of the plaintiff for the use and benefit of the plaintiff, \u2019 \u2019 and that plaintiff recover all dividends paid to defendant together with interest, and the redemption price of the preferred stock paid to defendant. The answer contains a denial of the alleged fraud and pleads various statutes of limitation. There was also a cross-complaint to recover certain dividends withheld by appellant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">After a trial consuming several days, the matter was submitted to the trial court upon briefs and judgment rendered in favor of the respondent, quieting title to the stock held in respondent\u2019s name, and awarding to respondent the sum of $33,850.00 with interest, representing withheld dividends. There was no motion for a new trial. It is the appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s findings to the effect that no fraud was committed by respondent, that no unauthorized or illegal use of corporate funds was made, etc.' are not supported by or justified by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The record discloses evidence' indicating that at the time the stock' was purchased, Mr. Evans, president of Consolidated Produce Company recommended that respondent Pieper buy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the stock \u201cfor the sake of a little more prestige in view of the long service I had given the company. \u2019 \u2019 In order to purchase the stock Pieper in partnership with one Henry Rivers, borrowed $3,250 from the Bank of America which issued its cashier\u2019s cheek in that amount to respondent. Mr. Rivers also gave to respondent a personal check for $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The stock transfer was effected at respondent\u2019s office about noon on June 10, 1940. Pieper testified that as the seller\u2019s agent, Mr. Rubin, desired payment in one check, respondent secured a company check for $5,000 from President Evans, advising the president of the deposit in the cashier\u2019s drawer of the $3,250 cashier\u2019s check and the $1,500 Rivers check, the balance of $250 being drawn against respondent\u2019s salary. This company check (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 6), was made out to California Bank, signed by President Evans and by Pieper as vice president and treasurer, and turned over to the seller\u2019s agent, delivery of the stock being made to Pieper. The matter was entered upon the corporate records, and under date of June 11, 1940 a receipt was issued by appellant corporation to Peiper for $4,750 \u201cto account,\u201d with the notation, \u201c2 cks 6/10/40 HER 1500, Cashiers Ck. #3744948 3250.00.\u201d Nicholas Taube, cashier of appellant corporation, testified that the cash receipts were generally recorded the same day the cash was received but that \u201cthere were some days when you (the witness) weren\u2019t able to complete your work by noon and get all the cash entered and deposited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The trial court found, and the record discloses substantial evidence in support thereof, that entries concerning Pieper\u2019s deposit of the checks with the company cashier and the issuance of the corporation check for $5,000 used in the stock purchase, were recorded in the corporation books more than three years prior to the filing of plaintiff\u2019s action in 1948. It was also found that audits were regularly made of the books; that Price, Waterhouse made an independent audit in 1941, and that \u201cplaintiff had information from these statements that put it on inquiry as to the nature of the transactions\u201d in question; that \u201cthe same books and records plaintiff investigated in 1947 existed in 1940. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">There is also substantial evidence to justify the finding that \u201cdefendant made no secret withdrawals\u201d of corporate funds, and that <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>The act of the defendant in using the accommodation check in June, 1940, was not done in secret and was not concealed.\u201d The trial court concluded that since the cause of action did not accrue within three years before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>the commencement of the action, it was barred by the provisions of subdivision 4, section 338 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">It is conceded in appellant\u2019s brief that \u201cThere is some evidence relative to some of the findings but it is not enough to support the findings and the supporting evidence is so weak as to show an abuse of the discretion of the Trial Court.\u201d Appellant then asserts that \u201cThe only evidence to support findings in favor of the respondent was Pieper\u2019s testimony,\u201d and that \u201cHis testimony contained so many discrepancies, inconsistencies, contradictions and inherently improbable statements that it was not only the privilege, but the duty of the court to view all of his testimony with suspicion.\u201d Appellant then points out certain items of evidence which it is claimed necessitate a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Appellant\u2019s attempt to make the present case an exception to the usual rule governing appellate review of questions of fact must fail. It is doubtless true that the record reveals certain conflicts in the evidence. It is likewise true that certain evidentiary facts, if believed by the trial court, may to some extent afford support to appellant\u2019s contentions that all was not as it should be in reference to the transaction. This, however, is but the usual situation met with in all contested litigation. The .record in the instant case presents no exception to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The language used in <em>Isenberg </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>212 Cal. 454, 480 [298 P. 1004, 299 P. 528], is directly applicable to the present situation. The Isenberg action was brought by stockholders seeking an accounting after a sale of corporate assets alleged to have been fraudulently effected. Affirming a judgment of the trial court holding that there was no fraud, the reviewing court says: \u201cIt would serve no useful purpose to take up each point raised by appellants in reference to their theory of fraud and conspiracy. As is usual in such eases, the trial court was presented with two diametrically opposed theories, two different and opposed interpretations of certain acts and facts, and, on such conflicting evidence, the trial court decided in favor of respondents. Under such circumstances, our well-known rule as to findings based on conflicting evidence forbids interference with the judgment. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions to the effect that no fraud or concealment had taken place, and that if any cause of action had ever existed, the same was barred, by the three-year statute of limitation, finds adequate support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>in substantial evidence. The credibility to be attached to Pieper\u2019s testimony, and the weight and credibility of all the voluminous documentary and testimonial evidence introduced, were questions to be determined by the trial court. No appellate interference is here warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 18, 1950, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 25, 1951.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
