Defendants (1) appeal from the judgment in favor of plaintiffs, (2) purportedly appeal from (a) the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>denying a jury trial and (b) the order denying a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\"><em>Facts: </em>In July, 1945, plaintiffs owned a 17-acre citrus grove located in the county of Los Angeles just east of Glendora. At such time Mr. Snidow and Mr. Hill were general partners in a business known as the L. A. Trailer Service. About the 27th of June, 1945, they had a conversation culminating in an oral agreement for the purchase and sale of the citrus grove owned by plaintiffs. Under the terms of their agreement the price of the property was $55,000 including the fruit on the trees which was either picked or was in the process of being picked. Mr. Hill undertook and agreed to sell a home and a boat which he owned and to apply the proceeds toward the down payment on the grove. It was agreed that Mr. Snidow might take as much money as was or should become available out of the L. A. Trailer Service during the ensuing months and the portion of the proceeds thereof would apply toward the down payment on the grove. In addition defendants agreed to pay $3,000 on January 1 and July 1 of each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Pursuant to this agreement defendants entered into possession of the property. Prior to March 15, 1946, defendants had paid plaintiffs $1,000 in cash and also other monies which were applied toward the purchase price. On March 16, 1946, Mr. Snidow and Mr. Hill agreed as to the balance due on the purchase price and in May, 1946, the oral agreement between the parties was reduced to writing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The $3,000 payment due July 1, 1946, was paid on September 30, 1946. No other payments were made during 1946 except receipts from the fruit sold from the grove which were received by plaintiffs and applied toward the purchase price. Plaintiffs made demand on defendants for the $3,000 payment due January 1, 1947, and defendants made a partial payment thereon of $412 on January 27, 1947, and $600 on February 17, 1947. Finally on April 20, 1947, plaintiffs demanded the payment of the balance of the $3,000 due and were told that it was not going to be paid. On April 24, 1947, the present action to quiet title was filed. Defendants filed an answer praying for a judgment that they were the equitable owners of the property, and that plaintiffs be compelled to execute a conveyance and requested an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The case was tried and a judgment entered in favor of plaintiffs. This judgment was reversed on appeal. <em>(Snidow </em>v. <em>Hill, 87 </em>Cal.App.2d 803 [197 P.2d 801].) Thereafter on March 1, 1949, defendants made a motion for a jury trial which was denied. At the same time the trial judge permitted defendants to file an amended and supplemental answer. By this pleading defendants attempted to allege fraud upon the part of plaintiffs which induced defendants to enter into the contract. Upon the retrial judgment was again entered in favor of plaintiffs and the present appeals have ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Questions: </em>First: <em>Did plaintiff Houston A. Snidow perpetrate a fraud upon defendants or either of them?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">This question must be answered in the negative. The trial court expressly found that defendants\u2019 allegations of fraud were untrue. Defendants do not attack the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain such finding. Therefore the finding is binding upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Second: <em>Was the contract uncertain as to the dates and amounts of payments due under it?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">This question must also be answered in the negative. The contract provided, \u201cPurchasers agree to pay not less than $3,000.00 on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of June of each year.\u201d This language is clear and unambiguous. The exact dates of payment as well as the minimum amount thereof is clearly stated in the quoted provision of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Third: <em>Were the payments of $3,000 twice a year contingent on receipt of monies from the L. A. Trailer Service or the sale of crops?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">This question must likewise be answered in the negative. The contract provided, \u201cSellers hereunder shall have the right to all proceeds from the fruit or other rents, issues, and profits therefrom, until said obligation is paid.\u201d Clearly such provision was for payments to be made in addition to the minimum requirement of $6,000 a year as provided elsewhere in the contract where it said, \u201cIt is understood and agreed that moneys withdrawn from L. A. Trailer Service by either Houston A. Snidow or Hayden Hill may be credited against the amount due hereunder, as their interest may appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">Fourth: <em>Were defendants in default at the time the present action was filed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">This question must be answered in the affirmative. The trial court found that defendants were in default at the time the present action was commenced and defendants do not attack the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain such finding. Therefore it is binding upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">Fifth: <em>Was there a contract between the parties?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-14\">This question must also be answered in the affirmative. The trial court found that the parties entered into the agreement hereinabove mentioned. The sufficiency of the evidence to sustain this finding is not questioned. Hence it is binding upon this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Sixth: <em>Were defendants entitled to recover the amount paid under the terms of the contradi</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">This question must be answered in the negative. Defendants\u2019 pleadings are devoid of the necessary allegations upon which to predicate a rescission of their contract with plaintiffs. Neither do they in their answer or amended and supplemental answer seek a rescission. On the contrary, in the prayer of their original answer they ask that the court declare them to be the equitable owners of the property in question and compel plaintiffs to execute a valid conveyance thereof to them, while in the prayer to the amended and supplemental answer they ask that plaintiffs take nothing by their suit, but be required to account for all monies received from the grove. Clearly such relief is entirely inconsistent with that which defendants now seek, to wit, a rescission. <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>Duke, </em>140 Cal. 22, 26 [73 P. 732] ; <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>First Trust etc. Bank, </em>11 Cal.App.2d 668, 672 [54 P.2d 495].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Seventh: <em>Did the court properly deny defendants\u2019 motion for a jury trialf</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">This point is not available to defendants on this appeal for the reason that no exception was taken or noted by them to the ruling denying a jury trial. Where no exception is taken or noted to the ruling of the trial court in accordance with the provisions of section 646 of the Code of Civil Procedure when a jury trial is denied, such order, not being within the list of orders which are deemed to have been excepted to under the provisions of section 647 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is not reviewable on appeal from the judgment. <em>(Estate of Magerl, </em>201 Cal. 162, 167 [256 P. 204].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">1. The judgment is affirmed. 2. Since (a) an order denying a motion for .a new trial, and (b) an order denying a jury trial are reviewable upon appeal from the judgment but are not appealable orders, the purported appeals from such orders are and each is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Moore, P. J., and Wilson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 6, 1950, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 14, 1950. Carter, J., and Sehauer, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\">This agreement reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\u201cThis agreement made and entered into by and between Houston A.
