The incumbents were not ousted and may continue in office. <em>(People ex rel.

Prior to May 27, 1936, the Municipal Civil Service Commission created a new <em>classification </em>known as \u201c Stationary Engineer in Charge,\u201d and on that date directed a competitive promotional examination to be held for the position of <em>\u201c </em>Stationary Engineer in Charge.\u201d However, on August 5, 1936, the Commission adopted this resolution: \u201c Resolved, That with respect to all Stationary Engineers in Charge whose payrolls have been heretofore approved by this Commission, that the Commission continue such approval of payrolls <em>until application is made </em>by the respective departments in which such persons are employed <em>to change such title to Senior Stationary Engineer, </em>the existence of any promotion list to the contrary notwithstanding; it- being intended that <em>such a promotion list is to be used and certified only for the purpose of filling future </em>vacancies.\u201d Five months subsequent to the adoption of this resolution, and while it remained in effect, the examination for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>\u201c </em>Stationary Engineer in Charge \u201d was held January 20, 1937. The ehgible hst, upon which these petitioners\u2019 names appear, was not promulgated until July 7, 1937. On the dates of the adoption of the resolution, of the examination and of the promulgation of the ehgible list, no vacancies existed among the \u201c Stationary Engineers in Charge \u201d in the Department of Sanitation. Ah the present incumbents had obtained vahd original appointments as stationary engineers, and when, prior to May, 1936, additional duties were imposed and increased emoluments conferred upon them under their departmental designation as <em>\u201c </em>Stationary Engineers in Charge,\u201d there were no promotion examinations to be taken and no ehgible lists from which appointments could be made. Having received original vahd appointments, they have the right to remain in their positions, even though a new classification has been effected and new requirements exacted. <em>(Matter of Fornara </em>v. <em>Schroeder, </em>261 N. Y. 363, 368; <em>Matter of Sandford </em>v. <em>Finegan, </em>276 N. Y. 70, 73.) No new position has been created, no vacancy has occurred, and the sole purpose of the promotion examination was for filling vacancies. (Civil Service Law [Cons. Laws, ch. 7], \u00a7 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The orders should be reversed and the apphcation denied, with costs in ah courts. (See 278 N. Y. 694<em>.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Crane, Ch.
