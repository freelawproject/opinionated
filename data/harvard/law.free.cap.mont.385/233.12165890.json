We vacate and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in instructing the jury to decide whether the plaintiffs would have settled the claim underlying their legal malpractice suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">\u00b63 The factual background of this case was detailed in <em>Labair v. Carey, </em>2012 MT 312, 367 Mont. 453, 291 P.3d 1160 <em>(Labair I), </em>and will not be repeated here at great length. In short, this case stems from the October 2003 death of Dawson Labair, the Labairs\u2019 newborn child, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>following an early delivery by C-section. The Labairs signed a retainer agreement with Carey in January 2004 to pursue a potential medical malpractice claim against Dr. Thomas Baumgartner, their obstetrician. In September 2006, Carey filed a complaint in District Court against Dr. Baumgartner and Community Medical Center alleging negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Carey did not file an application with the Montana Medical Legal Panel (MMLP) before filing the complaint, as required by \u00a7\u00a7 27-6-301 and -701, MCA (2005). Carey also failed to file an application with the MMLP before the expiration of the three-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-2-205, MCA (2005). Carey later admitted to an error in calculating the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b64 In March 2010, the Labairs filed a legal malpractice complaint against Carey alleging negligence and several other causes of action stemming from the lapsed statute of limitations. In November 2011, the District Court granted summary judgment to Carey on the grounds that the Labairs had failed to establish a prima facie legal malpractice case because they failed to provide expert evidence on causation and damages in the underlying medical malpractice claim. The Labairs appealed, and we reversed and remanded in <em>Labair I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b65 We concluded in <em>Labair I </em>that the Labairs were entitled to summary judgment on the duty, breach, and causation elements of their legal malpractice claim against Carey. We remanded the case to the District Court for a trial to establish two required components of the damages element of the Labairs\u2019 claim: first, \u201cthat it is more probable than not that they would have recovered a settlement or a judgment against Dr. Baumgartner but for Carey\u2019s negligence,\u201d and second, \u201cthe value of the lost settlement and/or judgment.\u201d <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b66 On remand, the District Court conducted a six-day jury trial in which both sides presented expert testimony on the likelihood of a settlement or a judgment in the underlying case and the estimated value of that settlement or judgment. Charles Burdell, the Labairs\u2019 expert witness on settlements, testified that the case could have settled for $500,000 to $750,000. He also testified that over 90% of medical negligence cases settle. Carey\u2019s settlement expert testified that 95% of medical negligence cases settle, and that the Labairs\u2019 claim likely would have settled for $100,000 to $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b67 Both Holly and Robert Labair testified at trial, but neither explicitly said whether or not they would have settled with Dr. Baumgartner. Holly Labair said she believed Steve Carey could help her \u201c[ojbtain justice\u201d and \u201chold [Dr. Baumgartner] accountable.\u201d Steve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Carey testified that Robert Labair was angry at Dr. Baumgartner, but neither the Labairs\u2019 attorney nor Carey actually established the Labairs\u2019 desires regarding settlement. The defense played a videotaped deposition of Dr. Baumgartner, in which Dr. Baumgartner said he would have settled with the Labairs for a nominal amount. No other evidence on the Labairs\u2019 or Dr. Baumgartner\u2019s willingness to settle the underlying medical malpractice claim was presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b68 The jury issued its verdict on a special verdict form, which posed yes or no questions to the jury regarding key elements of the Labairs\u2019 claim. Relevant portions of the verdict form, including the jury\u2019s responses, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">QUESTION NO. 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">Have the Labairs proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Dr. Baumgartner\u2019s treatment of Holly and Dawson Labair failed to meet the accepted standards of skill and care at the time the services were provided?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">ANSWER: [ X ] Yes [ ] No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">If your answer to QUESTION NO. 1 is \u201cNo,\u201d then skip QUESTION NO. 2 and QUESTION NO. 3 and proceed to QUESTION NO. 4.

If your answer to QUESTION NO. 4 if [sic] \u201cYes,\u201d then proceed to QUESTION NO. 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The jury then skipped to Question No. 6, which is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b69 During deliberations, the jury asked the District Court for clarification of Question No. 4: \u201cIn regards to question 4 on the questionare [sic] are we to consider whether the Labairs would have settled or did they just lose the opportunity?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b610 The District Court discussed the jury\u2019s question with counsel for both parties and suggested that the jury be given a new instruction, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">In response to your question, attached hereto,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">You are instructed that the Labairs did lose the opportunity to settle with the dismissal of the underlying case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">The question of 4 is would they have settled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">If your answer is yes, go to question no. 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">If your answer is no go to question no. 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">\u00b611 In accord with M. R. Civ. P. 51(c), the Labairs made a timely and specific objection to the District Court\u2019s proposal, arguing that \u201call we have to prove is that we could have secured a settlement, and the moment Dr. Baumgartner said he would have settled, we proved that.\u201d The District Court disagreed, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-14\">[T]he settlement value has been established, but the question remains ... would the Labairs have taken the settlement? And I don\u2019t know how we get around that question for them. ... I don\u2019t know that, from listening to Mr. Carey\u2019s testimony, that they would have settled....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">\u00b612 The District Court then gave the jury the new instruction, which was identified as Instruction No. 36. With this additional instruction, the jury answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question No. 4, apparently indicating that the Labairs would not have settled the underlying medical malpractice claim. After the jury was discharged, the Labairs orally renewed their objection to Instruction No. 36:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-16\">The Montana Supreme Court did not lay the burden on the plaintiffs of whether they would have settled. There was no way for the plaintiffs to give that testimony if they would have settled without knowing the amount. ... We believe that this instruction to the jury is a reversible error, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-17\">Carey countered that the Labairs\u2019 willingness to settle was an element of proof implied by our holding in <em>Labair I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-18\">[T]he Labairs bore the burden from the beginning, at least since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to prove both that there could have been a settlement and the value of that settlement. It\u2019s a failure of proof on the part of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, and they had all the opportunity in the world to provide that proof to this court and to this jury, and they failed to do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b6 13 The District Court decided to let the jury\u2019s verdict stand, but noted \u201cDr. Baumgartner\u2019s testimony is that he would have only agreed for a minimal settlement on his part,\u201d implying the Labairs also failed to show a potential settlement value that would have been agreeable to both sides. The District Court formally entered judgment on September 22, 2015, from which the Labairs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s selection of jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>Cechovic v. Hardin &amp; Assocs., </em>273 Mont. 104, 116, 902 P.2d 520, 527 (1995). Taken in their entirety, \u201cjury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law.\u201d <em>Goles v. </em>Neumann, 2011 MT 11, \u00b6 9, 359 Mont. 132, 247 P.3d 1089. When a jury instruction is based on a district court\u2019s conclusion of law, we apply a plenary review standard. <em>W. Sec. Bank v. Eide Bailly LLP, </em>2010 MT 291, \u00b6 18, 359 Mont. 34, 249 P.3d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court err in instructing the jury to decide whether the plaintiffs would have settled the medical malpractice claim underlying their legal malpractice suit?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\u00b616 Legal malpractice is a type of professional negligence consisting of four essential elements: (1) a duty owed by the attorney to the client, (2) a breach of that duty, (3) causation, and (4) damages to the client. <em>Labairl, </em>\u00b6 17. Because <em>Labair I </em>established the first three elements of the Labairs\u2019 claim against Carey, the sole issue on remand was damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">\u00b617 It is well established that a plaintiff in a legal malpractice case \u201c \u2018must show by a preponderance of the evidence what injuries he suffered\u2019 \u201d as a result of the malpractice. <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 43 (quoting <em>Lieberman v. Emp\u2019rs Ins. of Wausau, </em>84 N.J. 325, 342, 419 A.2d 417, 426 (N.J. 1980)). Ultimately, the plaintiff must prove that damages are not speculative, but have a sufficient basis in fact. <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 45 (citing <em>Merzlak v. Purcell, </em>252 Mont. 527, 530, 830 P.2d 1278, 1280 (1992)). The method by which the plaintiff proves those injuries is generally left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 43 (citing <em>Lieberman, </em>419 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>A.2d at 427). In cases like the present, proving damages requires a plaintiff to effectively prosecute a \u201csuit within a suit,\u201d wherein the claim underlying the legal malpractice must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence in order to show the legal malpractice caused actual harm. <em>Stott v. Fox, </em>246 Mont. 301, 305, 805 P.2d 1305, 1307 (1990); <em>Richards v. Knuchel, </em>2005 MT 133, \u00b6 18, 327 Mont. 249, 115 P.3d 189, <em>overruled on other grounds hy Labair I, </em>\u00b6 23. The jury in such a case must determine whether a reasonable jury considering the underlying claim could find for the plaintiff. <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>Richards, </em>\u00b6 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b618 We acknowledged in <em>Labair I </em>the difficulty of prescribing the particular types of evidence and presentation that a legal malpractice \u201csuit within the suit\u201d would require. \u201cDifferent types of legal malpractice cases will require different types of evidence and presentation.\u201d <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 44. We also noted the Labairs\u2019 claim against Carey presents a unique case in that the Labairs lost not only the right to sue Dr. Baumgartner and recover a verdict for medical malpractice, but they also lost the opportunity to pursue a pretrial settlement. <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 31. Because the lost possibilities of securing either a verdict or a settlement were each potential injuries, we remanded the case to determine whether the Labairs could prove it was more probable than not that they would have recovered a verdict or a settlement. <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b6 19 On remand, the District Court rightly instructed the jury that the Labairs could not recover for the loss of both a verdict and a settlement. To recover the value of a verdict in the underlying claim, the Labairs would need to prove each element of their underlying claim against Dr. Baumgartner by a preponderance of the evidence. Even if the Labairs failed to prove that they would have recovered a <em>verdict </em>against Dr. Baumgartner, however, the lost possibility of a pretrial settlement with Dr. Baumgartner remained a distinct injury for which the Labairs could recover damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b620 In answering Questions 1 and 2 of the special verdict form, the jury concluded the Labairs proved Dr. Baumgartner breached the standard of care, but that they failed to prove that this breach caused damages. As a result, the Labairs are not entitled to damages that would be recoverable from a verdict in the underlying claim against Dr. Baumgartner. The Labairs do not allege any error in the District Court\u2019s instruction on the question of verdict damages. The sole question on appeal is whether the Labairs satisfied their burden of proving the lost opportunity for a pretrial settlement in the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>claim. Consequently, the crux of this case is the scope of the Labairs\u2019 burden of proof for the lost opportunity to settle.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b621 The Labairs argue <em>Labair I </em>never required them to prove that they would have <em>actually settled </em>with Dr. Baumgartner. Instead, the Labairs interpret <em>Labair I </em>as imposing the more limited burden of proving the likelihood of a settlement and the value of a potential settlement, both of which they established through expert testimony. Carey counters it would be improper to relieve the Labairs of the burden of proving they would have settled with Dr. Baumgartner. While Carey\u2019s negligence undoubtedly deprived the Labairs of the opportunity to settle, Carey argues it is still possible that the Labairs would have refused to settle if the opportunity presented itself. Carey maintains that if the Labairs would have refused to settle, the lost opportunity to settle would not be an actual injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b622 As stated in <em>Labair I, </em>the Labairs\u2019 burden on remand was as follows: \u201cAt trial, the Labairs must establish that it is <em>more probable than not </em>that they would have recovered a settlement or a judgment against Dr. Baumgartner but for Carey\u2019s negligence, as well as the value ofthe lost settlement and/or judgment.\u201d <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 41 (emphasis added). We did not hold the Labairs had to prove they would have settled. Instead, the Labairs were required to prove a settlement was more probable than not. The Labairs clearly satisfied this burden through expert testimony establishing that settlements occur in 90% of cases similar to theirs. That testimony was bolstered by Carey\u2019s expert, who estimated that 95% of medical malpractice cases settle.</p>\n<p id=\"A3J\">\u00b623 The Labairs also satisfied their burden of proving the likely value of the lost opportunity to settle. The Labairs\u2019 settlement expert estimated the likely settlement value would fall between $500,000 and $750,000. Although Carey\u2019s expert testified to a much lower range of settlement values, between $100,000 and $300,000, the jury could weigh this conflicting testimony and determine a value for the lost opportunity. Thus, the Labairs\u2019 evidence was sufficient to satisfy the two-part burden we outlined in <em>Labair I. </em>When the jury asked for clarification of this burden, however, the District Court effectively added a new element: whether the Labairs would have actually accepted a settlement. Moreover, the District Court added this element to the burden of proof after both parties had rested and the case was in the jury\u2019s hands. Because the District Court\u2019s instruction did not fairly instruct the jury on the law of the case we established in <em>Labair I, </em>we conclude that the instruction was an abuse of discretion that demands a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u00b624 Carey maintains this additional element is a logical extension of <em>Labair I, </em>because the Labairs\u2019 willingness to accept a settlement is a prerequisite to actually recovering a settlement. We stated in <em>Labair I, </em>however, that the Labairs simply needed to prove it <em>was more probable than not </em>that they would have recovered a settlement. We did not hold that the Labairs must show they were willing to settle and therefore would have <em>actually recovered </em>a settlement. If we adopted such a rule, it stands to reason that the Labairs must also prove Dr. Baumgartner would have been willing to settle, because a settlement requires the assent of both parties. But it would be impossible to replicate the give-and-take of settlement negotiations with Dr. Baumgartner now that he is shielded from liability by Carey\u2019s negligence. Indeed, Dr. Baumgartner has no incentive to settle now that the Labairs\u2019 claim against him is time-barred. Carey should not be shielded from liability simply because his own negligence makes it impossible to prove today what the parties would have done in settlement negotiations years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"APV0\">\u00b625 The appropriate burden of proof is the one we established in <em>Labair I. </em>The Labairs must prove two elements to recover for the lost opportunity to settle with Dr. Baumgartner: (1) that they more probably than not would have recovered a settlement with Dr. Baumgartner, and (2) the likely range of value of the lost settlement. We note that neither Question No. 4 of the special verdict form nor Instruction No. 36 clearly posed this first element as a question for the jury. Question No. 4 asked whether the Labairs had \u201cproven by a preponderance of the evidence that Holly and Robert Labair lost the opportunity to recover a settlement from Dr. Baumgartner as a result of Steve Carey\u2019s and the Carey Law Firm\u2019s admitted negligence.\u201d This determination, however, was established as law of the case by virtue of our conclusion in <em>Labair I </em>that the Labairs did in fact lose the opportunity to settle. Instruction No. 36 corrected this error, but then proceeded to direct the jury to answer the subjective question of whether the Labairs would have actually settled, when <em>Labair I </em>required only that they answer the obj ective question of whether it was more probable than not that they would have recovered a settlement. At this stage, the threshold question for the jury should have been whether the Labairs had proven that they more probably than not would have recovered a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"AXc\">\u00b626 Because both parties\u2019 experts testified that a settlement was more probable than not, the Labairs argue judgment as a matter of law is appropriate on this threshold question. We agree. \u201cJudgment as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>matter of law is properly granted only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury.\u201d <em>Martin v. BNSF Ry. Co., </em>2015 MT 167, \u00b6 8, 379 Mont. 423, 352 P.3d 598 (citing <em>Weber v. BNSF Ry. Co., </em>2011 MT 223, \u00b6 16, 362 Mont. 53, 261 P.3d 984). When considering whether judgment as a matter of law is proper, we view evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing such judgment. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>Weber, </em>\u00b6 16). By the lowest estimate presented at trial, the probability of settlement was 90%. The only evidence that comes close to contradicting this estimate is testimony from Carey\u2019s expert, who stated that the Labairs\u2019 specific claim \u201chad a better-than-even chance of settlement if they would have been willing to accept\u201d a settlement. Setting aside the fact that this testimony is couched in the Labairs\u2019 willingness to settle, which we have held is not dispositive of their recovery, the testimony nonetheless shows that a settlement was more probable than not. Even considering this evidence in the light most favorable to Carey, the only reasonable conclusion is that the Labairs more probably than not would have recovered a settlement. Thus, we conclude that the Labairs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this first element of settlement damages.</p>\n<p id=\"A1ZY\">\u00b627 In the new trial, the District Court need not revisit the question of whether Dr. Baumgartner\u2019s treatment of Holly and Dawson Labair failed to meet accepted standards of care, as the jury here answered that question in the affirmative. In addition, the District Court need not revisit the question of damages for a lost opportunity to recover a <em>verdict. </em>As explained above, the jury already resolved that question in Carey\u2019s favor, and the Labairs do not allege the District Court erred in instructing the jury on that question. <em>See supra </em>\u00b6 20. Instead, the new trial will address damages for the lost opportunity to settle with Dr. Baumgartner. Because the Labairs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the first element of settlement damages, the only remaining evidentiary burden borne by the Labairs is showing the likely range of value of a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b628 For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand for a new trial on the question of the value of the lost opportunity to settle.</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b268-8\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"A5q1\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u00b629 I concur with the Court\u2019s disposition of this appeal based on the law of the case established in <em>Labair I. </em>I do not conclude from this disposition, however, that a plaintiff in every legal malpractice case is relieved from the burden of proving that she would have accepted a settlement. It is not necessary for us to decide that here, and I do not interpret today\u2019s decision to settle that question as a matter of law.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b269-4\">JUSTICE MCKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"Abq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b630 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to reverse and remand for a new trial. In my opinion, the Court has rewritten <em>Labair I; </em>changed the law of the case, to the extent the law of <em>Labair I </em>could reasonably be discerned; and conflated burdens of proof for causation and damages. The District Court labored onerously in its commitment to follow and understand our decision in <em>Labair I. </em>The court\u2019s instruction that the Labairs must show that they would have <em>actually </em>settled is a correct statement of the law of negligence. However, regardless of the correctness of the instruction, when examining the context of the entire record \u2014 the jury instructions as a whole; the Special Verdict form (to which no objection was made); and, in particular, our confusing reasoning in <em>Labair </em>I \u2014 I cannot find that the District Court abused its discretion when it instructed the jury that for the Labairs to recover the jury must find they \u201cwould have settled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYi\">\u00b631 Our decision results from our efforts in <em>Labair I </em>to create an injury and fashion a remedy which was not only novel and unique, but distanced this Court from the mainstay of authority provided by other jurisdictions. In <em>Labair I, </em>we recognized, for the first time and devoid of any authority, that a loss of opportunity to <em>settle </em>a claim can be an injury. Although we cited as authority for creating this new injury <em>Jenkins v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>422 So.2d 1109, 110 (La. 1982), stating \u201c[o]ther jurisdictions have similarly recognized that the loss of the opportunity to <em>bring a claim </em>can constitute prima facie evidence of an injury,\u201d <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 32, (emphasis added), <em>Jenkins </em>considered only the lost opportunity to bring a claim and not the lost opportunity to settle a claim. It is well established that the loss of opportunity to bring a claim is a recognizable cause of action in legal malpractice cases which, within the framework of a \u201csuit within a suit,\u201d is a compensable injury if causation is demonstrated. However, there is no authority recognizing a right to settlement and injuries resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>from a loss of settlement opportunity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, while we recognized a distinction in the type of injury between a lost opportunity to bring a claim and a lost opportunity to settle a claim, we failed to appreciate a distinction in causation and damages between the injuries and to instruct the trial court on remand accordingly. Had we done so, we might have seen the fallacy of our reasoning in allowing the pursuit of a claim for loss of opportunity to settle. The court, counsel, and the jury had the misfortune of laboring under our guidance in <em>Labair I. </em>In my opinion, despite the unmanageability of <em>Labair I, </em>the jury recognized and dealt with the salient issue in these proceedings \u2014 that the Labairs were not interested in settling their claim. I would not prolong the agony of this case and add another layer of poorly reasoned precedent by finding an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b632 Settlements result from a multitude of unique factors, including the mental disposition of the parties, which are difficult to account for when considering causation and damages. Preliminarily, in my opinion, \u201c[t]here is \u201cno \u2018right\u2019 to a settlement, which is an extra-judicial action of the parties taken for any number of reasons, some of which are completely unrelated to a claim\u2019s validity.\u201d <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 63 n. 1 (J. Rice, concurring). The District Court\u2019s misfortunes stem from our creation in <em>Labair I </em>of a stand-alone injury of a loss of settlement potential, and our statements implying that causation for such a claim has already been established by Carey\u2019s admission of duty and breach of that duty. Furthermore, we conflated causation for these two distinct injuries. In <em>Labair I, </em>we held that \u201cCarey was the cause-in-fact of the Labairs\u2019 loss of their medical malpractice case <em>...f Labair I, </em>\u00b6 39 n. 5: that is, that Carey was the cause-in-fact of the Labairs\u2019 loss of the opportunity to <em>bring a claim. </em>It does not follow, however, that such a conclusion is equally dispositive of a lost opportunity to settle. There is little question that by hiring a lawyer and pursuing a medical malpractice action, the Labairs intended to <em>bring a </em>claim; however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>same cannot be said regarding an intention to <em>settle a claim, </em>especially when there was evidence indicating the Labairs were not interested in settling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury and the District Court, in contrast to this Court in <em>Labair I </em>and here, appreciated these distinctions. While the Labairs\u2019 counsel protested and argued that another burden was being placed upon the Labairs, the court\u2019s instruction that the Labairs would have actually accepted a settlement was consistent with the law of causation and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b633 It is thus painfully apparent that the issues in the current appeal arise from our inconsistencies and incorrect reasoning regarding causation and damages <em>in Labair I. </em>We stated in <em>Labair I </em>that \u201c[u]nder circumstances such as this \u2014 where duty and breach are admitted, and an untimely filing caused the loss of a claim with some value \u2014 legal causation can be decided as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 36. Despite our conclusion that causation was established as a matter of law, <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 36, and fact, <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 39 n. 5, we remanded for the Labairs to establish, within the context of a \u201csuit within a suit\u201d analysis, that \u201cit is more probable than not that they would have recovered a settlement or a judgment against Dr. Baumgartner <em>but for </em>Carey\u2019s negligence, as well as the value of the lost settlement and/or judgment.\u201d <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 41 (emphasis added). It makes no sense to, first, remove from determination by a jury the question of causation, finding it established as a matter of law and leaving nothing but the amount of damages to be ascertained by a jury. It is, second, inconsistent to next remand for causation to be established \u2014 \u201cthey would have recovered a settlement... but for Carey\u2019s negligence....\u201d <em>Labair I, </em>f 41. Our use of \u201cbut for\u201d language relates to causation, which, after examining our precedent discussing \u201cproximate cause\u201d within the context of a legal malpractice action, we concluded was the appropriate test to be applied. <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 21 (\u201cWe take this opportunity to clarify our previous legal malpractice jurisprudence and reconcile the causation analysis with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Busta </em>....\u201d). Nonetheless, we simultaneously established causation as a matter of law, <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 36, while remanding for the jury to determine causation in the context of a \u201csuit within a suit.\u201d <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 41. Significantly, with respect to this inconsistency, we fail to distinguish between causation and damages respecting loss of opportunity to <em>bring </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>a claim, </em>and that of a loss of opportunity to <em>settle a claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b634 Today, the Court rewrites <em>Labair I, </em>in favor of the Labairs, to definitively conclude that causation regarding the loss of opportunity to settle a claim, in addition to causation to bring a claim, was established in <em>Labair </em>7 as a matter of law. The Court enters judgment as a matter of law on duty, breach, and causation, leaving only the amount of damages to be determined by a jury. First, as already seen, we were inconsistent in <em>Labair I </em>regarding causation and, in particular, its relationship to damages. Second, we failed to appreciate a distinction in causation between the two types of injuries. There is no question that by hiring a lawyer and pursuing a medical malpractice action, the Labairs intended to bring a claim which they lost the opportunity to pursue. However, the same cannot be said for an intention to accept and settle a claim, which must first be demonstrated before the Labairs can receive damages as compensation for the injury of a lost opportunity to pursue settlement. Accordingly, in establishing a new \u201ctwo-part burden\u201d we have changed the law of the case by removing the requirement that the Labairs demonstrate they would have accepted a settlement and that \u201cbut for\u201d Carey\u2019s negligence they lost the opportunity to settle. Instead, we include what was omitted in <em>Labair I </em>by concluding \u201c[t]his determination, however, was established as law of the case by virtue of our conclusion in <em>Labair I </em>that the Labairs did in fact lose the opportunity to settle.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 25. Thus, the only remaining element the Labairs must establish is the \u201clikely range of value of a settlement.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 27. <em>(See also </em>Opinion, \u00b6 26; \u201cthus we conclude that the Labairs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this first element [but for causation] of settlement damages.\u201d) We arrive at this conclusion despite the jury having found that Carey\u2019s failure to file a claim was not the cause of the Labairs\u2019 injuries, both for the loss of opportunity to bring a claim and the loss of opportunity to settle a claim. This leaves us with the unbelievable and astounding proposition that, in a negligence action, this Court may remove from consideration by a jury nearly the entire action \u2014 duty, breach, causation, and damages \u2014 leaving only the <em>amount </em>of damages to be determined by the jury. While we may not have stated this clearly in <em>Labair I, </em>we do so, unfortunately, here. The Court\u2019s reasoning, at the very least, is unprecedented.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b635 Finally, I would be remiss if I failed to point out that the District Court\u2019s instruction to the jury that it must find the Labairs actually would have settled was, in fact, a correct statement of the law. A legal malpractice case is a negligence action that imposes a standard of care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that is both objective and external, rather than that of individual judgment. \u201cIt must be the same for all persons, since the law can have no favorites; and yet allowance must be made for some of the differences between individuals, the risk apparent to the actor, his capacity to meet it, and the circumstances under which he must act.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 283 cmt. c (1965). The law of torts attempts to \u201cput an injured person in a position as nearly as possible equivalent to his position prior to the tort.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 901 cmt a (1965). Attorney malpractice is professional negligence. \u201cThe proper measure of damage in an attorney malpractice action is the difference between the client\u2019s recovery and the amount that would have been recovered by the client except for the attorney\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Merzlak v. Purcell, </em>252 Mont. 527, 529, 830 P.2d 1278, 1279 (1992). A claim of malpractice must have resulted in damages. <em>Kane v. Miller, </em>258 Mont. 182, 187, 852 P.2d 130, 133 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b636 In contrast to the duty of care element for a negligence action, we do not impose an objective standard or \u201creasonable man\u201d standard when determining whether causation has been established and damages have been incurred. Hence, the Court is incorrect when it concludes that the District Court, by requiring the Labairs to establish they would have actually settled, imposed an additional, subjective burden of proof upon the Labairs. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. Contrary to the Court\u2019s reasoning, whether the Labairs themselves did indeed sustain damages is a subjective inquiry which examines the particular circumstances of the Labairs\u2019 situation. Proof of damages means that the recovering party has demonstrated that they would have actually recovered; that is, under the circumstances present here, that they would have accepted the settlement. This is in accord with jurisdictions that have considered the failure of an attorney to communicate a settlement offer. <em>See Cannistra v. O\u2019Connor, McGuinness, Conte, Doyle, Oleson &amp; Collins, </em>286 A.D.2d 314, 316 (N.Y. App. Div. 2001) (\u201cHere, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that, but for the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence, they would have accepted the County\u2019s settlement offer and not have sustained any damages.\u201d); <em>Bauza v. Livington, </em>40 A.D.3d 791 (N.Y. 2007) (\u201cHere, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that, but for the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence, they would have accepted the defendant\u2019s offer of settlement[.]\u201d). To recover in any negligence action, there is always a requirement that the damages be the plaintiffs actual damages which, by their very nature, is not an objective standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b637 When reviewing a trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury, we consider the instructions in their entirety, in connection with other instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>given, and the evidence introduced at trial. Instructions to the jury-must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. <em>Goles, </em>\u00b6 9. Consistent with <em>Labair I, </em>the court instructed the jury repeatedly that the Labairs had to show they \u201cwould have recovered\u201d a judgment or settlement from Dr. Baumgartner. Consistent with general principles in negligence law of causation and damages, the court responded to a specific question from the jury, likely prompted by their assessment that the Labairs were not interested in settling, that the Labairs had to demonstrate that they would have accepted a settlement. In my opinion, this was an accurate statement of the law and was within the court\u2019s broad discretion to assess whether its response went beyond the parties\u2019 expectations when presenting their case to the jury. The distinction between \u201cwould have settled\u201d and \u201cwould have recovered a settlement\u201d is immaterial and does not warrant reversal and remand for a new trial. When considered with all the instructions given and the confusing analysis we provided in <em>Labair I, </em>I cannot fault the District Court and find an abuse of discretion when it instructed the jury that they must find the Labairs \u201cwould have settled\u201d in order to recover for their lost opportunity to settle. The Labairs received a jury trial on their claims and the jury found causation did not exist between Carey\u2019s negligence and the Labairs\u2019 lost opportunity to bring a claim and settle a claim. The Labairs\u2019 substantial rights have not been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b638 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision holding otherwise.</p>\n<judges id=\"b274-5\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-5\"> <em>Jenkins </em>simply does not stand for the proposition we cited it for: recognition of a loss of settlement of a claim; <em>Jenkins </em>concerns the loss of opportunity to bring a claim. <em>Spencer, </em>also cited in <em>Labair </em>7, \u00b6 32, was decided within the context of a criminal matter and the loss of opportunity to bring a post-conviction proceeding. It likewise is not authority for the creation of a loss of opportunity to settle in a medical malpractice action. <em>Jenkins, </em>which followed the majority line of cases, recognized that the \u201csuit within the suit\u201d would necessitate examining the success of the underlying court action in the post-conviction proceedings, a matter which is more easily susceptible to a causation analysis than the likelihood of settlement in a medical malpractice action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-5\"> Indeed, Holly Labair testified that she \u201cabsolutely [did] not\u201d bring this lawsuit against Dr. Baumgartner for the money.
