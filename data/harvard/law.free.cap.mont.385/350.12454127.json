We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\"><em>Issue: Did the District Court err when it dismissed Crawford\u2019s claims for lack of subject matter </em>jurisdiction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">\u00b63 On March 13, 2012, Crawford was pulled over by Couture on the Flathead Reservation. Couture identified each person in the vehicle, arrested one, letting Crawford and the others leave. Couture was then in contact with Crawford\u2019s parole officer, who informed Couture that Crawford was in violation of his parole because he did not have permission to be traveling in that area. On March 17, 2012, Lake County Deputy Sheriff Levi Read (Read) arrested Crawford on the Flathead Reservation upon a warrant issued by Butte-Silver Bow County Probation for parole violations. The State charged Crawford with criminal possession of dangerous drugs. A jury found him guilty. Crawford appealed his conviction and we affirmed in <em>State v. Robert Lee Crawford, </em>2016 MT 96, 383 Mont. 229, 371 P.3d 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">\u00b64 During his appeal, Crawford filed the instant complaint in state court seeking recovery from the named defendants. Crawford alleged numerous claims including libel, slander, false imprisonment, and injuries involving property due to inappropriate conduct by Couture. The Tribes, on behalf of the Tribes, Couture, and the Police Department filed a motion to dismiss the complaint or in the alternative summary judgment. The District Court granted the Tribes motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the sovereign immunity of the Tribe. Crawford appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">\u00b65 \u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Big Spring v. Conway (In re Estate of Big Spring), </em>2011 MT 109, \u00b6 20, 360 Mont. 370, 255 P.3d 121 (citing <em>Cooper v. Glaser, </em>2010 MT 55, \u00b6 6, 355 Mont. 342, 228 P.3d 443). \u201cA district court must determine whether the complaint states facts that, if true, would vest the court with the subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>jurisdiction. This determination by a district court is a conclusion of law that we review for correctness.\u201d <em>Big Spring, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>Meagher v. Butte-Silver Bow City-County, </em>2007 MT 129, \u00b6 13, 337 Mont. 339, 160 P.3d 552).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u00b66 <em>Issue: Did the District Court err in dismissing Crawford\u2019s claims for lack of subject matter </em>jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u00b67 Absent express authorization by Congress, state courts lack jurisdiction over Indian tribes and tribal members within their reservations. <em>Williams v. Lee, </em>358 U.S. 217, 223, 79 S. Ct. 269, 272 (1959). When analyzing both regulatory and adjudicatory actions involving tribes and their members for conduct occurring within tribal territory, the State must determine if the \u201cexercise of jurisdiction by a state court or regulatory body is preempted by federal law.\u201d <em>Big Spring, </em>\u00b6 46. If it is not preempted then the State must determine if the \u201caction infringes on tribal self government.\u201d <em>Big Spring, </em>\u00b6 46. If either is present, the state court will not have subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AKQ\">\u00b68  The State does not have subject matter jurisdiction over Crawford\u2019s claims. Congress has not authorized state jurisdiction of civil claims against the Tribe or tribal officers. <em>See Williams, </em>358 U.S. at 223, 79 S. Ct. at 272. Further, Crawford\u2019s claims do not fall under the limited concurrent jurisdiction agreement between the Tribes and the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1360 (P.L. 280); <em>see also </em>Laws of the CSKT \u00a7 1-2-105 (2013). Crawford has not identified any basis in federal law that would provide the State court jurisdiction over his claims. His claims are preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">\u00b69 Tribal self-governance would also be infringed upon if the State asserted jurisdiction. Crawford\u2019s claims are against the Tribe, tribal members, and tribal government departments regarding a series of events occurring entirely within the exterior boundaries of the reservation. There is no scenario where the state would not be infringing on the Tribes right to self-governance in this case if state jurisdiction was asserted. \u201c[T]he exercise of state jurisdiction over activities occurring entirely on Indian lands is an infringement on inherent tribal authority and is contrary to principles of self-government and tribal sovereignty.\u201d <em>In re Fair Hearing of Hanna, </em>2010 MT 38, \u00b6 17, 355 Mont. 236, 227 P.3d 596 (citing Flat <em>Ctr. Farms, Inc. v. State, </em>2002 MT 140, \u00b6 13, 310 Mont. 206, 49 P.3d 578).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">\u00b610 The Tribe is a sovereign authority with the authority over its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>members and its territories. Tribes are \u201c \u2018domestic dependent nations\u2019 that exercise inherent sovereign authority over their members and territories.\u2019 \u201d <em>Confederated Salish &amp; Kootenai Tribes v. Clinch, </em>2007 MT 63, \u00b6 18, 336 Mont. 302, 158 P.3d 377 (citing <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v. Potawatomi Tribe, </em>498 U.S. 505, 509, 111 S. Ct. 905, 909 (1991)). \u201cSuits against Indian tribes are ... barred by sovereign immunity absent a clear waiver or congressional abrogation.\u201d <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>498 U.S. at 509, 111 S. Ct. at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"arv-dedup-1\">\u00b611  The District Court properly dismissed Crawford\u2019s claims based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction and sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\u00b612 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-8\">JUSTICES WHEAT, SHEA, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
