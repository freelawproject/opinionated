Krebs challenged the prior conviction\u2019s applicability, arguing that the State failed to meet its burden of showing that the prior conviction could be used to enhance the penalty for his conviction to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>felony. The District Court disagreed and imposed a felony sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"ALpp\">\u00b62 We reverse because the State had the burden of demonstrating the existence of qualifying convictions for purposes of enhancing Krebs\u2019s penalty to a felony DUI and did not meet it.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b63 The State charged Krebs with felony DUI in June 2014. The probable cause affidavit alleged that Krebs had three prior DUI convictions \u2014 two from North Dakota in 1988 and 2006, and one from Montana in 1991. Krebs filed a motion challenging the 1988 North Dakota conviction\u2019s applicability, arguing that the 1988 conviction should not qualify as a conviction sufficient to enhance the penalty for his 2014 charge to a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b64 Krebs contended that the State bore the burden to prove that the 1988 conviction was a qualifying conviction. Krebs maintained that it was impossible to determine whether the 1988 conviction was a \u201cblood alcohol concentration\u201d (BAC) conviction or an \u201cunder the influence\u201d conviction because, under North Dakota\u2019s statutory framework, the same statute governed both offenses. In contrast, there are distinct Montana statutes that govern BAC convictions and \u201cunder the influence\u201d convictions. Krebs asserted that it was the State\u2019s burden to prove whether the 1988 conviction was an \u201cunder the influence\u201d conviction or a BAC conviction. If the 1988 conviction was a BAC conviction, Krebs asserted that it would have been expunged under Montana law. Alternatively, if it were an \u201cunder the influence\u201d conviction, Krebs contended that it could not count as a qualifying conviction pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-734, MCA, because it was not a substantially similar offense given the differences between North Dakota\u2019s and Montana\u2019s definitions of \u201cunder the influence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b65 The State countered that Krebs bore the burden to prove whether the 1988 conviction was an \u201cunder the influence\u201d or a BAC conviction. Prior to hearing Krebs\u2019s motion, the District Court requested supplemental information regarding the nature of the 1988 conviction. Both parties agreed that the register of actions from the North Dakota court was the only documentation available, as the court file had been destroyed. The register showed only that Krebs had been convicted of DUI; it did not indicate whether the 1988 conviction was an \u201cunder the influence\u201d or a BAC conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u00b66 The District Court denied Krebs\u2019s motion following a hearing. The court concluded that it was Krebs\u2019s burden to prove the nature of the 1988 conviction. Because Krebs failed to show that the 1988 conviction was expunged from his record, the District Court concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>1988 conviction could be used to support the felony charge. Krebs pleaded guilty to the felony, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b67 Whether a prior conviction may be used to enhance a criminal sentence is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>State v. Burns, </em>2011 MT 167, \u00b6 17, 361 Mont. 191, 256 P.3d 944; <em>State v. Maine, </em>2011 MT 90, \u00b6 12, 360 Mont. 182, 255 P.3d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b68 <em>Whether the State is required to prove the existence of a qualifying conviction in order to treat an alleged fourth DUI offense as a felony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aj1\">\u00b69 The District Court treated Krebs\u2019s motion as a motion to dismiss. The court acknowledged that \u201c[t]he record is inadequate to provide the Court with sufficient information as to whether [Krebs\u2019s 1988 conviction] was a BAC conviction or an \u2018under the influence\u2019 conviction.\u201d In addition, the court agreed with Krebs that if his 1988 conviction was a BAC conviction, it would have been expunged from his record and therefore it would not count for sentence enhancement purposes. The court concluded, however, that the burden was on Krebs to provide the court \u201cwith sufficient information supporting any argument that his 1988 DUI conviction was a BAC conviction.\u201d In doing so, the court relied on the procedural framework we established in <em>Maine </em>to evaluate collateral challenges to prior convictions. Because Krebs failed to meet the burden imposed by <em>Maine, </em>the District Court concluded that the 1988 conviction was valid for enhancing his 2014 charge to felony DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\u00b610 On appeal, the State agrees that if the 1988 conviction had been a BAC conviction, it would not qualify as a conviction for purposes of enhancing the new DUI to felony status. Relying exclusively on <em>Maine, </em>the State contends that it was Krebs\u2019s \u201cburden to produce direct evidence that the prior conviction is invalid.\u201d (Quoting <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 12). The State contends further that it provided sufficient evidence of Krebs\u2019s 1988 conviction by introducing the North Dakota court\u2019s register of actions. Because Krebs was the moving party, and he \u201conly disputed the type of DUI conviction,\u201d the State argues that the \u201cburden of proof clearly\u201d remained with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">\u00b611 The District Court\u2019s and the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Maine </em>is misplaced. In <em>Maine, </em>the defendant argued that a prior DUI conviction used to enhance his conviction to felony DUI was \u201cconstitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>infirm\u201d and was therefore invalid. <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 35. Our purpose in <em>Maine </em>was \u201cto clarify the procedure on <em>these sorts of collateral attacks </em>on prior convictions.\u201d <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 17 (emphasis added). We grounded our analysis in the well-established principle that a constitutionally infirm conviction may not be used to support an enhanced punishment. <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28, 33. We recognized also that the State has an interest \u201cin deterring habitual offenders\u201d and \u201cin the finality of convictions.\u201d <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b612 Balancing these interests, we concluded that \u201ca rebuttable presumption of regularity attaches to [a] prior conviction, and we presume that the convicting court complied with the law in all respects.\u201d <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 33. We held therefore that when a defendant collaterally attacks the validity of a prior conviction on the ground that the conviction is constitutionally infirm, the defendant bears the \u201cinitial burden to demonstrate that the prior conviction is constitutionally infirm.\u201d <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 33. In other words, under <em>Maine, </em>it is the defendant \u201cwho must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the conviction is <em>invalid,\u201d Maine, </em>\u00b6 34 (emphasis in original). Imposing the burden of proving the prior conviction\u2019s constitutional infirmity on the defendant does not violate due process \u201conce [the] state <em>proves the fact </em>of a prior conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Okland, </em>283 Mont. 10, 17, 941 P.2d 431, 435 (1997) <em>(citing Parke v. Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 29, 113 S. Ct. 517, 523 (1992)) (emphasis added). We have applied the <em>Maine </em>framework consistently in cases where a defendant attempts this type of collateral attack on a prior DUI conviction. <em>E.g., State v. Hancock, </em>2016 MT 21, 382 Mont. 141, 364 P.3d 1258; <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2015 MT 221, 380 Mont. 198, 356 P.3d 438; <em>State v. Nixon, </em>2012 MT 316, 367 Mont. 495, 291 P.3d 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b613 But here, Krebs admits that he was validly convicted in 1988. He is not questioning whether the North Dakota court complied with the law or violated his constitutional rights. Rather, he is asserting that the State had the burden of proving the fact that the 1988 conviction qualified as a predicate for the felony charge in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b614 Montana\u2019s statutory framework establishes separate offenses for driving under the influence and for driving with excessive blood alcohol concentration. Sections 61-8-401, -406, MCA. After three qualifying convictions, a defendant convicted of a fourth or subsequent offense is guilty of a felony and subject to an enhanced penalty. Section 61-8-731(1), MCA. Under current law, \u201call previous convictions,\u201d whether \u201cunder the influence\u201d or BAC, \u201cmust be used for sentencing purposes\u201d no matter when they occurred. Section 61-8-734(l)(b)-(c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b615 Under the law in effect at the time of Krebs\u2019s 1988 conviction, however, a person\u2019s prior BAC conviction would be \u201cexpunged from the defendant\u2019s record\u201d if he or she did not receive another BAC conviction within five years. <em>State v. Sidmore, </em>286 Mont. 218, 227, 951 P.2d 558, 564 (1997) (quoting \u00a7 61-8-722(6), MCA (1989)). This remained true even if the person received an \u201cunder the influence\u201d conviction within five years of receiving a BAC conviction. <em>Sidmore, </em>286 Mont. at 227, 951 P.2d at 564. Thus, a BAC conviction that was not followed by another BAC conviction within that five-year period could not \u201cbe counted to support [a] charge of felony DUI.\u201d <em>Sidmore, </em>286 Mont. at 227, 951 P.2d at 564; <em>accord State v. Beckman, </em>284 Mont. 459, 466, 944 P.2d 756, 761 (1997); <em>State v. Cooney, </em>284 Mont. 500, 508, 945 P.2d 891, 895 (1997); <em>State v. Brander, </em>280 Mont. 148, 155, 930 P.2d 31, 36 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b616 The parties do not dispute that if Krebs\u2019s 1988 conviction was a BAC conviction, it could not have been used to support a felony charge under \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA, because he did not receive another BAC conviction in the subsequent five years. The parties do dispute, however, who bears the burden of proving whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cconviction\u201d that may be used to support felony enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b617 As noted, in order to be sentenced for felony DUI, a person must have four or more qualifying convictions. Section 61-8-731, MCA; <em>Sidmore, </em>286 Mont. at 227, 951 P.2d at 564. Analogous are the statutes governing persistent felony offenders, which require that an offender have two or more qualifying felony convictions. Section 46-18-501, MCA. In both instances, prior convictions are considered at sentencing. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>178 Mont. 280, 284, 583 P.2d 435, 437 (1978) (concluding that the State had to present evidence of prior DUI convictions at sentencing, not at a defendant\u2019s trial for third DUI); \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA (\u201cSentencing of persistent felony offender\u201d). We have analogized sentencing procedures for multiple DUI convictions to the sentencing procedures for repeat felony offenders in the past. <em>Nelson, </em>178 Mont. at 284, 583 P.2d at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b618 In the persistent felony offender context, we have concluded that \u201cin order to present evidence of a prior conviction in a sentencing proceeding there must be <em>competent proof </em>that the defendant in fact suffered the prior conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Lamere, </em>202 Mont. 313, 321, 658 P.2d 376, 380 (1983) <em>(citing State v. Cooper, </em>158 Mont. 102, 489 P.2d 99 (1971)) (emphasis in original); <em>accord State v. Farnsworth, </em>240 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>328, 334, 783 P.2d 1365, 1369 (1989) (concluding that the \u201cDistrict Court relied on competent evidence... to establish the requirements of the persistent felony offender statute\u201d); <em>State v. Smith, </em>232 Mont. 156, 160, 755 P.2d 569, 571-72 (1988) (agreeing that \u201cbecause the Court relied on competent evidence in sentencing [the defendant],\u201d the court properly sentenced the defendant as a persistent felony offender). Requiring competent proof of a prior conviction \u201chas nothing to do with the validity of the conviction.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>158 Mont. at 109, 489 P.2d at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b619 As demonstrated above, Krebs is not challenging the 1988 conviction\u2019s validity; he is challenging whether the 1988 conviction may be used to enhance his penalty to felony status. It is the State\u2019s burden to \u201cprove[ ] the fact of a prior conviction.\u201d <em>See Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 17, 941 P.2d at 435. And the State must do so by presenting <em>\u201ccompetent prooftheA </em>the defendant in fact suffered the prior conviction.\u201d <em>Lamere, </em>202 Mont. at 321, 658 P.2d at 380. The District Court acknowledged that \u201c[t]he record is inadequate to provide the Court with sufficient information as to whether [Krebs\u2019s 1988 conviction] was a BAC conviction or an \u2018under the influence\u2019 conviction.\u201d An \u201cinadequate record\u201d cannot be competent proof that Krebs in fact suffered a prior conviction that would qualify to enhance his penalty to a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"AHg\">\u00b620 We conclude that the State bore the burden to prove that the 1988 conviction could be used to support its felony charge against Krebs and that the State failed to meet this burden. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b621 Because our resolution of this issue is dispositive, we need not address whether North Dakota\u2019s and Montana\u2019s definitions of \u201cunder the influence\u201d are substantially similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\u00b622 We reverse and remand to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA, COTTER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
