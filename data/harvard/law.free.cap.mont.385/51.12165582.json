Resource Councils challenged the Montana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation\u2019s (the Board) approval of well stimulation activities at the site, claiming that they were denied a meaningful opportunity to participate in the process. The Thirteenth Judicial District Court held that Resource Councils\u2019 concerns were speculative and therefore not ripe for judgment. We disagree and hold that Resource Councils\u2019 claims are ripe for judicial review. We conclude that the Board did not violate their right to participate in its consideration of the permit issued in this case. We thus find it unnecessary to decide whether the Board\u2019s \u201c48-hour notice\u201d rule may be unconstitutional in other circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">\u00b62 The Montana Constitution guarantees citizens a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d to participate in government operations. Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 8. In executing this constitutional mandate, agencies are obligated to \u201cdevelop procedures for permitting and encouraging the public to participate in agency decisions that are of significant interest to the public.\u201d Section 2-3-103, MCA. As a quasi-judicial state agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>administratively attached to the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, the Board is required to ensure public participation in its decision-making procedural processes. Sections 2-3-103,2-4-201,2-15-3303, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b63 The Board\u2019s procedural rules require oil and gas well operators to file an application for a permit to drill with the Board. Admin. R. M. 36.22.601(1). If the proposed well is outside of an existing oil and gas field delineated by the Board, the operator must publish notice of its intent to drill and file proof of publication with the Board. Admin. R. M. 36.22.601(1). The application for a permit to drill must be set for notice and public hearing if an interested person demands an opportunity to be heard pursuant to the procedures provided for under the relevant Administrative Rules. Admin. R. M. 36.22.601(4). Following a hearing, the Board may either grant or deny the permit. Admin. R. M. 36.22.601(5). If the Board grants the permit, it may impose \u201csuch conditions\u201d as it finds \u201cproper and necessary.\u201d Admin. R. M. 36.22.601(5)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b64 Well completion activities such as \u201chydraulic fracturing, acidizing, or other chemical stimulation ... are considered permitted activities under the drilling permit for that well only if the processes, anticipated volumes, and types of materials planned for use are expressly described in the permit application for that well.\u201d Admin. R. M. 36.22.608(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Admin. R. M. 36.22.608(2) (the Rule) provides that for exploratory wells \u2014 like the well at issue here \u2014 the well operator must notify the Board of its \u201cintent to stimulate or chemically treat a well... prior to commencing such activities.\u201d The well operator must describe the \u201cfracturing, acidizing, or other chemical treatment\u201d in the notice, and the operator must give the Board notice \u201cat least 48 hours before commencement of well stimulation activities.\u201d Admin. R. M. 36.22.608(2)(a). A well operator is required to disclose the amount and type of materials used in its well stimulation activities, Admin. R. M. 36.22.1015, and comply with safety and well control requirements if it engages in hydraulic fracturing, Admin. R. M. 36.22.1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b65 In October 2013, Energy Corporation of America (Energy Corp.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>announced that it planned to develop oil and gas leases in the Beartooth Mountains. Energy Corp. then filed an application with the Board for a permit to drill an exploratory oil and gas well in Carbon County known as the Hunt Creek 1-H well (Hunt Creek Well). Energy Corp.\u2019s application did not describe any well completion activities pursuant to Admin. R. M. 36.22.608(1). Resource Councils, which are affiliated grassroots conservation and agriculture groups, objected to the permit. Despite procedural problems with Resource Councils\u2019 objection, the Board held a hearing on Energy Corp.\u2019s drilling permit application in February 2014. Nine local residents and an expert testified on behalf of Resource Councils. The residents presented their concerns with the permit application, the environmental assessment\u2019s adequacy, and the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing at the Hunt Creek Well. The expert, an environmental geologist, testified and submitted a report highlighting the risks associated with the proposed drilling plan as well as risks associated with hydraulic fracturing at the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b66 During the hearing, the Board noted that Energy Corp. proposed drilling an exploratory well to evaluate the site\u2019s potential for development. The Board emphasized that Energy Corp.\u2019s application did not propose hydraulic fracturing and that there was no indication from the application that hydraulic fracturing was planned in the future. At the close of the hearing, the Board approved the permit with the condition that Energy Corp. comply with certain water standards should it propose hydraulic fracturing at the Hunt Creek Well in the future. The Board\u2019s order approving the permit reiterated that Energy Corp. did not propose hydraulic fracturing at the Hunt Creek Well.</p>\n<p id=\"AD2\">\u00b67 On July 7, 2014, Energy Corp. submitted a sundry notice to the Board pursuant to the Rule. In its notice, Energy Corp. indicated that it intended to \u201cstimulate\u201d or \u201cchemically treat\u201d the Hunt Creek Well and \u201cperform a diagnostic fracture injection test\u201d (diagnostic test) on the well. The notice provided a detailed description of the planned work and stated that the well would be shut in once \u201c25-30 barrels [had] been pumped into the formation.\u201d Pursuant to the Rule, the Board approved Energy Corp.\u2019s notice and allowed it to perform the diagnostic test without engaging in any additional review or public process.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b68 After the hearing, but prior to Energy Corp.\u2019s submitting notice pursuant to the Rule, Resource Councils challenged the Board\u2019s permitting process for the Hunt Creek Well. Resource Councils claimed, in part, that the Board\u2019s application of the Rule violated their constitutional right to meaningfully participate in government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>decisions. On the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court held that because hydraulic fracturing had not occurred at the Hunt Creek Well, Resource Councils\u2019 constitutional challenge was not ripe for judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Resource Councils appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b69 We review summary judgment rulings de novo. <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 18, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455. Issues of justiciability \u2014 such as standing, mootness, ripeness, and political question \u2014 are questions of law that we also review de novo. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 20. Our review of constitutional questions is plenary. <em>Williams v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2013 MT 243, \u00b6 23, 371 Mont. 356, 308 P.3d 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b610 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that Resource Councils\u2019 challenge was not ripe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">fll Relying on <em>Reichert, </em>the District Court first concluded that Resource Councils\u2019 right to participate claim would be ripe only if Energy Corp. had expanded its drilling permit to include hydraulic fracturing without public input. The court found that Energy Corp.\u2019s diagnostic test did not meet the definition of hydraulic fracturing under Admin. R. M. 36.22.302(28). Thus, the court concluded that Resource Councils\u2019 assertion that hydraulic fracturing had occurred at the Hunt Creek Well was \u201cspeculation unsupported by any specific facts.\u201d The District Court concluded therefore that Resource Councils\u2019 right to participate claim was unripe for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">\u00b612 It is well-established that \u201cthe judicial power of Montana\u2019s courts is limited to \u2018justiciable controversies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 53 (quoting <em>Plan Helena, Inc. v. Helena Reg\u2019l Airport Auth. Bd., </em>2010 MT 26, \u00b6 6, 355 Mont. 142, 226 P.3d 567). A justiciable controversy is, in general terms, \u201cone that is definite and concrete ... as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts, or upon an abstract proposition.\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 53 (citations and internal quotations omitted). Ripeness \u2014 which is a specific justiciability doctrine \u2014 \u201cis concerned with whether the case presents an \u2018actual, present\u2019 controversy.\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 54 (quoting <em>Mont. Power Co. v. Mont. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>2001 MT 102, \u00b6 32, 305 Mont. 260, 26 P.3d 91). As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>such, \u201ccases are unripe when the parties point only to hypothetical, speculative, or illusory disputes as opposed to actual, concrete conflicts.\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 54 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b613 In their amended complaint, Resource Councils asserted that the Rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">allows a company to proceed with hydro-fracking upon providing the Board\u2019s staff certain specified information 48 hours in advance of commencing hydro-fracking. The Board staff is under no obligation to take further action, inform the Board or the public of the fact that hydro-fracking will occur at the [Energy Corp.] well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZc\">They asserted further that no additional \u201cenvironmental review, public participation or Board deliberation is required under the terms of [the Rule].\u201d Resource Councils argued that the Rule, as applied here, consequently violated their \u201cfundamental right to meaningfully participate in government decisions.\u201d Therefore, contrary to the District Court\u2019s conclusion, Resource Councils\u2019 right to participate claim does not hinge on whether Energy Corp. engaged in hydraulic fracturing at the Hunt Creek Well. Rather, their claim centers on whether they had the opportunity to participate in the permitting process.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b614 It is undisputed that Energy Corp. filed a sundry notice pursuant to the Rule\u2019s procedures, which the Board approved. Therefore, the controversy \u2014 whether Resource Councils had the opportunity to participate in the process \u2014 was not a \u201chypothetical, speculative, or illusory dispute[ ].\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 54. On the contrary, Resource Councils\u2019 claim that the Board violated their right to participate in applying the Rule raised \u201can actual, present controversy\u201d because the Board applied the Rule. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 54 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Agp\">\u00b6 15 The District Court erred in concluding that Resource Councils\u2019 right to participate claim was unripe. We proceed to consider the claim and its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u00b616 <em>2. Whether the Board violated Resource Councils\u2019 right to participate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">\u00b617 Resource Councils assert that the Board expanded the original well permit\u2019s scope when it approved Energy Corp.\u2019s sundry notice pursuant to the Rule because the notice, not the original application for a permit to drill, \u201cis where the operator discloses a desire to chemically stimulate a well and provides specific information about the proposed activities.\u201d As such, Resource Councils assert that the \u201cBoard failed to provide adequate notice or meaningful opportunity for public participation in the decision making process\u201d that led to the Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>approving chemical stimulation activities under the Rule. Resource Councils argue that the Board therefore violated their fundamental right to participate under both the Public Participation in Governmental Operations Act, \u00a7\u00a7 2-3-101 to 2-3-301, MCA, and Article II, Section 8, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\">\u00b618 Resource Councils acknowledge that the Board provided them an opportunity to participate during the February 2014 hearing on Energy Corp.\u2019s application for a permit to drill the exploratory Hunt Creek Well. They contend, however, that that \u201chearing cannot suffice as a meaningful opportunity to participate in a decision to chemically stimulate the [Energy Corp.] well\u201d because the Board made clear during the hearing that it was considering only an exploratory well, the permit\u2019s environmental assessment did not address hydraulic fracturing, and the Board\u2019s decision to approve the exploratory well \u201cdid not implicate the concerns of the public\u201d regarding hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, Resource Councils allege, the Board \u201cstated it lacked authority or jurisdiction to consider specific concerns regarding\u201d hydraulic fracturing during the hearing. Finally, Resource Councils contend that hydraulic fracturing at the Hunt Creek Well is a matter of significant public interest and therefore the Board was required to adopt procedures to ensure adequate notice and public participation in the Rule\u2019s procedural process, which it failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b619 The Board counters that its approval of well stimulation activities pursuant to the Rule was not an expansion of the original drilling permit\u2019s scope because well stimulation is allowed under a drilling permit. As such, the Board contends, its rules and procedures ensuring notice and public participation during the permitting process include the well stimulation activities allowed under a drilling permit. The Board contends that the record demonstrates that Resource Councils always knew that well stimulation activities could occur under a drilling permit. The Board and Amicus Montana Petroleum Association also maintain that the diagnostic test did not constitute hydraulic fracturing because the test\u2019s purpose was to temporarily test the well\u2019s reservoir pressure and did not involve well stimulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b620 The Board argues that Resource Councils had the opportunity to participate in \u2014 and did participate in \u2014 the Board\u2019s decision to approve the drilling permit, which included consideration of the potential for hydraulic fracturing at the Hunt Creek Well. As evidence that Resource Councils \u201cmeaningfully participated in the Board\u2019s decision,\u201d the Board points to the considerable testimony Resource Councils\u2019 members and their expert provided during the hearing as well as the fact that the Board approved the permit with the condition that Energy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Corp. comply with certain water standards should it engage in hydraulic fracturing. Because Resource Councils participated in the permit approval process \u2014 which the Board claims included consideration of well stimulation activities \u2014 the Board asserts that providing Resource Councils with an additional opportunity to participate was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"AlU\">\u00b621 \u201cThe essential elements\u201d required to meet Montana\u2019s constitutional and statutory guarantees of public participation are \u201cnotice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Bitterroot River Protective Ass\u2019n v. Bitterroot Conservation </em>Dist., 2008 MT 377, \u00b6 21, 346 Mont. 507, 198 P.3d 219 (citing \u00a7 2-3-103(l)(a), MCA). Public participation procedures \u201cmust include a method of affording interested persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, or arguments.\u201d Section 2-3-111(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b622 The record demonstrates that Resource Councils had notice not only of the application for a permit to drill, but also of the potential for well stimulation activities at the Hunt Creek Well pursuant to the Rule. Affidavits of Resource Councils\u2019 members state explicitly that they received notice of Energy Corp.\u2019s application for a permit to drill. Based on this notice, Resource Councils sent the Board a letter on October 23, 2013, requesting a hearing to discuss their concerns with the proposed permit. The testimony of Resource Councils\u2019 members at the hearing focused on the potential negative impacts of hydraulic fracturing at the site. Furthermore, Resource Councils\u2019 expert submitted a report that focused, in part, on the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing \u201c[gjiven the likelihood that hydraulic fracturing will take place at the proposed well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b623 The record demonstrates further that Resource Councils were given an opportunity to be heard on their concerns about well stimulation activities under the Rule. Although the Board could have declined to hold a hearing due to Resource Councils\u2019 procedural problems in objecting to the permit, Admin R. M. 36.22.601(4), the Board held a full hearing on the permit application due, in part, to the \u201cextensive media coverage and public comments received during the public comment period.\u201d Resource Councils\u2019 members and their expert testified for nearly an hour and a half during the hearing. Their testimony focused on the potential negative environmental impacts associated with hydraulic fracturing at the Hunt Creek Well. The recorded hearing testimony demonstrates that the Board clearly afforded Resource Councils an opportunity \u201cto submit data, views, or arguments\u201d related to well stimulation at the site. Section 2-3-111(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>MCA. Moreover, the Board made clear during the hearing that it retained \u201cthe full authority to grant, deny, or grant conditionally the application for a drilling permit.\u201d That the Board approved the permit with the condition that Energy Corp. comply with certain water standards should it propose hydraulic fracturing at the Hunt Creek Well in the future demonstrates that Resource Councils were heard on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b624 The District Court additionally observed \u201cthat the record clearly reflects that the Board has continually guaranteed to [Resource Councils] that [they] will be given the opportunity to weigh in on any [hydraulic fracturing] ventures that might someday be brought forth.\u201d During the hearing, the Board\u2019s administrator noted that \u201cwastewater and hydraulic fracturing are regulated under the rules [the Board] adopted a couple of years ago. If hydraulic fracturing isn\u2019t approved with the drilling permit then there\u2019s another process that has to be followed to approve it.\u201d The administrator emphasized that \u201chydraulic fracturing has not been proposed in the permit. The environmental assessment assesses what was proposed, which was a potential horizontal well, but does not propose hydraulic fracturing.\u201d In its briefing on appeal, the Board emphatically asserts that hydraulic fracturing has not occurred at the Hunt Creek Well. It does not take issue with the District Court\u2019s statement that the Board guaranteed that Resource Councils will be given the opportunity to participate should hydraulic fracturing be proposed at the Hunt Creek Well in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Z\">\u00b6 25 It is unclear from the record, the Board\u2019s briefing, and our review of the pertinent Administrative Rules what process the Board anticipates should Energy Corp. propose hydraulic fracturing at the Hunt Creek Well. The Board\u2019s representations, however, demonstrate that it will further consider the matter should Energy Corp. make that proposal, and that it will afford additional process at that time. On this record, we conclude that Resource Councils had notice and an opportunity to participate in the Board\u2019s consideration of the permit and to present evidence about their concerns for well stimulation activities at the site. Accordingly \u2014 under the facts presented here \u2014 the Board did not violate Resource Councils\u2019 right to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b626 We reverse the District Court\u2019s holding that Resource Councils\u2019 right to participate challenge was unripe; however, we conclude that the Board did not violate Resource Councils\u2019 right to participate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>applying the Rule to the permit it issued for the Hunt Creek Well.</p>\n<judges id=\"b86-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\"> \u201cHydraulic fracturing\u201d or \u201cfracturing,\u201d also known as \u201cfracking,\u201d \u201cfracing,\u201d or \u201chydro-fracking,\u201d is an oil and gas extraction technique.
