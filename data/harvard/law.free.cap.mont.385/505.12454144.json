Due to uncertainty over the scope of relief granted by the District Court\u2019s order, Citizens has cross-appealed from any partial denial of the relief it sought. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-17\"><em>1. Did the District Court err by holding that the Map Amendment was invalid for failing to comply with statutory </em>requirements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>2.

Did the District Court err by granting attorneys\u2019 fees to Citizens </em>?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u00b63 Two zoning actions are at issue in this proceeding. First, by Resolution No. 955 HL, the Commission enacted an amendment to the Flathead County Zoning Regulations (FCZR) that created anew zoning classification, called the General Business Highway Greenbelt, or B-2HG. This is known as the \u201cText Amendment.\u201d Second, by Resolution No. 837 BX, the Commission approved an \u201con-the-ground\u201d zoning change, applying the new B-2HG classification to particular property bordering Highway 93, north of Kalispell. This is known as the \u201cMap Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\u00b64 Following the adoption of the Flathead County Growth Policy (Growth Policy)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in 2007, owners of property lying north of Kalispell on Highway 93 approached the Flathead County Planning and Zoning Office (Planning Office) about changing the zoning of their properties from a combination of Agricultural (AG) and Suburban Agriculture (SAG) classifications to General Business (B-2). The Flathead County planning staff explained that such a change would not be feasible because (1) there was uncertainty regarding such changes due to the Growth Policy\u2019s lack of guidance in that area of the County; and (2) the B-2 zoning classification had substantial differences from both the AG and SAG classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">\u00b65 Several years later, in 2010, owners of property on Highway 93, north of Kalispell, proposed the creation of a mitigated commercial zone for use on major highways corridors in Flathead County. Labeled B-2HG, this highway greenbelt category would permit many of the same uses as in B-2, General Business, but also establish conditional uses that would require approval from the Planning Office, as well as mitigation measures to alleviate the impacts between AG/SAG zoning and B-2 zoning, such as setbacks, landscaping, signage requirements, tiered building heights arising from the highway, and additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>lighting restrictions to minimize light intrusions on neighboring property. The proposed B-2HG district stated three categories of uses: (1) permitted uses (uses allowed without further review, including banks, barber shops, bed and breakfast operations, hotels, and food stores with less than 5,000 square feet of gross floor area); (2) conditional uses (uses that are permissible but which require a public hearing, including bars and casinos, gas stations, funeral homes, farm equipment sales, supermarkets over 5,000 square feet, and others); and (3) administrative conditional uses (uses that require county review, but do not require a public hearing, including lumber yards, day care centers, boat sales, and rental service stores and yards).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u00b66 Following consultation with the Planning Office, the landowners submitted an application for adoption of the Text Amendment to amend the zoning ordinances to create the B-2HG zoning district. The landowners also submitted a request for the Map Amendment to change the zoning of their particular properties, an area covering 63 acres, to B-2HG, if the Text Amendment was first approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b67 The Planning Office staff prepared a report (Text Report) on the proposed Text Amendment. Citing Montana Code and FCZR, the Text Report stated that the proposed B-2HG classification would advance three parts of the Growth Policy: (1) \u201cProvide ample commercial land designation to promote affordability\u201d (Policy 6.3); (2) \u201cEncourage small-scale, impact-mitigated and compatible commercial developments in accessible, developing rural areas with good access and away from urban areas\u201d (Policy 7.3); and (3) \u201cIdentify existing areas that are suitable for impact-mitigated commercial uses\u201d (Policy 7.4). The Text Report also addressed the statutory considerations required by \u00a7 76-2-203, MCA, including fire dangers; promotion of health, public safety, and general welfare; facilitating adequate provision of transportation, water, sewer, schools, parks, and other public requirements; compatibility with urban growth in the area; the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses; and whether the proposed Text Amendment would be compatible with ordinances of the surrounding municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b68 Specifically, the Text Report stated that Flathead County did not have a \u201cbuilding department\u201d like the cities of Whitefish and Kalispell, but that the proposed amendment contained \u201cadditional criteria for the site development similar to criteria used by the cities\u201d and gave consideration to the growth of nearby municipalities \u201cbecause the text of the proposed amendment provides for standards that are similar to neighboring municipality\u2019s standards for highway commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>standards.\u201d The Text Report noted that although this particular zoning ordinance did not exist in area municipalities, similar municipal ordinances had been consulted for guidance, and that \u201c[plortions of the proposed amendment were based upon regulations adopted by local municipalities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u00b69 After notice, the Commission conducted a public hearing on May 17, 2011. Proponents and opponents of the Text Amendment offered public comment, after which Commissioner Holmquist stated she would take the comments under consideration. Commissioner Lauman said that \u201cissues expressed ... need [to be] addressed\u201d and stated a \u201cconcern regarding which public roads would be affected.\u201d Chairman Dupont asked the Planning Board to address the concerns raised.</p>\n<p id=\"Ascc\">\u00b610 On May 31, 2011, the Commissioners met to discuss changes to the proposed Text Amendment. Public comment was again taken and six citizens spoke in opposition. The Commissioners discussed potential locations where the B-2HG zone could be applied, but clarified that adopting the Text Amendment would not automatically zone any piece of property, but only provide another \u201ctool in the toolbox\u201d for zoning. The Commissioners adopted changes to the Text Amendment that had been suggested in the multiple public workshops conducted by the Planning Board, and published notice of their intent to adopt the Text Amendment as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b611 On July 27,2011, the Commission held its final hearing regarding the Text Amendment. It was reported that, during the statutory protest period, 881 protests to the Text Amendment were received, which was insufficient to legally block its adoption. Commissioner Holmquist said that she had read through all the protest letters, indicating that they included \u201cinaccurate and scare tactic information\u201d and that the \u201cB2HG is not replacing B2 zoning, and it does not cover every road in the county; it is only on major arterial roads.\u201d Commissioner Lauman said he \u201cspent a lot of time\u201d reading through the protests and petitions received, and expressed \u201cconcerns about the quality of information put out there [regarding the B-2HG Text Amendment].\u201d He stated that he did \u201cnot see where B2HG zoning would impose anything on anyone that they can\u2019t already do.\u201d Chairman Dupont concurred, noting that \u201cif [the B-2HG Text Amendment] passed today it would be an option for zoning that a property owner can choose from to further restrict development of their property.\u201d The Commission unanimously adopted the Text Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b612 On August 7,2011, the landowners requested that their proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Map Amendment be adopted by the Commission, which would change the zoning of their property from SAG to the newly created B-2HG zone. The Planning Office\u2019s report (Map Report) analyzed whether the Map Amendment substantially complied with the Growth Policy and met the requirements of \u00a7 76-2-203, MCA. The Map Report noted six policies in the Growth Policy that \u201cmay be relevant\u201d: (1) \u201cProvide ample commercial land designation to promote affordability\u201d (Policy 6.3); (2) \u201cRequire traffic impact analysis for all major commercial projects on major highways and arterials\u201d (Policy 6.4); (3) \u201cConserve resources and minimize transportation demand by encouraging redevelopment and infill of existing commercial areas\u201d (Policy 6.5); (4) \u201cEncourage small-scale, impact-mitigated and compatible commercial developments in accessible, developing rural areas with good access and away from urban areas\u201d (Policy 7.3); (5) \u201cIdentify existing areas that are suitable for impact-mitigated commercial uses\u201d (Policy 7.4); and (6) \u201cEncourage commercial development that is visually and functionally desirable\u201d (Policy 7.5). The Map Report generally concluded that these policies would be furthered by zoning the land in question as B-2HG, but noted that the proposed zoning change would not provide infill. The Map Report also noted two problems that required \u201ccareful Planning Board and Commission consideration\u201d: (1) the lack of specific guidance regarding the Highway 93 area, because there was no neighborhood plan or future use map; and (2) the potential lack of compatible growth with nearby municipalities. The Planning Board voted to approve the Map Amendment. After review, the Commission made several changes to the Map Amendment and unanimously adopted it on February 14, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b613 Citizens initiated this action, challenging the Commission\u2019s adoption of both the Text Amendment and the Map Amendment. Both sides moved for summary judgment. The District Court held that \u201cthe map amendments along with the zone change on the land in question are voided\u201d for failing to substantially comply with the Flathead County Growth Policy; that the Commissioners\u2019 actions in rezoning the 63 acres constituted illegal spot zoning; and that Citizens were entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria as the district court. <em>Siebken v.

Did the District Court err by holding that the Map Amendment was invalid for failing to comply with statutory </em>requirements?</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\u00b617 The Commission argues that the District Court\u2019s determination that the Map Amendment failed to substantially comply with the County\u2019s Growth Policy was based upon factual errors, incorrect legal conclusions, and a failure to consider whether the Commission\u2019s decision was supported with an adequate record and analysis.

We have explained that these statutes, in sum, require zoning to be in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the growth policy. <em>Heffernan v.

For purposes of evaluating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>\u2018substantial compliance,\u2019 that includes all pertinent elements of the growth policy.\u201d <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 87 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">\u00b621 In <em>Heffernan, </em>we held that the Missoula City Council had insufficiently evaluated the pertinent elements of the growth policy when approving a zoning change. There, the Missoula City Council had \u201csimply not addressed\u201d or \u201caddressed but in conclusory fashion\u201d many of the goals and recommendations from the growth policy at issue. <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 85. We reach similar conclusions here regarding the Growth Policy at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u00b622 The Planning Office\u2019s Map Report indicated that six out of fifty policies in the Growth Policy may be relevant to the proposed Map Amendment. Largely missing from the Map Report, and from the Commission\u2019s analysis, was a consideration of possible conflicts between the proposed B-2HG zoning and the Growth Policy, and other pertinent factors raised by the Growth Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u00b623 First, the Map Report stated that Policy 6.3\u2014\u201cProvide ample commercial land designation to promote affordability\u201d\u2014was furthered by zoning this area B-2HG because \u201c[hjighway corridors provide opportunities for relatively inexpensive land in areas of high accessibility and visibility.\u201d However, this general statement overlooked the potential conflict posed by the proposed zoning change in this subject area, as raised by the commentary to Chapter 2 of the Growth Policy, addressing strip developments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">All but one of the seven elements of the public\u2019s vision for the future of the county outlined in Chapter 1 are directly impacted by the manner in which commercial land is developed. <em>County residents regularly comment on the need to prevent \u201cstrip development\u201d from dominating the rural landscape between business centers.... It is not a common remark that no development should take place, just that a certain type of development should be avoided.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">(Emphasis added.) As noted by the District Court, this issue was raised by the planning staff of both Kalispell and Whitefish, expressing concern that the amendment \u201cwill allow strip development to expand beyond the already existing strip development, contrary to the long range planning for both Kalispell and Whitefish.\u201d While the Map Report noted that the B-2HG zone would \u201cutilize)] standards for the site development similar to standards used by the cities to mitigate impacts of strip development,\u201d consideration was not given to whether re-zoning this property along the highway would either limit or enhance the kind of development disfavored by the Growth Policy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Although this concern, by itself, may be insufficient to invalidate the Map Amendment, <em>see Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 78, this issue, identified by the Growth Policy as an important development concern, was not properly considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\u00b624 Second, traffic considerations were only cursorily addressed. The Commission identified one policy that required traffic impact analysis for major commercial developments, and noted that the conditional uses in B-2HG zoning would require such an analysis. However, Chapter 6 of the Growth Policy provides many more traffic considerations. The policies encourage, among other goals, \u201c[l]imit[ing] private driveways from directly accessing arterials and collector roads,\u201d \u201c[p]romot[ing] coordinated and cooperative transportation planning with Kalispell, Columbia Falls, Whitefish and Montana Departments of Transportation and the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation,\u201d and \u201c[r]estrict[ing] direct access from private properties onto the Montana State highways.\u201d There is no evidence indicating that Flathead County consulted the Montana Department of Transportation for guidance on development along Highway 93, and the Map Amendment analysis did not address how the newly allowed uses, such as banks, food stores, hotels, churches, etc.\u2014not conditional uses\u2014would impact traffic as the property directly abutting Highway 93 was developed. These goals concerning a critical object of planning\u2014traffic and traffic safety\u2014were not properly considered.</p>\n<p id=\"AUH8\">\u00b625 Further, little attention was given to the requirement that the County consider \u201ccompatible urban growth in the vicinity of cities and towns,\u201d \u00a7 76-2-203(2)(c),MCA, and that county zoning \u201cmust, as nearly as possible, be made compatible with the zoning ordinances of nearby municipalities.\u201d Section 76-2-203(3), MCA. Flathead County\u2019s Designated Land Uses Map designated the area of the proposed Map Amendment as SAG. While the parties dispute the Designated Land Uses Map\u2019s authority and significance, it was nonetheless consistent with Kalispell\u2019s Growth Policy, which similarly designated the same area as Suburban Residential. Kalispell\u2019s interest in this area was heightened because, as the District Court stated, \u201c[t]he land under question is across from and immediately north of land which has already been annexed into Kalispell, so it is very reasonable to assume that Kalispell will grow in that direction and annex this land.\u201d The Map Report noted this and explained that \u201cthe proposed map amendment is not compatible with the City of Kalispell\u2019s planning for the subject properties. If the proposed map amendment was approved and then the properties petitioned to annex into the city, the zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>would not be in compliance with [Kalispell\u2019s] Growth Policy.\u201d The Map Report offered that consideration had been given to Kalispell\u2019s Growth Policy and to compatible urban growth because \u201csome standards for site development similar in nature to mechanisms in use by the City of Kalispell\u201d would be employed in the new zone. However, citation to similar site development standards does not contemplate the larger issue that the County\u2019s new zone may result in development that is inconsistent with planned and potentially imminent Kalispell growth. We recognize that \u00a7 76-2-203(3), MCA, requires only that county zoning be \u201ccompatible with zoning <em>Ordinances </em>of nearby municipalities,\u201d not city growth policies. (Emphasis added.) Further, the County\u2019s argument that the District Court erred by holding that \u201cthe map amendment and zone must <em>statutorily comply </em>with existing municipal zoning\u201d is well taken. (Emphasis added.) The District Court here erroneously overstated the obligation of the County, and Kalispell does not exercise a \u201cveto power\u201d over the County\u2019s zoning. However, in view of clear conflict between the proposed Map Amendment and the stated growth purposes expressed in Kalispell\u2019s growth plan for property that was immediately adjacent to the city, it was incumbent on the County to more broadly consider this issue and assess the impact of the proposed Map Amendment on Kalispell\u2019s growth plans. As Citizens\u2019 briefing states, \u201c[wjhile some tension [between county zoning and city planning] is perhaps inevitable, open conflict is unnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJ0\">\u00b626  The proposed application of the B-2HG zone to the 63 acres in question, directly abutting a Montana State highway, would have permitted banks, retail shops, and other businesses along the highway, clearly impacting traffic, posing a potential for further strip development, and potentially conflicting with planned growth in close proximity to Kalispell. However, the County\u2019s consideration only cursorily addressed commercial growth goals in the Growth Policy, did not address potential conflicts over disfavored development, only briefly addressed traffic and traffic safety concerns, and failed to assess the possible conflict with planned city growth. While the County does not need to address every aspect of the Growth Policy in detail, it must give sufficient consideration to the policies that raise pertinent and significant concerns. For these reasons, we conclude the Commission abused its discretion in implementing the Map Amendment. We do not reach the issues of whether the Map Amendment constituted spot zoning or was enacted in violation of public participation requirements. We affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling invalidating the Map <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b627 <em>2. Did the District Court err by failing to invalidate the Text Amendment for violating statutory obligations and public participation </em>requirements?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b628 As an initial matter, Citizens and Commissioners dispute the scope of the District Court\u2019s order and the relief granted. Commissioners argue that the District Court\u2019s \u201cruling voided only the Commissioners\u2019 map amendment.\u201d Acknowledging the possibility of this interpretation of the District Court\u2019s order, Citizens cross-appealed to preserve its challenge to the Text Amendment, arguing that \u201cI i Inherent in the District Court\u2019s decision is its grant of Citizens requested relief, overturning both the map and text amendments.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b629 The Commissioners clearly took two separate zoning actions, passing two different zoning resolutions. Citizens challenged both actions, and the parties briefed both actions before the District Court. In its order, the District Court began its analysis by stating that Citizens requested both zoning actions be declared void, but added \u201cthe Court will focus primarily on the map amendment and zone change and the errors and deficiencies therein.\u201d The District Court then engaged in several legal analyses, concluding each time that only the Map Amendment and the associated zone change on the subject property were void, commonly employing such language: \u201cIt is clear the Commissioners decision to re-zone <em>the land </em>is unsustainable. Clearly, the map amendment and zone change <em>for the land in question </em>does not comply with the growth policy, constitutes spot zoning, was an abuse of discretion and must be voided.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Then, in the \u201cORDER\u201d section of its decision, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment that the act of the Commissioners of Flathead County was an abuse of discretion is granted and the map amendments along with the zone change imposed on the land in question are voided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Here, the reference to actions for which relief is granted is singular (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment that <em>the act </em>of the Commissioners ... is granted\u201d (emphasis added)) and, in that regard, the order mentions only the Map Amendment and the corresponding zone change \u201con the land,\u201d not the Text Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\u00b630 The District Court made two statements that could implicate the Text Amendment. In what seems to be a passing observation, the District Court stated that the Text Amendment\u2019s \u201clack of comprehensive consideration [of neighborhood plans which encompass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>a major transportation corridor] is contrary to the Growth Policy which places great importance on existing neighborhood plans.\u201d By itself, this is insufficient to invalidate the Text Amendment, absent a determination that the Text Amendment was not in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the County\u2019s Growth Policy. <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 79. Then, near the beginning of its order, the District Court stated that \u201c[t]he result of the County adopting the text, map and zone amendments which are inconsistent with other controlling documents is that the Commissioners\u2019 acts were an abuse of discretion.\u201d This statement immediately follows a recitation of Citizens\u2019 argument on this issue and precedes any analysis by the District Court. That particular section of the order concludes that only the Map Amendment was flawed. A review of the entire section yields ambiguity about the District Court\u2019s intention with regard to the Text Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b631 It is, at least, poor procedure for a legislative act to be judicially invalidated by way of an order that is ambiguous as to that intent. Further, because, as discussed herein, the proper standards were not applied by the District Court to determine the Text Amendment\u2019s validity, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s order was not sufficient to invalidate the Text Amendment in addition to the Map Amendment. However, because the issue was raised and briefed in the District Court, and because Citizens has cross-appealed any denial of its challenge to the Text Amendment, we undertake review of its validity. <em>Wurl v.

Karnezis, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3. First, the \u201clocal zoning authority establishes in its zoning ordinance a specific zoning classification for a specific purpose or a class of purposes, but does not assign on the zoning map the classification to any property.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>120 A.3d at 692; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>accord Zoning and Land Use Controls, supra, </em>\u00a7 13.01, at 13-3. After enacted by the local municipality, this zone is said to \u201cfloat\u201d above the jurisdiction until a request is made for the zone to be applied to a particular piece of property. <em>Bellemeade Co., </em>503 S.W.2dat 738; <em>Bigenho, </em>237 A.2d at 56. The second step occurs when a landowner requests rezoning (a map amendment) to apply the floating zone to his or her property. <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>120 A.3d at 692; Karnezis, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3. Then, the governing body \u201cconsiders the recommendation of the zoning agency, holds a public hearing, and either approves or rejects the developer\u2019s rezoning request.\u201d <em>The Law of Zoning and Planning, supra, </em>\u00a7 45:2, at 45-6 to 45-7; <em>accord Zoning and Land Use Controls, supra, </em>\u00a7 13.02, at <em>13-8; Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>120 A.3d at 692 (\u201cTo rezone a property to a floating zone, the zoning authority must find generally that the legislative prerequisites for the zone are met and the rezoning is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.\u201d). This two-step process was followed by Flathead County in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AmA2\">\u00b635 Float zoning was developed in response to \u201cEuclidian zoning\u201d permitted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 U.S. 365, 47 S. Ct. 114 (1926). <em>The Law of Zoning and Planning, supra, </em>\u00a7 45:1, at 45-2. Euclidian zoning \u201c(1) divides a municipality into specific zones or districts; (2) assigns the uses of land within the districts, excluding certain uses from certain districts; and (3) establishes height, width, setback, and other measurement or structural restrictions applicable within each district.\u201d <em>Zoning and Land Use Controls, supra, </em>\u00a7 13.01, at 13-2 to 13-3. The purpose of float zoning is to provide more flexibility in municipal zoning. <em>Zoning and Land Use Controls, supra, </em>\u00a7 13.01, at 13-3 to 13-4 (noting the use of floating zones \u201cwhere new or specialized uses are contemplated but cannot be specifically located at the time the districts are originally drawn\u201d); <em>The Law of Zoning and Planning, </em>\u00a7 45:1, at 45-3; <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>120 A.3d at 691 (\u201cFloating zones ... are a local legislative response to the relative rigidity of Euclidian zoning and occupy the opposite end of the flexibility continuum of zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>categories from Euclidian zones.\u201d); <em>Zoning and Land Use Controls, supra, </em>\u00a7 13.01, at 13-5 (\u201cOne of the most logical uses for a floating zone is to create the predictability of a set of written rules for a type of development that does not yet exist in the community without tying that development to a specific sit <em>e.\u201d); American Law of Zoning, </em>\u00a7 9:80, at 9-255 (\u201cThe floating zone is widely employed to create cluster developments, planned developments of various kinds, and planned unit developments.\u201d (internal footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b636 Although it did not use the phrase \u201cfloating zone,\u201d the New York Court of Appeals was the first court to address that concept, in <em>Rodgers v. Village of Tarrytown, </em>96 N.E.2d 731 (N.Y. 1951). The Village of Tarrytown enacted two, separate zoning ordinances. First, in 1947, Tarrytown enacted an ordinance that created \u201c[a] new district or class of zone to be called \u2018Residence B-B,\u2019 \u201d but provided no boundaries for where the zone would apply. <em>Rodgers, </em>96 N.E.2d at 732 (internal punctuation omitted). Rather, it stated that boundaries would be \u201cfixed by amendment of the official village building zone map, at such times in the future as such district or class of zone is applied, to properties in this village.\u201d <em>Rodgers, </em>96 N.E.2d at 732. The ordinance also contained standards required in the new zoning classification pertaining to lot size, building height, setbacks, and other specifications. <em>Rodgers, </em>96 N.E.2d at 732-33. Then, in 1948, a landowner approached the Village seeking to rezone her land to the Residence B-B zoning category created the year prior. <em>Rodgers, </em>96 N.E.2d at 733. The Village approved the map amendment and another landowner brought suit challenging both ordinances. <em>Rodgers, </em>96 N.E.2d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b637 The Court of Appeals first addressed the map amendment ordinance that rezoned the land to the new Residence B-B zoning category, holding that this \u201con the ground\u201d rezoning was within the municipality\u2019s authority and that the action furthered the municipality\u2019s zoning, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">The mere circumstance that an owner possesses a ten-acre plot and submits plans conforming to the physical requirements prescribed by the 1947 amendment will not entitle him, <em>ipso facto, </em>to a Residence B-B classification. It will still be for the board to decide, in the exercise of a reasonable discretion, that <em>the grant </em>of such a classification accords with the comprehensive zoning plan and benefits the village as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\"><em>Rodgers, </em>96 N.E.2d at 734 (emphasis original). This holding was, in essence, a review to ensure the map amendment complied with what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>today is considered a comprehensive plan or growth policy. Secondly, the Court of Appeals addressed the initial text amendment ordinance, which had created the new zoning classification but had not applied it to any particular property in the jurisdiction. On that point it held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a8u-dedup-0\">We turn finally to the contention that the 1947 ordinance is invalid because, in proclaiming a Residence B-B district, it set no boundaries for the new district and made no changes on the building zone map. The short answer is that, since the ordinance merely prescribed specifications for a new use district, there was no need for it to do either the one or the other. True, until boundaries are fixed and until zoning map changes are made, no new zone actually comes into being, and neither property nor the rights of any property owner are affected. But it was not the design of the board of trustees by that enactment to bring any additional zone into being or to affect any property or rights; the ordinance merely provided the mechanics pursuant to which property owners might in the future apply for the redistricting of their property. In sum, the 1947 amendment was merely the first step in a reasoned plan of rezoning, and specifically provided for further action on the part of the board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><em>Rodgers, </em>96 N.E.2d at 735-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b638 Since <em>Rodgers v. Village of Tarrytown, </em>many states have addressed float zoning and have generally found it to be a legally valid and appropriate means of zoning. <em>Zoning and Land Use Controls, supra, </em>\u00a7 13.05 (noting New York, Maryland, Connecticut, Kentucky, California, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin); <em>The Law of Zoning and Planning, supra, </em>\u00a7 45:5 (adding Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Washington).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b639 In the case before us, the Commissioners took two, separate actions. First, they enacted a zoning regulation that created the B-2HG zoning classification within the FCZR, containing certain specifics regarding location, lot size, use, setback, building height, and others. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>This Text Amendment made no actual changes \u201con the ground\u201d to any property, or to the zoning map. Rather, it was, in the words of the Commissioners, another \u201ctool in the [zoning] toolbox.\u201d Second, the Commissioners enacted a second ordinance that applied the new B-2HG zoning category to the property of the petitioners and to the zoning map. The first action, the Text Amendment, created a classic floating zone, and the second action, the Map Amendment, applied that floating zone to the map. As we have already determined, the Map Amendment was adopted in violation of the County\u2019s statutory zoning obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b640 Turning to Montana law, our state\u2019s zoning statutes generally provide for flexibility in zoning and readily encompass a county\u2019s enactment of a floating zone, as Flathead County enacted here. Section 76-2-203, MCA, provides the substantive requirements for all zoning regulations enacted by a county, without distinguishing between text and map amendments. These provisions do not prohibit float zoning or otherwise require all zoning ordinances to apply to a particular property or location when enacted. Rather, the statutes require certain considerations and analyses to be undertaken, \u00a7\u00a7 76-2-203(l)(b), (2), (3), MCA, and that zoning regulations be in accordance with the county\u2019s growth policy. Section 76-2-203(l)(a), MCA. Procedurally, the same process is statutorily required for \u201cthe establishment or revision of boundaries for zoning districts and in the adoption or amendment of zoning regulations\u201d\u2014a broad description of the possible zoning actions that may be undertaken by a board of county commissioners. Section 76-2-205, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b641 Additionally, floating zones are typically the method of implementation of a planned unit development (PUD). <em>American Law of Zoning, </em>\u00a7 9:80, at 9-255 (\u201cThe floating zone is widely employed to create... planned unit developments <em>.\u201d); Zoning and Land Use Controls, </em>\u00a7 13.01, at 13-4 (\u201cMost planned unit development... zones \u2018float\u2019 over the zoning map in the sense that it is rare to see a site pre-zoned for planned unit development without some sort of development plan attached to it.\u201d). Localities in Montana routinely use PUDs in their zoning. <em>See e.g., Kent v. City of Columbia Falls, </em>2015 MT 139, \u00b6 3, 379 Mont. 190, 350 P.3d 9; <em>Botz v. Bridger Canyon Planning &amp; Zoning Comm\u2019n, </em>2012 MT 262, \u00b6 6, 367 Mont. 47, 289 P.3d 180; <em>Grant Creek Heights, Inc. v. Missoula Cnty., </em>2012 MT 177, \u00b6 5, 366 Mont. 44, 285 P.3d 1046. \u201c|P Harmed unit developments, like zoning amendments and variances, are normal land use regulation tools, their approvals are matters committed to the judgment of local officials, and they are used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>to further the welfare of the general public.\u201d <em>Kent, </em>\u00b6 68 (Baker, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\n<em>Judicial Review of Text Amendments/Floating Zones</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b642 Generally, floating zones are given legislative deference and presumed valid. <em>Zoning and Land Use Controls, supra, </em>\u00a7 13.04, at 13-22 to 13-23; <em>The Law of Zoning and Planning, supra, </em>\u00a7 45:7, at 45-21. Likewise, legislative deference is given to municipal zoning actions under Montana law, and this Court only reviews for an abuse of discretion. <em>Schanz, </em>182 Mont. at 335, 597 P.2d at 71 (\u201c[A] zoning ordinance is a legislative enactment, and is entitled to the presumption of validity and reasonableness.\u201d (original punctuation omitted)); N. <em>93 Neighbors, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Lake County First, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u00b643 However, zoning regulations, including text amendments or float zoning, must comply with governing statutes. Where a state has a requirement that all zoning regulations comply with the comprehensive plan, the floating zone must comply with that comprehensive plan. <em>Zoning and Land Use Controls, supra, </em>\u00a7 13.02, at 13-8 to 13-9; Karnezis, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5a; <em>Rockville Crushed Stone, Inc. v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>552 A.2d 960, 970 (Md. 1988) (affirming a district court\u2019s ruling that struck down application of a floating zone to an area for violating the comprehensive plan); <em>Wheaton Moose Lodge No. 1775 v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>397 A.2d 250, 261-62 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1979) (affirming a district court\u2019s ruling that denied designation of a floating zone to property in part because of incompatibility with the local comprehensive plan); <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>120 A.3d at 692; <em>Lutz v. City of Longview, </em>520 P.2d 1374, 1379 (Wash. 1974) (holding floating zone as applied on the ground did not conflict with the comprehensive plan). Similarly, all zoning regulations in Montana, which would include floating zones, must comply with statutory requirements. Sections 76-2-203, 76-1-605, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u00b644 While a text amendment or floating zone must likewise \u201csubstantially comply\u201d with a growth policy, <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 79, and all other statutory requirements, the nature of a legal review of its validity is starkly different than for a map amendment, because no changes are made to actual property or to a location on a zoning map. Consequently, there is no specific factual context to evaluate whether a new zoning category, before applied to a particular location, substantially complies with the growth policy or is compatible with the zoning ordinances of \u201cnearby municipalities.\u201d These issues necessarily require a consideration of location. If a new commercial zoning category was proposed for an area that had a neighborhood plan calling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>for no further business development, the proposed category would, of course, fail to substantially comply. On the other hand, if a new commercial category was proposed for an area slated for business growth under the growth policy, it could very well substantially comply. The location is what permits this analysis to be undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"ACS7\">\u00b645 The difference between challenging a text amendment and challenging a map amendment is analogous to the difference between a facial and as-applied challenge to a statute. <em>See State v. Whalen, </em>2013 MT 26, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22, 368 Mont. 354, 295 P.3d <em>1055; Mont. Cannabis Indus. Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2016 MT 44, \u00b6 14, 382 Mont. 256, 368 P.3d 1131. One examines the application of a statute as applied in the given set of circumstances (as applied), while the other reviews the possible application of the statute in all circumstances (facial). <em>Brady v. PPL Mont., Inc., </em>2008 MT 177, \u00b6 13, 343 Mont. 405, 185 P.3d 330 (Gray, C.J., dissenting) (\u201cFacial challenges, unlike as applied challenges, do not depend on the facts of a particular case.\u201d); <em>In re Marriage of K.E.V., </em>267 Mont. 323, 336, 883 P.2d 1246, 1255 (1994) (Trieweiler, J., concurring and dissenting) (\u201c <em>The difference is important. </em>If a court holds a statute unconstitutional on its face, the state may not enforce it under any circumstances, unless an appropriate court narrows its application; in contrast, when a court holds a statute unconstitutional as applied to particular facts, the state may enforce the statute in different circumstances.\u201d (emphasis in original)). Facial challenges require the litigant to show \u201cno set of circumstances exists\u201d where the statute would be valid, \u201ci.e., that the law is unconstitutional in all its applications.\u201d <em>Mont. Cannabis Indus. Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 14 (internal quotations omitted) (citing <em>Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party, </em>552 U.S. 442, 449, 128 S. Ct. 1184, 1190 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"Ao4S\">\u00b646  Thus, in a legal challenge to a county text amendment or floating zone that makes no \u201con the ground\u201d changes, the question is whether the new zoning category could satisfy statutory requirements <em>anywhere in the county. </em>Put another way, to invalidate an ordinance enacting only a text amendment, a court must conclude there is no place within the jurisdiction where the amendment could be implemented without violating statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b647 Subsequently, when a map amendment is considered, the county would, of course, conduct the second review\u2014based on the proposed location\u2014to determine whether the proposed zoning satisfied statutory requirements. A challenge to an approved map amendment is akin to an as-applied challenge of the zoning. Further, this is the stage where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>it is possible to evaluate whether the zoning constitutes spot zoning.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\n<em>Citizens\u2019 Challenges to the Text Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ail-dedup-0\">\u00b648 Citizens challenged the Text Amendment on the grounds that it (1) failed to substantially comply with the County Growth Policy, and violated other statutory obligations, and (2) that the Commissioners failed to satisfy public participation requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b649 The Text Amendment implemented by Flathead County made no actual zoning map changes in Flathead County. It created the possibility that property in Flathead County could be zoned to B-2HG if regulatory requirements were satisfied and the Growth Policy was substantially complied with in the location of its application. Facially, the B-2HG zone could appropriately be implemented in Flathead County if, for example, a landowner wished to change the zoning of his or her property from less restrictive to more restrictive by moving from B-2 to B-2HG. At a minimum, areas in Flathead County already zoned for commercial or business could be rezoned to B-2HG without violating the Growth Policy, as that would change those properties to a more restrictive zoning than currently zoned. The Designated Land Uses Map from the Growth Policy indicates the existence of such areas. We need not take this analysis further because a proper facial challenge to the Text Amendment was not actually made in this case; Citizens\u2019 challenge was functionally an as-applied one, challenging the outcome of the new zoning as applied on the ground. In that challenge they have succeeded, obtaining a judicial invalidation of the Map Amendment. However, the Text Amendment remains valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u00b650 Citizens also assert that the Commissioners violated both Montana law and Flathead County regulations regarding public participation in the process of adopting the Text Amendment. We note initially that it appears Citizens have conflated the more extensive statutory public participation requirements for adoption of growth policies, \u00a7\u00a7 76-1-601 to -607, MCA; <em>see generally Citizens for a Better Flathead, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-49 (reviewing public participation process for growth policy amendment), with that required for zoning changes.

Section 76-2-205(2), MCA, requires that, following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>notice of a public hearing on any proposed zoning, the \u201ccommissioners shall give the public an opportunity to be heard regarding the proposed zoning district and regulations.\u201d There is no statutory requirement that public comment be further evaluated, as with adoption of growth policies. Section 76-1-603, MCA. Commissioners are here required to \u201creview the proposals of the planning board and shall make any revisions or amendments that it determines to be proper.\u201d Section 76-2-205(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b651 Flathead County has enacted its own ordinance regarding public participation that applies more broadly. Resolution No. 2129 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"asv-dedup-1\">In accordance with the principles announced by the court in <em>North 93 Neighbors v. Board of County Commissioners of Flathead County, </em>prior to making a <em>land use decision, </em>the Board shall summarize the relevant public comment received on a particular action and shall explain how such comment factors into the decision. The scope and format of such summarization and explanation may vary as appropriate for the type of decision and extent of public comment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">(Emphasis added.) Although <em>North 93 Neighbors </em>pertained to growth policies, not zoning, <em>N. 93 Neighbors, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 37-38, 45, on the basis of that case Flathead County laudably adopted a broader requirement that encompasses all land use decisions, including the present one, and that requires \u201csummarization and explanation\u201d by the Commission in response to the receipt of public comment. No specific requirement as to the form of this summary and explanation by the Commission is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b652 When the Text Amendment public hearing was held on May 17, 2011, public comment was received and the Commissioners orally responded with comments acknowledging the public input. Commissioner Holmquist stated she would take the comments under consideration and Commissioner Lauman stated that \u201cissues expressed to them need [to be] addressed.\u201d Commissioner Lauman also expressed \u201cconcern regarding which public roads would be affected,\u201d a concern raised by the public comments. The Commissioners then unanimously voted to undertake further consideration of the Text Amendment and Chairman Dupont asked the Planning Board to address the concerns that had been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u00b653 On May 31, 2011, the Commissioners met again to discuss the proposed Text Amendment. The Commissioners responded to public concerns by explaining that the Text Amendment would not automatically zone any given property. They also made multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>changes to the language of the Text Amendment that came out of public workshops conducted about the proposed ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"AT5B\">\u00b654 On July 27,2011, the Commissioners acknowledged receipt of 881 protest letters. Commissioner Holmquist stated that she had read through all the protest letters. Commissioner Lauman said he \u201cspent a lot of time\u201d reading protests and noted \u201cconcerns about the quality of information put out there [regarding the B-2HG Text Amendment].\u201d Addressing concerns raised, Commissioner Lauman stated he did \u201cnot see where B2HG zoning would impose anything on anyone that they can\u2019t already do.\u201d Commissioner Holmquist, describing \u201cinaccurate and scare tactic information\u201d in the protest letters, stated that the \u201cB2HG is not replacing B2 zoning, and it does not cover every road in the county; it is only on major arterial roads.\u201d Finally, Chairman Dupont concurred with the other Commissioners, noting that \u201cif [the B-2HG Text Amendment] passed today it would be an option for zoning that a property owner can choose from to further restrict development of their property.\u201d The Commission then adopted the Text Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"ALk7\">\u00b655  Our review of the record leads to the conclusion that the Commission satisfied the statutory obligation to permit the public to be heard and, further, satisfied the obligations of the Flathead County ordinance by summarizing the concerns raised and explaining its position in light of those concerns. The Commission incorporated changes to the proposed Text Amendment in response to some comments. As such, the Text Amendment is not invalid for failure to comply with public participation requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u00b656 <em>3. Did the District Court err by granting attorneys\u2019 fees to Citizens </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"AI3\">\u00b657 The District Court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees as both mandamus relief and under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act (UDJA), reasoning that award of attorneys\u2019 fees based on the claims made by Citizens were on \u201csolid footing.\u201d However, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u00b658 A writ of mandate is issued \u201cto compel the performance of an act that the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station.\u201d Section 27-26-102, MCA. Writs of mandate are available where (1) \u201cthe party who applies for it is entitled to the performance of a clear legal duty by the party against whom the writ is sought\u201d; and (2) \u201cthere is no speedy and adequate remedy available in the ordinary course of law.\u201d <em>Smith v. Cnty. of Missoula, </em>1999 MT 330, \u00b6 28, 297 Mont. 368, 992 P.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\u00b659 First, the clear legal duty \u201cmust involve a ministerial act, not a discretionary act.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 <em>28; accord Jefferson Cnty. v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>2011 MT 265, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 362 Mont. 311, 264 P.3d 715. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>determine if an act is ministerial or discretionary, we have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">[WJhere the law prescribes and defines the duty to be performed with such precision and certainty as to leave nothing to the exercise of discretion or judgment, the act is ministerial, but where the act to be done involves the exercise of discretion or judgment, it is not to be deemed merely ministerial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><em>State ex rel. Sch. Dist. No. 29 v. Cooney, </em>102 Mont. 521, 529, 59 P.2d 48, 53 (1936); <em>accord Smith, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>Jefferson Cnty., </em>\u00b6 21. We have held that zoning is a legislative, not ministerial, act. <em>N. 93 Neighbors, Inc., </em>\u00b6 18 (\u201cAmending a growth policy or a zoning designation constitutes a legislative act.\u201d); <em>Liberty Cove, Inc. v. Missoula Cnty., </em>2009 MT 377, \u00b6 12, 353 Mont. 286, 220 P.3d 617; <em>Schanz, </em>182 Mont. at 335, 597 P.2d at 71 (\u201cA rezoning ordinance, like a zoning ordinance, is a legislative enactment.\u201d). Thus, the actions of the Commission challenged here were not ministerial in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\u00b660 Secondly, Citizens had a remedy at law. \u201cAny person aggrieved by any decision of the commission or the board of county commissioners may, within 30 days after such decision or order, appeal to the district court in the county in which the property involved is located.\u201d Section 76-2-110, MCA. Further, if Citizens were concerned about Flathead County implementing the Text Amendment or the Map Amendment, they could have sought preliminary injunctive relief pursuant to Title 27, chapter 19, MCA, pending judicial review of the ordinances. As such, mandamus was not an available remedy in this case and did not provide a basis for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"AL_\">\u00b661 Attorneys\u2019 fees are also potentially available in declaratory actions. Section 27-8-313, MCA, of the UDJA provides that \u201c[flurther relief based on a declaratory judgment or decree may be granted whenever necessary or proper.\u201d Accordingly, attorneys\u2019 fees are available under the Montana UDJA when the district court, in its discretion, \u201cdeems such an award necessary or proper.\u201d <em>Trs. of Ind. Univ. v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 46, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663. However, as a threshold question, equitable considerations must support an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Mungas v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2009 MT 426, \u00b6 45, 354 Mont. 50, 221 P.3d 1230; <em>United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

The availability of attorneys\u2019 fees is not \u201cautomatically presumed\u201d and fees are not warranted in \u201cgarden variety\u201d declaratory judgment actions, which would \u201cevisceratel I\u201d the American Rule. <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 44; <em>Mont.

This action constituted a garden variety declaratory action brought by citizens that does not involve equitable considerations compelling a fee award. As such, the grant of fees under the UDJA was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b663 The judgment of the District Court invalidating the Map Amendment is affirmed. We conclude that the District Court did not also invalidate the Text Amendment, and for the reasons set forth herein, that judgment, challenged on cross appeal, is also affirmed.
