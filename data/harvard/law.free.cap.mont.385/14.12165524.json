We affirm in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b62 Hooper presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>1. Whether the failure to object to multiple convictions for elder abuse and aggravated burglary constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in imposing higher fees in the written judgment than were imposed in the oral pronouncement of sentence.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\u00b63 On June 26,2014, Hooper knocked on the door of Mrs. Blaz\u2019s home under the guise of selling Mrs. Blaz magazine subscriptions. When Mrs. Blaz declined to give Hooper any money, Hooper forced herself into Mrs. Blaz\u2019s house and knocked the 84-year-old woman to the ground. Once in the home, Hooper grabbed and twisted Mrs. Blaz\u2019s wrist and threw her to the ground. Mrs. Blaz hit her head when she fell. Hooper kicked Mrs. Blaz in the thigh, once she was on the ground, and demanded Mrs. Blaz give Hooper money. Hooper then threatened Mrs. Blaz with a pair of sewing shears. Only after Hooper left Mrs. Blaz\u2019s home was Mrs. Blaz able to summon assistance. Following the attack, Mrs. Blaz became less active. She no longer visited with her neighborhood friends. She isolated herself and stayed in her house with \u201call the doors locked up.\u201d According to her son, Mrs. Blaz became more forgetful and fearful after the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">\u00b64 On December 17, 2014, Hooper pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary, elder abuse, and failure to comply with licensing requirements. On March 23, 2015, Hooper received a twenty-five year sentence with ten years suspended for aggravated burglary; ten years for elder abuse; and a six-month commitment to the county jail for the licensing violation. All sentences were to run concurrently. Hooper\u2019s counsel did not object to convictions for both elder abuse and aggravated burglary. Hooper asserts on appeal that she was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">\u00b65 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel constitute mixed questions of law and fact; our review is de novo. <em>Deschon v. State, </em>2008 MT 380, \u00b6 16, 347 Mont. 30, 197 P.3d 476 (internal citation omitted). \u201c[WJhere ineffective assistance of counsel claims are based on facts of record in the underlying case, they must be raised in the direct appeal and, conversely, where the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be documented from the record in the underlying case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>those claims must be raised by petition for post-conviction relief.\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 12, 306 Mont. 58, 30 P.3d 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b66 <em>1. Whether the failure to object to multiple convictions for elder abuse and aggravated burglary constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u00b67 Hooper argues that receiving multiple convictions for elder abuse and aggravated burglary violated \u00a746-1 l-410(2)(d), MCA, and that her counsel\u2019s failure to object constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. The State contends that the crimes of elder abuse and aggravated burglary are distinct and do not constitute multiple convictions in violation of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">\u00b68 When evaluating a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, we use the two-part test enunciated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984); <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 86. \u201cUnder the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, \u2018the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 14 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S. Ct. at 2064). Under the second prong of <em>Strickland, </em>the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. In establishing prejudice, the \u201cdefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068. Because a defendant must prove both prongs, an insufficient showing under one prong eliminates the need to address the other. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Adams v. State, </em>2007 MT 35, \u00b6 22, 336 Mont. 63, 153 P.3d 601, 607); <em>Sartain v. State, </em>2012 MT 164, \u00b6 11, 365 Mont. 483, 285 P.3d 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\u00b69 If a court can discern from the record the reason for counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance, then the matter may be addressed on direct appeal. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095. However, if the record does not disclose the reason for the alleged error, then the matter may be more appropriately decided by a post-conviction relief proceeding. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14. With these principles in mind, we must examine whether there was any error by counsel in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">\u00b610 When the same transaction may establish a basis for charging more than one offense, a person may be charged and prosecuted with each offense. Section 46-11-410(1), MCA. However, a defendant may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>not be convicted of more than one offense if \u201cthe offenses differ only in that one is defined to prohibit a specific instance of the conduct\u201d of the other offense. Section 46-ll-410(2)(d), MCA. Section 46-11-410, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\">(1) When the <em>same transaction </em>may establish the commission of more than one offense, a person charged with the conduct may be prosecuted for each offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">(2) A defendant may not, however, be convicted of more than one offense if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAu\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">(d) the offenses differ only in that one is defined to prohibit a <em>specific instance </em>of the conduct^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">(Emphasis added). Hooper argues elder abuse is a specific instance of the conduct of aggravated burglary controlled by \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">\u00b611 When evaluating a challenge on the basis of double jeopardy grounds to \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(d), MCA, \u201cwe consider the elements of each charge to determine whether each charge requires proof of a fact that the other does not (if so, prosecution for each charge is not statutorily prohibited.)\u201d <em>State v. Wetherell, </em>2010 MT 37, \u00b6 12, 355 Mont. 230, 225 P.3d 1256 (citations omitted). \u201cThe limitations relevant to this case protect the person from being prosecuted for more than one offense if \u2018one offense is included in the other\u2019 or \u2018the offenses differ only in that one is defined to prohibit a specific instance of the conduct.\u2019 Section 46-11-410(2)(a), (d), MCA.\u201d <em>Wetherell, </em>\u00b6 12. We employ a single standard when evaluating a double jeopardy claim under these provisions. Wihere each offense requires proof of a \u201cfact\u201d which the other does not, there cannot be a specific instance of conduct which is included in the other offense. <em>Wetherell, </em>\u00b612.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">\u00b612 Section 45-6-204, MCA, defines aggravated burglary as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">(2) A person commits the offense of aggravated burglary if the person knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in an occupied structure and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">(a) (i) the person has the purpose to commit an offense within that structure; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAr\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-12\">(b) in effecting entry or in the course of committing the offense or in immediate flight after effecting entry or committing the offense:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAj_\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-13\">(ii) the person purposely, knowingly, or negligently inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily injury upon anyone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u00b613 Elder abuse is committed when a person \u201cpurposely or knowingly abuses, sexually abuses, or neglects an older person.\u201d Section 52-3-825(l)(a), MCA. Abuse is defined as \u201cthe infliction of physical or mental injury.\u201d Section 52-3-803(1), MCA. \u201cOlder person\u201d is defined as \u201cperson who is at least 60 years of age.\u201d Section 52-3-803(8), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">\u00b614 When considering the elements of each statute, we conclude that elder abuse and aggravated burglary do not have the same elements. First, elder abuse requires that the person abused be at least 60 years of age; aggravated burglary is not dependent upon age of the victim. Second, aggravated burglary requires that the intent to commit an offense occur within an occupied structure; elder abuse does not have to occur within an occupied structure. Both statutes therefore require an additional element which the other offense does not require.</p>\n<p id=\"A3M\">\u00b615 In <em>Weatherell </em>we found that assault on a minor (\u00a7 45-5-212, MCA) was not a \u201cspecific instance\u201d of partner or family member assault (\u00a7 45-5-206, MCA), when the daughter\u2019s status as a family member and as a minor met different and separate elements of each crime. <em>Weatherell, </em>\u00b6 13. Likewise, we found in <em>State v. Matt, </em>2005 MT 9, \u00b6 15, 325 Mont. 340, 106 P.3d 530, that assault with a weapon (\u00a7 45-5-213(l)(a), MCA) was not a \u201clesser included offense\u201d of assault of a peace officer (\u00a7 45-5-210( l)(a), MCA) because assault with a weapon required the additional finding that the assault occurred with a weapon. We determined in <em>State v. McQuiston, </em>277 Mont. 397, 406-07, 922 P.2d 519, 525 (1996) <em>(ioverruled </em>in part on other grounds), that incest (\u00a7 45-5-507, MCA) was not an \u201cincluded offense\u201d of sexual intercourse without consent (\u00a7 45-5-503, MCA) because sexual intercourse without consent required a lack of consent and incest required only that the sexual relations be between the perpetrator and a related victim. In each of these cases the statutes required poof of a distinct element that the other did not.</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">\u00b616 While the two statutes at issue here require some of the same elements, each offense requires at least one element that the other does not. The fact that Mrs. Blaz meets the definition of older person and Hooper entered the occupied structure with the purpose of committing a theft against Mrs. Blaz satisfies different and distinct elements for each respective offense. We conclude that elder abuse is not a specific instance of aggravated burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b617 Hooper\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is based on her assertion that elder abuse is a specific instance of aggravated burglary. Because we conclude that elder abuse and aggravated burglary do not violate \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(d), MCA, and do not constitute multiple convictions for the same offense, Hooper\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must fail. There was no error in counsel\u2019s failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>to object to a conviction for elder abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b618 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in imposing higher fees in the written judgment entered than were imposed in the oral pronouncement of sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b619 The State concedes that these proceedings should be remanded to the District Court to correct the judgment by removing the $65 in surcharges and fees which were not imposed by the court during the oral pronouncement of sentencing. <em>State v. Hammer, </em>2013 MT 203, \u00b6 27, 371 Mont. 121, 305 P.3d 843. Therefore, we remand to the District Court to remove the $65 from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b620 We affirm the conviction of both aggravated burglary and elder abuse, and remand to correct the judgment to remove fees which were not pronounced orally.</p>\n<judges id=\"b45-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, COTTER and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
