We affirm and address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><em>Did the District Court err by determining there was particularized suspicion for the traffic stop of Massey\u2019s </em>vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u00b62 At approximately 1:00 a.m. on June 16, 2014, Trooper Lynwood Bateman observed a sport-utility vehicle with black plastic, logo-style covers on its tail lights, and initiated a traffic stop because the covers appeared to obscure and diminish the visibility of the vehicle\u2019s tail lights. During the traffic stop, Bateman observed signs that Massey was impaired by drugs and asked him to step out of his vehicle. As Massey stepped out, Bateman observed a small, plastic bag with possible drug residue in plain view in the passenger door pocket. Massey stated the bag was not his and declined to consent to a search of the vehicle. Bateman seized the vehicle and released Massey. A subsequent search of the vehicle pursuant to a search warrant revealed drugs, a handgun, drug paraphernalia, and other items leading to the filing of charges against Massey for criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute, a felony, and criminal possession of dangerous drugs/opiates, a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u00b63 Massey moved to suppress the evidence found in his vehicle on the ground that Bateman lacked particularized suspicion to initiate a traffic stop. At the suppression hearing, Bateman testified that he was approximately 500 feet behind Massey\u2019s vehicle when he noticed the tail light covers, which he stated \u201cwere black and covered up the light.\u201d Bateman initiated the traffic stop \u201cbecause [the tail light covers] were obscuring and diminishing the visibility of the lights to the rear,\u201d and he needed to stop the vehicle to determine if the lights were visible from more than 1,000 feet, the distance required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\u00b64 Under cross examination, Bateman testified that the tail light covers functioned as stencils, which \u201cleft portions of the red visible, but they obscured it.\u201d The following exchange also took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">Q. Okay. Do you see [these stencil-like covers] fairly often in Missoula in the line of work that you\u2019re in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">A. I see them, yeah, I would say fairly often.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-12\">Q. Okay. Do you stop everybody with those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-13\">A. If I\u2019m able to make a traffic stop, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-14\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-15\">A. And, I mean, but that\u2019s all dependent on the situation, other traffic and, you know, what I have going on that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Q. And there was no other reason for your stop of the vehicle Kelly Massey was in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b65 Bateman compared the effect of the tail light covers to placing fingers in front of a flashlight, which \u201cstops some of that light from going through. And, therefore, the visibility is less and the light is diminished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b66 The District Court denied Massey\u2019s motion to suppress. Massey entered into a plea agreement, but reserved his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s ruling. Massey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\u00b67 We review a motion to suppress to determine whether a district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Plouffe, </em>2014 MT 183, \u00b6 18, 375 Mont. 429, 329 P.3d 1255 (citing <em>State v. Dawson, </em>1999 MT 171, \u00b6 13, 295 Mont. 212, 983 P.2d 916); <em>State v. Chilinski, </em>2014 MT 206, \u00b6 16, 376 Mont. 122, 330 P.3d 1169. A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>State v. Ellis, </em>2009 MT 192, \u00b6 20, 351 Mont. 95, 210 P.3d 144 (citing <em>State v. Lewis, </em>2007 MT 295, \u00b6 17, 340 Mont. 10, 171 P.3d 731).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err by determining there was particularized suspicion for the traffic stop of Massey\u2019s vehicle?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">\u00b69 The Montana and United States Constitutions prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures, Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 11; U.S. Const, amend. IV, which includes brief investigatory stops, <em>State v. Ross, </em>2008 MT 369, \u00b6 9, 346 Mont. 460, 197 P.3d 937 (citing <em>State v. Loiselle, </em>2001 MT 174, \u00b6 7, 306 Mont. 166, 30 P.3d 1097); <em>State v. Roy, </em>2013 MT 51, \u00b6 15, 369 Mont. 173, 296 P.3d 1169; <em>City of Missoula v. Moore, </em>2011 MT 61, \u00b6 16, 360 Mont. 22, 251 P.3d 679. Investigatory stops are valid where a law enforcement officer observes a vehicle \u201cin circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d Section 46-5-401(1), MCA. Particularized suspicion requires, in the totality of the circumstances, \u201c(1) objective data from which an officer can make certain inferences, and (2) a resulting particularized suspicion that the occupant of the motor vehicle is or has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>been engaged in wrongdoing or was a witness to criminal activity.\u201d <em>State v. Flynn, </em>2011 MT 48, \u00b6 7, 359 Mont. 376, 251 P.3d 143; <em>accord Brown v. State, </em>2009 MT 64, \u00b6 20, 349 Mont. 408, 203 P.3d 842. The focus of an inquiry into whether particularized suspicion existed is \u201centirely on what facts were available to the officer.\u201d <em>State v. Duong, </em>2015 MT 70, \u00b6 14, 378 Mont. 345, 343 P.3d 1218; <em>accord State v. Clawson, </em>2009 MT 228, \u00b6 11, 351 Mont. 354, 212 P.3d 1056; <em>Flynn, </em>\u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b610 Section 61-9-204(5), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">A person may not operate a motor vehicle on a highway with taillamps that are covered by a lens or a plastic cover or with a tinted or colored material, substance, system, or component placed on or in front of rear lamps, taillamps, license plate lamps, or rear lamp combinations that obscures the taillamps or diminishes the distance of visibility required by this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The \u201cdistance of visibility\u201d stated in this section requires that tail lamps be \u201cplainly visible from a distance of 1,000 feet to the rear of the vehicle.\u201d Section 61-9-204(1), MCA. Thus, there are two ways the statute may be violated: by covering the tail lights in a manner that (1) obscures the tail lamps, or (2) diminishes the tail lamps such that they are not \u201cplainly visible\u201d at 1,000 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b611 Massey argues that the statutory term \u201cobscures\u201d means \u201cnot clearly seen or easily distinguished\u201d and is synonymous with \u201cconceal,\u201d which Bateman\u2019s testimony did not establish. He argues that because his covers allowed light to shine through, they did not \u201cobscure\u201d the tail lights. He interprets Bateman\u2019s testimony as espousing a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d for tail light covers that leads to vehicle stops without regard to actual suspicion on the part of the officer that the statutes are being violated.</p>\n<p id=\"Afpp\">\u00b612 \u201cObscures\u201d is not defined by the statute but generally means, as acknowledged in part by Massey, \u201cto make dark, dim, or indistinct\u201d or which is \u201cnot clearly seen or easily distinguished.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>856 (Frederick C. Mish ed., 11th ed. 2012). Bateman testified that he stopped Massey because the tail light covers \u201cwere obscuring and diminishing the visibility of the lights to the rear.\u201d He also stated that the covers were \u201cblack and covered up the light.\u201d Clearly, these observations establish a suspicion that the tail lights were obscured. The District Court credited Bateman\u2019s testimony, finding that \u201cthe tail light covers at issue diminished the visibility of the lights by covering the red portion of the tail lights.\u201d Further, Bateman\u2019s observations, initially made from a point approximately 500 feet behind Massey\u2019s vehicle, also raised a suspicion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>concerning the second way to violate the statute, by not having tail lights \u201cplainly visible\u201d at 1,000 feet. As such, the District Court correctly concluded that Bateman had particularized suspicion of a violation of \u00a7 61-9-204(5), MCA, that justified a traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"ARQc\">\u00b613 Stopping all vehicles with tail light covers pursuant to a \u201czero tolerance policy,\u201d regardless of actual suspicion of a statutory violation, would clearly be improper. Tail light covers are not per se prohibited by \u00a7 61-9-204(5), MCA. However, covers must comply with the statute and, here, Bateman\u2019s testimony demonstrated that his stop of Massey was supported by a particularized suspicion that Massey\u2019s covers violated \u00a7 61-9-204(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b614 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b490-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON, BAKER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
