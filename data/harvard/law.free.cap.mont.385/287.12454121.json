A month later, police officers discovered Oxycodone residue on a spoon in Temple\u2019s possession. The State charged him with criminal possession of dangerous drugs. The trial court instructed the jury that Temple could assert as a defense that he had obtained the Oxycodone pursuant to a valid prescription. The jury asked the court during deliberations whether crushing prescription Oxycodone violated the law. The court declined to answer and referred the jury to the original instructions. The jury found Temple guilty. He appeals the trial court\u2019s refusal to further instruct the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u00b63 On April 2,2011, Temple arrived at the emergency department of St. Peter\u2019s Hospital complaining of back pain. A doctor prescribed Temple Oxycodone. Temple filled the prescription that day at a CVS pharmacy. Although the record does not include a copy of the prescription, it does include a prescription receipt, which states that the prescription included an eight-day supply of pills. The receipt includes the instruction, \u201cTake 1 tablet by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">\u00b64 A month later, law enforcement officers conducted a probation search of Temple\u2019s vehicle. The search uncovered a spoon, a tourniquet, a pill crusher, and a syringe. The officers sent a sample of residue from the spoon to the State Crime Laboratory for chemical analysis. In the meantime, the State charged Temple with criminal possession of drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">\u00b65 In September 2011, the State Crime Laboratory identified the residue found on the spoon in Temple\u2019s vehicle as Oxycodone. The State subsequently amended its charges against Temple to include felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs (Oxycodone).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">\u00b66 At trial, Temple admitted to possessing drug paraphernalia and Oxycodone. He asserted as a defense, however, that he possessed the Oxycodone lawfully because he obtained it by prescription. At the close of trial, the District Court instructed the jury on the elements of criminal possession of dangerous drugs and on Temple\u2019s asserted defense that he obtained the Oxycodone \u201cpursuant to\u201d a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b67 Neither party had proposed an instruction on the legality of crushing prescription Oxycodone, and the court gave no such instruction in its initial charge to the jury. But during deliberations, the jury sent a note with the following questions: (1) \u201cAccording to the law, when you alter the form of a prescription drug ... by either applying heat or crushing, does that change the chemical compound of the drug?\u201d; and (2) \u201cIf so, does that chemical change make it illegal?\u201d The court responded with the statement, \u201cYou are instructed to rely on your collective memory of the testimony and evidence presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b68 The jury sent another note, asking, \u201cIs it illegal to crush Schedule II Oxycodone?\u201d Temple\u2019s counsel urged the court to answer \u201cno,\u201d arguing that the relevant statutes did not criminalize such conduct. The court acknowledged that the legality of crushing Oxycodone was \u201cobviously ... tying [the jury] up.\u201d Nonetheless, the court responded to the jury, \u201cYou are instructed to rely on your collective memory of the testimony and evidence presented and on the instructions previously given.\u201d The jury found Temple guilty of criminal possession of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u00b69 Temple argues that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to further instruct the jury on the legality of crushing prescription Oxycodone.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s decision to provide or deny requested information to a jury during deliberations is one of discretion. Section 46-16-503(2), MCA; <em>State v. Greene, </em>2015 MT 1, \u00b6 12, 378 Mont. 1, 340 P.3d 551. We review such a decision for abuse of discretion. <em>Greene, </em>\u00b6 12. When the jury instructions in a criminal case, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case, a district court does not abuse its discretion by refusing to further instruct the jury. <em>State v. Bieber, </em>2007 MT 262, \u00b6 67, 339 Mont. 309, 170 P.3d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it declined to further instruct the jury in response to the jury\u2019s questions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">\u00b612 Temple argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to answer the jury\u2019s questions about the legality of crushing Oxycodone. In his view, the law does not criminalize crushing validly prescribed medication or otherwise failing to follow a prescription\u2019s instructions. Temple contends that the original instructions did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>adequately inform the jury on this critical point of law. As such, Temple maintains that the court was obligated to clarify for the jury, in response to its questions, that crushing Oxycodone did not violate the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b613 The State counters that crushing and injecting prescription medication contrary to the prescription\u2019s instructions for use violates the law. It asserts that a person lawfully possesses a dangerous drug only if he obtains the drug pursuant to a prescription and continually possesses it \u201cin accordance with the prescription\u2019s instructions and for the purpose for which the drug was prescribed.\u201d The State contends also that the District Court acted within the bounds of its broad discretion when it declined to answer the jury\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b614 Montana law criminalizes possession of \u201cdangerous drugs,\u201d including Oxycodone. Sections 45-9-102(1), 50-32-101(6), - 224(1)(a)(xvi), MCA. \u201cUltimate users and practitioners,\u201d however, are \u201cexempt\u201d from the criminal possession statute. Section 45-9-102(8), MCA. The law defines an \u201cultimate user\u201d as \u201ca person who lawfully possesses a dangerous drug for personal use.\u201d Section 50-32-101(28), MCA. \u201c[A]n ultimate user or a person in possession of any dangerous drug pursuant to a lawful order of a practitioner\u201d may \u201clawfully possess\u201d such dangerous drug. Section 50-32-302(3), MCA. The relevant statutes do not specifically address whether crushing validly prescribed medication or otherwise failing to follow a prescription\u2019s instructions violates the law or bars a defendant from asserting the \u201cultimate user\u201d defense. <em>See generally </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-9-101 to -132, 50-32-101(28), -302(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">\u00b615 The District Court gave the following instruction to the jury regarding Temple\u2019s asserted defense to the possession of dangerous drugs charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">An ultimate user of a dangerous drug may possess it lawfully. An ultimate user means a person who lawfully possesses a dangerous drug under a valid prescription.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">A prescription means any order given individually for the person for whom prescribed by means of an order signed by the prescriber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">\n<em>To rebut the assertion that Defendant was in criminal possession of dangerous drugs, Defendant may raise the defense that he obtained the drug alleged in the charge pursuant to a valid prescription.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">If, after considering all the evidence, you have a reasonable doubt whether Defendant was in unlawful possession of Oxycodone, you must find Defendant not guilty of the charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Temple did not object to this instruction. The instruction fairly captures the language of the statutes defining the terms applicable to Temple\u2019s claimed defense. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-9-102(8), 50-32-101(25), -302(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b616 The State argues that crushing and injecting a prescription medication or otherwise failing to abide by the prescription\u2019s instructions for use violates the law because possession is lawful only if the \u201cultimate user\u201d uses the drug \u201cpursuant to\u201d a valid prescription\u2014by following the prescription\u2019s instructions and using the drug for the purpose for which it was prescribed. The instruction the State proposed to define \u201cultimate user\u201d and \u201cprescription\u201d did not directly explain this theory, although it did include additional language from the statutes. The District Court declined the State\u2019s instruction as proposed, and its refusal is not an issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"apl-dedup-1\">\u00b617  The trial court charged the jury on the elements of the crime charged and on Temple\u2019s \u201cultimate user\u201d defense using the language of the controlling statutes. The relevant statutes do not speak directly to the issue the jury raised during deliberations. <em>See generally </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-9-101 to -132, 50-32-101(28), -302(3), MCA. The District Court was obligated to instruct the jury only as to \u201cthe law applicable to the case,\u201d <em>Bieber, </em>\u00b6 67, not as to a legal question on which the parties had not been heard prior to the jury\u2019s retiring to deliberate and on which the law presented no clear answer. There is no abuse of discretion if, as a whole, the instructions fairly and fully covered the applicable law. <em>Bieber, </em>\u00b6 67.</p>\n<p id=\"aif-dedup-0\">\u00b618  The outcome of this case hinged on the jury\u2019s determination of whether the Oxycodone found in Temple\u2019s possession in May 2011 was obtained \u201cpursuant to\u201d his April 2, 2011 prescription. Section 50-32-302(3), MCA. We conclude that the court\u2019s initial instructions on the \u201cultimate user\u201d defense, using the phrases \u201cunder a valid prescription\u201d and \u201cpursuant to a valid prescription,\u201d fulfilled its obligation to \u201cfully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>Bieber, </em>\u00b6 67. Its decision to refer the jury back to the instructions in response to the jury\u2019s questions did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Bieber, </em>\u00b6 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">\u00b619 The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
