We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows: Whether this Court should undertake plain error review and conclude that the District Court committed reversible error by failing to directly address a spectator comment made during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b63 In January 2014 the State charged Griffin with six felonies arising from his sexual contact with two step-daughters. The evidence presented during the State\u2019s case-in-chief showed that Griffin repeatedly engaged in sexual contact with the girls, in addition to inflicting beatings, requiring them to do house work in the nude, and killing their pets. Griffin did not present any evidence and did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">\u00b64 During closing argument by Griffin\u2019s attorney, an audience member interrupted by stating: \u201cWell I\u2019d like to say that God is faithful and just to those who confess their sins.\u201d The District Court intervened, stating: \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. Ma\u2019am, any more outbursts and whoever makes the outburst will be removed from the courtroom.\u201d Griffin\u2019s attorney continued his closing without noting the statement and did not move for any relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury deliberated and returned the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">\u00b65 Griffin appeals, arguing that the spectator\u2019s comment deprived him of a fair trial and that this Court should undertake plain error review and reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">\u00b66 Griffin requests that this Court review the District Court\u2019s response or lack of response to the spectator comment during closing argument, even though there was no objection or motion from defense counsel. The general rule is that an issue raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered, because a defendant who does not object to an error is deemed to have waived the error. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>2010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>MT 94, \u00b6 12, 356 Mont. 167, 231 P.3d 79. However, this Court has the discretionary authority to find plain error even though the defendant made no objection or requested no relief at trial. <em>State v. Jackson, </em>2009 MT 427, \u00b6 42, 354 Mont. 63, 221 P.3d 1213. This Court has repeatedly stated that it will find plain error only sparingly, where failing to do so \u201cmay result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Walton, </em>2014 MT 41, \u00b6 17, 374 Mont. 38, 318 P.3d 1024. Our precedent requires that the alleged error \u201cfirmly convince\u201d the Court that there was a serious mistake that must be addressed. <em>Taylor, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b67 We will not undertake \u201cfull analysis\u201d of the alleged error each time a party requests plain error review. <em>Walton, </em>\u00b6 17. Conducting a full analysis in order to determine whether to find plain error would defeat the underlying rule that a party must object to error at trial, because errors should be brought to the attention of the trial court where they can be initially addressed. <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 28, 317 Mont. 331, 77 P.3d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b68 <em>Issue: Whether this Court should undertake plain error review and conclude that the District Court committed reversible error by failing to directly address a spectator comment made during closing argument.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Az\">\u00b69 A criminal defendant has a right to a fair trial under both the United States and Montana Constitutions. <em>State v. Aker, </em>2013 MT 253, \u00b6 24, 371 Mont. 491, 310 P.3d 506. The district court bears the duty to insure that the defendant receives a fair trial. <em>State v. Egan, </em>178 Mont. 67, 78, 582 P.2d 1195, 1201 (1978). Griffin argues that the spectator\u2019s remark eroded his presumption of innocence and impacted his right to be judged solely upon properly-presented evidence. Griffin argues that the effect of the speaker\u2019s comment was to implicate him as a sinner who should confess. Griffin argues that the District Court had the options to poll the jury to determine whether the remark influenced any of them; to instruct the jury to disregard the statement; or to declare a mistrial. Finally, he contends that the District Court\u2019s failure to invoke one or more of these options deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">\u00b610 Under the circumstances of this case, and based upon existing precedent, we disagree with Griffin and decline to find plain error. First, the spectator\u2019s remark did not expressly accuse Griffin of a crime or of guilt, and did not imply any extra-judicial knowledge of the facts. It was more an expression of the spectator\u2019s personal beliefs. Second, it was a brief and isolated event. Third, the District Court responded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>promptly by chastising and warning the spectator, in the presence of the jury, that her conduct was inappropriate and that further outbursts would not be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b611 In addition, the District Court\u2019s instructions to the jury emphasized Griffin\u2019s presumption ofinnocence \u201cthroughout every stage of the trial\u201d and the fact that he was not required to prove his innocence or to present any evidence. The District Court cautioned the jurors to not accept any person\u2019s version of the applicable law except as stated in the instructions. The jurors were instructed to deliberate and decide \u201cuninfluenced by passion or prejudice.\u201d The District Court instructed the jury that the \u201claw forbids you to be governed by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AQ\">\u00b612 In many cases this Court has declined to find plain error when a defendant argues that a prosecutor\u2019s statement about witness credibility in closing argument was improper. <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30 and cases cited therein. In <em>State v. Lacy, </em>2012 MT 52, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, 364 Mont. 291, 272 P.3d 1288, we acknowledged the impropriety of a prosecutor\u2019s invocation of a \u201creliance on God\u201d during closing, but determined that is was \u201cnot so far from the permissible\u201d to justify finding plain error. We follow those cases here. While the spectator\u2019s remark was improper, it was not sufficiently serious that it caused a manifest miscarriage of justice, left unsettled the fundamental fairness of the trial, or compromised the integrity of the judicial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b613 The convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b30-8\">JUSTICES McKINNON, COTTER, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-12\"> Out of the presence of the jury the District Court further admonished the spectator that her conduct was inappropriate and was the type of conduct that could lead to a mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
