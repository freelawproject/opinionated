Spottedbear threatened to kill Officer Walker and his family after Officer Walker told him that he was also being charged with criminal trespass\u2014a more serious offense. The State charged Spottedbear with threats and other improper influence in official matters, criminal trespass, and disorderly conduct, and a jury convicted him on all three counts. Spottedbear challenges his conviction on the following grounds: (1) the improper influence statute is unconstitutionally overbroad\u2014a claim Spottedbear raises for the first time on appeal; (2) the evidence was insufficient to convict him on either the improper influence or criminal trespass charge; (3) the court should not have admitted evidence regarding a prior incident with Officer Walker; and (4) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the constitutional challenge and for failing to object to the jury instructions on mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">\u00b62 We affirm the improper influence conviction and reverse the conviction for criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">\u00b63 In late February 2014, Officer Walker responded to a disturbance between Spottedbear and another customer at a Wal-Mart store in Great Falls, Montana. After speaking to Janet Sherod, a Wal-Mart staff member, about the situation, Officer Walker told Spottedbear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>leave the store. On his way out, Spottedbear yelled at Sherod, and Officer Walker arrested him for disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b64 On the way to the detention center, Officer Walker informed Spottedbear that he was going to charge him with criminal trespass in addition to disorderly conduct. Spottedbear\u2014who was intoxicated\u2014became more agitated and brought up a previous incident in which he threatened and assaulted Officer Walker. Spottedbear grew increasingly belligerent and yelled that he had seen Officer Walker and his wife out in public since that incident. Spottedbear then repeatedly threatened to kill Officer Walker, his pregnant wife, and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b65 Based on Spottedbear\u2019s threats, the State added a charge of improper influence to the disorderly conduct and criminal trespass charges. Prior to trial, Spottedbear moved to limit the State\u2019s introduction of evidence regarding the previous incident he had with Officer Walker. The District Court ruled that the State could elicit testimony about the prior incident but that it could not bring up that Spottedbear had been convicted of any crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b66 Officer Walker was the only witness at trial. The jury found Spottedbear guilty on all three charges. The District Court sentenced Spottedbear as a persistent felony offender to ten years for the improper influence conviction, six months for the criminal trespass conviction, and ten days for the disorderly conduct conviction, to run concurrently. Spottedbear appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\u00b67 This Court exercises plenary review over constitutional questions. <em>State v. Dugan, </em>2013 MT 38, \u00b6 14, 369 Mont. 39, 303 P.3d 755. A statute may be deemed constitutionally overbroad if it includes within its scope conduct that is protected by the First Amendment. <em>Dugan, </em>\u00b6 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">\u00b68 We review questions on the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal matter to determine whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Weigand, </em>2005 MT 201, \u00b6 7, 328 Mont. 198, 119 P.3d 74. We review a jury\u2019s verdict to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to support the verdict, not whether the evidence could have supported a different result. <em>Weigand, </em>\u00b6 7. It is within the province of the jury to weigh the evidence based on the credibility of the witnesses and determine which version of events should prevail. <em>Weigand, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u00b69 A trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. Thus, we review a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19. A court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19. In exercising its discretion, however, the trial court is bound by the Rules of Evidence. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19. Consequently, to the extent that the court\u2019s ruling is based on an interpretation of an evidentiary rule, our review is de novo. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b610 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel present mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v. Johnston, </em>2010 MT 152, \u00b6 7, 357 Mont. 46, 237 P.3d 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\u00b611 <em>1. Whether the improper influence statute is unconstitutionally overbroad.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\u00b612 A person commits the offense of threats and other improper influence in official matters \u201cif the person purposely or knowingly ... threatens harm to any person, the person\u2019s spouse, child, parent, or sibling, or the person\u2019s property with the purpose to influence the person\u2019s decision, opinion, recommendation, vote, or other exercise of discretion as a public servant, party official, or voter.\u201d Section 45-7-102(1)(a)(i), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">\u00b613 For the first time on appeal, Spottedbear argues that \u00a7 45-7-102(1)(a)(i), MCA, is unconstitutionally overbroad. He asserts that we should review the statute because his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise the constitutional issue below, because this Court may exercise plenary review of constitutional rights violations even where no objection has been made, and because this Court may review an unconstitutional statute under the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">\u00b614 Spottedbear does not challenge the improper influence statute\u2019s constitutionality as applied to him; he contends instead that the statute is facially overbroad because it prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech. Spottedbear asserts that the statute\u2019s language is unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment for three reasons: (1) the Legislature defines \u201charm\u201d expansively; (2) the statute is not limited to threats of unlawful harm; and (3) by focusing on threats of harm aimed at influencing a public official\u2019s discretion, the statute targets \u201cthe type of message that lies at the First Amendment\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>heart.\u201d Thus, Spottedbear asserts that the \u201cstatute\u2019s plain language makes clear that it reaches far beyond proscribing unprotected speech and into proscribing speech that is essential to our democracy.\u201d Because the statute\u2019s reach is not limited to unprotected speech, Spottedbear contends that the statute is distinguishable from statutes that we have upheld against overbreadth challenges. Spottedbear therefore argues that we should hold that the statute is unconstitutional and void his improper influence conviction in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b615 The overbreadth doctrine \u201cis an exception to the general rule that statutes are evaluated in light of the situation and facts before the court.\u201d <em>State v. Lilburn, </em>265 Mont. 258, 264, 875 P.2d 1036, 1040 (1994). Under the doctrine, a statute that \u201ccan be applied to constitutionally protected speech and expression may be found to be invalid in its entirety, even if it could validly apply to the situation before the <em>court.\u201d Lilburn, </em>265 Mont. at 264, 875 P.2d at 1040. We have made clear, however, that a statute is unconstitutionally overbroad only if its overbreadth is not only \u201c Veal, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lilburn, </em>265 Mont. at 264-65, 875 P.2d at 1040 <em>(quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 2918 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b616 The test for overbreadth therefore \u201cis not whether hypothetical remote situations exist, but whether there is a significant possibility that the law will be unconstitutionally applied.\u201d <em>Lilburn, </em>265 Mont. at 269, 875 P.2d at 1043 (citing <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 615, 93 S. Ct. at 2917-18). \u201cIn short, there must be a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court for it to be facially challenged on overbreadth grounds.\u201d <em>Lilburn, </em>265 Mont. at 269, 875 P.2d at 1041 (quoting <em>Members of the City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. 789, 800-01, 104 S. Ct. 2118, 2126 (1984) (hereafter <em>Vincent)). </em>When there is no realistic danger or significant possibility that First Amendment protections will be meaningfully compromised, we have held consistently that any unconstitutional application of a statute should be addressed on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis. <em>E.g., Mont. Supreme Court Comm\u2019n on the Unauthorized Practice of Law v. O\u2019Neil, </em>2006 MT 284, \u00b6 78, 334 Mont. 311, 147 P.3d 200; <em>State v. Nye, </em>283 Mont. 505, 515, 943 P.2d 96, 103 (1997); <em>State v. Ross, </em>269 Mont. 347, 356, 889 P.2d 161, 166 (1995); <em>Lilburn, </em>265 Mont. at 270, 875 P.2d at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b617 We are unpersuaded by Spottedbear\u2019s claim that his trial counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise the statute\u2019s alleged overbreadth below. In assessing whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, we look to \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 20, 343 Mont. 90, 180 P.3d 861. Spottedbear asserts that his counsel had \u201cno plausible\u201d justification for failing to raise a constitutional challenge because it would have ended Spottedbear\u2019s prosecution at its inception. But \u00a7 45-7-102(1)(a)(i), MCA, serves a plainly legitimate purpose\u2014to deter people from threatening harm to a public servant in order to influence that person\u2019s actions as a public servant. Spottedbear acknowledges that his conduct falls within the statute\u2019s legitimate sweep. Given these surrounding circumstances, and our overbreadth precedent discussed above, Spottedbear\u2019s trial counsel reasonably may have concluded that an overbreadth challenge to the statute would not have been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"al-dedup-0\">\u00b618 Indeed, when compared \u201cto the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep,\u201d Spottedbear would have a high hurdle to clear in showing how the statute adversely affects the rights of others in a \u201creal\u201d and \u201csubstantial\u201d way. <em>Lilburn, </em>265 Mont. at 264-65, 875 P.2d at 1040. Although Spottedbear points to \u201chypothetical remote situations\u201d in which the statute could be applied unconstitutionally, he would have to have demonstrated a \u201crealistic danger\u201d or \u201ca significant possibility that the law will be unconstitutionally applied.\u201d <em>Lilburn, </em>265 Mont. at 265, 269, 875 P.2d at 1041, 1043. \u201c[T]he mere fact that [Spottedbear\u2019s appellate counsel] can conceive of some impermissible applications of [the] statute,\u201d <em>Lilburn, </em>265 Mont. at 265, 875 P.2d at 1041 (quoting <em>Vincent, </em>466 U.S. at 800-01, 104 S. Ct. at 2126), is insufficient to overcome the \u201cstrong presumption that [trial] counsel\u2019s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b619 The State prosecuted Spottedbear for conduct that plainly came within the statute\u2019s legitimate sweep. Whether threatening harm under the statute would apply properly to the hypothetical situations Spottedbear presents on appeal \u201cis irrelevant. That was not the conduct for which he was convicted, and we do not find it necessary to address that argument.\u201d <em>Nye, </em>283 Mont. at 516, 943 P.2d at 103. We decline to consider the statute\u2019s alleged overbreadth in this appeal. \u201cTo the extent that the statute may reach constitutionally protected expression,\u201d any constitutional deficiencies not implicated by Spottedbear\u2019s case can be addressed at that time. <em>Lilburn, </em>265 Mont. at 270, 875 P.2d at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u00b620 <em>2. Whether the State presented sufficient evidence that Spottedbear threatened harm to Officer Walker with the purpose to influence Officer Walker\u2019s discretion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b621 Spottedbear contends that the State did not present sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he threatened Officer Walker with the requisite \u201cpurpose to influence\u201d Officer Walker\u2019s discretion. Relying on <em>State v. Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. 183, 948 P.2d 209 (1997), Spottedbear emphasizes that he was \u201cbelligerent and uncooperative\u201d before and after Officer Walker showed up and that his threats toward Officer Walker were \u201ca continuation\u201d of his \u201cbelligerent attitude.\u201d Accordingly, Spottedbear asserts that there is no evidence in the record upon which the jury could find that, \u201cbut for [Spottedbear\u2019s] purported purpose to influence Officer Walker\u2019s official discretion, he would not have threatened Officer Walker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b622 Relying on <em>State v. Motarie, </em>2004 MT 285, 323 Mont. 304, 100 P.3d 135, and <em>State v. Keating, </em>285 Mont. 463, 949 P.2d 251 (1997), the State contends that Spottedbear did not have to explicitly condition his threats in order to be convicted under the improper influence statute. The State asserts that the jury reasonably could have inferred from the evidence presented that Spottedbear threatened Officer Walker with the purpose to influence Officer Walker\u2019s charging discretion. The State points to the fact that Spottedbear did not threaten Officer Walker until he learned that Officer Walker intended to charge him with criminal trespass. The State alleges that Spottedbear\u2019s reliance on <em>Plenty Hawk </em>is misplaced because that case is factually distinguishable. Finally, the State asserts that while the evidence could have supported a contrary conclusion, it does not follow that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\u00b623 The improper influence statute prohibits \u201cthreatening] harm\u201d to a public servant or to a public servant\u2019s family or property \u201cwith the purpose to influence\u201d that person\u2019s actions as a public servant. Section 45-7-102(1)(a)(i), MCA. To show purpose, the State had to prove that it was Spottedbear\u2019s \u201cconscious object\u201d to influence Officer Walker\u2019s discretion. Section 45-2-101(65), MCA. Accordingly, the State had the burden of provingbeyond a reasonable doubt that Spottedbear not only threatened Officer Walker with harm, but that he did so with the conscious object to influence Officer Walker\u2019s actions as a public servant. While each element of an offense must be proven by sufficient evidence, <em>Weigand, </em>\u00b6 7, \u201c[t]he elements of a charged offense are factual in nature and their existence must be determined by the jury,\u201d <em>State v. Gladue, </em>1999 MT 1, \u00b6 40, 293 Mont. 1, 972 P.2d 827.</p>\n<p id=\"ahb-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u00b624  We have consistently held that \u201ccircumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to obtain a conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Clausell, </em>2001 MT 62, \u00b6 31, 305 Mont. 1, 22 P.3d 1111 (quoting <em>State v. Lancione, </em>1998 MT 84, \u00b6 37, 288 Mont. 228, 956 P.2d 1358) (internal quotations omitted). A person\u2019s mental state \u201cis rarely susceptible of direct or positive proof and therefore must usually be inferred from the facts testified to by witnesses and the circumstances as developed by the evidence.\u201d <em>Clausell, </em>\u00b6 31 (citation and internal quotations omitted). As such, whether a defendant acted with purpose \u201cmay be inferred from circumstantial evidence such as the acts of the accused and the facts and circumstances surrounding the offense.\u201d <em>Clausell, </em>\u00b6 31. Such evidence \u201cneed only be of sufficient quality and quantity to legally justify a jury in finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, taking into consideration all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the charged offense collectively.\u201d <em>Clausell, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b625 In <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>we addressed whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain Plenty Hawk\u2019s conviction of intimidation under \u00a7 45-5-203, MCA. <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 186, 948 P.2d at 210-11. Similar to here, Plenty Hawk argued that the State failed to present evidence that his threats towards a deputy were made \u201cwith the purpose to cause another to perform or to omit the performance of any act.\u201d <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 186, 948 P.2d at 211 (quoting \u00a7 45-5-203(1), MCA). The evidence established that Plenty Hawk was intoxicated, combative, and belligerent when deputies and ambulance personnel first approached him lying in a roadway. <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 184, 948 P.2d at 209-10. Plenty Hawk continued his combative behavior after being assured \u201cthat he was not under arrest\u201d and being placed in a holding cell to be cleaned up and examined more thoroughly. <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 184, 948 P.2d at 210. After Plenty Hawk \u201ctook a swing\u201d at an ambulance attendant who was attempting to take his pulse in the holding cell, a deputy informed Plenty Hawk \u201cthat he was under arrest for the charge of Intoxicated Pedestrian and that he would be spending the night in jail.\u201d <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 184-85, 948 P.2d at 210. During the booking process, Plenty Hawk challenged a deputy to a fight and \u201cdeclared that as soon as he got out of jail he was going to kick [the deputy\u2019s] ass and terrorize [him] and his family.\u201d <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 185, 948 P.2d at 210. Plenty Hawk apologized for his behavior the next day. <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 185, 948 P.2d at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b626 The State contended \u201cthat Plenty Hawk\u2019s purpose in making the threats was to cause [the deputy] to release him.\u201d <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Mont. at 186, 948 P.2d at 211. In concluding that there was \u201cno evidence in the record that the threats were made for any particular purpose,\u201d we noted that Plenty Hawk \u201cwas belligerent and uncooperative from the time\u201d the deputy approached him and that he was combative with ambulance attendants \u201cprior to being informed he was under arrest.\u201d <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 186, 948 P.2d at 211. We opined that \u201cPlenty Hawk was simply drunk and belligerent\u201d and that \u201c[a]t no time did Plenty Hawk state what act he might want [the deputy] to do or to omit and the State has provided no evidence to show what specific act Plenty Hawk was seeking to have done or omitted.\u201d <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 187, 948 P.2d at 211. We therefore held that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict on the intimidation charge. <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 187, 948 P.2d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"A5_\">\u00b627 In <em>Motarie, </em>we addressed whether the State had proven that Motarie acted with the requisite purpose under \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-203(1) and 45-7-206(1), MCA. <em>Motarie, </em>\u00b6 5. In that case, Motarie called Iverson, who had reported him for allegedly poaching an elk, and threatened to kill Iverson prior to Motarie\u2019s trial. <em>Motarie, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-3. Motarie relied on <em>Plenty Hawk </em>in arguing that the State failed to provide evidence of his purpose in making the threats. <em>Motarie, </em>\u00b6 7. We distinguished <em>Plenty Hawk </em>by noting that \u201cPlenty Hawk was behind bars when he\u201d threatened the deputy. <em>Motarie, </em>\u00b6 6. We differentiated our holding in <em>Plenty Hawk </em>further, explaining that, \u201c[b]y threatening the deputy with violence once released from his cell, Plenty Hawk would have made the deputy even more disposed to leaving Plenty Hawk in the cell.\u201d <em>Motarie, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b628 We noted that the record in <em>Motarie </em>spoke \u201cof a more invidious purpose\u201d because \u201cIverson was the central witness to the State\u2019s poaching case against Motarie.\u201d <em>Motarie, </em>\u00b6 7. We reaffirmed that, as a state of mind, criminal intent \u201cis rarely susceptible of direct or positive proof and therefore must usually be inferred from the facts testified to by witnesses and the circumstances as developed by the evidence.\u201d <em>Motarie, </em>\u00b6 8 (citation and internal quotations omitted). We concluded, therefore, that \u201c[s]een in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable jury could have determined that Motarie intended to stop Iverson from continuing his cooperation in Motarie\u2019s prosecution and, thus, he had the requisite purpose\u201d under the statutes. <em>Motarie, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"ad-dedup-0\">\u00b629 Similarly, in <em>Keating, </em>we upheld a conviction of improper influence under \u00a7 45-7-102(1)(a)(i), MCA. <em>Keating, </em>285 Mont. at 477, 949 P.2d at 259. In that case, officers attempted to serve Keating with process and he told them to leave his property. <em>Keating, </em>285 Mont. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>469, 949 P.2d at 254. After the officers left, Keating called 911 and threatened to kill any officer who entered his property. <em>Keating, </em>285 Mont. at 469, 949 P.2d at 254-55. On appeal, Keating argued \u201cthat the State did not establish that his threat to kill officers coming on his property to serve process was made for the purpose of influencing an exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Keating, </em>285 Mont. at 477, 949 P.2d at 260. In upholding Keating\u2019s conviction, we noted that \u201cKeating started yelling when told the purpose of the [officers\u2019] visit,\u201d and that Keating made the threats shortly after the officers left. <em>Keating, </em>285 Mont. at 479-80, 949 P.2d at 261. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">The evidence regarding Keating\u2019s awareness of the [officers\u2019] reason for being at his residence ... and his threat after the [officers] attempted to serve him with process was sufficient to permit the jury to infer that Keating purposely or knowingly threatened the [officers] with the purpose to influence their exercise of discretion regarding where and when to accomplish service of process on him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\"><em>Keating, </em>285 Mont. at 480, 949 P.2d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b630 Similar to <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>the evidence here establishes that Spottedbear was intoxicated and agitated when Officer Walker first approached him. The evidence also shows, however, that unlike in <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>Spottedbear was not combative with the officer prior to being placed under arrest. The evidence establishes further that Spottedbear did not begin threatening Officer Walker until after Officer Walker informed Spottedbear that he was going to charge him with criminal trespass. At that point, Spottedbear became more agitated and brought up the previous incident in which he had assaulted Officer Walker. Spottedbear then yelled that he had seen Officer Walker and his \u201cfat fucking wife\u201d out in public. After Officer Walker advised him to be quiet, Spottedbear then yelled, multiple times: \u201cI will fucking kill you, your fat wife and your whole family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqCf\">\u00b631 Plenty Hawk\u2019s threats to kill the officer after he got out of jail could have made the officer even more disposed to keep Plenty Hawk in jail. <em>Motarie, </em>\u00b6 6. Here, in contrast\u2014viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution\u2014the jury could have found that Spottedbear thought that his threats to kill Officer Walker and his family might influence Officer Walker\u2019s decision to actually charge him with criminal trespass. Moreover, unlike in <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>the State introduced evidence showing as much. Officer Walker testified that he still had discretion and the ability to decide whether he was going to cite Spottedbear for criminal trespass at the time Spottedbear threatened him and his family. Officer Walker testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Spottedbear\u2019s threats concerned him because he had seen Spottedbear near his house, his wife was seven months pregnant, and Spottedbear had previously assaulted him. Finally, Officer Walker testified that intoxicated people had threatened him in the past, but that this time was different because it was the first time anyone had ever threatened his family, and Spottedbear made clear that he had seen Officer Walker and his wife in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b632 True, Spottedbear did not explicitly state the condition upon which his threats were based. But such direct proof is unnecessary to show Spottedbear\u2019s purpose to influence, which could \u201cbe inferred from the facts testified to by witnesses and the circumstances as developed by the evidence.\u201d <em>Motarte, </em>\u00b6 8; <em>Clausell, </em>\u00b6 31; see <em>Keating, </em>285 Mont. at 479-80, 949 P.2d at 261. Although the evidence could have supported a finding that Spottedbear was generally belligerent and did not have the purpose to influence Officer Walker\u2019s discretion, our inquiry on appeal is whether \u201csufficient evidence exists to support the verdict.\u201d <em>Weigand, </em>\u00b6 7. The jury weighed the conflicting evidence based on Officer Walker\u2019s credibility and determined that the State\u2019s version of the events should prevail. <em>Weigand, </em>\u00b6 7. Such a determination is \u201cexclusively within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>State v. Bower, </em>254 Mont. 1, 8, 833 P.2d 1106, 1111 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"A4y\">\u00b633  We conclude, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, that any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Spottedbear threatened Officer Walker and his family with the purpose to influence Officer Walker\u2019s discretion in charging him with criminal trespass. Accordingly, the State presented sufficient evidence to convict Spottedbear of improper influence under \u00a7 45-7-102(1)(a)(i), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b634 <em>3. Whether the State presented sufficient evidence to convict Spottedbear of criminal trespass.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u00b635 Criminal trespass to property requires the State to show that \u201c(1) a \u2018person knowingly,\u2019 (2) \u2018enters or remains unlawfully in,\u2019 (3) an \u2018occupied structure\u2019 or \u2018the premises of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Robertson, </em>2014 MT 279, \u00b6 19, 376 Mont. 471, 336 P.3d 367 (quoting \u00a7 45-6-203(1), MCA). A person who is \u201clicensed, invited, or otherwise privileged to do so\u201d cannot be convicted of criminal trespass. Section 45-6-201(1), MCA; <em>Robertson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19, 24. Such privilege, however, \u201cmay be revoked at any time by personal communication of notice by the landowner or other authorized person to the entering person.\u201d Section 45-6-201(1), MCA. A person \u201cremains unlawfully\u201d pursuant to statute\u2014and therefore commits criminal trespass\u2014if the person remains upon the premises after his or her privilege is revoked. Sections 45-6-201(1), -203(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b636 Spottedbear asserts that he\u2014along with all members of the public\u2014had a license to be in the Wal-Mart store. Accordingly, Spottedbear contends, \u201cto secure a trespass conviction in a case where a person at one time had a license to be on a property, the State must present adequate proof that the landowner or another authorized person revoked the license.\u201d Spottedbear argues that the State presented no evidence that an authorized person revoked his license to be in the store. Spottedbear notes that Officer Walker\u2014who was the only witness at the trial\u2014testified that he, and not an authorized person, told Spottedbear to leave the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b637 The State does not dispute that Spottedbear had a license to be at the store. The State argues, however, that it presented evidence that a store employee called the police and the store\u2019s manager informed Officer Walker of Spottedbear\u2019s behavior in the store. At that point, Officer Walker advised Spottedbear to leave. Thus, the State contends that \u201ca rational jury could have inferred that the manager not only desired that Spottedbear leave the store but that she authorized the officers to notify him that his privilege to remain in the store had been revoked and to escort him from the store on her behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b638 Officer Walker testified that he spoke with Janet Sherod upon arriving at the scene. He testified further that after speaking to Sherod, he advised Spottedbear to leave the premises. On cross-examination, Officer Walker testified that Sherod told him that \u201cher employees\u201d had called the police because another customer had accused Spottedbear of shoplifting and that an argument ensued. Officer Walker testified further that Sherod told him that Spottedbear had been yelling and swearing inside the store.</p>\n<p id=\"am-dedup-0\">\u00b639  Although a jury could infer from Officer Walker\u2019s testimony that an authorized person revoked Spottedbear\u2019s license to be at Wal-Mart, the State presented no evidence that Spottedbear remained unlawfully after his privilege was revoked. Officer Walker testified that after asking Spottedbear to leave, Spottedbear walked towards the exit, turned around and yelled at Sherod, and was then placed under arrest. Even viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Spottedbear remained unlawfully after Officer Walker directed him to leave. Accordingly, we conclude that the State did not present sufficient evidence to convict Spottedbear of criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u00b640 <em>4. Whether the District Court properly admitted evidence of Spottedbear\u2019s prior incident with Officer Walker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\u00b641 Spottedbear filed a motion in limine seeking to limit the admission of evidence relating to his prior incident with Officer Walker. Spottedbear argued that such evidence had little probative value when weighed against the high likelihood of substantial prejudice to Spottedbear. In addressing Spottedbear\u2019s motion, the court stated in open court that details regarding the prior incident were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">fair game except the conviction .... So I don\u2019t want any testimony that he\u2019s actually convicted of any crimes in ... the prior incident involving Officer Walker. So all of the other circumstances surrounding the offenses are admissible, but the actual conviction itself, I think you can get in everything you need under [M. R. Evid.] 404(b) without ... admitting evidence of the actual conviction. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">And for the record, under Rule 404(b),... the Court finds that the evidence of the actual convictions would be unduly prejudicial, would confuse the issues, and are unnecessary in order to show the knowledge, intent and motive that the State is trying to prove.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aul\">Before the State introduced the evidence of the prior incident during trial, the Court read the following limiting instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX_\">The State will now offer evidence that the Defendant at another time engaged in other wrongs or acts. That evidence is not admitted to prove the character of the Defendant, or to show he acted in conformity therewith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">The only purpose of admitting that evidence is to show proof of motive, opportunity, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. You may not use that evidence for any other purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">The Defendant is not being tried for that other wrong or act. He may not be convicted for any other offense than that charged in this case. For the jury to convict a Defendant of any other offense than that charged in this case may result in unjust double punishment of the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Both the State and Spottedbear\u2019s counsel questioned Officer Walker about the prior incident and discussed the prior incident in their closing arguments to support their respective arguments. The District Court gave the limiting instruction again prior to the closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">\u00b642 On appeal, Spottedbear contends that the District Court improperly allowed the State to present evidence of his prior incident with Officer Walker. Spottedbear asserts that the prior incident was not relevant and was thus inadmissible under the Montana Rules of Evidence. Spottedbear asserts further that the incident\u2019s probative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>value \u201cwas extremely limited if not non-existent under the theory argued by the State\u201d because it showed that physically assaulting Officer Walker\u2014let alone just threatening him\u2014would not influence his discretion, and the State\u2019s assertion that it was relevant to demonstrate the severity of Spottedbear\u2019s threats was misplaced because the severity of the threat is not an element of improper influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b643 More, Spottedbear alleges, the prior incident\u2019s probative value was outweighed by its danger of unfair prejudice. Spottedbear argues that the message that the prior incident sent to the jury was that \u201cSpottedbear is someone who follows through with his threats of violence.\u201d By focusing on the prior incident and the severity of his threats, Spottedbear asserts, the \u201cState\u2019s argument invited the jury to ignore the law and convict on an improper basis.\u201d Finally, Spottedbear contends that the District Court\u2019s limiting instruction did not minimize the prejudice caused by the prior incident\u2019s admission, especially when \u201cthe State\u2019s theory of relevance was unintuitive and risked much unfair prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b644 Generally, \u201c[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible\u201d unless otherwise provided by law. M. R. Evid. 402. Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d M. R. Evid. 401. M. R. Evid. 404(b), however, places a limitation on the admission of otherwise relevant evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts ... to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Nevertheless, prior act evidence may \u201cbe admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d M. R. Evid. 404(b). In other words, \u201c[elvidence of prior bad acts is not admissible if it is offered for a purpose that requires the inference from bad act to bad person to guilty person, but may be admissible if it proves a material issue without requiring any inference to the defendant\u2019s criminal disposition.\u201d <em>State v. Franks, </em>2014 MT 273, \u00b6 14, 376 Mont. 431, 335 P.3d 725 (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b645 Even if such evidence \u201cis offered for a valid non-propensity purpose, M. R. Evid. 404(b) may require its exclusion if the nature of the evidence might tempt the jury to decide the case against the defendant on an improper propensity basis.\u201d <em>Franks, </em>\u00b6 15 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">In this way, M. R. Evid. 404(b) must be viewed in concert with M. R. Evid. 403, which allows the exclusion of relevant evidence if its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Evidence that is offered for a valid purpose under M. R. Evid. 404(b) is still subject to the balancing test prescribed by M. R. Evid. 403.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\"><em>Franks, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2012 MT 317, \u00b6 67, 367 Mont. 503, 291 P.3d 1187). M. R. Evid. 403, in turn, \u201cdoes not require the exclusion of relevant evidence simply because it is prejudicial.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 68. Rather, the rule \u201cconfers discretion on the trial judge to exclude relevant evidence that poses a danger of\u2018unfair\u2019 prejudice, but only if the danger of unfair prejudice \u2018substantially outweigh[s]\u2019 the evidence\u2019s probative value.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 68 (quoting M. R. Evid. 403). The danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs probative value \u201cwhen the evidence will prompt the jury to decide the case on an improper basis.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 68 (citation omitted). A district court has \u201cbroad discretion to admit or exclude evidence under M. R. Evid. 403.\u201d <em>State v. Pulst, </em>2015 MT 184, \u00b6 21, 379 Mont. 494, 351 P.3d 687.</p>\n<p id=\"Af8\">\u00b646  Under M. R. Evid. 404(b), the State could not use evidence of the prior incident to prove Spottedbear\u2019s character in order to show that he acted \u201cin conformity therewith.\u201d As the District Court noted, however, the prior incident could be used under M. R. Evid. 404(b) \u201cin order to show the knowledge, intent and motive that the State [was] trying to prove.\u201d Our review of the record establishes that the State used the prior evidence for just such a purpose. Spottedbear\u2019s arguments to the contrary are belied by the fact that during the trial he used the prior incident to argue that he did not threaten Officer Walker with the purpose to influence Officer Walker\u2019s discretion. In fact, Spottedbear used the prior incident to demonstrate that he had a propensity for making such threats and knew that threats would not influence Officer Walker. The prior incident, therefore, was used by both parties to persuade the jury in determining Spottedbear\u2019s purpose under \u00a7 45-7-102(1)(a)(i), MCA. Spottedbear has not demonstrated that the danger of unfair prejudice from introducing evidence of the prior incident substantially outweighed the evidence\u2019s probative value. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing evidence of the prior incident under M. R. Evid. 403 and 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b647 5. <em>Whether Spottedbear\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b648 Spottedbear asserts that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the State\u2019s definition of \u201cpurpose\u201d compromised the improper influence verdict, and constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Spottedbear points out that the District Court instructed the jury that \u201c[a] person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>acts purposely, or with a purpose, when it is the person\u2019s conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature.\u201d Such an instruction, Spottedbear contends, fails to adequately instruct the jury on the meaning of \u201cpurpose\u201d as used in \u00a7 45-7-102(1)(a)(i), MCA, because the statute requires that a person act purposely to cause a result, not to engage in conduct. Spottedbear argues that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the State\u2019s jury instruction on \u201cpurpose\u201d is \u201cglaring and lacks plausible justification\u201d and represents a \u201cfailure to use the law to bolster [his] theory of the case.\u201d As such, Spottedbear contends that his counsel\u2019s failure to object \u201clessened the State\u2019s burden\u201d and prejudiced him. Spottedbear contends further that \u201cItlhere is a reasonable possibility that, but for trial-counsel\u2019s failure to procure proper instruction, the trial would have ended differently,\u201d which requires a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b649 We apply a two-part test in analyzing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. It requires a defendant to \u201cdemonstrate (1) that counsel\u2019s representation was deficient and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficiency was prejudicial by establishing that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 15. A defendant must satisfy both prongs of this test \u201cin order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim; thus, an insufficient showing on one prong negates the need to address the other.\u201d <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>2012 MT 227, \u00b6 21, 366 Mont. 379, 286 P.3d 1196. The inquiry under the second prong \u201cfocuses on whether counsel\u2019s deficient performance renders the trial result unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"AM6\">\u00b650 We decline to consider whether Spottedbear\u2019s counsel provided deficient representation by failing to object to the District Court\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d instruction. Spottedbear has not established that there was a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel\u2019s error, the result of the proceeding would have been different had a result-based definition of purpose been given. The District Court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">To convict the Defendant of the charge of threat and other improper influence in official matters, the State must prove the following elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">1. That the Defendant threatened harm to Officer Walker, his spouse, child, parent, or sibling:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">AND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">2. That the Defendant did so with the purpose to influence the exercise of discretion as a public servant!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">This instruction made clear that Spottedbear had to act with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u201cpurpose to influence.\u201d Even with the conduct-based definition of \u201cpurpose,\u201d Spottedbear has not, and cannot, demonstrate that the District Court\u2019s instruction \u201crenders the trial result unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b651 We affirm Spottedbear\u2019s conviction of improper influence and reverse his conviction of criminal trespass.
