McClure\u2019s (Jack) death in January 2013, his widow, Ruth Elsie Stiller Miller McClure (Ellie), and his children, George E. McClure, John W. McClure, and Verlayn G. McManus (collectively Siblings), have been involved in contentious litigation regarding the McClure Family Trust (the Trust). Ellie sought to enforce an amendment to the Trust, but the Fifth Judicial District Court concluded that under the Trust\u2019s plain language Ellie has no interest in any Trust assets. The court also rej ected Elbe\u2019s attempt to disinherit Siblings for purportedly contesting the Trust\u2019s validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">\u00b62 We conclude that Ellie has an interest in Trust assets and that Siblings did not forfeit their interest in the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">\u00b63 In 1993, Jack and his wife Dixie \u2014 Siblings\u2019 mother \u2014 established the Trust by executing a standard form Revocable Living Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement) that they obtained from an out-of-state company. Along with the Trust Agreement, the company provided Jack and Dixie with a binder that included various other documents relating to the Trust (Trust Binder). The Trust Agreement states that the Trust\u2019s primary purpose was to \u201cprovide for the health, support and maintenance of [Jack and Dixie] during their lifetimes.\u201d The Trust assets initially included real property in Montana and in Oregon, vehicles, and bank and investment accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">\u00b64 The Trust Agreement created a revocable trust that Jack and Dixie could modify or amend while both were living. The Trust Agreement provides that, upon the death of either Jack or Dixie, the living spouse \u201cshall divide the entire Trust Estate into two or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>separate trusts to be known ... as the \u2018Survivor\u2019s Trust\u2019 and the \u2018Decedent\u2019s Trust.\u2019 \u201d The Trust Agreement makes clear that the Decedent\u2019s Trust is irrevocable, \u201cbut the Survivor\u2019s trust shall continue to be revocable and subject to amendment and modification by the surviving Trustor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b65 The Trust Agreement specifies that the principal of the Survivor\u2019s Trust \u201cshall consist of all the interest in each and every asset held by the Trustee pursuant to this declaration on or by reason of the death of the deceased Trustor, not allocated to the principal or Trust Estate of the Decedent\u2019s Trust pursuant to Section 3.3.\u201d Section 3.3, in turn, stipulates that the principal of the Decedent\u2019s Trust \u201cshall consist of assets equal in value to the maximum amount, if any, that can pass free of federal estate tax by reason of the unified credit available to the estate of the Trustor.\u201d The surviving spouse has an unlimited right to withdraw \u201cas much of the principal of the Survivor\u2019s Trust as he or she shall request in writing.\u201d Conversely, the surviving spouse\u2019s right to withdraw funds from the principal of the Decedent\u2019s Trust is limited to the greater of $5,000 or five percent of the principal per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u00b66 The Trust Agreement names Siblings as beneficiaries, with each receiving one-third of the Trust principal upon the surviving spouse\u2019s death. The Trust Agreement appoints John W. McClure or George McClure to serve as successor trustee upon the surviving spouse\u2019s death. The Trust Agreement contains a no contest provision that provides that any beneficiary who contests the Trust\u2019s validity shall forfeit any interest the beneficiary may have under the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b67 Dixie died in 2004. The Trust assets at that time were valued low enough to pass free of the federal estate tax by reason of the unified tax credit. Following Dixie\u2019s death, Jack continued to accumulate assets, which became part of the Trust principal. Jack also continued to treat the entire Trust as revocable and he did not divide the Trust assets between a Survivor\u2019s Trust and a Decedent\u2019s Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u00b68 Jack married Elbe in 2006. Prior to marrying, Jack granted Elbe a life estate in their marital home in Dillon, Montana. The home is a Trust asset. In September 2012, Jack executed the First Amendment to the Trust (Amendment), which purported to make Elbe his successor trustee. The Amendment specified that upon Jack\u2019s death, Ellie would \u201cbecome the sole beneficiary for her lifetime of all income and principal of the [Trust]. Such income and principal shall be available to her at her discretion to maintain her comfort, care and general welfare and living expenses, including medical expenses.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The Amendment specified further that upon Elbe\u2019s death, \u201call remaining assets of the [Trust] shall be distributed according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>terms of said trust\u201d to Siblings. Finally, the Amendment named George McClure trustee upon Ellie\u2019s \u201cresignation, death or incapacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\u00b69 Jack died four months after executing the Amendment. Jack\u2019swill, which was included in the Trust Binder, contained a pour-over clause that conveyed all of his property to the Trust to be \u201cheld, administered, and distributed in accordance with its provisions, including any amendments made to it before [his] death.\u201d Jack\u2019s will also contained a no contest provision similar to that of the Trust Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b610 In June 2014, Siblings sued Ellie for conversion of Trust assets, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty. Siblings sought compensatory and punitive damages. Siblings requested also that the court set aside both the Amendment and the life estate Jack conveyed to Ellie in their home. Ellie counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory judgment concerning the construction, validity, and application of the Trust Agreement, the Amendment, and the life estate. In September 2014, unbeknownst to Ellie, George opened a probate action and petitioned to become the personal representative of Jack\u2019s estate, which the District Court granted. Upon learning of this development, Ellie petitioned to have George removed as personal representative of Jack\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\u00b611 The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in the civil case regarding the construction of the Trust Agreement, the manner in which the trusts should have been funded, and the Amendment\u2019s validity. The District Court issued an order consolidating the civil and probate cases, denying Ellie\u2019s summary judgment motion, and denying her petition to remove George as personal representative. The court concluded that under the Trust Agreement\u2019s plain language, the Decedent\u2019s Trust should have been funded up to the amount that could pass free of federal estate tax under the unifi ed credit, which was $1.5 million at the time of Dixie\u2019s death. Because the Trust\u2019s assets were \u201csubstantially less than this amount,\u201d the District Court concluded that \u201cthe Survivor\u2019s Trust never came into existence.\u201d Accordingly, the court determined that the Amendment was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\u00b612 Ellie appealed the District Court\u2019s order. Before submitting an opening brief on appeal, Ellie filed a motion to stay the appeal and remand to the District Court so the court could consider the \u201cTrustee Instructions,\u201d which were included in the Trust Binder. Ellie asserted that Siblings kept the Trustee Instructions from her. She alleged that the instructions showed that the District Court erroneously interpreted the Trust. Siblings opposed Ellie\u2019s motion and filed a motion to dismiss her appeal. We dismissed the appeal without prejudice. <em>George E. McClure v. Ruth Elsie Stiller Miller McClure, </em>No. DA 15-0311, Or. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>(Mont., Sept. 08, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b6 13 Upon remand, Ellie filed several motions. She sought to revise the court\u2019s previous order to conclude that the Survivor\u2019s Trust came into existence based on the Trustee Instructions; she moved for partial summary judgment declaring that the Decedent\u2019s Trust became fixed in value upon Dixie\u2019s death in 2004; and she asked the court to forfeit Siblings\u2019 interests under the no contest provisions of the Trust and Jack\u2019s will. The District Court denied the motions, reasoning that: the Trust Agreement was unambiguous and therefore the court did not need to consider the Trustee Instructions, which it concluded were extrinsic evidence; Jack did not create a separate trust with the assets he accumulated following Dixie\u2019s death, and therefore those assets were part of the Decedent\u2019s Tmst; and, even if the no contest provisions applied, they would be unenforceable against Siblings. Ellie appeals both the District Court\u2019s initial order interpreting the Trust Agreement and its order denying her motions upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b6 14 We review summary judgment rulings de novo. <em>Garza v. Forquest Ventures, Inc. </em>, 2015 MT 284, \u00b6 11, 381 Mont. 189, 358 P.3d 189. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Garza, </em>\u00b6 11. A district court\u2019s interpretation of a trust agreement presents a question of law, which we review for correctness. <em>In re Charles M. Bair Family Trust, </em>2008 MT 144, \u00b6 32, 343 Mont. 138, 183 P.3d 61 (hereafter <em>Bair Family Trust). </em>Similarly, whether a portion of a written agreement is ambiguous is a question of law, which we review for correctness. <em>In re Marriage of Holloway, </em>2000 MT 104, \u00b6 5, 299 Mont. 291, 999 P.2d 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\u00b615 As an initial matter, we are unpersuaded by Siblings\u2019 contention that Elbe\u2019s appeal is improper. As Ellie correctly argues, the District Court\u2019s orders are orders \u201crefusing, allowing, or directing the distribution of any estate or part thereof\u2019 under M. R. App. P. 6(4)(e). The District Court\u2019s rulings deny Ellie any interest in or claim to Jack\u2019s estate. As such, the orders \u201care considered final,\u201d M. R. App. P. 6(4), and we may review them on appeal, M. R. App. P. 6(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">\u00b616 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in interpreting the Trust Agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\u00b617 The District Court concluded that the Trust Agreement\u2019s terms are unambiguous. The court noted that under Section 3.2 of the Trust Agreement, the principal of the Survivor\u2019s Trust consists of only those assets not allocated to the principal of the Decedent\u2019s Trust. The court relied on the directive in Section 3.3 that the principal of the Decedent\u2019s Trust \u201cshall consist of assets equal in value to the maximum amount, if any, that can pass free of federal estate tax by reason of the unified credit.\u201d The court determined that, because the unified credit amount was $1.5 million when Dixie died, \u201cthe Decedent\u2019s Trust should have been funded up to that amount.\u201d Because the Trust assets did not exceed $1.5 million when Dixie died, the court determined that \u201cthe Survivor\u2019s Trust could not have been funded at all.\u201d Accordingly, it concluded \u201cthat the Survivor\u2019s Trust never came into existence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b618 Addressing Section 3.1 of the Trust Agreement, which provides that the trustee \u201cshall divide the entire Trust Estate into\u201d a Survivor\u2019s Trust and a Decedent\u2019s Trust, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">Section 3.1 simply requires the trustee to divide the trust according to the provisions set out in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. When these three provisions are read together, it becomes clear that the word \u201cshall\u201d [in Section 3.1] only clarifies that the trustee has no discretion to refuse to fund the Survivor\u2019s Trust with all funds not allocated to the Decedent\u2019s Trust. Under the plain language of Section 3.3, the Survivor\u2019s Trust is not funded when assets do not exceed the value of the unified credit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The District Court concluded further that \u201cSection 3.1 only generally provides for division of the estate into two trusts,\u201d whereas \u201cSections 3.2 and 3.3 specifically provide how this division must occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b619 The court acknowledged that at the time Jack and Dixie created the Trust, \u201cthe unified credit was only $600,000.\u201d The court also determined that Jack and Dixie may have anticipated that assets \u201cwould be left over to transfer into the Survivor\u2019s Trust\u201d after the Decedent\u2019s Trust had been funded up to the maximum amount allowed by the unified credit. The court concluded, though, that the Trust Agreement \u201cplainly demonstrates that [Jack and Dixie] intended the amount to vary with the unified credit.\u201d So, the court decided, the plain language of Section 3.3 \u201cdemonstrates that the primary purpose was to avoid estate taxes, not to fund the Survivor\u2019s Trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u00b620 Because the court found no ambiguity in the Trust Agreement, it declined to consider documents from the Trust Binder because they were extrinsic evidence. Based on its determination that the irrevocable Decedent\u2019s Trust came into existence, but that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>revocable Survivor\u2019s Trust did not, the court concluded that Jack had no power to amend the Trust Agreement. Consequently, the court determined that \u201cthe purported Amendment [was] invalid\u201d and that Ellie had no right to Trust assets. While the court did not speak directly to the issue, its holding that the irrevocable Decedent\u2019s Trust included all the Trust assets necessarily means that Jack did not have authority to convey the life estate to Ellie.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b621 Unquestionably, \u201c[t]he trustor\u2019s intent controls our interpretation of a trust agreement.\u201d <em>Bair Family Trust, </em>\u00b6 32 (citing <em>In re Estate of Snyder, </em>2000 MT 113, \u00b6 10, 299 Mont. 421, 2 P.3d 238; <em>Matter of Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. 114, 120, 943 P.2d 981, 985 (1997)). To discern intent, we look to \u201cthe language of the entire trust agreement, rather than [to] a particular word or phrase.\u201d <em>Bair Family Trust, </em>\u00b6 32 (citing <em>Estate of Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. at 120, 943 P.2d at 985). Thus, we seek to \u201cgive some effect to every expression\u201d in interpreting a trust agreement\u2019s language; we avoid \u201can interpretation which will render any of the expressions inoperative.\u201d <em>Estate of Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting <em>Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. at 121, 943 P.2d at 985). Further, \u201cwe emphasize substance over form, and we construe the [trust agreement\u2019s] words in their ordinary and grammatical sense, absent a clear opposite intention.\u201d <em>Bair Family Trust, </em>\u00b6 32 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b622 By focusing on a particular section of the Trust Agreement \u2014 Section 3.3 \u2014 the District Court failed to analyze \u201cthe language of the entire [T]rust [A]greement\u201d to discern Jack\u2019s and Dixie\u2019s intent in creating the Trust. <em>Bair Family Trust, </em>\u00b6 32. Section 1.1 of the Trust Agreement unequivocally manifests Jack\u2019s and Dixie\u2019s intention that the Trust\u2019s primary purpose \u201cshall be to provide for the health, support and maintenance of [Jack and Dixie] during their lifetimes, in their accustomed manner of living.\u201d The Trust\u2019s expressed secondary purpose, on the other hand, \u201cshall be to permit [Jack and Dixie] to provide funds for the reasonable health, support, and education of\u2019 Siblings. By concluding \u2014 based on its narrow emphasis on Section 3.3 \u2014 that Jack\u2019s and Dixie\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose was to avoid estate taxes, not to fund the Survivor\u2019s Trust,\u201d the court elevated the Trust Agreement\u2019s stated secondary purpose \u2014 to provide for Siblings \u2014 over the express primary purpose \u2014 to provide for Jack upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Dixie\u2019s death. And the court failed to give \u201csome effect to every expression\u201d in the Trust Agreement when it relied exclusively on Section 3.3. <em>Estate of Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b623 Likewise, the District Court\u2019s interpretation rendered additional sections of the Trust Agreement inoperative. Section 3.1 provides that the trustee \u201cshall divide the entire Trust Estate into\u201d a Survivor\u2019s Trust and a Decedent\u2019s Trust, and Section 1.7 states that upon the first spouse\u2019s death, \u201cthe Decedent\u2019s Trust... shall become irrevocable but the Survivor\u2019s Trust shall continue to be revocable and subject to amendment and modification by the surviving trustor.\u201d These sections, construed \u201cin their ordinary and grammatical sense,\u201d <em>Bair Family Trust, </em>\u00b6 32, required that the Trust be divided into a revocable Survivor\u2019s Trust and an irrevocable Decedent\u2019s Trust upon Dixie\u2019s death so that Jack would have the ability to manage his survivor\u2019s share for his support during the remainder of his lifetime. Contrary to the District Court\u2019s determination, the Trust Agreement\u2019s other provisions do not establish a \u201cclear opposite intention.\u201d <em>Bair Family Trust, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b624 Nevertheless, as the District Court concluded, Section 3.3 could be interpreted reasonably to require that the Decedent\u2019s Trust be funded up to the maximum amount of the unified tax credit. Such an interpretation would result in no assets being allocated to the Survivor\u2019s Trust, because Section 3.2 limits the principal of the Survivor\u2019s Trust to those assets \u201cnot allocated to the principal... of the Decedent\u2019s Trust.\u201d This interpretation, however, conflicts with both the plain language of Sections 1.7 and 3.1 and the stated intent of Jack and Dixie in creating the Trust. The Trust Agreement\u2019s terms are thus susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. Consequently, the Trust Agreement is ambiguous. Because the Trust Agreement is ambiguous, \u201cextrinsic evidence is admissible to aid in determining the ... meaning of the terms and [Jack\u2019s and Dixie\u2019s] intent in distributing their property through the Trust.\u201d <em>In the Matter of the Estate of the Dern Family Trust, </em>279 Mont. 138, 145, 928 P.2d 123, 127-28 (1996) (hereafter <em>Dern Family Trust). </em>Extrinsic evidence includes documents associated with a trust agreement, such as trustee instructions. <em>Dern Family Trust, </em>279 Mont. at 147-48, 928 P.2d at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b625 The Trust Binder includes both the Trustee Instructions and a \u201cTrust Summary.\u201d The Trust Summary \u201cidentifies the documents [the company] prepared in accordance with the instructions and preferences [Jack and Dixie] stated in [their] application.\u201d Summarizing \u201csome of the key provisions\u201d of the Trust Agreement, it specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Section 3.2 provides that the trust estate will split into two equal trusts, with the decedent\u2019s (or \u201cB\u201d) trust becoming irrevocable. Section 3.3 provides that the surviving spouse will have full authority and control over the survivor\u2019s (or \u201cA\u201d) trust and is entitled to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">(1) all income from the assets of the \u201cB\u201d trust;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">(2) access to the principal of the \u201cB\u201d trust under certain conditions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">(3) withdraw up to $5,000 or 5% from principal each year for any purpose.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The Trust Summary identifies the other documents in the Trust Binder. It states that the Trustee Instructions \u201cprovide[ ] your surviving spouse, and/or another successor trustee with guidelines and forms for settling the trust affairs when either of you dies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">\u00b626 The Trustee Instructions, in turn, provide, \u201cIf a couple have a complex (federal tax planning) A-B Trust, one-half of the Trust (the Decedent\u2019s B Trust) may become irrevocable upon the death of a spouse.\u201d The Trustee Instructions continue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">The decedent\u2019s share of community and separate property should be identified and placed in the Decedent\u2019s B Trust, with any excess over $600,000 placed in the \u201cC\u201d Trust, if available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">The decedent\u2019s assets consist of the decedent\u2019s separate property and the value of the decedent\u2019s share of the community or common property. One-half of the asset value of the community or common property must flow into Trust B .... This does not mean that both the decedent\u2019s and the survivor\u2019s trust need to own half of all assets at death. You may place total ownership of any asset in either trust as long as you put an equal value of assets into the \u201cA\u201d and the \u201cB\u201d (plus \u201cC\u201d) trusts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">The Trustee Instructions make clear that \u201c[a] person who has an A-B\u2019 Trust with federal tax planning features... must allocate assets among the applicable trusts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">\u00b627 Reading the Trust Agreement together with the Trust Summary and the Trustee Instructions \u201cso as to give effect to all,\u201d the documents show that Jack and Dixie intended for the Survivor\u2019s Trust to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>funded. <em>Dern Family Trust, </em>279 Mont. at 148, 928 P.2d at 129. Because Jack\u2019s and Dixie\u2019s \u201cintent controls our interpretation of [the] [T]rust [AJgreement,\u201d we hold that the District Court incorrectly interpreted the Trust Agreement. <em>Bair Family Trust, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"AxH\">\u00b628 Under the Trust Agreement, the Survivor\u2019s Trust \u2014 which is \u201csubject to amendment and modification by\u201d Jack \u2014 should have come into existence and been funded. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court incorrectly determined that the Amendment is invalid. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-38-602(1), MCA (\u201cUnless the terms of a trust expressly provide that the trust is irrevocable, the settlor may ... amend the trust.\u201d); \u00a7 72-38-602(3), MCA (\u201cThe settlor may ... amend a revocable trust: (a) by substantial compliance with a method provided in the terms of the trust; or (b) if the terms of the trust do not provide a method, by a writing delivered to the trustee manifesting clear and convincing evidence of the settlor\u2019s intent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b629 Finally, Section 1.5 of the Trust Agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">All property now or hereafter conveyed or transferred to the Trustee(s) pursuant to this Declaration, which was ... separate property at the time of such conveyance or transfer, shall retain its character [as] ... the separate property of the Trustor transferring such property to the Trust, during Trustors\u2019 lifetimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKa\">Section 1.5 provides plainly that the assets Jack accumulated after Dixie\u2019s death are considered Jack\u2019s separate property. Pursuant to the Trustee Instructions, those assets cannot be included in the Decedent\u2019s Trust because they cannot comprise Dixie\u2019s separate property, nor can they comprise Dixie\u2019s share of the community or common property. Consequently, Jack\u2019s assets accumulated after Dixie\u2019s death are part of the Survivor\u2019s Trust and are subject to the Amendment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-38-602(2), MCA (\u201cIf a revocable trust is created or funded by more than one settlor ... each settlor may ... amend the trust with regard the portion of the trust property attributable to that settlor\u2019s contribution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u00b630 Upon remand, the District Court must calculate the Trust assets at the time of Dixie\u2019s death, and it must divide the value of those assets equally between the Decedent\u2019s Trust and the Survivor\u2019s Trust. The court also must calculate the value of the assets Jack accrued after Dixie\u2019s death and apportion them to the Survivor\u2019s Trust. Additionally, in light of our conclusion that the revocable Survivor\u2019s Trust \u2014 which Jack had the authority to amend \u2014 came into existence, the District Court must revisit its consideration of the life estate that Jack conveyed to Elbe in their marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u00b631 <em>2. Whether the District Court incorrectly determined that Siblings </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number><em>did not forfeit their interests in the Trust pursuant to the no contest provisions of the Trust Agreement and Jack\u2019s will.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b632 The Trust Agreement\u2019s no contest provision provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">if any beneficiary hereunder asserts any claim (except a legally enforceable debt), statutory election, or other right or interest against or in Trustor\u2019s estate, Trustor\u2019s Will, or any properties of this trust, other than pursuant to the express terms hereof or of said Will, or directly or indirectly contests, disputes, or calls into question, before any court, the validity of this instrument or of said Will, then... [that person] shall thereby absolutely forfeit any and all beneficial interests of whatsoever kind and nature which such beneficiary might otherwise have under this instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM3\">The no contest provision of Jack\u2019s will in like fashion provides that if any beneficiary of Jack\u2019s estate \u201cseeks through any court proceeding to prevent the admission to probate or to contest the validity of this Will or any of its provisions, any share or interest in [Jack\u2019s] estate given to that beneficiary under this will is hereby revoked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b633 The District Court concluded that the no contest provisions did not proscribe Siblings\u2019 actions. It determined that in the probate proceeding, \u201cGeorge sought to admit [Jack\u2019s] Will to probate and to force Ellie to account for her conduct as purported trustee.\u201d In the civil proceeding, the court determined that Siblings \u201csought damages from Ellie for conversion of trust assets and breach of fiduciary duties while she acted as trustee.\u201d Based on its analysis of the two proceedings, the court concluded that Siblings \u201cnever attacked the Trust Agreement.\u201d Furthermore, the court concluded, Siblings\u2019 \u201cactions do not \u2018contest\u2019 or \u2018dispute\u2019 the trust\u2019s validity or assert an interest other than the one conveyed by the terms of the Trust.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court held that the plain language of the Trust Agreement\u2019s no contest provision \u201cdoes not apply to such conduct.\u201d The District Court concluded similarly that the no contest provision of Jack\u2019s will did not apply to Siblings\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"AXA\">\u00b634 We agree with the District Court. A review of Siblings\u2019 complaint in the civil proceeding and George\u2019s petition in the probate proceeding establishes that they \u2014 similar to Ellie \u2014 simply were trying to ascertain the meaning of the Trust\u2019s language. Our conclusion that the Trust Agreement is ambiguous establishes further that Siblings acted within reason in trying to determine the Trust\u2019s construction. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court correctly determined that Siblings did not forfeit their interests in the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b635 We reverse the District Court\u2019s holding that the Amendment was invalid and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.
