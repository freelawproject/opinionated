Police officers pursued her at high speeds \u2014 with lights and sirens activated \u2014 off the Reservation and into Hill County. Russell drove erratically, badly damaging her car and causing oncoming traffic to swerve to avoid collision. Police officers eventually arrested Russell. The State charged her with criminal endangerment, among other offenses. At trial, Russell proposed a jury instruction on negligent endangerment as a lesser included offense. The District Court denied her request. The jury convicted Russell of criminal endangerment. She appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">\u00b63 In November 2014, Rocky Boy Tribal Officer Larry Bernard responded to multiple calls of a car driving \u201call over the road\u201d on the Reservation. Officer Bernard spotted the car in question driving in the wrong lane. He activated his patrol car\u2019s lights to conduct a traffic stop, and the driver pulled the car to the side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">\u00b64 Officer Bernard approached the stopped vehicle and recognized the driver as Georgie Russell. He noticed that Russell appeared intoxicated. Officer Bernard told Russell that he pulled her over because of multiple reports of her erratic driving. He asked her to turn off the engine, but she refused. When Officer Bernard attempted to open Russell\u2019s driver\u2019s-side door, Russell said either \u201cfuck you\u201d or \u201cfuck this\u201d and sped away.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">\u00b65 Officer Bernard pursued Russell with his patrol car\u2019s emergency lights and siren on. Russell\u2019s car reached speeds of approximately 100 miles per hour. Officer Bernard observed Russell\u2019s car drift back and forth across the center line of the highway. This caused other vehicles on the road to swerve or pull to the side of the road to avoid colliding with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">\u00b66 Russell drove beyond the Reservation boundary into Hill County. She then drove her car off the road, into a ditch, onto a raised railroad track, and back onto the road. Russell\u2019s car sustained a flat tire. Despite this, she continued to drive at high speeds, causing the tire to wear down to an exposed rim and to emit sparks.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">\u00b67 Additional police officers j oined the pursuit with their patrol cars\u2019 lights and sirens activated. The pursuing officers observed Russell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>car\u2019s speed fluctuate dramatically. Other vehicles on the road continued to take evasive action as Russell\u2019s car weaved back and forth across the road. One driver drove into a ditch to avoid a collision with Russell\u2019s car. Even with her erratic driving, Russell still used her brakes and turn signal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b68 Russell eventually pulled her car to the side of the road and stopped. The pursuing officers arrested her. Upon arrest, the officers noticed that Russell\u2019s speech was slow and slurred, that she struggled to maintain her balance, and that she smelled of alcohol. The officers transported Russell to a detention facility. There, she took a sobriety test and showed further signs of intoxication, including poor motor skills and difficulty following directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b69 Russell asked her arresting officers multiple times why she was in trouble. When an officer explained to Russell why she was under arrest, Russell appeared confused. When the officer asked Russell why she had run from the police, Russell responded that she did not think she had been running.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b610 The State charged Russell with fleeing from or eluding a peace officer, driving under the influence, and criminal endangerment. At trial, Russell requested a jury instruction on negligent endangerment as a lesser included offense of criminal endangerment. The District Court refused Russell\u2019s proposed instruction. It concluded that the evidence established that Russell acted knowingly when she led the police on a high-speed chase, and it therefore held that the evidence could not support a jury finding that Russell had acted negligently. The jury convicted Russell of all three charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b611 Russell claims that the District Court should have instructed the jury on negligent endangerment and that she is entitled to a new trial on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\u00b612 We review for abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s refusal to give an instruction on a lesser included offense. <em>State v. Shegrud, </em>2014 MT 63, \u00b6 7, 374 Mont. 192, 320 P.3d 455. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2016 MT 1, \u00b6 13, 382 Mont. 57, 363 P.3d 1140. We review claims of instructional error in a criminal case to determine whether the jury instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">\u00b613 Russell argues that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing her proposed jury instruction on negligent endangerment as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>a lesser included offense of criminal endangerment. She contends that the evidence does not conclusively establish that she was fully aware of the probable outcome of her actions \u2014 in other words, that she acted knowingly \u2014 but instead that the evidence could have supported a jury finding that she acted negligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b614 Montana law defines criminal endangerment as \u201cknowingly [engaging] in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another.\u201d Section 45-5-207, MCA. A person acts \u201cknowingly\u201d when the person is aware of a high probability that the person\u2019s conduct will result in death or serious bodily injury to another. <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 11; \u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA. A court or jury may not take a defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication into consideration when determining whether the defendant acted knowingly for the purposes of criminal endangerment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-2-203, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b6 15 In contrast to criminal endangerment, a person commits negligent endangerment when she \u201cnegligently engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another.\u201d Section 45-5-208, MCA. A person acts \u201cnegligently\u201d when the person either \u201cconsciously disregards a risk\u201d that the person\u2019s conduct will result in death or serious bodily injury to another, or when the person disregards such a risk \u201cof which the person should be aware.\u201d Section 45-2-101(43), MCA; <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b616 A trial court must grant a request for a lesser included offense instruction when: (1) the offense is actually a lesser included offense of the offense charged, <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 9; (2) \u201cthere is a proper request by one of the parties\u201d for such an instruction, \u00a7 46-16-607(2), MCA; and (3) there is \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to support an instruction on the lesser included offense, such that \u201cthe jury, based on the evidence, could be warranted in finding the defendant guilty of [the] lesser included offense,\u201d <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting \u00a7 46-16-607(2), MCA). The evidence does not support a lesser included offense instruction on negligent endangerment if it \u201cshows clearly that the defendant acted knowingly\u201d or if \u201cthe defendant\u2019s evidence or theory, if believed, would require an acquittal.\u201d <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b617 Negligent endangerment constitutes a lesser included offense of criminal endangerment. <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 12. The record shows that the defendant made a \u201cproper request\u201d for an instruction on negligent endangerment, and the State does not argue otherwise. Section 46-16-607(2), MCA. Nor does either party assert that Russell\u2019s \u201cevidence or theory, if believed, would require an acquittal.\u201d <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 13. Instead, the parties dispute only whether, based on the evidence, the jury could have been warranted in finding Russell guilty of negligent endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u00b618 This Court agreed with the defendant in <em>Shegrud </em>that sufficient evidence existed to support a negligent endangerment instruction as a lesser included offense of criminal endangerment. <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 16. There, the police approached the driver of a pickup truck at a gas station after reports of a similar-looking truck driving erratically. <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4. The police noticed that the driver, Shegrud, appeared intoxicated and that his young daughter was seated in the backseat of his truck. <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 4. Shegrud admitted to drinking two \u201ctallboy\u201d beers and to taking prescribed oxycodone; blood tests, however, revealed that he was within the legal limits for both. <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"AZJ\">\u00b619 We concluded that Shegrud\u2019s statements that he had consumed prescribed oxycodone and beer \u201cdid not clearly establish awareness of a high probability that death or serious bodily injury would be caused by his conduct.\u201d <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 14. The fact that Shegrud \u201cdid not flee law enforcement or even respond to questioning evasively\u201d suggested further that he did not act knowingly. <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 14. We therefore held that the jury, based on the evidence, \u201ccould as reasonably have inferred that Shegrud acted negligently as inferred that he acted knowingly.\u201d <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b620 In contrast, we held in <em>State v. Martinosky, </em>1999 MT 122, 294 Mont. 427, 982 P.2d 440, that a District Court was correct to refuse the defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction on negligent endangerment as a lesser included offense of criminal endangerment. Martinosky backed his truck into a parked car outside of a bar, fled the scene of the collision, and ran a stop sign. <em>Martinosky, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. A police officer, using his patrol car\u2019s lights and siren, attempted to pull over Martinosky\u2019s truck. <em>Martinosky, </em>\u00b6 6. In response, Martinosky sped up and led the officer on a high-speed chase through a residential area. <em>Martinosky, </em>\u00b6 6. He eluded the pursuing officer, crashed his truck into a private home, and abandoned it. <em>Martinosky, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b621 The next day, Martinosky turned himself in to the police. <em>Martinosky, </em>\u00b6 7. He admitted that he had been drinking, that he knew he had sped through a residential neighborhood, and that he had fled from the police because he did not want to receive a DUI. <em>Martinosky, </em>\u00b6 21. This Court agreed that a negligent endangerment instruction was not justified because Martinosky\u2019s statements and behavior established that he was fully aware of his actions and the probable outcome of those actions; the evidence thus could not support a finding that Martinosky acted negligently. <em>Martinosky, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b622 We conclude that this case is more like <em>Martinosky. </em>The record shows that Russell was aware that she was fleeing from the police. When Officer Bernard conducted the initial traffic stop, Russell pulled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>her car to the side of the road. She spoke with Officer Bernard, she refused his instruction to turn off her engine, she swore at him, and then she sped away. This indicates that Russell knowingly fled the traffic stop, similar to Martinosky\u2019s response to an attempted traffic stop by intentionally speeding away. <em>See Martinosky, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b623 Russell drove at high speeds away from Officer Bernard and from a number of other police officers. All of the officers pursuing her had activated their cars\u2019 emergency lights and sirens, supporting the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Russell had to have been aware of the officers\u2019 intentions to stop her vehicle. Russell used her brakes and turn signal, illustrating her general awareness while driving. These facts demonstrate Russell\u2019s knowledge that she was driving away from the police officers who were pursuing her, unlike Shegrud, who made no attempts to evade the police. <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"Aeg\">\u00b624 The record establishes further that Russell, unlike Shegrud, was \u201caware that it [was] highly probable\u201d that her conduct would cause harm to others. Section 45-2-101(35), MCA. She drove at high speeds, she forced oncoming traffic to take evasive measures to avoid colliding with her car, and she drove on a flat tire with an exposed rim. This extreme behavior justified the District Court\u2019s determination that no reasonable jury could have been warranted in finding that Russell acted negligently and without awareness of the risk of harm that her conduct created.</p>\n<p id=\"Adq\">\u00b625 Because the evidence demonstrates that Russell acted knowingly in engaging \u201cin conduct that createfd] a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another,\u201d \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the evidence was insufficient to support an instruction on the lesser included offense of negligent endangerment, <em>see Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 9. \u201c[T]he jury instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instructed] the jury on the law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 7. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing Russell\u2019s proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u00b626 We affirm the District Court\u2019s refusal of Russell\u2019s proposed jury instruction on negligent endangerment as a lesser included offense of criminal endangerment. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
