The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>underlying payments arose from the Defendant\u2019s application of its policy\u2019s Coordination of Benefits Provision to avoid payment of medical expenses already paid by a third-party liability carrier without Defendant first undertaking a made whole analysis. The District Court found that, except for claims \u201carising after December 24, 2009,\u201d interest for all such payments is to commence 30 days following our decision in <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mont. v. Mont. State Auditor, </em>2009 MT 318, 352 Mont. 423, 218 P.3d 475 <em>(BCBS). </em>For claims arising after December 24,2009, the District Court required that the State pay interest commencing on the day the underlying medical expenses were incurred. We affirm the District Court order, but remand for correction of the date to be applied for determining the calculation of prejudgment interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b62 Diaz presents the following issue for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">\n<em>Whether the District Court correctly determined the date upon which interest should first accrue on claims for members of the State of Montana Health Benefit Plan.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b63 This case has been appealed on three previous occasions on various questions. The underlying claim in these proceedings concerns an exclusion in the State\u2019s health benefit insurance plan which allowed the State to coordinate benefits in violation of Montana\u2019s made whole laws. The State offers a State Employee Health Benefits Plan (Plan) paid to its employees, retired employees, and dependents of both. The Plan enrolls approximately 32,000 members and provides for coverage of health care costs to health care providers. Significantly, it does not provide for any payments to be made directly to a Plan member.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u00b64 The Plan had a coordination of benefits provision, in conjunction with payments from third parties, which excludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">5. Expenses that a member is entitled to have covered, or that are paid under an automobile insurance policy, a premise liability policy, or other liability insurance policy. This includes but is not limited to, a homeowner\u2019s policy or business liability policy, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>expenses that a member would be entitled to have covered under such policies if not covered by the State Plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Both Diaz and Hoffmann-Bernhardt\u2019s original medical bills were paid timely and in full by third-party insurers and the State. Diaz filed suit alleging that defendants, third-party administrators and the State, had violated the employees\u2019 made whole rights under Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b65 Our first consideration of coordination of benefits language, such as here, was in 2009 when we decided <em>BCBS. </em>In <em>BCBS, </em>coordination of benefits language in a Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield policy excluded coverage for any health care costs incurred by its insured if they received or were entitled to receive payment for those costs from a third-party\u2019s automobile or premises liability policy. The issue in <em>BCBS </em>was whether the coordination of benefits provision violated the made whole requirement in \u00a7 33-30-1102, MCA. We held that the legal effect of the coordination provision was to allow Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield to exercise subrogation before paying anything to its insured. <em>BCBS </em>was the first time this Court examined a coordination of benefits provision in the context of our made whole laws and determined that its utilization violated the made whole requirement of \u00a7 33-30-1102, MCA. <em>BCBS, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b6 6 The <em>Diaz </em>trilogy is premised upon our decision in <em>BCBS. </em>The first appeal dealt with Rule 23 class certification. We concluded that the District Court had properly certified a class which addressed issues of the Plan\u2019s coordination of benefits language. <em>Diaz v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>2011 MT 322, \u00b6 50, 267 P.3d 756 <em>(Diaz I). </em>The second appeal addressed the definition of the class by the court which included those claims with an \u201ceight-year statute of limitations suggested by the Plaintiffs, but also adopting the one-year filing limitation proposed by the State ....\u201d <em>Diaz, </em>\u00b6 14. We affirmed the court\u2019s class definition, observing that class action orders \u201care not frozen once made\u201d and that a \u201cDistrict Court maintains discretion to alter the class definition as the case proceeds.\u201d Diaz <em>v. State, </em>2013 MT 219, \u00b6 28, 308 P.3d 38 <em>(Diaz II). </em>The third appeal affirmed the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment finding the policy\u2019s coordination of benefits provision to be de facto subrogation and that the State, which operates as an insurer, is subject to the Insurance Code and Montana\u2019s made whole laws. <em>Diaz v. State, </em>2013 MT 331, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 313 P.3d 124 <em>(Diaz III).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u00b67 In the current appeal, which is the fourth, Diaz asks us to determine when interest should begin to accrue on the class members\u2019 claims. Some of the claims, given the court\u2019s broad class definition which we affirmed in <em>Diaz II, </em>predate our decision in <em>BCBS, </em>while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>other claims arose following our decision in <em>BCBS. </em>The District Court addressed both categories of claims and ordered that for <em>pre-BCBS </em>claims, interest commences 30 days following the date of our <em>BCBS </em>decision. For all claims arising subsequent to <em>BCBS, </em>the District Court required the State to pay interest commencing on the day the underlying medical expense was incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b68 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of prejudgment interest to determine if the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>Fitterer Sales Mont., Inc. v. Mullin, </em>2015 MT 272, \u00b6 16, 381 Mont. 107, 358 P.3d 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the District Court correctly determined the date upon which interest should first accrue on claims for members of the State of Montana Health Benefit Plan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u00b610 Diaz argues that \u00a7\u00a7 18-1-404(1) and 17-8-242(2), MCA, provide interest should commence 30 days after the date on which payment was due and that the District Court erred in commencing interest on the date <em>BCBS </em>was decided, rather than the date the bills were incurred. The statutory sections to which Diaz refers do, in fact, provide that interest is to commence from \u201cthe date on which the payment on the contract became due\u201d and that \u201c[t]his liability is retroactive... and applies to any contract in effect or an action pending on a contract on or after May 1, 1997.\u201d Section 18-l-404(l)(b), MCA. Further, Diaz argues that, pursuant to \u00a7 18-l-404(l)(a), MCA, the State is liable with respect to any contract in the same manner as an individual and that the provision for interest is retroactive whether \u201cdue before or after a decision by the government agency or court.\u201d Section 18-l-404(l)(b), MCA. Section 17-8-242(2), MCA, provides that payment is timely if made within 30 days of when the bill is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\u00b611 The State does not dispute that it is held to the same standard as an individual when it enters into a contract. Section 18-l-404(l)(a), MCA. The State contends that interest only accrues when an individual has a right to a monetary recovery and the right has fully vested. As the Plan provides no right of monetary recovery or for direct payment to Plan members, the State argues there is no interest liability until after a monetary right exists and has fully vested. Here, the State maintains the right of recovery was not created and could not vest until this Court determined in <em>BCBS </em>that the Plan\u2019s coordination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>of benefits provision violated Montana\u2019s made whole laws. Additionally, the State maintains that \u00a7 18-1-404, MCA, provides a good faith exception to the rule that interest commences when payment on the contract is due which allows for interest to be assessed following a court\u2019s resolution of the good faith dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b612 We have previously stated that \u201cprejudgment interest is to be awarded unless either the law or the creditor prevents the payment of principal.\u201d <em>Byrne v. Terry, </em>228 Mont. 387, 391, 741 P.2d 1341, 1343 (1987) (citing <em>Price Building Services, Inc. v. Holms, </em>214 Mont. 456, 468-69, 693 P.2d 553, 559-60 (1985)). Section 27-1-211, MCA, sets forth the criteria for an award of prejudgment interest as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">Each person who is entitled to recover damages certain or capable of being made certain by calculation and the right to recover that is vested in the person upon a particular day is entitled also to recover interest on the damages from that day except during the time that the debtor is prevented by law or by the act of the creditor from paying the debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b613 We have interpreted this statute as having three requirements a party must satisfy to be eligible for an award of prejudgment interest under \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA: (1) an underlying monetary obligation; (2) the amount of recovery must be certain or capable of being made certain by calculation; and (3) the right to recover must vest on a particular day. <em>Kraft v. High Country Motors, Inc., </em>2012 MT 83, \u00b6 70, 364 Mont. 465, 480-81, 276 P.3d 908; <em>see also New Hope Lutheran Ministry v. Faith Lutheran Church of Great Falls, Inc., </em>2014 MT 69, \u00b670, 374 Mont. 229, 328 P.3d 586; <em>Byrne, </em>228 Mont. at 390, 741 P.2d at 1343; <em>Stafford v. Fockaert, </em>2016 MT 28, \u00b6 24, 382 Mont. 178, 366 P.3d 673. The main purpose of prejudgment interest is to compensate a party for the loss of her money during the period in which her valid claim was not paid. <em>Byrne, </em>228 Mont. at 391, 741 P.2d at 1343. Finally, \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, mandates interest \u201cas long as the legal situation fits within the broad guidelines of the statute.\u201d <em>Byrne, </em>228 Mont. at 391, 741 P.2d at 1343. The instant proceedings involve the question of how to apply the provisions of \u00a7 18-1-404, MCA, within the context of \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, and the newly recognized right to recovery created by our decision in <em>BCBS. </em>For purposes of \u00a7 18-l-404(b), MCA, Diaz stipulates that the State had a good faith basis for disputing coverage. Accordingly, Diaz is entitled to prejudgment interest if the requirements of \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b614 The first criterion entitling a party to prejudgment interest is the existence of a monetary obligation. Here, the State had no monetary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>obligation under the Plan to its members. The policy provisions of the Plan did not allow for any payment or right to monetary recovery by a Plan member. As noted previously, the Plan provides for payment to health care providers and does not provide for any direct payments to a Plan member. With respect to third-party health care providers, the Plan recognized that payment of medical expenses may not be due because the coordination of benefits provision recognized the State\u2019s obligation as secondary to the payment from a third-party liability carrier. There is no dispute that Diaz\u2019s medical expenses were paid in a timely manner by a third-party carrier. It was not until our decision in <em>BCBS, </em>that any right to monetary recovery for damages arising out of the State\u2019s violation of the made whole laws was recognized. We conclude that the existence of an underlying monetary obligation did not exist under the Plan\u2019s provisions until our decision in <em>BCBS </em>and the first criterion of \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, has, therefore, not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajz\">\u00b615 Our conclusion that the underlying monetary obligation did not arise until our decision in <em>BCBS </em>also disposes of the third criterion in \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, that the right to recover vests on a particular day. Diaz\u2019s right to recover did not vest until our decision in <em>BCBS </em>recognized, for the first time, that the Plan\u2019s coordination of benefits provision violated Montana\u2019s made whole laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The coordination of benefits provision at issue was enforceable under Montana law until our decision to the contrary in <em>BCBS. </em>Thus, the particular day on which Diaz\u2019s right to recover vested was 30 days after our remittitur in <em>BCBS. See </em>\u00a7 17-8-242(2), MCA. The second criterion, that the amount of recovery is capable of being made certain by calculation, is undisputed. Nonetheless, on the basis of Diaz\u2019s failure to establish the (1) existence of an underlying monetary obligation prior to <em>BCBS, </em>and (2) the right to recover prior to <em>BCBS, </em>we conclude that the District Court did not err in holding that for claims arising prior to December 24, 2009, interest was to commence following our decision in <em>BCBS.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXBp\">\u00b616 We do note, however, that <em>BCBS </em>was decided on September 24, 2009, and our remittitur was issued October 15, 2009. Therefore, 30 days following the remittitur was November 14, 2009. We therefore remand only for the purpose of: (1) changing the date of December 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>2009, to November 14, 2009, as the correct date upon which interest is to commence, and (2) that the date of November 14, 2009, is also to be applied for purposes of assessing when a claim arose. For claims arising after November 14, 2009, the State shall pay interest commencing on the day the underlying medical expense was incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b6 17 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order declaring interest to begin 30 days following our decision in BCBS. We remand for the District Court to correct the commencement date for interest from December 24,2009 to November 14, 2009. Additionally, the order should reflect this applies to all claims arising prior to November 14, 2009.</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, BAKER, SHEA and RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-10\"> The District Court\u2019s ORDER ON INTEREST TO BE PAID incorrectly calculates 30 days following <em>BCBS </em>to be December 24, 2009.
