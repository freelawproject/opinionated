We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\n<em>Issue One: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights without making specific findings that the Department of Health and Human Services engaged in reasonable efforts to reunite the family pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-423(1), MCA?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">\n<em>Issue Two: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights based on a failed treatment plan pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">\n<em>Issue Three: Did the District Court deny Mother due process by failing to reappoint a public defender?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">\u00b63 In May 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services (DPHHS) received reports of concern for Mother\u2019s three children\u2019s welfare based on alleged drug use in the family home. DPHHS, through Child Protective Services social worker Pamela Meyerson (Meyerson), attempted to make contact with the family without success. In October 2014, DPHHS received reports from two doctors\u2019 offices stating Mother had brought her children in, concerned they were infested with bugs. No bugs or infestation was present. The doctor\u2019s offices believed Mother may have been hallucinating. On October 14, 2014, Meyerson went to the family home in Great Falls, Montana, and spoke to Mother about the children\u2019s bug infestations. Meyerson observed no evidence of bugs or infestation on Mother or children. Mother refused to submit to a drug test at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">\u00b64 Three days later, when Mother removed the children from public school, Meyerson again went to the home. One child spoke with Meyerson but stated she could not get an adult to wake up. Finally, Mother\u2019s boyfriend came to the door and told Meyerson Mother was not home; eventually Mother came out and spoke with Meyerson. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Meyerson asked Mother why the children were not in school and if she would submit to a drug test or have the children\u2019s hair tested. Mother refused, went back in the house, brought all three children outside to Meyerson and stated \u201cthis is what happens when you talk to [DPHHS], now they are going to take you away ... go ahead, you want to take them, so take them.\u201d Meyerson did not take the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b65 On November 5, 2014, Meyerson went to the family\u2019s home. The children were not attending school or registered for the home schooling program, Mother refused to submit to a requested drug test, and she denied Meyerson access to the children. The children were removed from Mother\u2019s care. On November 12, 2014, the Cascade County Attorney filed a Petition for Emergency Protective Services (EPS), adjudication as youths in need of care, and temporary legal custody. The Department alleged Mother physically neglected the children through her bizarre behavior and suspected methamphetamine use. The District Court granted the State\u2019s petition for emergency protective services and appointed Mother a public defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b66 DPHHS referred Mother to Corin Fisch, LCPC-LAC (Fisch) for a chemical dependency evaluation which took place on November 25, 2014. Fisch diagnosed Mother as amphetamine dependent. Mother admitted to using methamphetamine but did not believe she had an addiction problem or that she needed treatment. Intensive outpatient treatment was recommended given Mother\u2019s lack of \u201ctreatment readiness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u00b67 On January 9, 2015, at a show cause hearing, Mother fired her public defender and hired private counsel. Mother\u2019s new counsel entered a notice of appearance on January 8, 2015, and appeared on her behalf. Mother stipulated to temporary legal custody for six months and that her children were youths in need of care. The District Court approved the treatment plan DPHHS, through Meyerson, had proposed. Although she did not sign the treatment plan, the transcript shows Mother was \u201cwilling\u201d and \u201calready actively\u201d working on the plan. Nevertheless, the District Court allowed Mother\u2019s private counsel ten days to object to the treatment program. Counsel never objected. Temporary legal custody was ordered on January 15, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\u00b68 The treatment plan was designed to \u201cpreserve the parent child relationship,\u201d \u201cassist Mother in acquiring necessary skills to provide for her children\u2019s safety, permanency, and well-being,\u201d as well as \u201cassess the family and instill long term change and lasting stability.\u201d The plan authorized DPHHS to gather information regarding the children\u2019s ability to return home and devise a permanent placement plan if return was not feasible. Specifically, the treatment plan gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Mother six months to stop using illicit drugs and alcohol, maintain sobriety with scheduled and random urinalysis testing, complete mental health and chemical dependency evaluation and counseling, maintain contact with her children, attend parenting classes and submit to home visits, create and maintain a safe and secure home environment including stable employment, and not allow other people to reside in the family\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b69 Mother requested referral to an inpatient treatment center in January 2015. Fisch referred her to Montana Chemical Dependency Center (MCDC). Mother missed her first two intake appointments with Dr. Robert Page (Dr. Page), but did meet with him on January 22, 2015, for psychological, mental health, and parenting evaluations. Mother admitted that she had been using methamphetamines since mid-December. Dr. Page believed Mother\u2019s substance abuse \u201ccreated a pattern of neglect of the children,\u201d and that Mother was aware she needed inpatient treatment but was \u201creluctant to actually enroll.\u201d Dr. Page determined Mother had co-occurring problems of chemical dependency and mental health. However, Mother needed inpatient chemical dependency treatment first.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b610 On January 30, 2015, Mother was arrested in Billings for possession of methamphetamine. She entered MCDC on February 9, 2015, discharging herself only a few days shy of the standard 28-day term, on March 2, 2015. Mother began her outpatient treatment with Fisch through individual and group chemical dependency counseling sessions. Mother also began seeing a mental health counselor, Roberta Powell (Powell).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u00b611 In the meantime, the biological father of two of Mother\u2019s children filed a petition for full custody. At that hearing on March 20, 2015, Mother admitted her addiction had an \u201catrocious\u201d effect on the children, but that she was 39 days sober and would do anything to get her children back. The District Court lauded her sobriety but based on the pending criminal charges and the \u201clong road\u201d ahead of Mother, the two children were placed with their father. This appeal is limited to Mother\u2019s other child, M.V.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\u00b612 Mother appeared on April 3, 2015, for a status hearing represented by her private counsel. Mother was attending most of her chemical dependency outpatient group sessions. Fisch and the counselors were working with Mother trying different groups and approaches. However, Mother\u2019s progress began to decline in May 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"ANu9\">\u00b613 Mother\u2019s lawyer was granted a motion to withdraw from representation on June 15,2015. The District Court ordered Mother to find new counsel within 30 days or represent herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>\u00b614 Mother attended few chemical dependency outpatient group sessions; June 23,2015, was the last session she attended. Mother had missed two weeks of her required urinalysis testing and admitted she was using methamphetamine again. She was dismissed from her chemical dependency outpatient treatment program for allegedly attempting to sell methamphetamine to other patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b615 On July 7, 2015, DPHHS petitioned to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights to M.V.R. based on her failure to complete the court approved treatment plan. At the scheduled termination of parental rights hearing on August 6, Mother attended but was unrepresented. The Court and DPHHS agreed Mother should have counsel, and the hearing was continued for four weeks for her to obtain private counsel. At the August 18 hearing, Mother was still without counsel. DPHHS again requested the hearing be continued while Mother obtained legal counsel. The District Court ordered a new hearing and Mother requested a public defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b616 Julie Bass (Bass) was assigned as Mother\u2019s new social worker on August 6,2015. Bass arranged for Mother to take a urinalysis test and then meet with M.V.R. Bass referred Mother to Stewart McCracken (McCracken), for a chemical dependency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u00b617 Days before the termination of parental rights hearing, on September 21, 2015, DPHHS requested that temporary legal custody be extended based on Mother\u2019s reengagement with services. The Office of Public Defender had appointed Jane Berger (Berger) to represent Mother and she did so at the September 24, 2015 extension of temporary legal custody hearing. DPHHS and the District Court agreed that while Mother\u2019s progress had taken steps backward, she was reengaged in services. Temporary legal custody was extended so that Mother could try to make \u201cdramatic improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\u00b618 Mother participated in chemical dependency outpatient therapy with McCracken but her attendance was sporadic and she was not in compliance with her urinalysis testing. Mother had stopped seeing Powell for mental health counseling and resisted a new mental health counselor. McCracken and Bass encouraged her to attend inpatient treatment; however, Mother was reluctant. Bass helped her find temporary housing for her pets and personally took her for urinalysis testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">\u00b619 Mother again entered MCDC on November 18, 2015. Less than one week later, Mother called Bass. Bass and her supervisor explained to Mother that she needed to stay in treatment and establish sobriety because DPHHS would not seek another temporary legal custody extension. Mother agreed to stay but left after less than one week at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>MCDC. Mother\u2019s treatment progress was insignificant. On December 12, 2015, Mother reengaged visits with M.V.R. and Bass referred Mother to a third chemical dependency treatment program, where she began intensive outpatient treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b620 On December 17, 2015, Mother and her public defender Berger appeared for the scheduled permanency plan hearing. DPHHS renewed its termination of parental rights petition and a hearing was set for January 14, 2016. Mother tested positive for methamphetamine on January 5,2016. Bass testified that Mother\u2019s car had been repossessed and her water and heat had been shut off for non-payment. Mother never found a job and could not verify any income.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b621 On January 14, 2016, the District Court held the final parental rights termination hearing. Mother expressed interest in relinquishing her parental rights but refused a drug test; the State objected, noting that if Mother was under the influence the relinquishment may not be valid. Mother sought to terminate her current public defender during the hearing and asked to stay the hearing until she could hire a new attorney. Mother claimed she had not been in contact with her public defender at any point. The District Court denied the request as a dilatory tactic, observing she had many opportunities to retain and consult with her public defender or an attorney of her choice. The District Court granted DPHHS\u2019s petition, terminating Mother\u2019s right to parent M.V.R. Mother appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">\u00b622 \u201cThis Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>In re T.S., </em>2013 MT 274, \u00b6 21, 372 Mont. 79, 310 P.3d 538.

Section 41-3-423(1), MCA. The statute does not define \u201creasonable efforts.\u201d <em>In re J.H., </em>2016 MT 35, \u00b6 17, 382 Mont. 214, 367 P.3d 339. However, the statute gives examples of reasonable efforts, which include developing a voluntary protective services agreement, individual written case plans specifying state reunification efforts, and periodic review. Section 41-3-423(1), MCA. The court must evaluate each case individually and that analysis is highly fact-dependent. <em>In re J.H., </em>\u00b6 17. DPHHS is not required to make \u201cherculean efforts.\u201d <em>In re J.H., </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">\u00b627 Montana policy is to protect children whose health and welfare are or may be threatened by those responsible for their care; however, this protection must be provided in a manner that preserves family unity, if possible. Section 41-3-101(1)(a), (b), MCA; <em>In re C.J., </em>2010 MT 179, \u00b6 23, 357 Mont. 219, 237 P.3d 1282. When terminating parental rights, the District Court\u2019s chief concern is the best interests of the child. <em>In re T.S., </em>\u00b6 30 (citing <em>In re Custody &amp; Parental Rights of D.A., </em>2008 MT 247, \u00b6 21, 344 Mont. 513, 189 P.3d 631 (quoting <em>In re E.K., </em>2001 MT 279, \u00b6 33, 307 Mont. 328, 37 P.3d 690)). \u201cChildren need not be left to twist in the wind when their parents fail to give priority to their stability and permanency.\u201d <em>In re T.S., </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">\u00b628 Mother argues the District Court failed to address the reasonable efforts made by DPHHS, thus violating her due process rights. Mother argues that DPHHS did not engage in reasonable efforts to reunite the family or to ensure she would complete the treatment plan approved by the District Court. The record clearly shows that DPHHS made reasonable efforts to reunite the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">\u00b629 DPHHS created and Mother did not challenge the treatment plan. The plan was designed to preserve the parent child relationship, assist Mother in acquiring necessary skills to provide for her children\u2019s safety, permanency, and well-being, and inform DPHHS regarding the children\u2019s ability to return home. The plan required Mother to stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>using illicit drugs and alcohol, maintain sobriety, complete mental health and chemical dependency evaluations and counseling, maintain contact with her children, attend parenting classes and submit to home visits, create and maintain a safe and secure home environment including stable employment, and not allow other people to reside in the family\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b630 DPHHS provided Mother with many resources including outpatient narcotic treatment programs, group and individual counseling, parenting support, two case workers, two stints in MCDC, and weekly visits with M.V.R. Further, DPHHS continually accepted Mother back after she relapsed. DPHHS twice moved for an extension of M.V.R.\u2019s temporary legal custody in order to help Mother complete her treatment plan. DPHHS gave Mother fourteen months to get clean and comply with the treatment plan before her parental rights to M.V.R. were terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"AX2V\">\u00b631  Section 41-3-423(1), MCA, is satisfied when the district court record shows reasonable efforts were made to reunite the family. Here, the record clearly shows reasonable efforts were made to reunite the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u00b632 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights based on a failed treatment plan pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f). MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">\u00b633 When a child has been adjudicated as a youth in need of care, the district court may terminate the parent-child relationship if, by clear and convincing evidence, it finds both of the following exist: (i) a court approved appropriate treatment plan has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and (ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit to care for the child is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(1)(f) (i), (ii), MCA; <em>In re D.F., </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">\u00b634 Mother argues the District Court\u2019s determination that the condition which rendered her unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time was not supported by substantial evidence, thus violating the statutory requirements for termination of parental rights and her due process entitlement to fundamentally fair procedures; that the six-month deadline for her treatment plan was unreasonable and given more time and more resources she could have been successful; that the District Court failed to make findings that DPHHS engaged in reasonable efforts; and that DPHHS did not engage in reasonable efforts to ensure she would complete the treatment plan approved by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">\u00b635 DPHHS must prove by clear and convincing evidence each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>statutory criteria for termination of parental rights. Section 41-3-422(5)(a)(iv), MCA; <em>In re K.L., </em>2014 MT 28, \u00b6 14, 373 Mont. 421, 318 P.3d 691. This Court defines clear and convincing evidence in a parental rights case to mean \u201ca preponderance of the evidence must be definite or that a particular issue must be established by a clear preponderance of proof.\u201d <em>In re T.D.H., </em>2015 MT 244, \u00b6 28, 380 Mont. 401, 356 P.3d 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b636 When determining \u201cwhether the conduct or condition of the parent is unlikely to change\u201d the court shall enter a finding that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship will likely result in continued abuse or neglect, or that the conduct or the condition of the parents renders them unfit, unable, or unwilling to give the child adequate parental care. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b637 The court shall consider, but is not limited to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">(a) Emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent of a duration or nature as to render the parent unlikely to care for the ongoing physical, mental, and emotional needs of the child within a reasonable time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">(b) a history of violent behavior by the parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">(c) excessive use of intoxicating liquor or of a narcotic or dangerous drug that affects the parent\u2019s ability to care and provide for the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">(d) present judicially ordered long-term confinement of the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Section 41-3-609(2)(a)-(d), MCA; <em>In re D.F., </em>\u00b6 23. Additionally, \u201cthe court shall give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child,\u201d and the court may \u201cassess the parent\u2019s past and present conduct.\u201d Section 41-3-609(3), MCA; <em>In re T.D.H., </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">\u00b638 Here the District Court adjudicated M.V.R. as a youth in need of care. The District Court approved a reasonable and appropriate treatment plan for Mother. The record shows, and the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law found, Mother failed to comply with or complete the treatment plan. Further, the District Court found the conduct or condition rendering Mother unfit, her abuse of methamphetamine, was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">\u00b639 It is clear from the record that Mother was unable, or unwilling, to abstain from methamphetamines. Neither the record nor her previous behavior supports her assertion that she just needed more time or that alternate treatment was not provided. Shortly after M.V.R. was removed from her care, Mother was arrested for possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>of dangerous drugs. Mother failed to provide consistently clean urine samples until more than one year after M.V.R. was removed. Mother failed to complete two twenty-eight-day inpatient treatment programs at MCDC, one shortly after M.V.R. was removed and one shortly before her parental rights to M.V.R. were terminated. The outpatient chemical dependency treatment program terminated Mother\u2019s participation after she was found attempting to sell methamphetamine to the other patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b640 The District Court found \u201cby clear and convincing evidence, that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship between the Youth and the Birth Mother will result in an ongoing risk of abuse and/or neglect to the Youth.\u201d Further, the District Court found \u201cthe best interests of the Youth\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional condition will be served by termination of the parent-child legal relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A83\">\u00b641  Section 41-3-609(1)\u00ae, MCA, does not require a specific finding by the District Court that DPHHS engaged in reasonable efforts before terminating a parent child relationship.

Due process requires a parent not be placed at an \u201cunfair disadvantage\u201d during State proceedings to terminate the parent\u2019s liberty interest in the care and custody of a child. <em>In re A.S.A, </em>258 Mont. 194, 198, 852 P.2d 127, 129 (1993). \u201cFundamental fairness requires that a parent be represented by counsel at proceedings to terminate parental rights.\u201d <em>In re A.S., </em>\u00b6 12 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">\u00b645 In 2004, when we decided <em>In re A.S., </em>the right to counsel had not attached to all stages of termination proceedings. <em>In re A.S. </em>(2004). \u201cIn 2005, the Montana Legislature granted indigent parents a statutory right to appointed counsel in all abuse and neglect proceedings involving any petition filed pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-422, MCA.\u201d <em>In re J.J.L., </em>2010 MT 4, \u00b6 16, 355 Mont. 23, 223 P.3d 921. Specifically, \u00a7 41-3-425(1), MCA, gives any party involved in a petition under \u00a7 41-3-422, MCA, the right to counsel in all proceedings. Section 41-3-425(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>MCA. The court is required to \u201cimmediately appoint the office of state public defender to assign counsel for any indigent parent\u201d so long as that parent qualifies pursuant to \u00a7 47-1-111(2), MCA. Section 41-3-425(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b646 Mother argues that the District Court violated her due process right to counsel when it failed to immediately appoint a public defender for her when her private counsel withdrew and she was without counsel from June 15 to September 21, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b647 Mother was assigned a public defender in December 2014 and had terminated the public defender in January 2015, hiring her own private counsel. In June 2015, Mother\u2019s private counsel was granted leave by the District Court to withdraw from representing Mother. In accordance with Rule 10(b) of Montana Uniform District Court Rules, Mother was informed she was entitled to appoint other counsel or represent herself. Mother made no indication she desired a public defender at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u00b648 At the hearing to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights on August 6, 2015, Mother was without counsel. The transcript shows the State immediately acknowledged that Mother was without counsel, agreed she should have counsel present, and moved to have a public defender appointed. Mother spoke with the regional deputy public defender outside of the courtroom. He encouraged Mother to immediately come to his office after the hearing so she could obtain counsel. Mother failed to go to the public defender\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\u00b649 At the next hearing, on August 18, 2015, Mother had yet to go to the public defender\u2019s office or obtain private counsel. The hearing was continued for four weeks and a public defender, Berger, was appointed for Mother. At the September 24, 2015 hearing Mother failed to appear. Berger informed the District Court that Mother had never contacted her or the public defender\u2019s office and the phone number on file for Mother was out of date; no contact between Berger and Mother had occurred. The hearing was again continued until December 17, 2015. Berger represented Mother throughout the termination proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">\u00b650 Mother was aware of what was required to obtain a public defender; she had a public defender during these proceeding and in other previous and contemporaneous proceedings. Mother was not denied counsel. Mother voluntarily terminated her public defender and hired private counsel. When private counsel withdrew, the District Court informed Mother of her duty to find new counsel. Mother never requested a new public defender and the District Court reasonably concluded that she would hire new counsel. While it does not take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u201cparticular words\u201d to request counsel, some indication must be given to the court that respondent wishes for appointed counsel based on indigence. <em>J.M. v. R.H. (In re J.W.M.), </em>2015 MT 231, \u00b6 25, 380 Mont. 282, 354 P.3d 626.</p>\n<p id=\"an0-dedup-0\">\u00b651  Due process and \u00a7 41-3-425, MCA, give parents at risk of having their parental rights terminated the right to counsel and the right to appointed counsel if indigent, at all termination proceedings. The District Court properly appointed a public defender for Mother immediately upon initiation of these proceedings. Once she was without any counsel, Mother needed to indicate to the District Court, in any manner, that she needed another public defender. When notified that Mother did not have counsel, the District Court ordered one be appointed and twice continued the proceedings. Mother failed to follow through to engage another public defender. However, at all critical stages of the proceeding Mother was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b652 Under these facts, Mother\u2019s due process right was not infringed when she was without counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">\u00b653 It was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to terminate Mother\u2019s rights to M.V.R. Although Mother failed to cooperate with getting a new attorney appointed, Mother had counsel at all critical stages of these proceedings. Her due process rights were not infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">\u00b654 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b485-10\">JUSTICES McKINNON, COTTER, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
