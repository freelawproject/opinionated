Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees to the </em>Folsoms?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">\u00b62 In 1990, Recreational Leasing Inc., the Folsoms\u2019 predecessor in interest, constructed sewer and water lines and a sewer lift station outside of the City of Livingston, and transferred these utilities to Livingston pursuant to a Reimbursement Agreement (Agreement). The Agreement provided that Livingston would collect proportional reimbursement fees (referred to herein as \u201cpayback fees\u201d) when new development connected to the water and sewer lines, and pay these fees to Recreational Leasing, Inc. The Folsoms succeeded to this contractual interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">\u00b63 Eagle\u2019s Rest acquired property near Livingston in 2006 and began constructing Eagle\u2019s Landing Condominiums. It constructed Buildings A and B, which were condominiums, and Building K, which was a clubhouse. These units were connected to the sewer and water lines covered by the Agreement. Livingston initially calculated a payback fee for the hookups, but the fee was not paid by Eagle\u2019s Rest or collected by Livingston, and the Folsoms were not paid as provided in the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">\u00b64 In 2012, the Folsoms made an initial inquiry about the payback fees for the Eagle\u2019s Landing Condominiums hookups and then filed this lawsuit. Based upon the amount of the payback fees due under the Agreement, Livingston made an offer of judgment to the Folsoms \u201cin the amount of $25,693.70, together with costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be determined by the Court.\u201d The Folsoms rejected the offer, and the case proceeded against both Livingston and Eagle\u2019s Rest, with the Folsoms claiming breach of contract, negligence, unjust enrichment, and <em>quantum meruit </em>. The District Court issued a Scheduling Order setting an expert disclosure deadline of July 11, 2014, and setting a deadline of October 31, 2014, for all \u201cpretrial motions, including motions in limine and motions for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">\u00b65 Meanwhile, Livingston sought and received payment of $25,693.70 in fees from Eagle\u2019s Rest on May 22, 2014. Livingston then delivered a check for that amount to the Folsoms. The Folsoms returned the check uncashed on July 9, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">\u00b66 Counsel for the Folsoms sent a draft of their pretrial order submissions to the counsel for the Defendants in February 2015, listing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>professional appraiser William Bridwell as an expert witness regarding the value of the Eagle\u2019s Landing Condominiums, and Bridwell\u2019s written appraisal as an exhibit. Eagle\u2019s Rest filed a motion to exclude Bridwell\u2019s expert testimony and his appraisal on March 2, 2015, well after the motions deadline in the scheduling order, arguing that Bridwell had not been disclosed as an expert witness and permitting him to testify would be prejudicial. After hearing arguments at the pretrial conference, the District Court issued an order excluding Bridwell and his appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b67 The next day, the Folsoms filed a notice stating they would instead rely on David Folsom\u2019s testimony regarding the value of the Eagle property. Eagle\u2019s Rest filed a second motion, this one to likewise exclude David Folsom\u2019s testimony as undisclosed expert testimony, which was also granted by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b68 These motions were disposed of on the eve of trial, which was conducted from March 23 to 27, 2015. The jury was instructed by the court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">The Court has decided some issues as a matter of law in this case. Specifically, the Court has ruled that the City of Livingston breached the parties\u2019 Reimbursement Agreement by failing to pay Plaintiffs the sum of $25,436.40 for Buildings A and B in Eagle\u2019s Rest at the time they were connected to the water and sewer lines on October 4, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">The Court has further decided that the City of Livingston cured this breach of contract in June of 2014, when it tendered the sum of $25,693.70 to the Plaintiffs. The City will be obligated, by the Court\u2019s Order, to pay this sum to the Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Because the payback fee issue regarding Buildings A and B was decided as a matter of law, the special verdict form asked the jury to consider the issue of a payback fee only for the clubhouse. The form asked: \u201cDid the City of Livingston breach the Agreement with Recreational Leasing, Inc., by failing to calculate and collect a payback fee for the Eagle\u2019s Landing clubhouse?\u201d In answering, the jury selected \u201cno.\u201d In answer to questions about the Folsoms\u2019 negligence claim, the jury first found that Livingston was 60% negligent, while the Folsoms were 40% negligent. In answer to the question, \u201cWhat amount of money will reasonably compensate Plaintiffs for the injuries caused by negligence?\u201d, the jury answered: \u201c$17,742 which is 60% of $25,000 error plus $2[,]742 travel compensation.\u201d Additionally, the jury specifically found that no implied contract existed between the Folsoms and Eagle\u2019s Rest, that Eagle\u2019s Rest did not retain a benefit conferred by the Folsoms by connecting to Livingston\u2019s water and sewer lines, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>and that the Folsoms\u2019 expectation to receive compensation from Eagle\u2019s Rest in the matter was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b69 After trial, and upon a motion from Livingston, the District Court ordered the Folsoms to make an election of remedies\u2014either for breach of contract or for negligence. The Folsoms elected to recover under breach of contract. The District Court then entered judgment, specifying that the Folsoms recovered nothing from Eagle\u2019s Rest, but awarding as to Livingston $25,460.40 in contract damages for Buildings A and B, $2,742 for the Folsoms\u2019 travel expenses, and $2,571 \u201cin damages relative to payback fees for the clubhouse, which sum is reasonably construed as damages for negligence and is not a form of double damages as the clubhouse payback fee was left to the jury\u2019s determination.\u201d The District Court also awarded $140,980 in attorney fees to the Folsoms as the prevailing party, pursuant to the fee provision in the Agreement. The District Court awarded almost all of the attorney fees claimed by counsel for the Folsoms, minus only the billable time spent in pursuing an injunction against the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"A4t\">\u00b610 The Folsoms appeal the District Court\u2019s decisions in granting the motions in limine and in instructing the jury. Livingston cross-appeals the award of negligence damages to the Folsoms, and the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b611 \u201cA motion in limine can seek to prevent or limit the introduction of evidence at trial, and the authority to grant or deny the motion rests in the inherent power of the district court to admit or exclude evidence so as to ensure a fair trial. Where a decision on a motion in limine involves the exercise of discretion, this Court will not overturn the district court absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Meek v. Mont.

Did the District Court err by excluding expert testimony of a professional </em>appraiser?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">\u00b615 The Folsoms argue the District Court abused its discretion by excluding the testimony and report of appraiser Bridwell concerning the value of the Eagle\u2019s Rest property. Eagle\u2019s Rest moved to exclude this testimony because the Folsoms had not disclosed Bridwell as an expert witness. The Folsoms argue the motions deadline had long passed and the District Court \u201cshould have denied [Eagle\u2019s Rest\u2019s] motion immediately for this reason alone.\u201d They also argue that the District Court failed to take into account that Eagle\u2019s Rest had ample notice of their reliance on Bridwell\u2019s testimony and report, noting that they had listed Bridwell as a fact witness and had referenced his report in their pleadings and discovery responses. Eagle\u2019s Rest responds that it became aware of the Folsoms\u2019 intention to rely on Bridwell as an expert only when the Folsoms\u2019 pretrial order submissions were received, and promptly sought to exclude this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\u00b616 A district court has \u201cbroad discretion over the admissibility of evidence and control of pretrial and trial proceedings.\u201d <em>Stevenson v. Felco Indus., </em>2009 MT 299, \u00b6 32, 352 Mont. 303, 216 P.3d 763. Given the last minute identification of Bridwell as an expert, we do not fault either the timing of Eagle\u2019s Rest\u2019s motion or the District Court\u2019s discretionary determination to take up the issue instead of dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>it as untimely. <em>See State v. Wedele, </em>2003 MT 117, \u00b6 66, 315 Mont. 452, 69 P.3d 1162 (it was a matter of the District Court\u2019s discretion to either \u201cmodify the scheduling order and accept the motions\u201d or to \u201cdeny such motions as untimely based upon [a party\u2019s] failure to comply with the scheduling order.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"APMD\">\u00b617  Further, the District Court correctly cited <em>Superior Enters. LLC v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2002 MT 139, 310 Mont. 198, 49 P.3d 565, where, as here, a witness had been disclosed as a lay witness, but ended up providing expert testimony. <em>Superior </em>Enters., \u00b6 14. We reversed, concluding that because the defendant did not identify the witness as an expert in discovery disclosures, it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to allow the expert testimony. <em>Superior Enters., </em>\u00b620. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Bridwell\u2019s expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b618 <em>2. Did the District Court err in granting the motion in limine that prevented David Folsom from testifying as an expert at </em>trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b619 The District Court also granted Eagle\u2019s Rest\u2019s motion to exclude David Folsom\u2019s testimony about the value of the Eagle\u2019s Rest property because he had not previously been disclosed as an expert witness. The Folsoms argue that the District Court erroneously classified David Folsom\u2019s testimony as expert in nature and that this Court has held that a lay person may testify as to the value of real property if she or he is familiar with the property in question, citing <em>State v. Peterson, </em>134 Mont. 52, 328 P.2d 617 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u00b620 Folsom\u2019s proposed testimony about the subject property\u2019s value included average sale prices of Eagle\u2019s Rest condominiums and Eagle\u2019s Rest\u2019s net land development profit, \u201cbased on public information and the land development experience of David Folsom.\u201d The District Court reasoned that the proposed testimony was \u201cbeyond what is presumed to be possessed by men generally[,]\u201d and did not abuse its discretion by ruling that Folsom\u2019s testimony was expert in nature. <em>See Superior Enters., </em>\u00b6 14 (\u201c[The witness\u2019] testimony relates information which is not within common knowledge or experience of lay people and is, therefore, in the nature of expert testimony.\u201d). Despite the fact that Folsom was essentially attempting to provide the same testimony that Bridwell would have offered, he had likewise not been disclosed as an expert witness. The Folsoms argue that David Folsom\u2019s land development experience was revealed in discovery, early in the litigation, but at that point in time, David Folsom was simply a plaintiff and a potential lay witness. As we said in <em>Superior Enters., </em>\u00b6 19, \u201c[flor purposes of trial preparation, there is a big difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>between knowing about a factual witness and understanding that he will be called as an expert witness by your opponent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-b\">\u00b621  As with Bridwell, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding David Folsom\u2019s expert testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b622 <em>3. Did the District Court properly instruct the jury regarding unjust </em>enrichment?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b623 The Folsoms argue that the unjust enrichment instruction erroneously excluded the requirement of necessary restitution in the event the jury found that Eagle\u2019s Rest had been unjustly enriched, and erroneously stated that the plaintiff must show misconduct on the part of the defendant in order to recover for unjust enrichment. However, the jury was instructed about the basic elements of unjust enrichment (\u201cthe retention of a benefit conferred ... in circumstances where compensation is reasonably expected\u201d), and specifically found these basic elements had not occurred. Therefore, the jury never reached further issues involved in a claim of unjust enrichment. Reviewed as a whole, we find no reversible error in these instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b624 The Folsoms argue the instructions regarding implied contracts incorrectly included superfluous instructions regarding express contracts. The District Court instructed the jury that an agreement can be reached between two parties by their conduct if it appears that the parties mutually intended to agree. However, the jury specifically found that no implied contract existed between the Folsoms and Eagle\u2019s Rest, and therefore, any additional instructions regarding the elements of express contracts would have been unnecessary. Reviewed as a whole, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"AS0\">\u00b625  The Folsoms argue that the District Court erroneously instructed the jury that if the plaintiffs did not prove unjust enrichment, then the jury must dismiss the claim for <em>quantum meruit </em>damages. The Folsoms argue that they \u201cmay prove unjust enrichment in the form of ELC\u2019s increased property value, even if they don\u2019t prove <em>quantum meruit.\u201d </em>We have previously held that <em>quantum meruit </em>is the measure of equitable damages in an unjust enrichment action. <em>See Storms v. Bergsieker, </em>254 Mont. 130, 133, 835 P.2d 738, 740-41 (1992). The jury was instructed that \u201c[i]f you determine that Eagle\u2019s Rest, LLC has been unjustly enriched, you must calculate the damages based upon the evidence provided by the plaintiffs. The measure of damages for a claim of unjust enrichment is ... <em>quantum </em>meruit....\u201d However, the jury found that no unjust enrichment had occurred to entitle the Folsoms to any equitable damages. It was not error for the District Court to instruct the jury not to consider the damages that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>follow unjust enrichment if that claim had been not proven. We affirm the instructions given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b626 <em>4. Did the District Court err by awarding negligence damages to the Folsoms in view of their election of breach of contract </em>damages?</p>\n<p id=\"AXn\">\u00b627 The question of Livingston\u2019s failure to collect payback fees for the clubhouse as a breach of contract claim, and damages to compensate the Folsoms for Livingston\u2019s negligence, were separate questions of fact asked of the jury on the verdict form. The issue of breach of contract damages for the payback fees for Buildings A and B was never put to the jury. Instead, the District Court instructed the jury that this issue had already been decided as a matter of law. Accordingly, the verdict form asked the jury to find whether Livingston breached the Agreement by failing to collect a payback fee for the clubhouse. The jury stated \u201cNo.\u201d However, the jury nonetheless found that Livingston was 60% negligent and that the Folsoms were entitled to 60% of the damages associated with failure to pay the payback fees for Buildings A and B ($15,000), and 60% of the claimed travel expenses ($2,742). Livingston moved the District Court to require the Folsoms to elect their remedy either under breach of contract or negligence, and the District Court did so. The Folsoms chose breach of contract. Thus, they received an award of $25,436.40 in contract damages\u2014decided as a matter of law before trial\u2014but also were granted $2,742 for travel expenses the jury had awarded in negligence, and $2,571 for clubhouse payback fees. On cross-appeal, Livingston argues that the District Court erred by awarding the travel expenses as negligence damages because it contradicts the District Court\u2019s own reasoning that the Folsoms must choose one remedy or the other. In addition, Livingston argues that the District Court erred in awarding the payback fee for the clubhouse, as this award of damages had no basis whatsoever in the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b628 In response to the election of remedy motion, the District Court initially observed that \u201cthe jury could not consider any damages for [Livingston\u2019s] failure to pay [the Folsoms] for the connection of [Eagle Rest\u2019s] Buildings A and B\u201d because the jury had been instructed that this breach had been cured by Livingston and that Livingston was already obligated to pay these fees. It thus concluded that a damage award for payback fees on Buildings A and B based upon breach of contract and a negligence damage award based upon the same issue would constitute a double recovery, and required the Folsoms to elect their remedy between breach of contract and negligence. It has been acknowledged that potential liability in tort may coexist with potential liability in contract, and in such a case, \u201can injured party has the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>to elect which form of action he will pursue.\u201d <em>Corp. Air v. Edwards Jet Ctr. Mont. Inc., </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6 49, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111 (citing <em>Thiel v. Taurus Drilling, </em>218 Mont. 201, 710 P.2d 33 (1985)). An exclusive availability of remedy is not always the case, as we have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">A cause of action may sound in tort although it arises out of a breach of contract, if a defaulting party, by breaching the contract, also breaches a duty which he owes to the other party independently of the contract. ... [A] tort arises out of a breach of contract if the party also breaches a duty which he owes to another independently of the contract, and which duty would exist even if no contract existed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><em>Boise Cascade Corp. v. First Sec. Bank, </em>183 Mont. 378, 392, 600 P.2d 173, 181 (1979) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, there were not independent duties, and the District Court was well within its power to direct the Folsoms to elect one form of remedy over another for the fees on Buildings A and B, citing for additional support \u00a7 27-1-303, MCA (\u201cA person may not recover a greater amount in damages for the breach of an obligation than the person could have gained by the full performance of the obligation on both sides unless a greater recovery is specified by statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b629 It is clear that the District Court understood the election of remedies requirement to apply only to the damages associated with the payback fees for Buildings A and B. The jury specifically awarded damages of $2,742 for \u201ctravel compensation\u201d under negligence, which the District Court determined did not duplicate any damages Fossums had obtained by their breach of contract claim. <em>See Renville v. Taylor, </em>2000 MT 217, \u00b6 14, 301 Mont. 99, 7 P.3d 400 (\u201cThe function of this Court is not to agree or disagree with a jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d); <em>Sandman v. Farmers Ins. Exchan., </em>1998 MT 286, \u00b6 41, 291 Mont. 456, 969 P.2d 277 (\u201cMoreover, in our review of jury verdicts in civil cases, we have stated ... that we do not decide whether the verdict was correct or whether the jury made the right decision; that we will not lightly overturn the verdict of a finder of fact, especially a jury ....\u201d) (citation omitted). We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of $2,742 in travel expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u00b630 However, the District Court\u2019s decision to award the $2,571 for payback fees for the clubhouse is without basis in the jury\u2019s verdict. In awarding this amount, the District Court stated, \u201c[the Folsoms] are further entitled to the $2[,]571 in damages relative to payback fees for the clubhouse, which sum is reasonably construed as damages for negligence and is not a form of double damages as the clubhouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>payback fee was left for the jury\u2019s determination.\u201d The jury did make a determination on this issue, specifically finding that Livingston had not breached the contract in regard to the clubhouse fees. Neither did the jury award these damages under negligence. There being no award of this amount by the jury, the District Court contradicted the verdict and erred by granting this amount, and we reverse this award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b631 5. <em>Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees to the </em>Folsoms?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b632 Livingston argues \u201cthe District Court abused its discretion by awarding F olsoms attorney fees incurred in prosecuting all of their tort claims.\u201d Notably, Livingston does not dispute the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Folsoms were the prevailing party and were entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees, but, rather, argues that the amount of the award\u2014$140,980\u2014was not reasonable. We affirm an award of attorney fees to the Folsoms, but reverse the amount of the award as unreasonable, and remand to the District Court for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b633 In general, attorney fees are available only when provided for by statute or by contract. <em>See Blue Ridge Homes, Inc. v. Thein, </em>2008 MT 264, \u00b6 78, 345 Mont. 125, 191 P.3d 374 (\u201cA court may award attorney fees only where a statute or contract provides for their recovery.\u201d) (citation omitted). Fees are not generally available for tort claims. The Agreement provided for attorney fees to the prevailing party for claims arising thereunder. Further, \u201c[although reviewed for abuse of discretion, an award of attorneys\u2019 fees must be reasonable.\u201d <em>Houden v. Todd, </em>2014 MT 113, \u00b6 37, 375 Mont. 1, 324 P.3d 1157 (citation omitted). In determining whether an award is reasonable, we have previously articulated non-exclusive guidelines for the district courts to consider. These guidelines include: \u201c(1) the amount and character of the services rendered; (2) the labor, time and trouble involved; (3) the character and importance of the litigation in which the services were rendered; (4) the amount of money or the value of the property to be affected; (5) the professional skill and experience called for; (6) the attorneys\u2019 character and standing in their profession; and (7) the results secured by the services of the attorneys.\u201d <em>Plath v. Shonrock, </em>2003 MT 21, \u00b6 36, 314 Mont. 101, 64 P.3d 984 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u00b634 Livingston argues that the \u201cresults secured\u201d in this case highlight that the award of almost all of the Folsoms claimed attorney fees was unreasonable. Early in the case, Livingston made a formal offer of judgment for the breach of contract damages, in the amount of $25,693.70, \u201ctogether with costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>determined by the Court.\u201d This offer was rejected, and the case was litigated through trial. In 2014, once Eagle\u2019s Rest had been named a defendant in the Second Amended Complaint, Livingston delivered a check to Alana Folsom in the amount of $25,693.70. The check was returned to the city, uncashed. The Folsoms ultimately claimed over $1,000,000 in damages stemming from the breach of the Agreement, but, after trial, received a small damage award in the range of the pretrial offers.</p>\n<p id=\"A7kG\">\u00b635  As the District Court noted, the Folsoms\u2019 actual recovery was \u201cminimal in light of their demand.\u201d After several years of litigation, the Folsoms essentially received what Livingston had offered them all along, making the \u201cresults secured\u201d factor a significant one in the determination of reasonable attorney fees here. We conclude it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to award essentially all of the attorney fees incurred by the Folsoms, including those associated with their tort claims, and we, therefore, reverse the award. We remand for consideration of an award that would more appropriately reflect what the litigation accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b636 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b57-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b57-8\">JUSTICE SHEA,</author>\n<p id=\"AkL\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">\u00b637 I concur fully with the Court\u2019s opinion. I write separately to address the Folsoms\u2019 counsel\u2019s baseless, and completely inappropriate, ad hominem attack on the District Court Judge who presided over this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">\u00b638 The Folsoms\u2019 counsel devotes an entire section of his opening brief before this Court to allegations that the District Court Judge essentially engaged in public malfeasance because she \u201cwas simply not going to allow the Plaintiffs the potential of a large jury verdict, and the ensuing publicity for the Court.\u201d I will not go into the substance\u2014or, more appropriately, lack thereof\u2014of these allegations because, aside from the fact that the record divulges no basis for them, their lack of merit and relevancy is best illustrated by the Folsoms\u2019 counsel\u2019s own admission that \u201cthese actions of the Court are not part of this appeal.\u201d This then begs the question: So why make these allegations if not to gratuitously malign a member of the judiciary?</p>\n<p id=\"AaqH\">\u00b639 The Folsoms\u2019 counsel\u2019s criticism of the District Court Judge is further belied by the fact that this Court has unanimously affirmed the District Court\u2019s rulings on all of the Folsoms\u2019 assignments of error. Ironically the only error we have found in this case is the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Court\u2019s award to the Folsoms of some damages to which they were not entitled, Opinion, \u00b6 30, and the District Court\u2019s award of essentially all of the Folsoms\u2019 attorney fees, which we have concluded is incommensurate with what the Folsoms\u2019 counsel actually accomplished with this litigation, Opinion, \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b640 Eagle\u2019s Rest points out in its brief that the Folsoms\u2019 counsel\u2019s attack on the District Court Judge appears to violate M. R. Prof. Conduct 8.2(a), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">A lawyer shall not make a statement that the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity concerning the qualifications or integrity of a judge, adjudicatory officer or public legal officer ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Eagle\u2019s Rest\u2019s point may be well taken. If there is a legitimate basis for the Folsoms\u2019 counsel\u2019s allegations of malfeasance towards the District Court Judge in this case, I cannot find it in the record before this Court. That being noted, due process requires that we refrain from making that judgment at this juncture. This is more appropriate for consideration by the Commission on Practice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
