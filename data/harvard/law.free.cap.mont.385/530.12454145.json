The order committed R.H. to the Montana State Hospital for a period not to exceed three months and ordered the use of involuntary medication, if needed. We affirm the order for commitment and reverse the administration of involuntary medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u00b62 R.H. presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">\n<em>1. Whether there was sufficient evidence to support the commitment of R.H.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in authorizing involuntary medication.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">\u00b63 R.H., age 72, suffers from bipolar disorder and general anxiety disorder. She takes medication for her mental illnesses. R.H. also has physical infirmities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and gout. She is being treated with oxygen, insulin, and other medications. In September of 2015, R.H. was evicted from her senior-living apartment at Pleas antview after having multiple altercations with her neighbors. Following her eviction, R.H.\u2019s adult son paid for one week\u2019s lodging at a motel. However, as of October 6, 2015, R.H. had nowhere to go and her son was unsuccessful in securing other living arrangements. R.H. lives on a limited fixed income controlled by a conservator, Joyce Wuertz (Wuertz).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">\u00b64 On October 6, 2015, R.H.\u2019s son and Wuertz contacted R.H.\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Amstutz, because they were concerned about where R.H. was going to live and that R.H. was exhibiting mood swings and other symptoms of her bipolar disorder. Further, R.H. had made a suicidal comment and did not appear to understand that her finances prevented her from continuing to stay in a hotel. Dr. Amstutz requested that R.H. be picked up by law enforcement and transported to the Billings Clinic Psychiatric Center for evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">\u00b65 Upon admission to the Billings Clinic, R.H. was evaluated by Dr. Schuett. Dr. Schuett determined R.H. suffered from a mental disorder and needed treatment. Thereafter, the Yellowstone County Attorney\u2019s Office filed a petition on October 8, 2015, to involuntarily commit R.H. At the initial hearing held October 9, 2015, the court found probable cause to believe R.H. was suffering from a mental disorder which might need commitment, and set trial on the State\u2019s petition for October 14, 2015. The court appointed R.H. counsel and subsequently appointed, on October 13, 2015, Bonnie Karinen (Karinen) to evaluate R.H. Karinen is a nurse practitioner with an emphasis in psychiatry.</p>\n<p id=\"ABxb\">\u00b66 On October 13, 2015, Karinen filed a report with the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>describing R.H.\u2019s moods as labile; that R.H. exhibited grandiose thoughts and irrational decision-making; and that R.H. easily became irritable or cried. Karinen concluded R.H. suffered from a mental disorder requiring commitment because R.H. was unable to care for herself. During the hearing on October 14, 2015, Karinen testified consistent with her report and added that she believed the court should order involuntary medication for R.H. Karinen explained, \u201c[i]n most cases for the safety of the patient and possibly others, you know, we usually do recommend [involuntary medication], and I would in this case, too.\u201d Karinen testified, however, that R.H. had no history of refusing her medication and that, at the time, R.H. was compliant and had been taking her medication as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b67 The evidence produced at trial established that R.H. either applied for or otherwise considered multiple types of housing, including Section 8 or HUD housing, hotels, nursing homes, assisted living, a crisis center, and a friend\u2019s home. In each instance, R.H. was unsuccessful in securing housing, either because her request was denied or not responded to, or because R.H., herself, was uncooperative. Karinen testified that, \u201conce a patient is a patient in the psychiatric center when we sen[d] the records, especially if there is any behavioral issues, it's highly unlikely that any [nursing home] will take her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u00b68 Following the hearing, the District Court issued its Finding of Facts, Conclusion of Law and Order. The District Court found that R.H. suffered from a mental disorder; was unable to care for herself; the Montana State Hospital was the least restrictive treatment option available to R.H.; and that administration of medication \u201cmay be necessary to facilitate treatment\u201d for R.H. The court reasoned that, \u201cbecause of her mental disorder, she could abruptly decide not to take her medications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">\u00b69 We review a civil commitment order by a district court to determine whether its conclusions of law are correct and whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Mental Health of L.K.-S., </em>2011 MT 21, \u00b6 14, 359 Mont. 191, 247 P.3d 1100. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous if\u2018it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if, after a review of the entire record, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re C.R., </em>2012 MT 258, \u00b6 12, 367 Mont. 1, 289 P.3d 125 <em>(quoting L.K.-S., </em>\u00b6 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">\u00b610 \u201cWhether a district court\u2019s findings of fact satisfy statutory requirements is a question of law.\u201d <em>In re S.M., </em>2014 MT 309, \u00b6 13, 377 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Mont. 133, 339 P.3d 23. \u201cWe have long emphasized the necessity of \u2018strict adherence\u2019 to the statutory scheme governing involuntary commitment, given the utmost importance of the rights at stake in such proceedings, and the \u2018calamitous effect of a commitment, including loss of liberty and damage to a person\u2019s reputation.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re B.D., </em>2015 MT 339, \u00b6 7, 381 Mont. 505, 362 P.3d 636 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b611 <em>1. Whether there was sufficient evidence to support the commitment of R.H.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b612 The District Court concluded, relying on \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(a), MCA, that R.H. could not meet her \u201cbasic needs.\u201d Basic needs are \u201cfood, clothing, shelter, health, or safety.\u201d Section 53-21-126(1)(a), MCA. When committing a person pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(a), MCA, the court must find that the person suffers from a mental disorder and that <em>\u201cbecause of a mental disorder, </em>is substantially unable to provide for the [person\u2019s] own basic needs[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u00b613 It is undisputed that R.H. has a mental disorder and is currently unable to meet her own basic needs; specifically, R.H. is unable to find housing. R.H. argues, however, that her inability to find housing is not <em>because </em>of her mental disorder. R.H. maintains that she is simply a person with a mental disorder who is having a housing crisis; not that she is homeless <em>because </em>she has a mental disorder. R.H. believes that her inability to find housing is due to her lack of family support and financial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">\u00b614 We will only disrupt a district court\u2019s finding of fact and conclusions of law if we determine factual findings are clearly erroneous or legal conclusions are incorrect. <em>L.K.-S., </em>\u00b6 14. The District Court found that R.H. was unable to meet her basic needs. Testimony established that R.H. suffers from bipolar disorder which is characterized by fluctuating mood swings frequently exhibited by symptoms of mania and depression. Bipolar disorder is incurable, but treatable with medication, therapy, and the assistance of social supports. R.H. exhibited symptoms typical of a bipolar disorder by being irritable, frequently emotionally disturbed, and having irrational thoughts, paranoia, poor insight, and poor decision-making ability. The State produced evidence that R.H. was unaware of her financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>limitations regarding housing options; that R.H.\u2019s disorganized thoughts prevented R.H. from caringfor herself; and that R.H.\u2019s beliefs that she would soon find housing were fanciful, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"ao_-dedup-0\">\u00b615  After careful review of the record, we conclude the District Court correctly determined that R.H. was unable to provide for her basic need of shelter <em>because </em>of her mental disorder and that the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(a), MCA, were therefore satisfied. R.H. was evicted because of problems she was having with her neighbors which were a result of her mental disorder. There was substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s conclusion that R.H.\u2019s bipolar disorder and history of conflict with neighbors prevented R.H. from obtaining and securing housing. We reject R.H.\u2019s argument that the District Court committedher simply because she was homeless; rather, the District Court correctly concluded that R.H\u2019s inability to find shelter was because of her mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b616 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in authorizing involuntary medication.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">\u00b617 The District Court held in its Finding of Facts and Conclusion of Law that involuntary medication \u201cmay be necessary to facilitate treatment.\u201d R.H. argues that the evidence does not support a finding of actual necessity to authorize involuntary medication. The State maintains that whether involuntary administration of medication \u201cis necessary\u201d must be considered within the context of the statute as a whole. Specifically, the State argues that \u00a7 53-21-127(6), MCA, sets forth three distinct levels of authority which must be met before medication is involuntary administered: (1) the district court\u2019s authorization, (2) approval by the chief medical officer or designated physician, and (3) review by the involuntary medication review committee. Accordingly, the State maintains R.H.\u2019s construction of the statute is too narrow and, as a practical matter, district courts do not ultimately make the decision as to whether involuntary medication should be administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">\u00b618 We have held that due to the constitutional rights at stake during an involuntary commitment, we require \u201c\u2019strict adherence\u2019 to the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>In re C.R., </em>2012 MT 258, \u00b6 13, 367 Mont. 1, 289 P.3d <em>125; In re R.W.K., </em>2013 MT 54, \u00b6 18, 369 Mont. 193, 297 P.3d 318. Pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-127(6), MCA, \u201c[t]he court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication <em>is necessary </em>to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) If a commitment order includes involuntary medication, the court \u201cshall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>make [a] ... finding of fact [establishing] ... the reason involuntary medication was chosen from among other alternatives.\u201d Section 53-21-127(8)(h), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b619 Here, the District Court did not find that involuntary medication \u201cis necessary;\u201d rather, the District Court found that involuntary medication \u201cmay be necessary to facilitate treatment.\u201d The District Court concluded that although \u201c[s]he has taken her medications while detained at the Clinic, but because of her mental disorder, she could abruptly decide not to take her medications.\u201d Indeed, while we determine the District Court\u2019s conclusion incorrectly applied the law, it was consistent with the evidence that involuntary medication, while not currently necessary, may become necessary in the future. Karinen explained</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">Q What is your opinion on the involuntary administration of medication facility treatment? Do you believe the Court should order that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">A Yes. In most cases for the safety of the patient and possibly others, you know, we usually do recommend that, and I would in this case, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">Q But [R.H.] hasn\u2019t been declining to take her medication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">A No, she has been very compliant with her treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">Q So [R.H.] suffers from a mental disorder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">Q She suffers from a bipolar disorder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-14\">Q Because of her bipolar disorder she is unable to care for herself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFmA\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-15\">Q Because of her bipolar disorder she may be a threat to herself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABsL\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-16\">Q And you believe the least-restrictive treatment option available to her is the Montana State Hospital at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-17\">A Unfortunately, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-18\">Q And you\u2019d recommend the involuntary administration of medication to facilitate treatment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-19\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-20\">\u00b620 Despite support in the record that involuntary medication \u201cmay be necessary\u201d in the future and the District Court\u2019s conclusion to the same effect, such a finding and conclusion does not satisfy the statute\u2019s clear requirement that before involuntary medication is ordered by a court, the court must find that medication \u201cis necessary.\u201d Nor does the tiered level of review provided in subsection (8) of \u00a7 53-21-127, MCA, dilute the statutory requirement and obligation of the court to find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>involuntary medication \u201cis necessary.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201c[T]he office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. Where there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Section 1-4-101, MCA. Accordingly, we will not alter the clear words of the statute by declaring that \u201cis necessary\u201d means \u201cmay be necessary,\u201d as to do so would violate maxims of jurisprudence and the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"ays-dedup-0\">\u00b621  Based upon the record before us, R.H. had never refused to take her medication and, in fact, had been compliant in taking her medication while at the Billings Clinic and detained awaiting her trial. A finding or general understanding that an individual with bipolar disorder may at some undisclosed future point in time decide not to take her medications is insufficient to satisfy the plain language of the statute requiring that involuntary medication \u201cis necessary.\u201d Had a standard other than \u201cis necessary\u201d been the goal and intent of the legislature when it addressed forced medication of mentally ill individuals, the legislature could have provided as much. Instead, it chose to use \u201cis necessary\u201d rather than \u201cmay be necessary,\u201d clearly implying a heightened standard of consideration before involuntary medication may be utilized. This is consistent with other statutory sections contained within Title 53, chapter 21, MCA, pertaining to the mentally ill. The legislature sought to enhance protection against forced medication of the mentally ill by enacting \u00a7 53-21-145, MCA, specifically declaring that \u201c[platients have the right to be free from unnecessary or excessive medication.\u201d Accordingly, we have little difficulty strictly enforcing the statutory requirement that there must be evidence supporting a finding and conclusion that involuntary medication \u201cis necessary.\u201d A finding and conclusion that in the future a person may become noncompliant is insufficient to meet this statutory requirement. We find no basis on the record before us to conclude that R.H. would not take her medication and that it was necessary for the court to issue an order forcing her to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\u00b622 Finally, we observe that should necessity for involuntary medication arise subsequent to entry of the commitment order, there are no statutory provisions which would prevent issuance of an order authorizing involuntary medication under such circumstances, provided due process demands have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u00b623 We conclude there was sufficient evidence to support R.H.\u2019s involuntary commitment and affirm the commitment order. We reverse the portion of the order authorizing involuntary medication because there was insufficient evidence to support the requirement that an involuntary medication order was necessary and the District Court erred in concluding the statute did not require involuntary medication was necessary.</p>\n<judges id=\"b563-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-10\"> This appeal is not moot.
