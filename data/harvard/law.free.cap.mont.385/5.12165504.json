Lee Foss, through Foss Realty, represented seller Len Wallace. Foss\u2019s commission on the sale was $112,000 which Melton contractually agreed to pay. Subsequently, Foss sued Melton for the unpaid balance of the commission. Melton countered that Foss had failed to comply with the \u201cexhaustion of remedies\u201d clause in the contract. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The Twenty-First Judicial District Court granted Foss\u2019s motion and denied Melton\u2019s. The court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Foss. Melton appeals. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issues on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in granting Foss\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u00b64 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Foss?</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">\u00b65 In February 2007, Melton entered into contracts purchasing the former Big Velvet Elk Ranch consisting of four parcels of property in Darby, Montana, and owned by Len Wallace. Two of the parcels were purchased for $140,000 on a Contract for Deed, and the other two parcels were purchased for approximately $1.5 million on an Agreement to Sell and Purchase. The Contract for Deed required Melton to pay Foss $112,000 in commission. In accordance with the Contract, Melton paid Foss $5,000 at closing and agreed to pay the remaining $107,000 at a future date when Melton sold purchased parcels. Consequently, Foss held a commission lien on some of the parcels purchased by Melton.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">\u00b66 In August 2009, Melton sold the property to Blue Vault, a Wyoming limited liability corporation, owned and operated by Richard S. Brown, III. Blue Vault\u2019s California lending bank, EH National, required that Foss release his commission lien before the sale between Melton and Blue Vault could close. Foss agreed to release his lien in exchange for three separate promissory agreements. The first agreement obligated Blue Vault to pay Foss\u2019s $107,000 commission. Blue Vault paid $16,050 at closing and agreed to pay Foss approximately $380 per month until the commission debt was paid in full. The second agreement required Brown to pay Blue Vault\u2019s debt in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the event Blue Vault defaulted. The third agreement \u2014 and the subject of this lawsuit \u2014 obligated Melton to pay Foss any remaining commission not paid by Blue Vault or Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b67 The third agreement, entitled the Limited Contingent Guarantee (Guarantee), provided in relevant part that Melton would guarantee the performance of \u201ceach and every obligation\u201d imposed on Blue Vault and Brown. It expressly stated that Foss could execute against Melton \u201conly in the event of default [by Blue Vault and Brown] and only to the extent that [Foss is] unable to recover all sums due and owing.\u201d It further required that Foss must \u201cexhaust all other remedies available to [him] under the law... before executing upon the personal guarantee of Melton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b68 In late 2010, Blue Vault defaulted under its contract with Foss. In accordance with the contract, Foss notified Blue Vault and Brown of the default and filed suit in November 2010 in the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, seeking payment of the $90,950 balance of the promissory note, plus accrued interest. In March 2011, while the lawsuit was pending, Brown died. In June 2011, Foss obtained a Montana judgment against Blue Vault in the amount of $90,950, plus accrued interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b69 In August 2011, Melton alerted Foss to the existence of a Blue Vault bank account at EH National, which purportedly contained sufficient funds to pay Blue Vault\u2019s judgment to Foss. Melton indicated that a $26,000 automatic monthly withdrawal was being drafted from the account. In October, Melton followed up, encouraging Foss to move quickly against the bank account to guarantee enforcement of the judgment. He also offered to pursue enforcement of Foss\u2019s judgment in exchange for a waiver of Foss\u2019s right to pursue recovery against Melton in the event Melton was unsuccessful in collecting the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u00b610 In late November 2011, Foss began looking for a California attorney to represent him in filing his Montana judgment in California and retained counsel in January 2012. In February 2012, Foss obtained a California sister-state judgment against Blue Vault in the amount of $101,727.83. Also in February, Melton and Blue Vault entered into a Stipulated Judgment in favor of Melton in the amount of $792,439.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 30, 2012, Foss levied on a Blue Vault account at EH National and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>collected $46,300.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u00b611 In August 2012, EH National filed a foreclosure action on the Darby ranch property. Foss and Melton\u2019s company, TJS, were named co-defendants based upon their inferior judgments against Blue Vault.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Foss failed to appear and the bank secured a default judgment against him. Subsequently, Melton abandoned efforts to collect on his inferior judgment in the foreclosure proceeding and received nothing toward his judgment. EH National prevailed in its foreclosure action against Blue Vault, obtaining a judgment in excess of $4 million. The ranch property was ordered sold at a sheriffs sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b612 In September 2013, Foss filed the complaint in this matter seeking a judgment of $55,120 plus interest from Melton pursuant to the Guarantee. Melton moved for summary judgment in February 2015 arguing that Foss had not exhausted his available remedies against Blue Vault and Brown and therefore could not prevail in the action against Melton. Melton claimed the following deficiencies on Foss\u2019s part: (1) after securing judgment against Blue Vault in Montana, Foss delayed pursuing Blue Vault in California until Blue Vault\u2019s bank account contained insufficient funds to pay Foss\u2019s judgment; (2) Foss failed to force multiple probate actions of Brown\u2019s estate in three states in an effort to obtain a judgment against the estate which purportedly included two California homes; (3) Foss failed to appear in EH National\u2019s foreclosure action thereby failing to assert his prior interest and doing nothing to protect his interest in his judgment; and (4) following Brown\u2019s March 2011 death, Foss failed to amend his lawsuit against Brown and Blue Vault to include Foss\u2019s granddaughter, Erika Brown, who had been granted power of attorney over Blue Vault\u2019s finances.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b613 Foss filed a cross-motion for summary judgment in March 2015 arguing that he had exhausted all remedies against Blue Vault and Brown that were \u201cpractical for him to pursue.\u201d He asserted that he had timely filed suit against Blue Vault and Brown and obtained a Montana judgment against Blue Vault but that Brown died before he could obtain a judgment against him. Foss claimed that while it took time to find and retain a California attorney, upon doing so, the attorney filed Foss\u2019s Montana judgment in California and executed against one of Blue Vault\u2019s bank accounts with EH National, obtaining a recovery of more than $46,000. Foss noted that at the time Melton told him about a Blue Vault California bank account, Foss had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>knowledge of the balance in the account. Moreover, Foss reported that the money recovered from Blue Vault in California was recovered from a separate bank account, and not the account Melton identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b614 Foss further argued that he did not pursue a probate action against Brown\u2019s estate because he had conducted an asset search and was unable to locate other assets owned by Brown. Subsequently, he discovered that Brown\u2019s estate was insolvent. Addressing Melton\u2019s claim that he should have appeared in the Bank\u2019s foreclosure of the ranch property, Foss claimed that he did not appear because his judgment was junior to EH National\u2019s $4 million mortgage and such an effort would have been futile as the property was valued at considerably less than $4 million. Lastly, Foss contends that he did not amend his complaint upon Brown\u2019s death to include Erika Brown because he believed he had no meritorious basis on which to name her.</p>\n<p id=\"ALu\">\u00b615 On October 13, 2015, the District Court issued its Opinion and Order, granting Foss\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying Melton\u2019s, finding Melton\u2019s assertions that Foss failed to exhaust all other remedies available to him were unpersuasive. Relying on Foss\u2019s arguments and explanations, the District Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">(1) the time it took for Foss to retain California counsel and pursue execution of his Montana judgment was reasonable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">(2) Brown\u2019s estate was insolvent and without assets, and consequently any attempt by Foss to pursue probate would have been unproductive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">(3) EH National Bank\u2019s $4 million first priority over all other interests in the ranch property and Melton\u2019s recognition of the futility of fighting for his inferior judgment in the foreclosure proceeding rendered Foss\u2019s decision to not appear in the proceeding for the sole purpose of advancing a meritless argument reasonable; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">(4) any power of attorney over Brown or Blue Vault held by Erika Brown would have terminated upon Brown\u2019s death rendering enforcement action against Erika Brown futile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">\u00b616 Based upon these holdings, the District Court granted Foss\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Additionally, and relying upon the contract language dictating an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the \u201cprevailing party,\u201d the court awarded Foss approximately $5,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">\u00b617 Melton filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment de novo. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Mont. Immigrant Justice Alliance v. Bullock, </em>2016 MT 104, \u00b6 14, 383 Mont. 318, 371 P.3d 430 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b619 We review a district court\u2019s conclusion regarding the existence of legal authority to award attorney fees for correctness. If legal authority exists, we review a district court\u2019s order granting or denying attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Mont. Immigrant Justice Alliance, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b620 <em>Did the District Court err in granting Foss\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u00b621 Melton argues that the District Court misinterpreted the law regarding contract interpretation and conditional guarantees. He asserts that the District Court concluded that the Limited Contingent Guarantee was satisfied by the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d Foss took to collect from Blue Vault and Brown. Melton counters that the language of the Guarantee was \u201cclear, stern, and very limiting,\u201d and did \u201cnot suggest that Foss merely make \u2018reasonable efforts,\u2019 \u201d but rather must \u201cexhaust all remedies\u201d before attempting to collect from him. Melton maintains that the District Court\u2019s failure to interpret the \u201cagreement as written\u201d was in error and resulted in the court\u2019s erroneous award of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">\u00b622 While the Guarantee does not specify what actions Foss must take to exhaust his remedies, Melton claims that Foss should have pursued claims against Brown\u2019s estate in Montana, California, and New York. Additionally, Melton asserts that Foss was obligated to appear in the California law suit between EH National Bank and Blue Vault rather than taking a default. Lastly, Melton argues that Foss\u2019s failure to amend his complaint to add Erika Brown constituted another failure to exhaust all available remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">\u00b623 Foss relies on <em>Western Indus. v. Chicago Mining Corp., </em>279 Mont. 105, 926 P.2d 737 (1996), as support that his diligent efforts to collect from Blue Vault and Brown satisfied the condition precedent in the Guarantee. In <em>Western, </em>Chicago Mining Corporation (CMC) entered into a contract with Western Industries under which Western supplied labor and materials to construct a tailings pond for CMC. When CMC failed to pay Western, Western filed a construction lien in the amount of $232,730. Byron H. Weis, Robert L. Greiner, and Robert Thomlinson (collectively Guarantors) executed personal guaranties obligating themselves to pay CMC\u2019s debt providing Western \u201cfirst proceeded] against [CMC].\u201d <em>Western, </em>279 Mont. at 108, 926 P.2d at 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">\u00b624 Western filed an action against CMC and the Guarantors, followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>by Western and CMC stipulating to entry of judgment in the amount of $196,849.72. However, before Western could collect on the judgment, CMC filed bankruptcy. Western then moved for summary judgment against the Guarantors, which the court granted. The district court entered judgment for Western in the amount of $232,730 plus prejudgment interest for a specified period of time. Western, 279 Mont. at 108, 926 P.2d at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b625 Guarantors challenged the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, claiming that while the facts were undisputed, Western was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law because CMC did not \u201cdefault\u201d; rather, it filed for bankruptcy. <em>Western, </em>279 Mont. at 109, 926 P.2d at 739. We concluded that although the guaranties between Western and CMC did not specify what steps Western was required to take to satisfy the condition precedent, the guaranties did <em>not </em>require Western to proceed against CMC\u2019s collateral, nor did they require a \u201cdefault\u201d by CMC. Relying on the \u201cwell-established principles of guaranty law\u201d set forth in 38 Am. Jur. 2d Guaranty \u00a7 108 (1968), we held that the guaranties required Western to first diligently pursue a recovery against CMC, which it did. <em>Western, </em>279 Mont. at 110, 926 P.2d at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqd\">\u00b626 As cited by the Court in <em>Western, </em>38 Am. Jur. 2d Guaranty \u00a7 108 (1968) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">The extent to which the creditor must pursue the debtor depends primarily upon the terms of the contract of guaranty. If the contract specifically details the action which the creditor may or must take, then the contract is controlling. When a conditional contract is not specific in its details, the liability of the guarantor [is] conditioned upon the exercise of diligence by the creditor to promote payment by the debtor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-6\"><em>Western, </em>279 Mont. at 110, 926 P.2d at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b627 While the above-referenced \u00a7 108 no longer exists, 38 Am. Jur. 2d Guaranty \u00a7 89 incorporates its rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">Since liability under a guaranty of collection is conditioned on the creditor attempting to collect from the debtor without success, the creditor usually must proceed against the debtor before resorting to a remedy against the guarantor. When a guaranty is conditioned on collection efforts against the debtor but not specific in its details, the creditor must exercise due diligence, including in perusing [sic] legal proceedings and collecting a judgment against the debtor. However, it has also been held that the creditor is not required to select every available remedy under the law but only to use reasonable efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\">The guarantor is discharged if the creditor fails to take the action required under a guaranty of collection. However, mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>delay by the creditor in enforcing the debtor\u2019s obligation, without injury to the guarantor, will ordinarily not release the guarantor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">The creditor\u2019s failure to pursue the debtor, when required by a guaranty of collection, does not preclude recovery against the guarantor if proceeding against the debtor would have been unavailing because of the debtor\u2019s insolvency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">38 Am. Jur. 2d Guaranty \u00a7 89 (2nd 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b628 In the case at bar, the District Court took judicial notice of the records and rulings in DV-10-638, DV-11-636, and DV-12-390. Notably, all of these cases proceeded to resolution before this same District Court. Additionally, while not expressly taking judicial notice, the court referenced the Estate of Brown probate proceeding in the Superior Court of Orange County, Probate No. 30-2012-00573979, noting that EH National Bank conducted considerable research and was unable to find any assets of record held by Blue Vault.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b629 The construction and interpretation of a contract is a question of law to be determined by a court. <em>Performance Mach. Co. v. Yellowstone Mt. Club, LLC, </em>2007 MT 250, \u00b6 39, 339 Mont. 259, 169 P.3d 394. Additionally, \u00a7 28-3-201, MCA, provides: \u201c[a] contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful, operative, definite, reasonable, and capable of being carried into effect if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.\u201d As noted above, the language of the Guarantee does not specifically set forth what actions Foss must undertake to \u201cexhaust\u201d his remedies. However, as \u00a7 28-3-201, MCA, requires a \u201creasonable\u201d interpretation, and because <em>Western </em>and \u00a7\u00a7 89 and 108 of 38 Am. Jur. 2d Guaranty support Foss\u2019s action against Melton, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as it pertains to Foss\u2019s failure to participate in the foreclosure proceeding or pursue futile probate proceedings. The records of this case and the other related cases establish that Blue Vault and Brown had no assets against which Foss could collect. It has long been established that the law does not require a useless thing. <em>Stanford v. Coram, </em>26 Mont. 285, 298, 67 P. 1005, 1010 (1902).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\u00b630 We further conclude that Foss\u2019s decision to forego amendment of his complaint to add Erika Brown as a party was a reasonable decision and does not constitute a failure to exhaust available remedies. In the spring of 2013, Foss learned that the FBI and the IRS, among others, were investigating Erika Brown and Blue Vault for bank fraud arising out of the falsification of information in order to obtain a $4 million bank loan from EH National. Erika Brown was subsequently indicted by the United States regarding the EH National Bank loan on the Darby ranch property. She is serving 56 months in prison and has been ordered to pay approximately $3.7 million in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"AU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u00b631 We next review the District Court\u2019s findings as they pertain to Foss\u2019s actions regarding pursuit of recovery from Blue Vault\u2019s California bank accounts. As indicated above, Melton notified Foss of the existence of a Blue Vault bank account at EH National Bank and asserted that the account had sufficient cash to pay Foss\u2019s judgment. Subsequently, Foss retained an attorney and several months later successfully collected $46,300 from a separate Blue Vault account with EH National Bank. While the District Court determined that Foss had not unreasonably delayed execution of his judgment in California, we conclude it was inappropriate for the court to decide this on summary judgment. While the Court\u2019s analysis of the reasonability of Foss\u2019s actions pertaining to probate and foreclosure proceedings was based upon the <em>legal </em>futility of those actions, the reasonableness of Foss\u2019s actions vis-a-vis executing on Blue Vault\u2019s bank account or accounts is a purely factual question that should be decided by the fact finder, and not on summary judgment. We therefore reverse the court on this issue and remand the matter to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\u00b632 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Foss?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b633 The Promissory Note between Blue Vault and Foss contained an attorney\u2019s fees provision. Relying on this contract clause, the District Court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Foss, as the \u201cprevailing party,\u201d in the amount of approximately $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b634 The \u201cprevailing party is the one who has an affirmative judgment rendered in his favor <em>at the conclusion of the entire case.\u201d Total Indus. Plant Servs. v. Turner Indus. Group, LLC, </em>2013 MT 5, \u00b6 43, 368 Mont. 189, 294 P.3d 363 (emphasis in original). Based upon our decision to remand this matter for further proceedings, Foss is not yet the prevailing party on all issues. We therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s order on attorney\u2019s fees. The District Court may reconsider the contractual award of attorney\u2019s fees based upon the outcome of the proceeding on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b635 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"AA\">JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-11\"> Unless otherwise specified, we refer to Melton and TJS collectively as Melton.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b33-8\"><em> Foss v.
