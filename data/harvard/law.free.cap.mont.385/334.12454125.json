They stole firearms, ammunition, gun cases, archery equipment, and other miscellaneous items. Ralph Tracy (Tracy), one of the victims, reported that 16 firearms were stolen. Brian Rogers (Rogers), a second victim, reported 12 firearms were stolen. During the investigation, firearms belonging to Tracy and Rogers were recovered from various pawn shops and from Patterson\u2019s sister, who did not know they were stolen. Patterson and King were each charged with two counts of burglary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7x\">\u00b64 Plea agreements were discussed, but were not agreed upon. On May 5,2015, King and Patterson each entered open guilty pleas on two counts of burglary. A hearing on restitution was conducted, at which the District Court was advised that the parties had agreed to restitution in the amount of $23,762. A minute entry in the District Court case register regarding the amount of restitution noted the defendants would be jointly and severally liable, but did not include an allocation to particular costs. Following the hearing, the District Court ordered the preparation of a Presentence Investigation Report (PSI), which was filed on September 1, 2015. The PSI proposed a higher restitution amount and included a letter and spreadsheet from Tracy detailing his claims, along with a new $1,300 claim from Cash One Pawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">\u00b65 At the sentencing hearing, the parties discussed the additional $1,300 claim from Cash One Pawn. Patterson questioned the $1,300 claim and pointed out that a restitution amount had previously been determined. The State responded that Cash One Pawn\u2019s restitution request was received after the parties had agreed to the $23,762 amount and, because the pleas were open, the additional restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>was a matter of the District Court\u2019s discretion. The District Court expressed a concern that the law required it to consider the request and, ultimately, the parties agreed that the $1,300 was appropriate for restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b66 Also, during the hearing, an attorney for Tracy asked to be heard. Tracy had not been part of the negotiations between the State and the defense and wanted to present his restitution request. The District Court ruled it would hear the request. Tracy testified and was cross-examined, explaining that he lived in Nevada and had traveled to Montana for the sole purpose of searching for his stolen property. Tracy stated that he had spent a considerable amount of time driving to and checking pawn stores around Montana, including shops in Missoula, Butte, Great Falls, Helena, and Kalispell. Tracy presented a spreadsheet itemizing his claims. It included the amount of time (84 hours) he had spent searching, his lost wages, travel expenses, damage to the firearms, and miscellaneous expenses, totaling $5,039.94, which are challenged on appeal by Patterson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b67 Patterson objected to Tracy\u2019s restitution request. The sentencing hearing was continued to give the defense additional time to analyze and respond to the restitution requests. At the continued hearing, the District Court concluded that all of Tracy\u2019s requested restitution amounts should be included in the restitution total. As part of his sentence, Patterson was ordered to pay, jointly and severally with King, $28,592 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b68 On appeal, Patterson challenges the restitution ordered for Tracy\u2019s lost wages, damages to the firearms, mileage expenses, and copying costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">\u00b69 A criminal sentence is reviewed for legality. <em>State v. Simpson, </em>2014 MT 175, \u00b6 8, 375 Mont. 393, 328 P.3d 1144 <em>(citing State v. Benoit, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>2002 MT 166, \u00b6 18, 310 Mont. 449, 51 P.3d 495). We review the imposition of criminal sentences to determine if they are statutorily authorized. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>2015 MT 56, \u00b6 13, 378 Mont. 301, 343 P.3d 566 (citing <em>State v. Thorpe, </em>2015 MT 14, \u00b6 7, 378 Mont. 62, 342 P.3d 5). Restitution cases create mixed questions of fact and law. Upon appeal, we review these mixed questions <em>de novo. State v. Cerasani, </em>2014 MT 2, \u00b6 11, 373 Mont. 192, 316 P.3d 819 (citing <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 21, 327 Mont. 352, 114 P.3d 254). Factual findings regarding the measure of restitution are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>State v. Passwater, </em>2015 MT 159, \u00b6 9, 379 Mont. 372, 350 P.3d 382 (citing <em>State v. Aragon, </em>2014 MT 89, \u00b6 9, 374 Mont. 391, 321 P.3d 841); <em>State v. Barrick, </em>2015 MT 94, \u00b6 11, 378 Mont. 441, 347 P.3d 241 (citing <em>State v. O\u2019Connell, </em>2011 MT 242, \u00b6 7, 362 Mont. 171, 261 P.3d 1042). Factual findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Barrick, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>\u00b6 7). Conclusions of law regarding the measure of restitution are reviewed for correctness. <em>Barrick, \u00b6 </em>11 (citing <em>State v. Pritchett, </em>2000 MT 261, \u00b6 18, 302 Mont. 1, 11 P.3d 539).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court err in determining the amount of restitution </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"A52\">\u00b611 Both parties cite to <em>Barrick </em>in support of their arguments. In <em>Barrick, </em>we considered whether the victims\u2019 lost wages incurred in cooperating in Barrick\u2019s prosecution could be properly ordered to be repaid as restitution. <em>Barrick, </em>\u00b6 16. Because the unpaid wages were neither an out-of-pocket expense under \u00a7 46-18-243(1)(d), MCA, nor a damage that the victims could recover \u201cin a civil action arising out of the facts or events\u201d of the crime under \u00a7 46-18-243(1)(a), MCA, we held that the wages were not properly assessed as restitution under \u00a7 46-18-243, MCA. In doing so, we analyzed substantive civil law and, based upon the conversion statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> concluded that recoverable losses for conversion, an applicable civil claim, included only the value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>converted property and compensation for \u201cthe time and money properly expended in pursuit of the property.\u201d <em>Barrick, </em>\u00b6 23. We thus denied the claim for lost wages incurred by the victims in cooperating in the litigation of the case. <em>Barrick, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b612 Regarding Tracy\u2019s $2,520 lost wages claim, Patterson argues that <em>Barrick </em>did not definitively hold that lost wages incurred in pursuit of converted property are recoverable, but rather noted some uncertainty in the law. Patterson notes that Montana\u2019s conversion statute, \u00a7 27-1-320, MCA, was drafted based on the Field Civil Code and that both California and North Dakota have similar statutes also originating from the Field Civil Code, leading to his citation of <em>Gladstone v. Hillel, </em>250 Cal. Rptr. 372 (Cal. App. 1988) and <em>Harwood State Bank v. Charon, </em>466 N.W.2d 601 (N.D. 1991). In <em>Gladstone, </em>the conversion victim sought reimbursement of expenses actually incurred in preparation for litigation under Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3336(2) (LexisNexis 2016), as \u201cfair compensation for the time and money properly expended in pursuit of the property.\u201d The victim\u2019s damages were denied. Similarly, in <em>Harwood, </em>a case we cited in <em>Barrick, </em>the North Dakota Supreme Court was asked to determine if attorney fees could be claimed under N.D. (2016) Cent. Code \u00a7 32-03-23(3), as \u201ca fair compensation for the time and money properly expended in pursuit of property.\u201d The North Dakota Supreme Court held the fees could not be claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"AZu\">\u00b613  In both <em>Gladstone </em>and <em>Harwood, </em>the expenses and fees requested by the conversion victims were deemed to have been incurred in the litigation against the wrongdoers, not as out-of-pocket expenses incurred to recover the property. <em>Gladstone, </em>250 Cal. Rptr. at 381 (\u201cThe court held \u2018[accounting expenses] ... were incurred in preparation for litigation and not in pursuit of property.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Harwood, </em>466 N.W.2d at 605 (\u201c[T]he phrase \u2018time and money properly expended in pursuit of the property\u2019 is not an express authorization of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We made the same distinction in <em>Barrick. Barrick, </em>\u00b6 23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>(\u201c 1C lourts have distinguished between time spent in pursuit of converted property,\u2019 which is generally compensable, \u2018and time spent in litigation,\u2019 which is generally not compensable.\u201d). This distinction is supported by the plain language of \u00a7 27-1-320, MCA, and we concur with the District Court that Tracy\u2019s lost wages, incurred in pursuit of his stolen property, are recoverable in a civil action for conversion, and are properly reimbursable as restitution for pecuniary loss under \u00a7 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA. The District Court found that Tracy\u2019s efforts to locate his property were expected and directly related to obtaining his firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b614 The same rationale applies to Tracy\u2019s mileage and copying costs. Tracy claimed $1,010 for driving to Montana from Nevada, as well as driving around Montana searching for his firearms. Tracy testified that none of this travel would have occurred had he not been directly engaged in pursuing and recovering his property, which the District Court found to be credible. He also claimed $9.94 in copying costs, which he would not have normally incurred. Tracy\u2019s mileage costs were reimbursable as a pecuniary loss under \u00a7 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA, and his copying costs under \u00a7 46-18-243(l)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u00b615 Tracy also sought $1,500 in restitution for damages to his recovered property. Tracy testified that his claim for $1,500 was \u201cfor [the] degradation and outright abuse of some of my firearms, which were all pristine and basically like new.\u201d Section 27-1-106(2), MCA, states that \u201c[a]n injury to property consists [of] depriving its owner of [its] benefits ..., which is done by ... deteriorating ... it.\u201d Likewise, the conversion statute permits recovery of \u201cthe value of the property at the time of its conversion.\u201d Section 27-l-320(l)(a), MCA. The District Court properly ordered this restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u00b616 Lastly, Patterson argues Tracy\u2019s claims were not supported by sufficient evidence. Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla of evidence, but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Passwater, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 9). As we stated in <em>Passwater, </em>evidence presented in favor of restitution must be substantiated in the record \u201c \u2018such that a reasonable mind\u2019 could conclude that the award of restitution was warranted,\u201d and that such evidence had been presented there. <em>Passwater, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing Aragon, \u00b6 19; <em>State v. Coluccio, </em>2009 MT 273, \u00b6 45, 352 Mont. 122, 214 P.3d 1282 <em>overruled in part on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>other grounds by State v. Kirn, </em>2012 MT 69, 364 Mont. 356, 274 P.3d 476). In <em>Passwater, </em>the District Court received: 1) a victim impact statement and affidavit claiming the amount of loss; and 2) a care plan with firm calculations. Here, the District Court received: 1) Tracy\u2019s testimony; 2) his written victim impact statement; and 3) an itemized spreadsheet with firm calculations to support his claims. Tracy calculated his mileage based on total miles traveled multiplied by $0.50 per mile, which was near the current IRS mileage rate, and found to be reasonable by the District Court. Tracy calculated his lost wages by multiplying the 84 hours he spent by $30 per hour. Finally, Tracy based his property damage claim on \u201crust, wood damage, [and] abrasions to [the] metal and wood finishes.\u201d Patterson did not specifically challenge the calculation of Tracy\u2019s claims, but instead argued that these amounts had already been incorporated into the original restitution figure of $23,762. However, Tracy\u2019s spreadsheet carefully itemized and accounted for a total restitution claim of $27,292, of which $5,039.94 was challenged on appeal. The District Court accepted all of Tracy\u2019s claims and added Cash One Pawn\u2019s $1,300 claim to arrive at $28,592, which was the total amount of restitution ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"AxM\">\u00b617  The District Court did not err in granting Tracy\u2019s restitution requests for lost wages, mileage, copying costs, and personal property damage, which were all supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b366-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, SHEA and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-10\"> Patterson\u2019s and King\u2019s cases proceeded together, and they were held jointly and severally liable for $28,592 in restitution.

Jesse Alma King, </em>Cause No. DA 15-0735.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-10\"> Tracy\u2019s total request was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">$2,520.00 Wages lost while pursuing stolen property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFD\">$1,500.00 Damage to returned personal property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aff-dedup-0\">$600.00 Mileage for driving from Nevada to Missoula to search for stolen property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-12\">$410.00 Mileage for driving around Montana searching for stolen property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-13\">$9.94 Copying costs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-14\">$5,039.94 Total</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\"> Section 27-1-320, MCA, Conversion of personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">(1) The detriment caused by the wrongful conversion of personal property is presumed to be:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">(a) the value of the property at the time of its conversion with the interest from that time or, when the action has been prosecuted with reasonable diligence, the highest market value of the property at any time between the conversion and the verdict without interest, at the option of the injured party; and</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">(b) a fair compensation for the time and money properly expended in pursuit of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\"> Patterson cites <em>Gladstone </em>for the proposition that the Field Civil Code was archaic and that, when enacted, \u201cthe Legislature may have contemplated compensation for time spent searching the countryside in search of misappropriated livestock or other chattels.\u201d <em>Gladstone, </em>250 Cal. Rptr. at 381. Based on this language, Patterson implies the effort and costs expended searching for stolen property may no longer be an appropriate measure of damages for civil conversion. However, we think the North Dakota Supreme Court\u2019s reading of <em>Gladstone </em>and other California decisions is more accurate, and places the <em>Gladstone </em>quote in the appropriate context of the general rule stated by those courts: \u201cCalifornia courts say the purpose of the second element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>damages for conversion\u2014time spent pursuing the property\u2014is meant to compensate for time spent to <em>recover the actual property.\u201d Harwood, </em>466 N.W.2d at 605 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
