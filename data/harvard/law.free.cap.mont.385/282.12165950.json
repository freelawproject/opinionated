(Alpine) appeals the interlocutory adjudication of the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, interpreting the phrase \u201cregularly scheduled flights\u201d within \u00a7 15-23-401(1), MCA. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">\n<em>Did the District Court correctly interpret the phrase \u201cregularly scheduled flights\u201d in \u00a7 15-23-401(1), MCA?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b63 On May 31, 2013, the Montana Department of Revenue (DOR) informed Alpine it would be centrally assessed pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 15-23-101 and 15-6-145, MCA. Alpine filed a request for reclassification, which was denied by the DOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\u00b64 DOR and Alpine both waived proceedings before the DOR Office of Dispute Resolution, and Alpine filed an appeal with the State Tax Appeal Board (STAB). After the initial STAB pleadings were filed, DOR brought an interlocutory appeal to the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 15-2-304, MCA, seeking an \u201cadjudication of the meaning of\u2018scheduled airline\u2019 and \u2018scheduled air commerce\u2019 for Montana property tax purposes.\u201d These terms are further informed by the statutory phrase \u201cregularly scheduled flights,\u201d the meaning of which was fully briefed by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">\u00b65 On May 14, 2015, the District Court issued an order for interlocutory adjudication, holding that \u201cscheduled airline company\u201d under the statute means \u201cany person who undertakes directly or indirectly to engage in the business of transportation by aircraft of persons or property for hire in interstate, intrastate, or international transportation on regularly scheduled flights,\u201d and that, in turn, \u201cregularly scheduled flights\u201d are \u201cthose which follow a patterned but not necessarily uniform interval according to timetables and locations predefined by the carrier and which fly regardless of whether there are passengers or freight to be carried.\u201d Alpine appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">\u00b66 We review issues of statutory interpretation for correctness. <em>Westmoreland Res. Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>2014 MT 212, \u00b6 5, 376 Mont. 180, 330 P.3d 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">\u00b67 This matter comes before us pursuant to statutes uniquely authorizing interlocutory adjudications and appeals from those adjudications. Section 15-2-305, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Jurisdiction to make interlocutory adjudication. A district court may make an interlocutory adjudication of an issue pending before the state tax appeal board if that issue involves procedure, the admissibility of evidence, or a substantive question of law and does not require the determination of a question of fact. If the petition is granted, the district court shall rule on all issues presented in the petition and the response, regardless of whether a ruling on less than all of the issues is dispositive of the case. Appeals from the ruling of the court may be appealed as in other civil actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">f 8 DOR is required to \u201ccentrally assess each year ... all property of scheduled airlines.\u201d Section 15-23-101(3), MCA. A \u201cscheduled airline company\u201d is defined as \u201cany person who undertakes directly or indirectly to engage in the business of scheduled air commerce.\u201d Section 15-23-401(8), MCA. In turn, \u201cair commerce\u201d is defined as \u201cthe transportation by aircraft of persons or property for hire in interstate, intrastate, or international transportation on <em>regularly scheduled flights.\u201d </em>Section 15-23-401(1), MCA (emphasis added). \u201cRegularly scheduled flights\u201d is not separately defined in the Code, and thus, the purpose of this litigation is to provide a definition of the term, so that the corresponding statutory sections governing \u201cscheduled airlines\u201d can be properly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b69 To accomplish this task, Alpine encourages the Court to examine the lengthy legislative history of aviation-related state statutes, and also argues that \u201cscheduled\u201d has a unique meaning in federal aviation regulatory law that should be considered. Alpine requests that we reverse and remand this matter with instructions to the District Court \u201cto issue an interlocutory adjudicatory ruling that Alpine is not a scheduled airline.\u201d The DOR responds that the plain meaning of the statutes should control and that \u201cAlpine impermissibly attempts to bring questions of fact into this interlocutory adjudication.\u201d It asks that we affirm the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b610 We agree with DOR\u2019s general approach to this matter. As noted above, this is an interlocutory appeal that does not permit determination of questions of fact. Section 15-2-305, MCA. There is no factual record before us and we cannot here determine Alpine\u2019s status as a scheduled airline company or its ultimate status as a centrally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>assessed company. The only issue properly before us is the legal question of the statute\u2019s interpretation, and we begin with its plain wording.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b611 \u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. \u201cIn the construction of a statute, the intention of the legislature is to be pursued, if possible.\u201d Section 1-2-102, MCA. \u201c[LJegislative intent is to be ascertained, in the first instance, from the plain meaning of the words used\u201d by the legislature. <em>W. Energy Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>1999 MT 289, \u00b6 11, 297 Mont. 55, 990 P.2d 767. Similarly, \u201c[w]hen the legislature has not defined a statutory term, we consider the term to have its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Giacomelli v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 418, \u00b6 18, 354 Mont. 15, 221 P.3d 666; <em>accord Bates v. Neva, </em>2014 MT 336, \u00b6 15, 377 Mont. 350, 339 P.3d 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b612 As such, statutory interpretation begins.with an examination of the plain language of the statute itself, <em>Smith v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry., </em>2008 MT 225, \u00b6 22, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639, and dictionary definitions may be considered, <em>Mont. Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. Priceline.com, Inc., </em>2015 MT 241, \u00b6 10, 380 Mont. 352, 354 P.3d 631; <em>Giacomelli, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>AP v. Mont. Senate Republican Caucus, </em>286 Mont. 172, 179, 951 P.2d 65, 69 (1997); <em>In re Irvine\u2019s Estate, </em>114 Mont. 577, 580, 139 P.2d 489, 489-90 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b613 Dictionary definitions of the operative words \u201cregularly\u201d and \u201cscheduled\u201d produce common sense renderings. \u201cRegular\u201d means \u201csteady or uniform in course, practice, or occurrence,\u201d \u201cnot subject to unexplained or irrational variation,\u201d \u201creturning, recurring, or received at stated, fixed, or uniform intervals.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1913 (Philip Babcock Gove ed., 16th ed. 1971) [hereinafter <em>Webster\u2019s Third], </em>Similarly, \u201cregularly\u201d means \u201cin a regular, orderly, lawful, or methodical way.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third, supra, </em>1913. \u201cSchedule\u201d is \u201ca written or printed formal list,\u201d \u201ca transportation timetable,\u201d or a \u201cwritten plan or proposal for future procedure typically indicating the objective proposed, the time and sequence of each operation, and the materials required.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third, supra, </em>2028.</p>\n<p id=\"A5H\">\u00b614 These terms, combined with the statute as a whole, demonstrate that a \u201cregularly scheduled flight\u201d occurs on a uniform or unvarying, and reoccurring, basis as preset by an airline and offered for hire to the public. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-23-401(1), MCA (defining \u201cair commerce\u201d as offering air transportation \u201cfor hire\u201d); \u00a7 15-23-401(8), MCA (defining \u201cscheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>airline company\u201d as engaging in \u201cthe business\u201d of air commerce). One key concept here is <em>who </em>sets the flight schedule. An airline arranges a regularly scheduled flight; the customer does not.</p>\n<p id=\"AUXd\">\u00b615 The District Court\u2019s definition of \u201cregularly scheduled flight\u201d was satisfactory with the exception of its use of the phrase \u201cpatterned but not necessarily uniform,\u201d which potentially incorporates a notion of irregularly arranged flights that would be inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s \u201cregularly scheduled\u201d wording, because a pattern can be an irregular one. <em>See, e.g., Trinity Am. Corp. v. EPA, </em>150 F.3d 389, 393 (4th Cir. 1998) (contaminated groundwater testing produced \u201can \u2018irregular pattern\u2019 of both low and high levels of contaminants at different times\u201d); <em>B B &amp; L, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>52 F.3d 366, 370 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (employees working an \u201cirregular pattern\u201d of hours nonetheless had a \u201creasonable expectancy of further employment\u201d); <em>Maker\u2019s Mark Distillery, Inc. v. Diageo N. Am., </em>679 F.3d 410, 417 (6th Cir. 2012) (trademark registered for the \u201cirregular pattern\u201d of the wax-like trade dress sealing bottles of Maker\u2019s Mark bourbon); <em>Thornton v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>715 F.2d 1508, 1510 (11th Cir. 1983) (\u201cirregular patterns\u201d of heat emissions from horse\u2019s forelegs suggested inflammation characteristic of soring). Thus, making the small revision of removing this phrase, we affirm the remainder of the District Court\u2019s definition of \u201cregularly scheduled flights\u201d as \u201cthose which follow an interval according to timetables and locations predefined by the carrier and which fly regardless of whether there are passengers or freight to be carried.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b616 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b312-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> Article VII, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution is entitled \u201cDistrict court jurisdiction.\u201d It provides, in part, that \u201cThe legislature may provide for direct review by the district court of decisions of administrative agencies.\u201d Mont.
