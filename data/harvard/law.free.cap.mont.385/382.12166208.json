Did the District Court err by holding that Scottsdale breached its duty to defend its insured?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err by holding there were no grounds for a reasonableness hearing regarding the stipulated judgment?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\n<em>3.

Haynie\u2019s commercial business was insured by two different insurance companies during the course of Haynie\u2019s work on the project. Mountain West Farm Bureau (Farm Bureau) insured Haynie under a policy that was in effect from April 22, 2008, to April 22, 2009. Scottsdale insured Haynie under a policy that was effective from April 29, 2009 onward, until it was cancelled on February 18, 2010. The Scottsdale policy contained a $1,000,000 limit of liability per occurrence, subject to a $2,000,000 aggregate limit. There was no overlap in the effective periods of the two policies insuring Haynie.</p>\n<p id=\"AIU\">\u00b64 In August 2008, Moodie entered into a buy/sell agreement to purchase a parcel of land on which to build the dealership building, and the transaction closed on July 18, 2009. Haynie conducted.some construction work during the effective period of the Farm Bureau policy. The building project was completed in September 2009, while the Scottsdale policy was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">\u00b65 In October 2012, Moodie filed the instant action against Haynie, asserting various construction defect claims regarding the construction project. Moodie filed its second amended complaint in February 2013, asserting intertwining claims against Haynie, Kyle Haynie personally, and Russell Country Realty, which was partly owned by Kyle Haynie.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AW1\">\u00b66 According to the affidavit of Jon Reamer (Reamer Affidavit), a Director of Claims for Scottsdale, Scottsdale received a Notice of Claim \u201cindicating Moodie Implement Company had presented a claim against Haynie in the captioned District Court action\u201d on March 6, 2013. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Scottsdale acknowledged receipt of the claim the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b67 The Reamer Affidavit further attests to \u201cseveral contacts\u201d between Scottsdale and Kyle Haynie, on behalf of Haynie, following the receipt of the Notice of Claim. First, on March 21,2013, Kyle Haynie informed Scottsdale that Farm Bureau had filed an Answer on behalf of Haynie and assigned an incident number to the claim. Second, on March 25, 2013, Kyle Haynie informed Scottsdale that his first contract \u201cas general contractor on the Moodie Implement project was dated February 15, 2009, prior to the inception of the Scottsdale coverage.\u201d Scottsdale averred that, during this second conversation, Kyle Haynie was advised, and he acknowledged, that Scottsdale\u2019s policy did not cover operations prior to April 29,2009, and that Kyle Haynie advised Scottsdale that Farm Bureau \u201cwould be defending him in the action.\u201d Kyle Haynie attested that he \u201cnever told Scottsdale or anyone else that [he] agreed Scottsdale does not owe a duty to defend [his] company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-O\">\u00b68 On May 20, 2013,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Scottsdale sent Haynie a letter formally denying coverage. The letter advised Haynie that Scottsdale had \u201cdetermined that there is no coverage available for the presently pending claims against you in this matter.\u201d The letter stated the \u201cDesignated Operations Exclusion\u201d of Scottsdale\u2019s policy excluded coverage for damages \u201carising out of any and all operations prior to the inception of this policy. ... Therefore, this exclusion will act to bar coverage for this matter and Scottsdale will not defend and/or indemnify you for this matter.\u201d The letter concluded by advising Haynie that if it believed \u201cthis coverage determination to be inaccurate, or that the claim has been wrongfully disclaimed or rejected in whole or in part, you [Haynie] may have the matter reviewed by the State Department of Insurance within the pertinent jurisdiction,\u201d and requested that Haynie provide any information or documentation to Scottsdale if the facts or circumstances changed. Scottsdale presented no evidence that it took any additional actions in furtherance of Haynie\u2019s defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Scottsdale\u2019s next action of any kind was its notice of appearance in this litigation, filed May 19, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b69 By discovery responses dated June 20, 2013, Haynie disclosed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Moodie that Scottsdale had refused to defend and indemnify Haynie, and that Farm Bureau was defending the action, but would be issuing a reservation of rights letter. That same day, Farm Bureau provided the letter to Haynie, advising that it would provide a defense through attorney Curt Drake (Drake) because some of the claims alleged may fall under the Farm Bureau policy. However, the letter stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">Mountain West Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company expressly reserves its rights with respect to the following questions concerning its duty to provide defense and indemnity under the Businessowners [sic] policies issued to you:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">1. There is a question as to whether some or all of the damages alleged in the lawsuit were the result of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence as those terms are defined in the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">2. There is a question as to whether some or all the claims asserted in the Second Amended Complaint fall within the scope of the policy\u2019s coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">3. There is a question as to whether the following policy language precludes coverage: [policy provisions regarding, in particular, the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion and whether the damages fall within the definition of \u201cproperty damage.\u201d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Farm Bureau noted that \u201cSome potential coverage exists for the claim of negligence. That being said, some or all of the damages alleged in the Second Amended Complaint may be excluded by the policy provisions cited above.\u201d The letter concluded by informing Haynie:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">As noted above, some of the damages asserted against you may not give rise to coverage. Consequently, this presents the potential for personal liability on your part, and we reserve the right to deny coverage to you, and anyone claiming coverage under your policy, for any judgment falling outside the policy\u2019s coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asdl\">Drake represented Haynie throughout the litigation and there is no dispute he provided a competent defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">\u00b610 On February 9,2015, Haynie and Moodie jointly filed a stipulated settlement that recited (1) Moodie\u2019s claims against Haynie; (2) Moodie\u2019s expert witnessess\u2019s opinion that the project was negligently constructed and that Moodie suffered $5,650,000 in damages; (3) Scottsdale\u2019s refusal to provide a defense or coverage; (4) Haynie\u2019s resulting substantial risk, including financial insolvency; (5) the settlement reached between Moodie and Haynie for $5,650,000; (6) Moodie\u2019s agreement to file a covenant not to execute on such judgment; and (7) Haynie\u2019s agreement to assign all its rights and interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Scottsdale policy to Moodie. Kyle Haynie attested that, as a result of Scottsdale\u2019s refusal to provide a defense, he had \u201csettled with Moodie to eliminate the severe risks to me and my business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b611 The District Court entered judgment in the case against Haynie for $5,650,000 on March 3,2015, and ordered that Moodie was entitled to recover all costs, fees, and interest as allowed by law. On March 12, 2015, Moodie and Haynie jointly filed a covenant not to execute on the judgment and claims. In the covenant, Moodie agreed to not enforce the judgment against Haynie, Kyle Haynie personally, or Russell Country Realty, and Haynie assigned all rights and interest in the Scottsdale policy to Moodie.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b612 Moodie filed a notice of entry of judgment on March 12, 2015. On March 24, 2015, Moodie filed its fourth amended complaint, which named Scottsdale as a defendant and requested a declaratory judgment against Scottsdale. The declaratory judgment count alleged that Scottsdale had breached its duty to defend, Haynie had entered a stipulated judgment due to Scottsdale\u2019s failure to defend, the judgment was reasonable and negotiated in good faith, and Scottsdale was liable for the stipulated judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b613 Scottsdale moved for summary judgment to dismiss the declaratory judgment count and sought discovery regarding the reasonableness of the settlement. Moodie cross moved for summary judgment on the same count and requested a protective order to bar discovery. Scottsdale argued that it was in an excess position and did not have a duty to defend under its excess coverage clause,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it did not unjustifiably breach its duty to defend, the stipulated judgment was not reasonable and could not survive summary judgment, and it was entitled to discovery regarding the reasonableness of the stipulated judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b614 The District Court ruled in favor of Moodie on all issues, holding that Scottsdale had a duty to defend Haynie, Scottsdale breached that duty unjustifiably, the stipulated judgment was reasonable, and Scottsdale was not entitled to discovery regarding the reasonableness of the stipulated judgment. Scottsdale appeals all rulings of the District Court, except for the ruling that it had a duty to defend Haynie.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b615 A district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo, applying the same criteria as the district court. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.

The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of establishing both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Roe, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25). If the moving party meets this burden, then the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to establish that a genuine issue of material fact does exist. <em>Roe, </em>\u00b6 14 (internal quotation omitted) (citing <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b617 If no material facts are in dispute, the question of whether or not an insurer breached its duty to defend is a question of law. <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur.

Did the District Court err by holding that Scottsdale breached its duty to defend its insured?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">\u00b619 Acknowledging it had a duty to defend Haynie, Scottsdale argues it did not breach the duty because, at all times during the litigation, Haynie was fully defended by counsel provided by Farm Bureau. Scottsdale argues that this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Schwan </em>and <em>Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Co. v. Keller Transportation, Inc., </em>2016 MT 6, 382 Mont. 72, 365 P.3d 465 <em>[hereinafterWestchester], </em>established that an insured is \u201conly entitled to one full defense,\u201d meaning that the provision of a defense by any insurer necessarily satisfies the duty to defend of any co-insurer. Thus, Scottsdale argues that because Farm Bureau fully defended Haynie throughout the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>litigation, Haynie was never \u201cimproperly abandoned by its insure[r] and left without a defense,\u201d and Scottsdale did not breach its duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b620 \u201cThe duty to defend arises when a complaint against an insured alleges facts, which if proven, would result in coverage.\u201d <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. </em>Staples, 2004 MT 108, \u00b6 21, 321 Mont. 99, 90 P.3d 381; <em>accord Schwan, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 26; <em>Tidyman\u2019s Mgmt. Servs. v.

St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine, </em>2009 MT 123, \u00b6 32, 350 Mont. 184, 206 P.3d 919. An insurer must defend all counts \u201cso long as one count potentially triggers coverage, even if the remaining counts would not be covered.\u201d <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 16. An insurer\u2019s duty to defend is \u201cindependent from and broader than its duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>accord Freyer, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b621 \u201c[WJhere an insurer refuses to defend a claim and does so unjustifiably, that insurer becomes liable for defense costs and judgments.\u201d <em>Newman v.

Cumiskey, </em>204 Mont. 350, 358, 665 P.2d 223, 227 (1983) (\u201cIn a proper case, an insurer may use [a declaratory action] in order to obtain a determination of the validity, continuance, or coverage of an insurance policy; a determination of the extent of liability; or a determination of the insurer\u2019s duties under the policy.\u201d); <em>see also Nielsen v. TIG Ins. </em>Co., 442 F. Supp. 2d 972, 977 (D. Mont. 2006) (noting this Court\u2019s admonition to use declaratory actions to resolve coverage questions).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b623 In <em>Schwan, </em>on which Scottsdale relies, we held the insurer did not breach its duty to defend, despite not hiring counsel for its insureds, because its actions in coordinating with the insureds\u2019 other defense counsel \u201cgave the necessary substance to the duty to defend and fulfilled its contractual duty to the [insureds] under the policy.\u201d <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 20. The <em>Schwan </em>plaintiffs argued and the district court ruled that the insurer, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (State Farm Fire), breached its duty to defend the defendants by not \u201cretaining] separate counsel for the [defendants] in the [underlying tort action] or contributing] financially to payment of [the other insurer\u2019s retained counsel\u2019s] legal fees.\u201d <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 11. However, State Farm Fire engaged in discussions with the insureds\u2019 co-insurer, confirmed the co-insurer did not need assistance and was defending the insureds on all claims, committed to assuming the defense if the co-insurer discontinued its defense, participated in settlement discussions, and kept the insured advised of its actions. <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 19. State Farm Fire also filed a declaratory action to determine coverage and hired coverage counsel for the insureds, even though not required to do so under the policy. <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9, 19. We reasoned that the insureds had not been \u201cleft unprotected or... prejudiced\u201d by State Farm Fire\u2019s actions, <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 20, and the duty to defend had not been breached, <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b624 In <em>Westchester, </em>we held that Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Company had not breached its duty because \u201c[t]he facts of this case demonstrate that the insureds were not \u2018improperly abandoned\u2019 by their insurers and left without a defense such that they would be \u2018justified in taking steps to limit their personal liability\u2019 by entering a stipulated judgment.\u201d <em>Westchester, </em>\u00b6 33 (quoting <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 34). Westchester, an excess carrier, assumed defense of the insured when the primary insurer\u2019s policy limits were reached, issued a reservation of rights letter explaining it would defend up to its facial policy limits of $4 million, litigated the matter until the facial limits were exhausted, transferred the case back to the primary insurer, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>assumed the defense, and joined the primary insurer in a declaratory action to determine coverage when plaintiffs claimed there was additional coverage. <em>Westchester, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-8. Between Westchester and the primary insurer, the insureds\u2019 legal costs, though delayed, were completely paid and the insured had legal representation up to the entry of the stipulated judgment between the insured and plaintiffs. <em>Westchester, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b625 In arguing it did not breach the duty to defend, Scottsdale urges a laser-like focus on the fact that Haynie was represented by counsel, overlooking our holding in <em>Schwan </em>that legal representation of the insureds by a co-insurer \u201c[did] not mean that State Farm Fire\u2019s duty to defend the [insureds] was extinguished by the defense provided by [the co-insurer].\u201d <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 17. Rather, we reviewed all of the facts in the matter to determine \u201cwhether State Farm Fire fulfilled [its] duty [to defend] by the actions it took,\u201d <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 14, and ultimately determined that it provided the \u201cnecessary substance\u201d of its contractual duty, <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 20. Similarly, in <em>Westchester, </em>we concluded that \u201c[t]he facts of this case demonstrate that the insureds were not \u2018improperly abandoned\u2019 by their insurers.\u201d <em>Westchester, </em>\u00b6 33 (quoting <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 34). The same conclusion cannot be reached from a review of Scottsdale\u2019s actions here.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b626 After receiving notice of the claim, Scottsdale spoke with Kyle Haynie on March 21, 2013, learning that Farm Bureau had assigned a claim number to the matter and filed an Answer on behalf of Haynie, and again on March 25, 2013, when it learned that the construction contract had been signed before the inception of its policy period and that Farm Bureau was undertaking defense of Haynie. Doing nothing more, on May 20, 2013, Scottsdale denied coverage pursuant to the \u201cDesignated Operations Exclusion\u201d of its policy, and did nothing further until it was named as a defendant in this action following entry of the stipulated judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b627 Clearly, the factual assertions of Moodie\u2019s claim included alleged actions by Haynie within Scottsdale\u2019s policy period: the policy became effective on April 29, 2009, and construction was not completed by Haynie until September 2009. Yet, contrary to what we have \u201crepeatedly admonished insurers,\u201d Freyer, \u00b6 37, Scottsdale did not seek a declaratory ruling to confirm its internal coverage determination. A declaratory action could have been brought early in the litigation \u2014 either upon tendering a defense to Haynie upon reservation of rights, or while letting Farm Bureau take the lead in defending Haynie \u2014 to resolve the coverage issue and confirm whether Scottsdale had a duty to defend. Failing that, Scottsdale provided no other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>assistance whatsoever to its insured related to the defense. As the District Court found, \u201cScottsdale can point to no evidence of actions it took to assist or participate in its insured\u2019s defense.\u201d Unlike the insurers in <em>Schwan </em>and <em>Westchester, </em>Scottsdale made no effort to contact the co-insurer to further understand the claims, offered no coordination, and provided no other defense support pending a ruling that would affirmatively confirm whether coverage existed under the policy. It simply made the unilateral decision that it was done.</p>\n<p id=\"A6s\">\u00b628 An insurer must ensure an insured is defended, as the insurer in <em>Schwan </em>did, even as it disputed coverage. Scottsdale did nothing to honor the contractual benefit that Haynie had secured under the policy, or to confirm that it had no obligation to do so. When an insurer defends the insured, it also defends itself against a duty to defend claim. Scottsdale\u2019s decision to \u201croll the dice\u201d on its opinion that Haynie was not insured under the policy exposed Haynie, and itself, to great risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b629 Scottsdale\u2019s failures placed Haynie in the position of litigating under a reservation of rights letter from Farm Bureau. Farm Bureau provided a defense, but did so under a reservation of rights that informed Haynie that \u201csome or all of the damages\u201d alleged may be excluded under the policy, and that the litigation \u201cpresents the potential for personal liability on your part.\u201d Farm Bureau reserved its right to \u201cdeny coverage to you, and anyone claiming coverage under your policy, for any judgment falling outside the policy\u2019s coverage.\u201d Scottsdale knew Haynie was being defended by Farm Bureau, but made no effort to learn if Haynie was being defended under a reservation of rights and, if so, the terms of the reservation. Haynie was \u201cleft unprotected,\u201d <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 20, and faced with this scenario, entered the stipulated judgment, stating that \u201cI [Kyle Haynie] settled with Moodie to eliminate the severe risks to me and my business.\u201d \u201c[W]hen an insurer improperly abandons its insured, the insured is justified in taking steps to limit his or her personal liability.\u201d <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 34 (quoting <em>Old Republic Ins. Co., </em>180 P.3d at 433); <em>accord Westchester, </em>\u00b6 33; <em>Tidyman's I, </em>\u00b6 25. As such, the stipulated judgment was the \u201cnatural and ordinary consequence of [Scottsdale\u2019s] breach\u201d of its duty to defend Haynie. <em>Indep. Milk &amp; Cream Co., </em>68 Mont. at 157, 216 P. at 1110.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u00b630 Scottsdale disclaimed coverage without a declaratory judgment and took no further steps to honor its duty to defend, which resulted in an abandonment of its insureds that exposed them to risk. While Scottsdale now acknowledges it had a duty to defend Haynie, at the time it entered the stipulated settlement, Haynie had received only denials from Scottsdale. We affirm the District Court\u2019s holding that Scottsdale breached its duty to defend Haynie.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b631 <em>2. Did the District Court err by ruling there were no grounds for a reasonableness hearing regarding the stipulated judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b632 Montana\u2019s general damages statute requires that \u201c[djamages must in all cases be reasonable, and where an obligation of any kind appears to create a right to unconscionable and grossly oppressive damages contrary to substantial justice, no more than reasonable damages can be recovered.\u201d Section 27-1-302, MCA. Likewise, settlements where an insurer has breached its duty to defend \u201cmust be reasonable.\u201d <em>Abbey /Land LLC v. Interstate Mech. </em>Inc., 2015 MT 77, \u00b6 12, 378 Mont. 372, 345 P.3d 1032 (citing <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 40; \u00a7 27-1-302, MCA; <em>Watson v.

Where a plaintiff has moved for approval of a stipulated settlement, the insurer \u201cmust set forth specific facts tending to demonstrate that the settlement amount may be unreasonable and request the district court to hold a reasonableness hearing.\u201d <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 41. The insurer must \u201cgo beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, <em>designate specific facts </em>showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 41 (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2553 (1986)) (emphasis added). If the insurer sets forth sufficient facts to make a showing that the settlement is unreasonable, that constitutes \u201ca factual issue which precludes entry of summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>judgment upon a claim for payment of a settlement amount, and a hearing on reasonableness should be held.\u201d <em>Tidymans I, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"An1\">\u00b634 Scottsdale raised specific fact issues by outlining problems with the appraisal used to establish the settlement amount. Even without the benefit of discovery, Scottsdale introduced an affidavit based upon tax records evidencing the tax value of the land and building currently owned by Moodie. This information implicated potential problems with Moodies\u2019s expert\u2019s filings regarding damages and the reasonableness of the stipulated judgment. Specifically, Scottsdale identified a possible $2 million windfall that appears to grant Moodie sufficient damages to purchase new land and build a new building, without considering the value of the land and building constructed for and currently owned by Moodie as offsetting values. This constitutes sufficient \u201cspecific facts\u201d to preclude the entry of summary judgment and require a reasonableness hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALc\">\u00b635 We hereby reverse the District Court and remand back for a reasonableness hearing to determine whether the settlement was reasonable in accordance with our holding in <em>Tidyman\u2019s Management Services Inc. v.
