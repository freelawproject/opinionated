Lee asserted that USAA acted in bad faith by conditioning payment on resolving the TRICARE liens. The Eighth Judicial District Court agreed and held USAA liable for its insured\u2019s $1,464,000 consent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">\u00b62 We conclude that USAA had a reasonable basis in law to condition its payment of policy limits upon resolution of the TRICARE liens, and we therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">\u00b63 In December 2012, Lee and three other passengers were injured in a single vehicle accident. Lee sustained catastrophic injuries. The driver, Julian Perez, held a USAA insurance policy. All of the passengers were military servicemen covered by TRICARE, a government insurance program for military members and their families. TRICARE paid medical benefits for the passengers and therefore had a statutory right to recover the benefits it paid. TRICARE\u2019s liens for the passengers\u2019 combined medical expenses totaled over $215,000; more than $204,000 of the total were for Lee\u2019s expenses alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">\u00b64 USAA insured Perez under an automobile liability policy with coverage limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. After conducting a liability investigation, USAA determined that Perez was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>100% at fault for the accident. Because of the extent of Lee\u2019s injuries, USAA informed Perez that he may be potentially liable for damages exceeding his coverage limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b65 On August 21, 2013, Lee\u2019s counsel \u2014 who represented all four injured passengers \u2014 made a settlement demand on USAA for Perez\u2019s $100,000 policy limits. The letter stated that the offer would be withdrawn and that the claimants would seek to recover all of their damages from USAA if USAA did not agree to pay the policy limits in twenty days. One week later, USAA\u2019s claims examiner contacted Lee\u2019s counsel and offered to pay the full policy limits, provided that the TRICARE liens were addressed. Lee\u2019s counsel immediately responded with a letter stating that his clients would indemnify and hold USAA harmless from any responsibility for the TRICARE liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b66 On September 9, 2013, USAA responded, stating that the offer to indemnify was not sufficient to protect Perez or USAA from the TRICARE liens. USAA confirmed in writing its offer to pay the policy limits, provided either that TRICARE be included as a payee on the settlement check or that Lee\u2019s counsel first secure lien releases from TRICARE. Lee\u2019s counsel followed with a letter two days later, stating that his clients would indemnify both USAA and Perez from any responsibility for the TRICARE liens. The letter gave USAA a deadline of September 21. USAA did not respond by the deadline. In the meantime, both USAA and Lee\u2019s counsel attempted to determine the status of TRICARE\u2019s liens. In early November 2013, USAA received letters from the Air Force providing notice of its claims and requesting payment of the liens pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651. TRICARE finally agreed to waive its liens at the end of January 2014, and USAA issued a check for the policy limits of $100,000 six weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b67 Lee had filed suit against Perez in October 2013, and he continued his suit after receiving the policy limits payment from USAA. In January 2015, Perez agreed to a consent judgment in the amount of $1,464,000, and assigned his claims against USAA to Lee. On behalf of Lee, West filed a separate suit that same month alleging bad faith against USAA. The District Court granted West summary judgment, concluding that USAA did not have a reasonable basis in law for conditioning payment of the settlement check. The court held therefore that USAA was liable to Lee for the consent judgment. USAA filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment that was deemed denied when the District Court did not rule. USAA appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u00b68 We review summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>standards set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). <em>Citizens for a Better Flathead v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2016 MT 256, \u00b6 10, 385 Mont. 156, 381 P.3d 555; <em>accord State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Freyer, </em>2013 MT 301, \u00b6 22, 372 Mont. 191, 312 P.3d 403. Generally, questions of reasonableness are factual matters properly answered by the finder of fact. <em>Estate of Gleason v. Cent. United Life Ins. Co., </em>2015 MT 140, \u00b6 60, 379 Mont. 219, 350 P.3d 349; <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48. But an insurer\u2019s reasonableness is a question of law for the court to decide when the insurer\u2019s basis in law is grounded on a legal conclusion and no issues of fact remain in dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Estate of Gleason, </em>\u00b6 60; <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the District Court correctly concluded that USAA did not have a reasonable basis in law for conditioning the settlement check upon resolution of the TRICARE liens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b610 Because insurers have the authority under their policies to settle third-party claims, insurers in Montana have a duty to accept reasonable settlement offers within the policy limits. <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 46. When an insurer acts in bad faith and \u201cfails to settle a bona fide third party liability claim against its insured, within policy coverage limits,\u201d that insurer \u201ctakes the risk of a judgment by the trier of fact in excess of the coverage limits.\u201d <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 47 (citation and internal quotations omitted). An insurer does not act in bad faith, however, and therefore is not liable, \u201cfor failing to settle within policy limits when it had a reasonable basis in law or fact for contesting coverage.\u201d <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 47. In determining whether an insurer has a reasonable basis in law for contesting coverage, \u201cit is first necessary to survey the legal landscape as it existed during the relevant time period.\u201d <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48 (citation and internal quotations omitted). The \u201cdeterminative question\u201d in our inquiry \u201cis whether the law in effect at the time, caselaw or statutory, provided sufficient guidance to signal to a reasonable insurer that its grounds for denying the claim were not meritorious.\u201d <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48. We are not to ask whether we agree \u201cwith the plaintiffs theories of liability in the underlying suit but, rather, whether the insurer\u2019s grounds for contesting those theories were reasonable under existing law.\u201d <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u00b611 Soon after filing her complaint in this action, West moved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>summary judgment. She argued that USAA acted in bad faith by failing to promptly settle the claim. USAA responded, arguing on the authority of <em>Freyer </em>that it had a reasonable basis in law to condition payment of the settlement upon resolution of the TRICARE liens. USAA contended that federal law \u2014 specifically 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651 \u2014 and our decision in <em>Conway v. Benefis Health Systems, Inc., </em>2013 MT 73, 369 Mont. 309, 297 P.3d 1200, established TRICARE as a secondary payer and obligated USAA either to include TRICARE as a co-payee or to secure a waiver of the liens before making payment to West. Despite Justice Cotter\u2019s assertion to the contrary, Dissent, \u00b6 30, USAA has asserted throughout litigation that the principal issue is whether its grounds for conditioning the settlement payment were reasonable under existing law because TRICARE is a secondary payer.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b612 The District Court recognized as much, identifying the issue before it as follows: \u201cDid USAA engage in bad faith settlement practices by refusing to pay an admitted liability settlement unless TRICARE was named as a co-payee on Lee\u2019s settlement check or TRICARE waived its statutory lien?\u201d The court ruled that USAA lacked a reasonable basis in law to delay payment of policy limits because of the TRICARE liens. The court focused its analysis on USAA\u2019s condition to include TRICARE as a payee on the settlement check. The court first noted that the parties had not identified any cases \u201caddressing this narrow issue.\u201d It rejected USAA\u2019s reliance on <em>Conway, </em>finding the case not directly on point. The court similarly rejected USAA\u2019s comparison of TRICARE to Medicare because it concluded that Medicare and TRICARE statutes and regulations are distinct. Specifically, the court noted that \u201cunlike the automatic first payer liability imposed ... on Medicare, there is no corresponding provision under TRICARE.\u201d Finally, the court rejected USAA\u2019s reliance on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651, which governs the United States\u2019 right to recover incurred medical costs from liable third parties and their insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"AkA\">\u00b613 The court determined that the federal statute would apply only if the United States had commenced litigation or intervened to enforce its liens; in that case, \u201cUSAA would have a compelling argument it properly included TRICARE on the settlement check.\u201d The court also determined that although TRICARE sent USAA notice of its claim and requested payment of the liens, \u201cthere is no obligation in the TRICARE regulations requiring USAA to protect the government lien.\u201d \u201cMost pertinently,\u201d the court specified, \u201cthere is no requirement that USAA name TRICARE on Lee\u2019s settlement check.\u201d As such, the court concluded that \u201cUSAA\u2019s unilateral decision [to include TRICARE as a payee on the settlement check] is without support in statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>regulation, or common law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b614 Further, the court noted that Lee expressly agreed to indemnify USAA, but that \u201cUSAA made the unilateral decision to condition its legal obligation to settle Lee\u2019s claims on including TRICARE as a settlement check payee.\u201d Such a condition, the District Court concluded, went against Montana\u2019s public policy regarding settlement of insurance claims. The court emphasized, \u201cWhen an insurer unilaterally adds a payee to a claimant\u2019s settlement check, the insurer substantially delays settlement, imposes onerous obligations not required by law, and creates unreasonable burdens on a claimant to receive funds the insurer is legally obligated to pay.\u201d Such a result, the court concluded, \u201cis hardly what the Montana legislature intended when it obligated insurers to \u2018attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA.) The court therefore held that \u201cUSAA\u2019s decision to condition payment on naming TRICARE as a payee of the settlement funds is unreasonable under applicable law.\u201d As a result, the District Court ordered USAA to pay the entire consent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b615 First, the District Court correctly recognized that \u201ca TRICARE lien arises under the Medical Care Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651(a).\u201d The Air Force\u2019s November 2013 letters to USAA referenced this section in asserting the United States\u2019 \u201cindependent right to recover costs.\u201d But the court incorrectly interpreted the statute. The statute broadly provides that, whenever the United States furnishes benefits to a beneficiary who is injured</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">under circumstances creating a tort liability upon some third person ... to pay damages therefor, the United States shall have a right to recover (independent of the rights of the injured or diseased person) from said third person, or that person\u2019s insurer, the reasonable value of the care and treatment so furnished, to be furnished, paid for, or to be paid for and shall, as to this right be subrogated to any right or claim that the injured [beneficiary]... has against such third person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651(a). By bestowing upon the United States a right to recover from Perez or USAA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651(a) obligated Perez or USAA to honor the TRICARE liens. The same statute allows the United States to enforce its right to recover by \u201cintervening]\u201d in or \u201cinstituting] and prosecuting] legal proceedings against the third person who is liable for the injury ... or the insurance carrier ... responsible for the payment or reimbursement of medical expenses.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651(d). Contrary to the District Court\u2019s conclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>USAA\u2019s obligation to honor the liens under \u00a7 2651(a) did not depend upon the United States already having pursued judicial enforcement under \u00a7 2651(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b6 16 Second, we disagree with the District Court that <em>Conway </em>offers no guidance here. We concluded in <em>Conway </em>that \u201cfederal regulations mandate that TRICARE functions as a secondary payer.\u201d <em>Conway, </em>\u00b6 32 (citing 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.8(a)). TRICARE\u2019s status as a secondary payer means that \u201cwhere the medical treatment at issue is necessitated as a result of the negligence of an insured third party, any payment originally made by TRICARE <em>must be reimbursed.\u201d Conway, </em>\u00b6 32 (citing 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.8(a), (b)(3)) (emphasis added). TRICARE benefits therefore are not \u201cavailable to a TRICARE beneficiary where there is third party insurance available to pay the expenses of medical treatment.\u201d <em>Conway, </em>\u00b6 32. <em>Conway </em>supports USAA\u2019s contention that it had an obligation to reimburse TRICARE given TRICARE\u2019s status as a secondary payer.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b617 Third, our conclusion finds additional support in other TRICARE statutes and regulations in effect at the time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The federal statute governing contractor payment of certain claims under TRICARE provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">(a) Payment of claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">(1) The Secretary of Defense may authorize a contractor under the TRICARE program to pay a claim described in paragraph (2) before seeking to recover from a third-party payer the costs incurred by the contractor to provide health care services that are the basis of the claim to a beneficiary under such program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">(2) A claim under this paragraph is a claim\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">(A) that is submitted to the contractor by a provider under the TRICARE program for payment for services for health care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>provided to a covered beneficiary; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">(B) that is identified by the contractor as a claim for which a third-party payer may be liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">(b) Recovery from third-party payers. The United States shall have the same right to collect charges related to claims described in subsection (a) as charges for claims under [10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">(c) Definition of Third-Party Payer. In this section, the term \u201cthird-party payer\u201d has the meaning given that term in [10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095(h)], except that such term excludes primary medical insurers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095b. Federal regulations confirm that \u201c10 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 1095b establishes the statutory obligation of third-party payers to reimburse the United States the costs incurred on behalf of TRICARE beneficiaries who are also covered by the third-party payer\u2019s plan.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.12(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u00b618 In turn, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095 provides that \u201cthe United States shall have the right to collect from a third-party payer reasonable charges for health care services incurred by the United States on behalf of [a person who is a covered beneficiary].\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095(a)(1); <em>accord </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651(a). Section 1095 defines a \u201cthird-party payer\u201d as \u201can entity that provides an insurance, medical service, or health plan by contract or agreement, including an automobile liability insurance or no fault insurance carrier.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095(h)(1). USAA is clearly a \u201cthird-party payer\u201d pursuant to both 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095b(c) and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095(h)(1). These statutes make clear that the United States had \u201cthe right to collect from [USAA] reasonable charges for health care services incurred by the United States on behalf of [Lee].\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095(a)(1); <em>accord </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095b(b); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">\u00b6 19 More, the federal TRICARE regulations provide: \u201cThe only way for a third-party payer to satisfy its obligation under 10 U.S.C. [\u00a7]1095b is to pay the United States or authorized representative of the United States. Payment by a third-party payer to the beneficiary does not satisfy 10 U.S.C. [\u00a7]1095b.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.12(d)(3). The United States\u2019 right to recover costs incurred on behalf of a TRICARE beneficiary \u201cincludes the authority under 10 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 1095(e)(1) for the United States to institute and prosecute legal proceedings against a third-party payer to enforce a right of the United States under 10 U.S.C. [\u00a7]1095b and this section.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.12(g)(1). The United States may also \u201ccompromise, settle or waive a claim\u201d of its right to reimbursement. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.12(g)(2); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">\u00b620 These statutes and regulations, \u201cin effect at the time\u201d of USAA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>negotiations with Lee\u2019s counsel, <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48, obligated USAA to reimburse TRICARE for the costs TRICARE incurred on behalf of Lee. So USAA issuing a settlement check to Lee would \u201cnot satisfy\u201d its statutory obligation. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.12(d)(3). Rather, the only way USAA could meet its obligation to reimburse TRICARE was \u201cto pay the United States or authorized representative of the United States.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.12(d)(3). If USAA did not satisfy its statutory obligation, the United States could \u201cinstitute and prosecute legal proceedings against\u201d USAA to enforce its right to reimbursement. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.12(g)(1); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095(e)(1); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651(d). Based on the plain language of the governing statutes and regulations, we conclude that the District Court incorrectly determined that \u201cthere is no obligation in the TRICARE regulations requiring USAA to protect the government lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b621 Justice Cotter takes issue with our reliance on these statutes and regulations because they were not presented to the District Court, nor to West at the time USAA responded to her demand for policy limits. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 31, 34. USAA\u2019s failure to cite specific statutes and regulations does not mean that those requirements were not part of the \u201clegal landscape as it existed\u201d when USAA conditioned payment of the settlement check upon resolution of the TRICARE liens. <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48. Our role is to assess objectively whether it was reasonable for USAA to condition payment \u2014 i.e., its \u201cproffered defense\u201d \u2014 \u201cin light of <em>that legal landscape.\u201d Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48 (emphasis added). West\u2019s argument, in any event, is that because Lee made an offer to indemnify USAA and Perez, the law did not obligate USAA to address the TRICARE liens before settling Lee\u2019s third-party claim, a position that Justice Cotter does not appear to embrace.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b622 Contrary to West\u2019s argument, neither Lee\u2019s offer to indemnify nor his obligation pursuant to 32 C.F.R. 199.12(h)(3) to \u201ccooperate\u201d with the United States in any reimbursement action by the United States against USAA affects USAA\u2019s statutory obligation to reimburse TRICARE, nor do they impact the United States\u2019 right to recover medical payments-from USAA. Any agreement between Lee\u2019s counsel and USAA would not bind the government or exempt USAA from federal law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\u00b623 The District Court was correct that \u201cthere is no requirement that USAA name TRICARE on Lee\u2019s settlement check.\u201d As the District Court pointed out, if USAA had tendered the settlement check with TRICARE as a payee, the check would not have been negotiable until an authorized government agent endorsed it, and Lee could have been denied the insurance proceeds he was entitled to receive. As the District Court also observed, Lee\u2019s attorney could not have deposited \u201cthe check in his ... IOLTA account until fully endorsed, making it impossible to comply with the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">\u00b624 As the District Court\u2019s order recognized, USAA did not, however, just condition payment of Lee\u2019s settlement on including TRICARE as a payee on the check \u2014 it also gave Lee\u2019s counsel the option of \u201cobtain[ing] waivers of any lien or negotiat[ing] the liens.\u201d USAA also followed up with the government to determine the status of the liens. Federal law expressly provides that the United States may \u201ccompromise, settle or waive a claim\u201d of its right to reimbursement. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.12(g)(2); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095(e)(2). The District Court erred in not considering USAA\u2019s request for lien waiver before concluding that USAA did not have a reasonable basis in law to condition payment of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">\u00b625 Justice Wheat also misses the import of USAA\u2019s alternative offers for resolving the TRICARE liens. In remarking that USAA \u201chad no lawful basis to refuse to settle Lee\u2019s claim based upon the status of TRICARE\u2019s lien,\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 40, Justice Wheat quotes only from the District Court\u2019s observation regarding USAA\u2019s offer to include TRICARE as a settlement check payee. <em>See supra </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14. His conclusion that \u201cUSAA had no legal obligation to protect TRICARE\u2019s lien,\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 40, fails to acknowledge the governing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b626 The District Court properly invoked <em>Freyer </em>as the correct framework for analysis. Applying that framework to determine whether USAA had a reasonable basis in law for contesting Lee\u2019s claim, we have \u201csurvey[ed] the legal landscape <em>as it existed during the relevant time.\u201d Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48 (emphasis added). That landscape compels a conclusion that USAA did have a reasonable basis in law to condition its settlement payment on waiver of the TRICARE lien from the United States. The \u201conly way\u201d for USAA to satisfy its statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>obligation to TRICARE \u2014 -the secondary payer \u2014 was to pay the United States, not to pay Lee. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.12(d)(3); <em>see Conway, </em>\u00b6 32. If USAA had not honored the lien, the United States presumably still could have gone after USAA to enforce its right to reimbursement. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.12(g)(1); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095(e)(1); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651(d). The law \u201cprovided sufficient guidance to signal to a reasonable insurer that its grounds ... were ... meritorious.\u201d <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48. This is especially so given \u201cthe absence of caselaw on point.\u201d <em>See Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48. Accordingly, we hold that USAA\u2019s \u201cgrounds [for conditioning payment] were reasonable under existing law <em>.\u2019\u2019Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"ArM\">\u00b627 Although USAA did not move for summary judgment before the District Court, \u201c[w]e require no cross-motion ... when the moving party had a full and fair opportunity to consider the proposition and all other criteria for summary judgment are met.\u201d <em>Watson v. Dundas, </em>2006 MT 104, \u00b6 30, 322 Mont. 164, 136 P.3d 973 (citing <em>Canal Ins. Co. v. Bunday, </em>249 Mont. 100, 108, 813 P.2d 974, 979 (1991)). West had a full and fair opportunity to argue the law applicable to her bad faith claim, there are no genuine issues of material fact, and USAA is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of West and order it to enter summary judgment in favor of USAA. <em>See Bunday, </em>249 Mont. at 108, 813 P.2d at 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b628 The District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to West is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for entry of judgment in favor of USAA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-9\"> Throughout the case, West has contended that no fact issues exist and that the case presents only questions of law. During oral argument before this Court, counsel for USAA agreed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\"> We are unpersuaded by West\u2019s argument that we cannot consider statutes and regulations that were not cited by USAA in its briefing on summary judgment. Although we generally do not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory, \u201cwe have permitted parties to bolster their preserved issues with additional legal authority or to make further arguments within the scope of the legal theory articulated to the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>2010 MT 193, \u00b6 12, 357 Mont. 348, 239 P.3d 929. TRICARE\u2019s lien rights and USAA\u2019s corresponding obligations were the focus of the legal theory that USAA presented to the trial court. And the District Court is not confined in its summary judgment review \u2014 nor is this Court on appeal \u2014 -to authorities presented in the parties\u2019 briefs. <em>See Junkermier, Clark, Campanella, Stevens, P.C. v. Alborn, Uithoven, Riekenberg, P.C., </em>2016 MT 218, \u00b6 22, 384 Mont. 464, 380 P.3d 747. Besides, as explained above, the District Court erred in its analysis of the legal authority that USAA did present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\"> We note that the State Bar of Montana Ethics Committee recently issued an ethics opinion concluding that an attorney should not agree in a settlement release to personally indemnify an insurer from any lien claims against the settlement proceeds for a plaintiffs medical expenses. M. Bar Ass\u2019n, Ethics Op. 131224 (2013). The opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>notes that \u201c[t]his practice presents a number of professional responsibility challenges\u201d and potentially violates multiple rules under the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct. M. Bar Ass\u2019n, Ethics Op. 131224, at 3-7. Because our resolution of the appeal does not turn on the issue of indemnification, we do not discuss the ethics opinion here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b328-8\">JUSTICE COTTER,</author>\n<p id=\"An9\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\u00b629 I dissent. I begin by reciting significant facts that the Court has omitted from its Opinion. First, USAA consented to Perez entering and filing the consent judgment, and had no objection to the amount of the judgment which does represent actual damages sustained by Lee. In addition, USAA agreed not to raise any policy defenses to preclude Perez from filing the consent judgment. There is therefore no issue of collusion or unreasonableness of the settlement amount before us.</p>\n<p id=\"AIcd\">\u00b630 Second, USAA\u2019s legal theories have been a moving target from the beginning. As addressed below, the legal authorities it relied upon when dealing with West and then presented to the District Court were different than those raised on appeal and upon which the Court now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>relies. In addition, after arguing in its opening brief before this Court that it was required to include TRICARE on the settlement check, USAA asserted in its reply brief that it was <em>not </em>required to include TRICARE as a payee on the settlement check. In short, USAA\u2019s legal arguments have been scattershot. These inconsistencies matter because the sole question before the Court is whether USAA had reasonable grounds under the law at the time it imposed the conditions at issue upon the settlement with West.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\">\u00b631 In a footnote on \u00b6 17, n. 2, the Court rejects West\u2019s argument that we should not consider statutes and regulations that were not cited by USAA in its briefing on summary judgment in the District Court, citing our decision in <em>Junkermier, Clark, Campanella, Stevens, P.C. v. Alborn </em>for the proposition that we are not confined on appeal to authorities that were presented in the parties\u2019 briefs. While that general proposition may be true, it is wholly misplaced in this case because, as the Court states at \u00b6 10, the focal question here is whether the insurer\u2019s grounds for contesting plaintiffs theories were reasonable under existing law <em>at the time it imposed the conditions at issue on the settlement. </em>We must therefore \u201cassess the insurer\u2019s proffered defense\u201d that was presented to West in 2013. <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b632 When it refused to pay the settlement without TRICARE\u2019s name on the check or lien waivers in 2013, USAA did not \u201cproffer a defense\u201d to West premised on 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095 or TRICARE regulation 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199 and its various sub-parts upon which this Court centers its decision. The statute and the regulations were never mentioned to West, and USAA did not cite these statutes and regulations as authority in its briefing before the District Court. These facts compel the inevitable conclusion that USAA did not <em>at the time it conditioned the settlement </em>have reasonable legal grounds under existing law for contesting plaintiffs theories. <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b633 The Court places much emphasis upon USAA\u2019s reference to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651 in its dealings with West and its brief opposing summary judgment before the District Court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651 is a general public health and welfare statute that permits the United States to recover sums paid to persons injured in cases where the injury is the responsibility of a third-party. This statute does not reference TRICARE nor does it contain any provision requiring insurance companies to protect government liens. It is 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095 that addresses medical expenses paid on behalf of members of the military. As 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.12(a)(1) states, \u201c10 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 1095b establishes the statutory obligation of third-party payers to reimburse the United States the costs incurred on behalf of TRICARE beneficiaries.\u201d In point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>of fact, the Court grounds its detailed analysis upon this statute and the supporting regulations set forth in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199, and not upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 17-20, 22, 24, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b634 After extensive review of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095 and 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199 and its subparts, the Court states at \u00b6 20: \u201cBased on the plain language of the governing statutes and regulations, we conclude that the District Court incorrectly determined that \u2018there is no obligation in the TRICARE regulations requiring USAA to protect the government lien.\u2019 \u201d The problem with this conclusion of course is that USAA did not present these statutes and regulations to the District Court for its consideration. The District Court rightly premised its decision upon the authorities submitted by the parties; it was under no obligation to scour the legal landscape to assist USAA. As we have stated, we will generally \u201c \u2018not address either an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory. The basis for the general rule is that it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u2019\u201d <em>Becker v. Rosebud Operating Servs., Inc., </em>2008 MT 285, \u00b6 17, 345 Mont. 368, 191 P.3d 435 (quoting <em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, 961 P.2d 100 (internal citations and quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b635 I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion at \u00b6\u00b6 17 and 21 that because the TRICARE statutes and regulations were part of the existing legal landscape at the time the settlement was in dispute, USAA had a reasonable basis in law to condition the settlement upon resolution of the TRICARE liens. Respectfully, USAA did not know these TRICARE regulations and statute existed when it conditioned the settlement. It stands to reason that in order to have a reasonable basis in law for a position, one must know what the law is.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b636 We err in supplying legal authority for USAA\u2019s defense long after the fact. In a case in which the intent and knowledge of the insurer at the time it conditioned the settlement is dispositive, we have no business providing retroactive support for a decision USAA made three years ago without citing the governing law, and no business providing USAA with a lifeline now premised upon legal authorities it did not present to the District Court. Given the sparse legal authority USAA provided to the District Court in opposition to West\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of West. That is the decision we should be reviewing, not USAA\u2019s decision to present new legal authorities on appeal. I therefore dissent from our decision overturning the District Court\u2019s order and directing the entry of judgment in favor of USAA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>JUSTICE WHEAT joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b331-3\">JUSTICE WHEAT,</author>\n<p id=\"A2E2\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b637 I join the Dissent of Justice Cotter, but provide additional reasons for separating myself from the reasoning of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b638 On December 1, 2012, Peter Lee and three others were injured when Julian Perez, the driver of the car in which they were passengers, caused a high-speed rollover collision. Lee\u2019s injuries were particularly catastrophic. Perez was insured by USAA. Importantly, by mid-December USAA knew without question that Perez\u2019s negligence caused the crash and was absolutely liable for all damages to the injured parties, which would probably exceed policy limits given the extent of the injuries to the parties. More importantly, by this time USAA also knew, or should have known, that TRICARE would be paying some or all of the medical expenses of the injured parties, especially Lee, and would have a subrogation interest in the policy proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b639 On June 4, 2013, the Blewett firm notified USAA that they were representing Lee and that policy limits would be inadequate. On August 21,2013, Blewett offered to settle for policy limits, in exchange for a full release, and placed a 20-day trigger on the offer. On August 28, 2013, USAA agreed by phone to pay, but only if TRICARE was named as a payee or a lien waiver was produced. On September 9, 2013, USAA confirmed its position in writing, and several days later Blewett extended the deadline for settlement and again reiterated a full and final release would be provided to Perez. On October 17,2013, Lee filed suit against Perez, and shortly thereafter Perez, with the assistance of counsel, entered into a consent judgment with Lee to protect himself from an excess judgment. On March 14, 2014, USAA paid policy limits after Lee provided a TRICARE lien waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u00b640 Therefore, by mid-December 2012, USAA knew it was statutorily obligated \u201cto attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlement\u201d of all claims covered by Perez\u2019s policy. Section 33-18-201(6), MCA. At the same time USAA had a duty to defend and protect Perez against any claims and/or judgments resulting from his clear negligence. Additionally, and simultaneously, USAA apparently believed, <em>for its own protection, </em>it was required to protect TRICARE\u2019s subrogation interest. This last conclusion, however, was incorrect. As noted by the Alabama Supreme Court in <em>Mut. Assur., Inc. v. Schulte, </em>970 So. 2d 292 (Ala. 2007), \u201cthe inquiry relevant to a claim alleging bad faith failure to settle is whether the insurer\u2019s failure to settle had any \u2018lawful basis,\u2019 that is, whether the insurer had any \u2018legitimate or arguable reason for failing to pay the claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schulte, </em>970 So. 2nd at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>296 (citations omitted). In the case before us, the District Court, based upon the arguments presented to it as discussed in Justice Cotter\u2019s Dissent, concluded that USAA\u2019s \u201cunilateral decision\u201d to protect TRICARE\u2019s lien, was \u201cwithout support in statute, regulation, or common law.\u201d In other words, USAA had no legal obligation to protect TRICARE\u2019s lien; consequently, it had no lawful basis to refuse to settle Lee\u2019s claim based upon the status of TRICARE\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b641 Moreover, if TRICARE\u2019s lien status posed significant problems to USAA\u2019s settlement determination, upon USAA\u2019s realization of its obligation to settle Perez\u2019s claim, it should have undertaken actions in December 2012 to insure that TRICARE\u2019s subrogation interest would not hinder settlement rather than delaying settlement and imposing the obligation to obtain a TRICARE lien waiver on Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b642 Under these facts, I submit that USAA violated its obligations to its insured and to the injured parties to exercise good faith to enter into a prompt, fair and equitable settlement. Instead, it delayed until a demand was made and then unilaterally imposed a requirement that TRICARE be named as a co-payee or that Lee obtain a lien release, equally for its own benefit and protection, even though Lee\u2019s attorneys offered to fully release and indemnify both USAA and Perez. At the expense of Perez and Lee, USAA demanded that Lee\u2019s attorneys agree to protect USAA, when USAA did nothing to protect itself, and was obligated to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b643 For these reasons and the reasons expressed by Justice Cotter, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
