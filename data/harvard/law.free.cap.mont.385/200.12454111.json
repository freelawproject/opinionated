Cruson. We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b62 <em>Did the Human Rights Commission err by determining that the Hearing Examiner improperly granted summary judgment to </em>MEC?</p>\n<p id=\"ahx-dedup-0\">\u00b63 We affirm the Commission\u2019s decision and remand this matter to the Hearing Examiner for further proceedings. The facts cited below are drawn from the record as it exists for summary judgment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b64 In 2011, MEC and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 44 (Union), as authorized by their collective bargaining agreement (CBA), entered into an Apprenticeship Standards for Electrical Lineman Agreement (Agreement), which was in full force and effect at all times relevant to this litigation. The Agreement governed the selection and training of apprentice linemen, and the administration of the apprenticeship program, for the Union, MEC, and MEC\u2019s employees. The Agreement created the Joint Apprentice Training Committee (JATC), which is the entity responsible for selecting and training apprentice linemen. As provided in the Agreement and CBA, the JATC is composed of four people, two selected by MEC and two selected by the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b65 The JATC, as established by MEC and the Union, is responsible for screening, recommending, and training apprentice linemen. Prospective linemen for each apprenticeship are interviewed by the JATC, which recommends a candidate for MEC\u2019s approval. Approved candidates then receive training by the JATC. If a candidate is not approved by MEC, then the JATC begins the process again to select and present another candidate. The Agreement and the CBA grant to the JATC duties in the process of selecting and training linemen that are to be exercised independently from the Union and MEC.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u00b66 Cruson was employed by MEC as a Master Electrician from 2001 until 2013. In 2012, MEC created a new apprentice lineman position. Cruson applied for this position and was interviewed by the JATC, along with other applicants. At the time, all of the JATC members were supervisory or managerial level MEC employees, including: 1) an Area Foreman; 2) the Operations Manager; 3) the Manager of Engineering; and 4) a Crew Foreman. Cindy Woods, an employee of MEC, also attended and participated in the interviews. An agency investigative report described Woods as the \u201cpayroll/benefits administrator\u201d for MEC, and Mark Hayden, MEC\u2019s General Manager, described Woods, in his deposition, as \u201cthe HR person for MEC.\u201d Upon completion of its interview process, the JATC selected another individual as its first choice for the apprenticeship and made this recommendation to MEC, while Cruson and two other employees, of similar age, were ranked in a three-way tie for second place. MEC did not approve the candidate recommended by the JATC, and no one was initially hired for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b67 Cruson inquired and was informed by Hayden that there were no qualified candidates for the position. Cruson, along with the two other employees, in the three-way tie, lodged a grievance with the Union, asserting age discrimination in the hiring process. The discrimination claims were based on statements allegedly made by members of the JATC expressing negative views about hiring older candidates. One member remarked that an older candidate\u2019s application \u201cwas a waste of [his] time,\u201d and that the older candidate \u201cshould have applied for [the position] years ago when [he] was younger.\u201d A second member said he \u201cwould never hire an apprentice lineman who was older\u201d because he would not get his \u201cmoney\u2019s worth out of [the apprentice] for all that training,\u201d or other words to that effect. The Union did not pursue a grievance over the matter, and Cruson and the other two candidates filed complaints against MEC with the Montana Human Rights Bureau, alleging age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b68 A Human Rights Bureau Investigator issued \u201creasonable cause findings\u201d in favor of Cruson and Greg Flesch, one of the other older candidates. After the findings were issued, MEC ordered the JATC to reconvene and recommend either Cruson or Flesch for the apprenticeship position. The JATC selected Cruson and MEC offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>him the position. However, Cruson declined the offer, claiming MEC\u2019s management had stated he would not be supported by management or the other linemen, and instead elected to continue to pursue his age discrimination complaint, naming only MEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b69 In the proceeding, MEC moved for summary judgment on the claim, arguing that the JATC, whose members\u2019 statements formed the basis of Cruson\u2019s claim, was not an agent of MEC, but a separate and independent entity over which it had no control. The Hearing Examiner granted MEC\u2019s motion, noting the JATC acted independently of MEC and \u201c[tjhere is no material and substantial evidence that [the] JATC was an agent of MEC[]. Cruson did not make any claims against [the] JATC. As a matter of law, Cruson cannot prove a case against MEC. His complaint must be dismissed in its entirety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b610 Cruson appealed to the Commission, which overturned its Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision, concluding the \u201cfacts presented by the hearings officer in the Order do not support the legal conclusion that there is no agency relationship between [MEC] and the [JATC].\u201d The Commission\u2019s order remanded the matter to the Hearing Examiner for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b611 MEC appealed to the District Court, which held the Commission properly reversed the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision because Cruson had presented evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact about whether the JATC was acting as an agent of MEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b612 MEC appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">\u00b613 An agency\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed to determine if they are correct. This same standard of review is applicable to both the district court\u2019s review of the administrative decision and our subsequent review of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Pennaco Energy, Inc. v. Mont. Bd. of Envtl. Review, </em>2008 MT 425, \u00b6 18, 347 Mont. 415, 199 P.3d 191 (citing <em>Indian Health Bd. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Labor </em>, 2008 MT 48, \u00b6 11, 341 Mont. 411, 177 P.3d 1029).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">\u00b614 The standard of review for agency decisions under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act, in relevant part, states: \u201cThe court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings....\u201d Section 2-4-704(2), MCA; <em>Hofer v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Health and Human </em>Servs., 2005 MT 302, \u00b6 12, 329 Mont. 368, 124 P.3d 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">\u00b615 Here, we examine the Commission\u2019s reversal of the Hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Examiner\u2019s granting of summary judgment. We consider summary judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56, and review the Commission\u2019s final agency decision <em>de novo. </em>Summary judgment is an extreme remedy that should be granted only when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hajenga v. Schwein, </em>2007 MT 80, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 507, 155 P.3d 1241 (citing Lee <em>v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>2001 MT 59, \u00b6 25, 304 Mont. 356, 22 P.3d 631). Under Rule 56, an agency should render a judgment \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); Roe <em>v. City of Missoula, </em>2009 MT 417, \u00b6 14, 354 Mont. 1, 221 P.3d 1200 (citing <em>Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Ctr., </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6 24, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111). The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of establishing both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Roe, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25). If the moving party meets this burden, then the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to establish that a genuine issue of material fact does exist. <em>Roe, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b616 <em>Did the Commission err by determining that the Hearing Examiner improperly granted summary judgment to </em>MEC?</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b617 MEC argues that MEC and the JATC operate independently of each other and there is no agency relationship between the two. MEC argues the lack of evidence to the contrary requires a determination that summary judgment on the claim was properly entered. Cruson answers that an agency relationship exists because MEC conferred authority to the JATC to conduct candidate selection and training for the benefit of MEC and, further, MEC exerted actual control over the JATC. Cruson argues his age discrimination complaint is properly filed against MEC because it is the principal in an agency relationship with the JATC.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b618 During the Commission hearing, Commissioner Sheri Sprigg listed several facts that could support an agency relationship between MEC and the JATC, including: 1) the JATC was created by MEC; 2) the JATC had no purpose other than to review applications for MEC; 3) all JATC members were MEC employees; 4) the JATC had no assets or staff of its own; 5) MEC\u2019s human resource person participated in meetings of the JATC; 6) the JATC was known by MEC employees as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u201cthe hiring committee\u201d; and 7) MEC reconvened the JATC to conduct a follow-up selection meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b619 Apprenticeship agreements are the product of statute and are generally governed by Title 39, chapter 6, MCA. Apprenticeship agreements are \u201ca written agreement between an employer or an association of employers and an organization of employees describing conditions of employment for apprentices.\u201d Section 39-6-105(l)(b), MCA. The Agreement in this case was entered between MEC and the Union. It authorized the creation of a joint apprenticeship training committee and outlined the general powers and duties of the JATC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqc-dedup-0\">The Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee established under these Standards shall be the sole administrative body for the apprenticeship and training program outlined in these Standards. The Committee shall have full authority and responsibility to install, regulate, supervise, control and operate the apprenticeship program and shall have complete authority to establish and enforce rules and requirements governing the qualifications, education, training, selection, and supervision of apprentices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b620 Many of the factual assertions offered by Cruson as indicative of an agency relationship are nothing more than inherent characteristics of the typical structure and organization of a joint apprenticeship committee, as the Hearing Examiner correctly reasoned. While MEC had a hand in \u201ccreating\u201d the JATC at issue here, MEC\u2019s involvement was not unilateral. The JATC was created only after joint action by MEC in cooperation with the Union, pursuant to the CBA. The fact that the JATC was referred to as \u201cthe hiring committee\u201d or as the \u201cMEC JATC\u201d is mere nomenclature or slang and provides no material evidence of an agency relationship. The assertion that the JATC \u201cworked for\u201d MEC or had no other purpose than to screen applicants for MEC contradicts the Agreement and the CBA, which clearly demonstrate the JATC was designed to serve MEC, the Union, and employees seeking to advance their careers by entering the apprenticeship program. Indeed, as noted by the Hearing Examiner, under the governing agreements, MEC did not have control over which candidates would be recommended for apprenticeship positions. That all members of the JATC were employees of MEC and that they all held supervisory positions are, likewise, functions of the governing agreements: the JATC provides services for employees of MEC, and the people serving on the JATC are selected by MEC\u2019s management and the Union. If Cruson did not like who was selected by the Union to serve on the JATC, he should have taken that up with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u00b621 However, there are several factual assertions which, when taken together, could demonstrate that, despite the governing agreements, MEC was exercising influence over the JATC in a way indicative of an agency relationship that would preclude summary judgment on the issue. First, Woods, a human resources representative of MEC, participated in the interviews and the applicant scoring process. Although Woods\u2019 scoring of the applicants apparently was not included in the JATC\u2019s final totals, her presence and participation signified an enhanced influence over the process by MEC not contemplated by the governing agreements. Because of a doctor\u2019s appointment, Woods did not also participate in the JATC\u2019s final selection meeting, about which Hayden stated in his deposition that \u201c[Woods] had a doctor\u2019s appointment, couldn\u2019t attend, but I wanted to get [the selection] meeting in before [Labor Day Weekend].\u201d Hayden\u2019s statement itself provides an indication that MEC was exercising influence over at least the timing of the JATC\u2019s selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b622 Second, after the \u201creasonable cause findings\u201d were issued by the Human Rights Bureau Investigator, MEC ordered the JATC to reconvene and select either Cruson or Flesch for the open apprenticeship. Flesch testified, in his deposition, that normally when the JATC\u2019s recommended apprentice candidate was not approved, then the position was reopened and the process began anew. However, here MEC ordered the JATC to choose either Cruson or Flesch, two of the three individuals who had tied for second place during the initial interview process. This conclusion is supported by the deposition testimony of Nick Labbe, a JATC committee member. Labbe testified the sole purpose for reconvening the JATC was to make a selection between Cruson and Flesch, and no other candidates were considered. Finally, the record indicates that it had been made known to the JATC that Cruson was MEC\u2019s preferred candidate, influencing his ultimate selection by the JATC.</p>\n<p id=\"ako-dedup-1\">\u00b623  Summary judgment \u201cis an extreme remedy that should be granted only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Hajenga, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 25). While we take no position on the merits of Cruson\u2019s claim, we agree with the Commission that for purposes of summary judgment, Cruson has met his burden to demonstrate issues of material fact about his contention that MEC was exerting control over the JATC such that the JATC was acting as MEC\u2019s agent. Consequently, the Commission did not err in reversing the entry of summary judgment, and remanding this matter for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>proceedings on Cruson\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court correctly affirmed the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b624 Affirmed and remanded to the Hearing Examiner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b233-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\"> The Agreement provided that the JATC would <em>\u201c[e]nsure that the employer </em>provides the Apprentices with reasonably continuous employment and training during the term of the Apprenticeship, including diversified training in all major work experience ofthe trade.\u201d It provided that JATC would \u201c[e]nsure that [the] Apprenticeship standards are kept up-to-date and that the Standards meet the requirements of the trade at all times and to supervise the enforcement of all provisions of the standards. The employer may modify these standards at any time <em>by the recommendation of [the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>JATC].\u201d </em>Lastly, it also provided that \u201c[t]he JATC will have full authority to supervise the enforcement of these Standards.
