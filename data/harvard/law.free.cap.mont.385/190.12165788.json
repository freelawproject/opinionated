Nolan appealed to the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, arguing that the victim\u2019s in-court identification was impermissibly suggestive and unreliable. Nolan also argued that Officer Boeckel\u2019s testimony regarding vehicle registration information received from dispatch was hearsay and inadmissible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court, confining its review to the record and questions of law, denied Nolan\u2019s appeal. Nolan appeals the District Court\u2019s order and reinstatement of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b62 Nolan presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\n<em>1. Whether the trial court erred in allowing the victim\u2019s in-court identification of Nolan at trial.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">\n<em>2. Whether the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted testimony concerning vehicle registration information received from police dispatch.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">\u00b63 On June 20, 2013, Beth Jones was driving west on Rimrock Road in Billings in her red Dodge Charger. Her daughter, Emily, was in the passenger seat. As they turned left onto Rimrock Road, a white car was turning right and honked at them. Beth saw the car take a sudden U-turn and begin traveling in the same direction as she was. Using the center turn lane, the white car sped up to the Jones\u2019 vehicle. The white car then pulled even with the Jones\u2019 vehicle and the driver yelled at Beth, \u201cYou\u2019re a dead bitch.\u201d The driver yelled this twice. Beth and Emily identified the white car as a four door Cadillac.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">\u00b64 Beth attempted to flee from the Cadillac by speeding up and slowing down erratically. The driver of the Cadillac cut her off and nearly hit Beth\u2019s vehicle several times with his vehicle. Beth honked at other drivers to alert them that she needed help. Beth drove between fifty and seventy miles per hour trying to get away from the Cadillac. Finally, Beth was able to lose the Cadillac by taking a sharp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>right turn onto a side street. Beth and Emily testified that they were terrified of the driver and thought he was coming after them to hijack their car, hurt them, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b65 Once they had escaped, Emily called 911 and reported the incident. They described the driver of the white Cadillac as a black male, with short hair, no facial hair, and wearing a white tank-top. During the 911 call Emily and Beth can be heard responding to the emergency operator\u2019s questions. Neither Emily nor Beth was able to get the license plate number of the white Cadillac. Emily estimated the age of the driver to be late twenties or early thirties. Beth interjected that, \u201cHe was young.\u201d As Beth and Emily were parked and speaking to the operator, Beth said the Cadillac just drove by heading east on Rimrock Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b66 Jason Jessen (Jessen) was also driving westbound on Rimrock Road and in his rearview mirror he observed a woman driving a red Charger approaching him at a high rate of speed. Jessen noticed the woman honking and waving and saw she was being chased by a man driving a white Cadillac. Jessen pulled to the side of the road to allow the Charger to pass. He observed that the Cadillac was causing oncoming traffic to pull over to avoid a collision. Jessen stated the Cadillac was driving erratically and swerving intentionally to hit the red Charger. Jessen called 911 and reported what he had seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b67 Officer Jeremy Boeckel (Officer Boeckel) of the Billings Police Department heard dispatch report that two cars, a red Charger and a white Cadillac, were racing down Rimrock Road. While driving westbound on Rimrock Road, Officer Boeckel saw a white, four-door Cadillac traveling eastbound. Officer Boeckel, who was able to observe the driver as the Cadillac passed, described the driver as a black male wearing a white tank-top, with short black hair. Officer Boeckel confirmed the description of the vehicle and driver with dispatch as the vehicle involved in the 911 call. Officer Boeckel turned around and activated his lights and siren. For thirteen blocks, the driver continued to drive leisurely, ignoring the sirens, lights, and the addition of other patrol vehicles. During the pursuit dispatch relayed to Officer Boeckel that the Cadillac\u2019s plates came back registered to Sherry Nolan. Officer Boeckel eventually suspended his pursuit upon instructions from his supervising officer and Billings Police Department Policy that officers are not allowed to pursue offenders for traffic offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u00b68 Officer Boeckel continued his investigation that day by taking statements from Beth and Emily Jones, Jessen, and talking to other Billing Police Department Officers. After speaking with other officers, Officer Boeckel learned that Nolan frequently drove a white Cadillac. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Officer Boeckel viewed a photograph of Nolan and confirmed that the photograph was of the same person that Officer Boeckel had observed driving the Cadillac during the pursuit. Officer Boeckel did not ask Beth or Emily to do a photo lineup, because he was confident of his identification of Nolan based on his own observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b69 Nolan was subsequently charged with reckless driving and failing to yield to an emergency vehicle. On March 20, 2014, Nolan\u2019s jury trial began in Municipal Court. On the morning of trial, Nolan notified the Municipal Court of his hearsay objection to Officer Boeckel\u2019s expected testimony regarding information from dispatch as to whom the Cadillac was registered. The court reserved its ruling for trial. Nolan also raised objections that he would be the only black male in the courtroom and that he would be seated next to defense counsel at the table for the defendant. The judge replied, \u201c[TJhere\u2019s nothing I can do about it. What do you want me to do? Get three more defendants in here... that are black?\u201d Although Nolan said he did not want any more persons who were black to be brought into the courtroom, he continued to maintain his objection that any identification would be impermissibly suggestive and unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b610 The State called four witnesses at trial: Emily and Beth Jones, Jessen, and Officer Boeckel. Neither Jessen nor Emily identified the driver of the Cadillac during their testimony. When Beth identified Nolan at trial, she testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">CITY: [When the Cadillac made the U-turn], did you get a look at the driver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">BETH: I got a brief look at him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">CITY: And what did he look like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">BETH: He looked like a black male in his maybe late 20\u2019s, mid-30s, somewhere around there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAy7\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">CITY: After the initial time that you\u2019d seen him, um, turn right as you were exiting MSU-B, um, did you ever get the opportunity to see his face while this chase was going on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-11\">BETH: Every time he\u2019d pull up next to me and blocked me in ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At-\">CITY: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-12\">BETH:... I would see his face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-13\">CITY: Okay, and do you have any way to identify him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-14\">BETH: He was a black male that looked like the gentleman sitting over there in the tie and the maroon shirt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-15\">CITY: Okay, and why do you say it looks like him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-16\">BETH: Because that\u2019s what he looked like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-17\">DEFENSE: Your honor, I would object to [this in-court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>identification] ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">CITY: Does he look any different today than the way you recalled him from back in June?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">BETH: Mmm, other than his clothing, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b611 Beth admitted that she could not tell, at the time of the incident, whether the driver was clean shaven or not. When she was questioned about her use of the word \u201cyoung\u201d to describe the driver during the 911 call she explained, \u201cI just meant he was younger than me.\u201d However, later when asked what she thought \u201cyoung\u201d meant, Beth said it meant a teenager.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\u00b612 Officer Boeckel testified that the Cadillac he observed Nolan driving was registered to Sherry Nolan and explained that he had received the registration information from dispatch in response to the license plate information he had supplied. Defense Counsel objected and the court overruled the objection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\u00b613 The jury convicted Nolan of both offences. Nolan appealed his conviction to the District Court on the basis that the in-court identification by Beth was impermissibly suggestive and unreliable, and that the testimony regarding information received from dispatch was hearsay. The District Court denied both claims. Nolan appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">\u00b614 On Nolan\u2019s appeal from the Municipal Court, the District Court functioned as an intermediate appellate court. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-5-303 and 3-6-110, MCA. On Nolan\u2019s appeal to this Court, we review the case as if the appeal originally had been filed in this Court. <em>City of Bozeman v. Cantu, </em>2013 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 369 Mont. 81, 296 P.3d 461; <em>State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 276, 272 <em>P.3d 646 (citing Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 26, 334 Mont. 489, 148 P.3d 643). We examine the record independently of the district court\u2019s decision, applying the appropriate standard of review. <em>Ellison, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">\u00b615 We treat a motion to exclude an eyewitness\u2019 identification as a motion to suppress. <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>2003 MT 346, \u00b6 11, 318 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>489, 81 P.3d 488. Our standard of review for a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and whether those findings are correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>Baldwin, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b616 Evidentiary rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2013 MT 50, \u00b6 14, 369 Mont. 165, 296 P.3d 1149. Atrial court abuses its discretion when it \u201cacts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>\u00b6 14. To the extent that the court\u2019s ruling is based on an interpretation of an evidentiary rule or statute, our review is de novo. <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u00b617 <em>1. Whether the trial court erred in allowing the victim\u2019s in-court identification of Nolan at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b618 Nolan argues that Beth\u2019s in-court identification of him was impermissibly suggestive and unreliable. Although the issue raised here concerns an in-court identification where no pre-trial identification was made, we deem the considerations and analysis the same when determining whether evidence of the identification was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\u00b619 A defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process bars the admission of evidence derived from suggestive identification procedures where there is a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. <em>State v. Lally, </em>2008 MT 452, \u00b6 15, 348 Mont 59, 199 P.3d 818 (citing <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 196-98, 93 S.Ct. 375, 380-81 (1972)). We apply a two-step process for determining whether evidence of an identification is admissible. First, we examine whether the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive. Second, if the procedure was impermissibly suggestive, we must consider several factors for determining whether the identification is nevertheless reliable under the totality of the circumstances. A defendant must establish both that the identification was impermissibly suggestive and that it was unreliable. <em>Lally, </em>\u00b6 15. <em>See Biggers, </em>409 U.S. at 198-99, 93 S.Ct. at 381-82; <em>Baldwin, </em>2003 MT 346, \u00b6 14; <em>State v. DuBray, </em>2003 MT 255, \u00b6 58, 317 Mont. 377, 77 P.3d 247; <em>State v. Bingman, </em>2002 MT 350, \u00b6 21, 313 Mont. 376, 61 P.3d 153. We first consider whether Beth Jones\u2019 identification testimony was impermissibly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\u00b620 A procedure is unnecessarily suggestive if a positive identification is likely to result from factors other than the witness\u2019s own recollection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>of the crime. <em>United States v. Greene, </em>704 F.3d 298, 306 (4th Cir. 2013). We have recognized that a \u201c \u2018show-up\u2019 identification requiring a \u2018yes or no\u2019 answer is a far less desirable situation than positively picking out a person from an anonymous line-up.\u201d <em>State v. Rudolph, </em>238 Mont. 135, 141, 777 P.2d 296, 300 (1989). As we cautioned in <em>Campbell, </em>\u201claw enforcement agencies [are] ill advised to rely solely on one-to-one showups in identifying suspects with a crime.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell, </em>219 Mont. 194, 201, 711 P.2d 1357, 1362 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1127, 106 S.Ct. 1654.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b621 Nolan, the only black person in the courtroom, was seated at the defense table next to defense counsel when Beth Jones identified him. There was little question that Nolan was the accused and the person that the State and law enforcement suspected of committing the criminal offenses. Under these circumstances, and in the absence of a pre-trial identification, Jones\u2019 identification of Nolan in-court amounted to a \u201cshow-up\u201d or \u201cone-to-one\u201d identification, which this Court has condoned on several occasions. <em>See State v. Schoffner, </em>248 Mont. 260, 266-67, 811 P.2d 548, 552-53 (1991); <em>Campbell, </em>219 Mont. at 200, 177 P.2d at 1361; <em>State </em>v. <em>Higley, </em>1990 Mont. 412, 421, 621 P.2d 1043, 1049 (1980). The Second Circuit has found that when a defendant was the only black person in the courtroom, and was seated at the defense table, the in-court identification by three witnesses were \u201cso clearly suggestive as to be impermissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Archibald, </em>734 F.2d 938, 942-43 (2d Cir. 1984). \u201cAny witness, especially one who has watched trials on television, can determine which of the individuals in the courtroom is the defendant, which is the defense lawyer, and which is the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Archibald, </em>734 F.2d at 941. The court in <em>Archibald, </em>however, ultimately found that the presence of other factors guaranteed the reliability of the in-court identification and that any error was harmless because the witness had also identified the defendant in photo arrays prior to trial. <em>Archibald, </em>734 F.2d at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b622 While we recognize that it is a common practice for an identification to be made in court of the defendant, under the circumstances here, and when the defendant has never been previously identified by the victim, we conclude the in-court identification of Nolan was impermissibly suggestive. Nolan was the only black man in the courtroom; he was the defendant; he was seated next to defense counsel; he was seated at the defense table; and the suspect of the crime was a black male. Further, although the identification made by Jones may not have been in response to a specific question by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>prosecutor, we cannot ignore that Jones\u2019 identification of Nolan was critical to the State\u2019s case. Officer Boeckel\u2019s pre-trial identification did not place Nolan at the scene of the offense and only identified Nolan as the driver of a white Cadillac following commission of the offense. We conclude that the circumstances of the in-court identification were unnecessarily suggestive and that Beth\u2019s identification likely could have resulted from factors other than her own recollection of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"A3ok\">\u00b623 Under the second prong, we must determine whether, under the totality of circumstances, the in-court identification gave rise to a \u201csubstantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Schoffner, </em>248 Mont. at 266, 811 P.2d at 552. <em>Biggers </em>sets forth five factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification: (1) the opportunity for the witness to view the suspect defendant at the time of the crime; (2) the witness\u2019 degree of attention at the time; (3) the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the suspect defendant; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the time of identification; and (5) the length of time between the crime and the time of identification. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. at 199-200, 93 S.Ct. at 382; <em>Lally, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Baldwin, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b624 Beth had ample opportunity to observe Nolan. She observed Nolan in the middle of the day when the weather was clear and sunny. Beth had her driver\u2019s window down and Nolan\u2019s passenger window was down. No one was seated in the passenger seat of Nolan\u2019s car who could have obstructed Beth\u2019s view of Nolan as he pulled up next to her, and twice yelled she was \u201ca dead bitch.\u201d Nolan positioned his vehicle close enough to nearly hit Beth\u2019s vehicle several times. The incident lasted several minutes and Beth and Emily provided the dispatcher with a description of Nolan immediately. Beth testified that she recalled the events of June 30, 2013 \u201cvery well.\u201d She was terrified and believed Nolan was crazy and wanted to either hijack the car, shoot her and Emily, or both. Beth described the color and make of Nolan\u2019s vehicle and the sex, gender, race, and clothing of Nolan. Beth\u2019s description of Nolan and his vehicle were corroborated by not only Emily, but by the subsequent observations of Officer Boeckel just moments later. Beth testified she was certain about her description and identification of Nolan. During direct and cross examination of Beth there was no evidence suggesting she hesitated in her identification of Nolan. Although the length of time between the offense and trial approached nine months, potentially indicating the identification would be less reliable, we do not find the length of time dispositive when viewed in the context of the other <em>Biggers </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"A4s\">\u00b625 Considering the totality of circumstances, we hold that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>although impermissibly suggestive, the in-court identification did not create a substantial likelihood of misidentification. Although the District Court did not specifically apply the <em>Biggers </em>factors, it did determine that the identification was \u201cnot impermissibly suggestive\u201d and \u201cdid not give rise to any mis-identification [sic].\u201d While the District Court erred in finding the in-court identification was not impermissibly suggestive, it correctly determined that the identification was nonetheless reliable. We will affirm a district court when it has reached the right result, even if it has applied the wrong rationale. <em>State v. Betterman, </em>2015 MT 39, \u00b6 11, 378 Mont. 182, 342 P.3d 971.</p>\n<p id=\"ALV2\">\u00b626 <em>2. Whether the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted testimony concerning vehicle registration information received from police dispatch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b627 Nolan argues that the information Officer Boeckel received from dispatch concerning the Cadillac\u2019s registered owner was hearsay which does not fall within any exception allowing for its admission. When Nolan appealed his conviction to the District Court, Nolan argued any testimony that Sherry Nolan was the Cadillac\u2019s registered owner was inadmissible because the custodian of records for the Department of Motor Vehicles did not lay a proper foundation for the business records exception to apply. <em>State v. Wurtz, </em>195 Mont. 226, 238, 636 P.2d 246, 252 (1981). The State maintains that Officer Boeckel\u2019s statements were not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"AH9o\">\u00b628 \u201cHearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d M. R. Evid. 801(c); <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>2008 MT 27, \u00b6 17, 341 Mont. 240, 177 P.3d 444. \u201cA statement is hearsay \u2018only when the immediate inference the proponent wants to draw is the truth of the assertion on the statement\u2019s face. If the proponent can demonstrate that the statement is logically relevant on any other theory, the statement is nonhearsay.\u2019 \u201d <em>Siebken v. Voderberg, </em>2015 MT 296, \u00b6 22, 381 Mont. 256, 359 P.3d 1073, (citing Edward J. Imwinkelried, Evidentiary Foundations, 153 (1980)); <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 19. Officer Boeckel\u2019s testimony that the Cadillac was registered to Sherry Nolan was not offered to prove the truth of the matter; that is, that the car was registered to Sherry Nolan. The intent of the statement was to explain how Officer Boeckel proceeded with the investigation and how he came to positively identify Nolan from a prior booking photo. \u201c[A] statement offered for the purpose of showing that the statement was made and the resulting state of mind is properly admitted.\u201d <em>Voderberg, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>Moats Trucking v. Gallatin Dairies, </em>231 Mont. 474, 479, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>753 P.2d 883, 886 (1988)); <em>Cartwright v. Scheels All Sports, </em>2013 MT 158, \u00b6 50, 370 Mont. 369, 310 P.3d 1080 (citing <em>Murray v. Talmage, </em>2006 MT 340, \u00b6 13, 335 Mont. 155, 151 P.3d 49). The statement was not offered to prove the registered owner of the Cadillac but, rather, to demonstrate how Officer Boeckel came to positively identify Nolan. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the information related to Officer Boeckel from dispatch regarding the registered owner of the Cadillac was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b629 The District Court\u2019s order affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and Nolan\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-12\"> Nolan raised a speedy trial claim in the District Court, but has not pursued it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b220-13\"> Nolan asserts that Officer Boeckel\u2019s testimony concerning information received from other officers that Nolan was known to drive a white Cadillac was also inadmissible hearsay.
