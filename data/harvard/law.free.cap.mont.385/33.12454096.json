We affirm, considering the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\"><em>1. Did the Commission apply the correct legal standard in reviewing NorthWestern\u2019s claim for excess outage </em>costs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-13\"><em>2. Were the \u201cfree ridership\u201dand \u201cspillover\u201dcalculations adopted by the Commission supported by substantial </em>evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b60-16\">\u00b62 This matter involves a challenge to the Commission\u2019s Final Order in NorthWestern\u2019s 2011-2012 annual tracker filing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therein, Northwestern requested, <em>inter alia, </em>a $1,419,427 increase in rates for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>unexpected electricity supply costs due to an outage at its Dave Gates Generating Station (DGGS), located near Anaconda.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As part of the proceeding, the Commission also ordered Northwestern to present evidence for purposes of conducting a \u201ctrue-up\u201d to actual costs for lost revenues that had been previously estimated in NorthWestern\u2019s demand-side management (DSM) programs. Ultimately, the Commission (1) denied NorthWestern\u2019s request to include the DGGS outage costs in customer rates, and (2) rejected NorthWestern\u2019s expert\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cfree ridership\u201d and \u201cspillover\u201d values of its DSM programs were perfectly offsetting, adopting instead the same expert\u2019s actual calculations used in a draft report.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">DGGS Outage Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b63 In 2008, Northwestern sought Commission approval to build the DGGS. The DGGS was intended to provide regulation and frequency response service in NorthWestern\u2019s service area. The Commission approved the project in 2009, and the DGGS commenced commercial operation on January 1, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u00b64 The DGGS was a first-of-its-kind facility that Northwestern presented as having \u201cthe potential to be a model facility for the supply of regulation service.\u201d It consisted of three generation units made by Pratt &amp; Whitney Power Systems, Inc. (PWPS) and was an application of a simple cycle natural gas turbine generator designed to increase or decrease generation (ramp) in response to variations in NorthWestern\u2019s load, \u201con a moment-by-moment basis.\u201dNorthWestern\u2019s General Manager of Generation testified that the plant had a \u201cvery unique\u201d control mechanism and \u201cearly on we knew that the plant was going to have a very unique control application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\u00b65 Northwestern was aware that the ramp capabilities of the DGGS were critical to its operation and that the DGGS was a first-of-its-kind application, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">[The DGGS] is one of the first power plant installations to be built specifically for electrical transmission grid regulation duty. The design requirements for grid regulation are stringent since they require the plant to continually change load in a short time frame (seconds to minutes).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">This load requirement was necessary because Northwestern \u201canticipated variable operating conditions,\u201d largely due to wind generation variations, and the DGGS needed to be able to ramp up or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>down by at least 15 mega-watts (MW) per minute per unit to \u201coffset the continuous variation between system generation and system load.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ab2s\">\u00b66 The contract between Northwestern and PWPS included a waiver of consequential damages, but Northwestern purchased, with customer revenue, an extended warranty to cover the innovative technology. Northwestern did not purchase or evaluate the feasibility of outage insurance in case the DGGS had an operational failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b67 On January 31, 2012, thirteen months after Northwestern brought the DGGS online, it suffered a complete outage. Unit cycling had caused \u201cthermal stresses\u201d by going from a cold state to a very high temperature, damaging the rotating equipment. PWPS concluded the outage resulted from ramp rates \u201cmuch greater\u201d than anticipated, excessive temperatures, and cycle-related hardware failures. The Commission was unable to precisely examine the ramp data because Northwestern failed to maintain minute-by-minute records.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b68 Pursuant to the extended warranty, PWPS repaired the damaged turbines at its cost, including removal, installation, and shipping costs. However, due to the waiver of consequential damages in the contract, PWPS was not obligated to cover the costs associated with purchasing replacement regulation service during the outage. On February 3, 2012, Northwestern began purchasing replacement service from Powerex Corp. (Powerex) and Avista Corp. (Avista). PWPS took \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to repair the DGGS as soon as possible. Individual generators were put back online as PWPS restored them and Northwestern proportionally decreased its regulation service purchases accordingly. The DGGS was fully back online on May 1, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b69 During the outage, Northwestern customers continued to pay the fixed costs for the operation of the DGGS ($6,742,625), including NorthWestern\u2019s usual rate of return, as well as the variable costs ($1,527,714) Northwestern did not actually incur, but would have incurred had the plant been operational. However, the outage caused Northwestern to incur an additional $1,419,427 in charges to Powerex and Avista for regulation service. Northwestern requested reimbursement of these costs, arguing they were reasonably incurred because it obtained an extended warranty that covered all repairs, it purchased regulation service on the competitive market at 2011 rates, it structured its regulation market purchases to enable it to incrementally reduce the purchases as generators were repaired, and it had worked quickly to get the DGGS back online.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u00b610 The Montana Consumer Counsel (MCC) opposed reimbursement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>of the replacement service costs, contending that Northwestern failed to undertake risk mitigation by failing to investigate whether outage insurance was available. The MCC offered the testimony of Dr. John Wilson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\">No. I don\u2019t fault the company for not procuring it [outage insurance]. What I think was imprudent was not looking into it, not evaluating it, not finding out whether it was available and what the cost would be for a plan like this. I think you have to do that before you make a determination as to whether you acquire it or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The MCC argued that evaluation of insurance was fundamental to risk management where the contract contained an exclusion for consequential damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">[T]he most imprudent thing that occurred here, is the failure of the company to take steps to protect itself against the outage, given the fact that they had this exclusion under the warranty, given the fact that they knew ... that there were unknowns about this plant and where it was going to go and how it was going to operate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b611 Northwestern responded by providing evidence that in its experience it had never purchased replacement power insurance and, instead, always relied on the market for replacement power. NorthWestern\u2019s General Manager of Generation testified that after receiving inquiry from the Commission and the MCC regarding insurance, he \u201cwent and solicited input from other utilities ... [a]nd they indicated that they simply do not get outage insurance because it is not economical to do so.\u201d Northwestern put on evidence that outage insurance could be $1 million per year, thus potentially costing more than the replacement power itself, but acknowledged it did not \u201cinvestigate or purchase insurance that might have covered the additional electricity supply costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\u00b612 The Commission inquired into NorthWestern\u2019s operation of the DGGS through data requests and found that Northwestern was aware the units needed to change load quickly, that quick response was critical, and that the units could experience unique thermal stresses due to ramping up and down. The outage was directly tied to \u201cramp rates \u2018much greater\u2019 than anticipated, excessive temperatures and cycle-related hardware failures,\u201d yet Northwestern used software allowing excessive ramping and did not retain precise ramp rate data.</p>\n<p id=\"A3PN\">\u00b613 The Commission determined that NorthWestern\u2019s management of the DGGS was not reasonable and that the excess regulation costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>were not prudently incurred because Northwestern (1) failed to prudently manage risks; and (2) did not \u201cexhibit the level of situational awareness that the Commission would expect from a utility managing a one-of-its-kind power plant.\u201d The Commission reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\">Given the warranty\u2019s exclusion of consequential damages and the uniqueness of DGGS, Northwestern should have identified the risk of incurring replacement costs in the event of an outage. ... [NorthWestern\u2019s] failure to identify risk ensured that incremental costs of replacement service would be incurred in the event of an outage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The Commission found that outage insurance was available and, even though it may not have been cost-effective, because Northwestern failed to \u201cevaluate the availability, price and terms of outage insurance,\u201d it \u201cguaranteed that any incremental replacement costs would be unavoidable in the event of an outage.\u201d Citing both NorthWestern\u2019s failure to manage risk and reasonably operate the DGGS, the Commission denied NorthWestern\u2019s request to include the outage costs in customer rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">DSM Program</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b614 Fixed costs are those the utility will incur regardless of how much energy it actually sells to consumers. Utilities typically recover fixed costs through volume based charges built into customer rates. Consequently, there is no financial incentive for a utility to encourage energy efficiency because decreases in consumption would hamper the utility\u2019s recovery of its fixed costs. A lost revenue adjustment mechanism (LRAM) is designed to compensate a utility for the revenue lost due to the utility\u2019s energy efficiency efforts. In essence, it allows the utility to estimate and recover the revenue it lost due to energy efficiency efforts directly attributable to the utility, such as by DSM programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\u00b615 In 2005, the Commission approved the use of a LRAM to account for revenue losses incurred as a result of NorthWestern\u2019s energy efficiency efforts, finding that \u201cthe lost revenue disincentive is real and puts at risk a full and complete ramp-up of cost-effective energy efficiency resource acquisition programs in the near-term.\u201d It authorized Northwestern to include in rates an estimate of the income lost due to DSM programs with a requirement that, after the programs had been implemented, the \u201cestimated lost... revenue amount must be trued-up based on actual program activity in [the given years] and again following a comprehensive program evaluation and independent verification of actual savings.\u201d This \u201ctrue-up\u201d ensures that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Northwestern is only including in rates the revenue lost from its DSM programs, and not from independent causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b616 Analysis of a DSM program includes examination of \u201cfree ridership\u201d and \u201cspillover.\u201d Free ridership occurs when a consumer takes advantage of a program incentive to install an energy efficient device, but would have installed the device with or without the incentive. As such, the utility did not effectuate the customer\u2019s usage reduction and is not entitled to recover the associated lost revenue. On the other side of the ledger, spillover occurs when a consumer does not respond to a DSM program incentive, but later chooses energy efficient products or practices as a result of the utility\u2019s general advocacy. As such, the utility is credited with the energy reduction it only indirectly induced, and can include those lost revenues in its LRAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b617 Northwestern selected Nexant Energy Management Group (Nexant) to evaluate its DSM programs for its first true-up process in 2006-2007. Nexant measured free ridership and spillover and included them in its final assessment. The Commission adopted the Nexant assessment, concluding that it \u201csatisfies the DSM program evaluation and savings verification requirements\u201d the Commission had established.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b618 The next true-up of NorthWestern\u2019s DSM programs was presented in the subject proceeding. Northwestern hired SBW Consulting (SBW), who partnered with Research into Action (RIA), to conduct the required independent, comprehensive true-up for the periods 2006-2007 to 2010-2011. In its draft report to Northwestern, SBW included the values for free ridership and spillover it had calculated. The draft report concluded that Northwestern was responsible for 79% of the energy efficiency savings it had estimated and included in customer rates through the LRAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b619 However, in its final report, SBW came to the conclusion that the values calculated for free ridership and spillover should not be used in the assessment of NorthWestern\u2019s DSM programs. The final report assumed that the two values, since they work in contradiction to each other, offset each other equally. In statistical terms, this offset was considered a 1.0 net-to-gross (NTG), meaning the net is no different than the gross savings. By completely offsetting spillover and free ridership values, SBW\u2019s final report concluded that Northwestern was responsible for 87% of the energy efficiency savings it had previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>estimated in the LRAM.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Northwestern agreed that this difference in over-collected revenues ought to be refunded to Northwestern ratepayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b620 During her testimony before the Commission, Dr. Marjorie McRae (Dr. McRae), the RIA researcher responsible for free ridership and spillover calculations, explained that when she met with Northwestern to discuss the draft report, she had informed Northwestern that she believed \u201cwe are not able, as a profession, to measure these accurately, and that the effects are offsetting.\u201d Dr. McRae testified that Northwestern had advised her to revise the draft \u201caccording to [her] professional opinion.\u201d Thus, the final report utilized a 1.0 NTG value for comparison between the two values instead of using the actual values derived from the research. Dr. McRae affirmed that she had conducted the free ridership and spillover research using \u201cnational common practices, and best practices,\u201d and the actual data was \u201ccomparable to those found for similar programs conducted by other respected program evaluators.\u201d However, the SBW final report stated that there were problems with using the calculated free ridership and spillover calculations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">[T]he economic analysis [should] use the value 1.0 for the net-to-gross ratio ... [due to] known limitations to standard practices for the estimation of free ridership and spillover estimation\u2014limitations that confound their effects and result in the overestimation of free ridership and the underestimation of spillover\u2014and on current net-to-gross practices in 31 jurisdictions with active energy efficiency programs, many of which recognize that free ridership and spillover are offsetting phenomena.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuC\">\u00b621 Dr. McRae concluded that researchers cannot truly ascertain free ridership and spillover values, and opined the Commission should use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>a 1.0 NTG ratio that treats the numbers as if they perfectly offset each other. To support her conclusion, Dr. McRae cited various studies, one notably finding that thirteen regulatory jurisdictions used a 1.0 NTG, while two jurisdictions, Michigan and New York, used a 0.9 NTG.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b622 Under cross-examination, Dr. McRae admitted she cannot know what the actual values are due to the state of the science. \u201cI would say that\u2019s [(measuring spillover and free ridership)] not possible with any methods that I know to know what they are.\u201d In response to questions from Commissioner Kavulla about whether there was data to support her conclusion that free ridership and spillover perfectly offset in a 1.0 NTG relationship, Dr. McRae admitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">If you take 1.0 as the null hypothesis that these effects are offsetting, then, I think the burden is\u2014especially if you\u2019re going to be in a lost revenue calculation or something like that, I think the burden of proof is to say, no, these aren\u2019t offsetting. These savings would have happened anyway. ... I don\u2019t think we have a way of saying that the null hypothesis is rejected, that it\u2019s anything other than what 1.0. And if you want to say for argument\u2019s sake it\u2019s [0].9, well, then for argument\u2019s sake why don\u2019t we say it\u2019s 1.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Commissioner Kavulla\u2019s asked: \u201cwhy is the 1.0 rather than a [0].09 or a 1.1 the null hypothesis?\u201d Dr. McRae concluded: \u201cI think in the absence of any other information, you just assume that one is positive and one is a negative; they\u2019re offsetting. That\u2019s how I think of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\u00b623 The Commission rejected Dr. McRae\u2019s conclusion that free ridership and spillover perfectly offset each other in a 1.0 NTG ratio and, instead, adopted the values she provided in her draft report. The Commission held that \u201cI a |1 though free ridership and spillover may be difficult to estimate, the remedy is not to discard the only empirical data that attempts to ascertain those values.\u201d The Commission disagreed with Dr. McRae\u2019s conclusion that offsetting meant equal offsetting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">Offsetting does not imply perfectly offsetting, and Northwestern has not demonstrated that an NTG of 1.0 is more reasonable as a null hypothesis than an NTG of 0.9 or any other fixed relation of the effects of free ridership and spillover. Because SBW did not test the null hypothesis proposed by [Dr.] McRae, it cannot be supported.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Noting the Commission\u2019s duty to \u201capprove an accurate level of savings and associated lost revenues,\u201d the Commission reasoned that Dr. McRae\u2019s conclusions were problematic because they forced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Commission to assume both that: (1) a fixed ratio (1.0 NTG) between free ridership and spillover was more accurate than actual measured numbers; and (2) 1.0 NTG was a better assumption than any other fixed value, for example, 0.9 NTG. Using the data from the draft report indicating a 0.908 NTG correlation between free ridership and spillover, the Commission lowered NorthWestern\u2019s true-up realization rate from 87% to 79%.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u00b624 Northwestern appealed the Commission\u2019s order on both issues to the Montana Second Judicial District Court, Silver Bow County. The District Court affirmed the Commission\u2019s Final Order. Northwestern, NRDC, and HRC appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u00b625 In an administrative appeal, we apply the same standards of review that the district court applies. <em>Whitehall Wind, LLC v.

Did the Commission use the correct legal standard in reviewing NorthWestern\u2019s claim for excess outage </em>costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u00b629 Northwestern argues that the Commission used the incorrect legal standard when reviewing the outage costs associated with purchasing replacement regulation service during the DGGS outage. Northwestern contends that \u201cprudently incurred electricity supply costs,\u201d \u00a7 69-8-210(1), MCA, is an objective, reasonable person standard, which in the context of utilities, is a \u201creasonable utility standard.\u201d Northwestern notes that other jurisdictions consider such costs under a reasonable utility standard. Under this standard, Northwestern argues that \u201cprudently incurred\u201d costs are those that a reasonable utility in NorthWestern\u2019s similar situation would have incurred, and argues that it acted as any other reasonable utility would have in the same situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">\u00b630 The Commission argues that \u201cprudent\u201d must be interpreted in light of the statutes and Commission rules referenced by the statute. The Commission does not dispute that the reasonable utility test is one factor to be considered, but argues that it is not the complete definition of \u201cprudent.\u201d The Commission offers that it reviewed NorthWestern\u2019s actions to determine whether the electricity supply costs were prudent pursuant to \u00a7 69-8-210(1), MCA, whether the assets purchased and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>owned by Northwestern were managed reasonably under \u00a7\u00a7 69-8-419 and -421, MCA, and whether rates that included the outage charges would be excessive or confiscatory pursuant to \u00a7 69-3-201, MCA. The Commission argues it applied the appropriate review and, under the facts in this case, made an appropriate determination that the costs were not prudently incurred because the plant was not reasonably managed, and that any rates that included those costs would not be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b631 At issue in this case is the meaning of the word \u201cprudent\u201d in \u00a7 69-8-210(1), MCA, which, as the parties note, is not defined by the Legislature. Section 69-8-210(1), MCA, reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">The commission shall establish an electricity cost recovery mechanism that allows a public utility to fully recover prudently incurred electricity supply costs, subject to the provisions of 69-8-419,69-8-420, and commission rules. The commission may include other utility costs and expenses in the cost recovery mechanism if it determines that including additional costs and expenses is reasonable and in the public interest. The cost recovery mechanism must provide for prospective rate adjustments for cost differences resulting from cost changes, load changes, and the time value of money on the differences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b632 Section 69-8-210(1), MCA reflects the full authority the Legislature granted to the Commission to review electricity supply costs. The Commission is an administrative agency created by statute. Section 69-1-102, MCA; <em>Schuster v. Northwestern Energy </em>Co., 2013 MT 364, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 54, 314 P.3d 650. The Commission does not have judicial powers, <em>Schuster, </em>\u00b6 9, <em>Williamson, </em>\u00b6 31, and its jurisdiction is \u201climited to the regulation of rates and service as provided by the Montana statutes.\u201d <em>Billings v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>193 Mont. 358, 370, 631 P.2d 1295, 1303 (1981); <em>accord Great N. Utils. Co. v. Pub. Serv.

Power Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>206 Mont. 359, 371, 671 P.2d 604, 611 (1983). As we noted in the cases following the deregulation of the Montana electrical industry, <em>see, e.g., Mont. Power Co. v Mont.

The word has been applied in prior Commission decisions, which have used such terms for \u201cprudent\u201d as \u201cmarked by wisdom or judiciousness\u201d or \u201ccircumspect or judicious in one\u2019s dealings\u201d and its synonyms are \u201c \u2018careful,\u2019 cautious,\u2019 \u2018sensible,\u2019 \u2018practical,\u2019 \u2018discreet,\u2019 \u2018wise,\u2019 and \u2018farsighted.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Mont. Power Co., </em>Mont. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, Docket D2001.10.144, Order No. 6382d 12 (June 21, 2002) (internal citations omitted). The Montana Legislature gave the Commission express latitude to determine if the given costs were prudent\u2014careful, sensible, practical, discreet, wise, or farsighted or, more apt in the regulatory environment, avoiding unnecessary risks\u2014through its own fact finding and administrative authority. Further, this analysis is undertaken in light of the statutory requirement that \u201cprudently incurred electricity supply costs\u201d must be determined \u201csubject to the provisions of 69-8-419, 69-8-420, and commission rules.\u201d Section 69-8-210(1), MCA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEW\">\u00b634 Section 69-8-419, MCA, governs the utility\u2019s duties for building and maintaining its \u201celectricity supply resource\u201d portfolio, including contracts for power generation or capacity, electricity plants owned or leased by the utility, customer load management, or any other means of providing reliable and adequate electricity service to customers. Section 69-8-103(9), MCA (defining \u201celectricity supply resource\u201d). The provision requires utilities to \u201cplan for future electricity supply resource needs; manage a portfolio of electricity supply resources; and procure new electricity supply resources when needed.\u201d Section 69-8-419, MCA. The utility is required to conduct this planning in accordance with, <em>inter alia, </em>the following objectives: (1) \u201cprovide adequate and reliable electricity supply service at the lowest long-term total cost\u201d; and (2) \u201cidentify and cost-effectively manage and mitigate risks related to its obligation to provide electricity supply service.\u201d Section 69-8-419(2)(a), (c), MCA. Thus, the utility must plan for future needs, manage its portfolio, and procure resources when necessary at the lowest long-term cost and, when doing so, identify and mitigate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>risks related to those obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b635 Commission administrative rules also address prudent utility resource procurement. \u201cPrudent electricity supply resource planning and procurement includes <em>evaluating, managing, and mitigating risks </em>associated with the inherent uncertainty of wholesale electricity markets and customer load.\u201d Admin. R. M. 38.5.8219(1) (2016) (emphasis added). The Commission has specifically identified sources of risk that, among others, may be evaluated: fuel prices and price volatility, environmental regulations and taxes, retail supply rates, supplier capabilities, construction costs, and <em>contract terms and conditions. </em>Admin. R. M. 38.5.8219(1) (emphasis added). The Commission\u2019s rules require that the \u201cutility\u2019s strategy for managing and mitigating risks associated with the identified risk factors should be developed in the context of the goals and objectives of these guidelines and include an evaluation of relevant opportunity costs.\u201d Admin. R. M. 38.5.8219(2). Finally, prudence involves documenting and carrying out the resource procurement plans:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">The commission must allow a utility to recover all costs it prudently incurs to perform this function. Whether the costs a utility incurs are prudent is, in part, directly related to whether its resource procurement process was conducted prudently. It is vital that a utility document its portfolio planning, management and electricity supply resource procurement activities to justify the prudence of its resource procurement decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Admin. R. M. 38.5.8220(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u00b636 Considering these sources, we disagree with Northwestern that the \u201creasonable utility standard\u201d\u2014i.e., what would a reasonable utility do in similar circumstances\u2014is the appropriate interpretation of \u201cprudent\u201d or the appropriate inquiry under Montana law. The Montana Legislature used the term \u201cprudent,\u201d not \u201creasonable utility,\u201d to describe how the Commission was to review electricity supply costs. Adopting NorthWestern\u2019s proposed standard would read a contradictory idea into the statute. If \u201cprudent\u201d was restricted to what a reasonable utility would do in similar circumstances, the Commission would be deprived of its own discretion to evaluate and determine whether the utility\u2019s actions were prudent. Tying the outcome to evidence of what other utilities did or would do would remove or reduce the discretion of the Commission to rely on its own expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"ASu\">\u00b637  In sum, \u00a7 69-8-210(1), MCA, grants authority to the Commission to determine whether energy supply costs were prudently incurred\u2014i.e., the utility\u2019s incurred costs were wise, judicious, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>sought to avoid unnecessary risk\u2014in light of the planning requirements set forth in \u00a7 69-8-419, MCA, \u00a7 69-8-421, MCA, and Commission rules, which specifically require risk analysis and mitigation, including an examination of the relevant contract terms. The Commission was correct to apply these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b638 The remainder of NorthWestern\u2019s arguments challenging the Commission\u2019s decision assumes that the reasonable utility standard governs the outcome. Having rejected that view, we need not address all of NorthWestern\u2019s further arguments based thereon. In brief, and to the extent that the reasonable utility standard is an appropriate factor to consider, as the Commission did, the Commission\u2019s determination was supported by the record. The DGGS was a \u201cone-of-a-kind\u201d plant and the purchase and installation contract contained a provision that excluded consequential damages. Waiver of consequential damages on a first-of-its-kind regulation plant without extensive industry use supported the Commission\u2019s determination that NorthWestern\u2019s failure \u201cto identify risk ensured that incremental costs of replacement service would be incurred in the event of an outage,\u201d and was imprudent. To defend its actions, Northwestern asked other utilities\u2014after the MCC and the Commission inquired into its risk mitigation efforts\u2014about their insurance practices and presented evidence that those utilities did not purchase it. However, this is risk justification, not risk management.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u00b639 Even if it is accepted that insurance was cost-prohibitive and would not have been a viable alternative, the Commission also determined that Northwestern did not reasonably manage the DGGS and that the outage costs were also imprudent for that reason.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Northwestern was aware that the DGGS had \u201cvery unique\u201d controls and was different from other plants. Northwestern was also aware, as the Commission found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">(1) \u201c[T]he units needfed] to change load rapidly\u201d as measured in \u201cMW change per minute,\u201d and that a single engine in operation could \u201cramp up or down at a rate of at least 15 MW per minute\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-10\">(2) \u201cthe ability to respond to demand within seconds\u201d was critical to the operational mission of DGGS; and (3) the units could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>experience unique \u201cthermal stresses,\u201d and that going \u201cfrom a cold start to a very high temperature\u201d can cause \u201ca lot of distress within rotating equipment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">(Internal quotations in original.) The outage specifically resulted from these known factors. PWPS\u2019s investigation concluded \u201c[o]ver temperatures resulted in reduction of material properties,\u201d \u201c[hjigher motion resulted in higher stress on the affected parts,\u201d and \u201chardware failures are cycle related.\u201d Northwestern admitted the ramp rate was \u201cmuch greater\u201d than Northwestern had requested due to software configuration and NorthWestern had not installed anything to monitor the actual ramp data on a per-minute basis. In addition, Northwestern cycled each unit frequently, which PWPS concluded was the cause of the hardware failures.</p>\n<p id=\"AZnj\">\u00b640  The Commission did not commit clear error in finding that Northwestern had failed to appropriately plan for and operate the DGGS. The Commission\u2019s decision to disallow the outage costs incurred by Northwestern when the DGGS went offline was well within its authority to determine whether those costs were \u201cprudently incurred.\u201d Section 69-8-210(1), MCA. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s order regarding the outage costs is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b641 <em>2. Were the \u201cfree ridership\u201d and \u201cspillover\u201d calculations adopted by the Commission supported by substantial </em>evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b642 NRDC and HRC argue that the Commission erred when it adopted the free ridership and spillover values presented in Dr. McRae\u2019s draft report when she, as the only witness to testify on the subject, repudiated those very numbers in her testimony. This, they argue, was clearly erroneous because there is no evidence in the record supporting the use of those numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b643 Citing problems with the methodology, the SBW final report concluded that the actual calculations for free ridership and spillover should not be used. SBW concluded that the best approach was to assume the numbers perfectly offset each other. Dr. McRae echoed this conclusion in her testimony before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">\u00b644 However, NRDC and HRC are incorrect to argue that there was no testimony regarding actual free ridership and spillover calculations. When pressed on her conclusions, Dr. McRae hedged her testimony in several ways. First, Dr. McRae stated affirmatively that actual free ridership and spillover calculations were conducted using \u201cnational common practices, and best practices,\u201d and that the actual data derived was \u201ccomparable to those found for similar programs conducted by other respected program evaluators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u00b645 Second, Dr. McRae testified her opinion of the state of the science is that she simply cannot know what the actual values are, including the 1.0 NTG she suggested the Commission adopt. \u201cI would say that\u2019s not possible with any methods that I know to know what they [free ridership and spillover] are.\u201d Regarding whether there was actual, hard data to support her conclusion for a 1.0 NTG, Dr. McRae testified there was no way to prove or disprove her conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">If you take 1.0 as the null hypothesis that these effects are offsetting, then, I think the burden is\u2014especially if you\u2019re going to be in a lost revenue calculation or something like that, I think the burden of proof is to say, no, these aren\u2019t offsetting. These savings would have happened anyway. ... <em>I don\u2019t think we have a way of saying that the null hypothesis is rejected, that it\u2019s anything other than what 1.0. And if you want to say for argument\u2019s sake it\u2019s [O].9, well, then for argument\u2019s sake why don\u2019t we say it\u2019s 1.1.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoA\">(Emphasis added.) When asked why 1.0 would be used instead of 0.9 or 1.1, Dr. McRae responded: \u201cin the absence of any other information, you just assume one is positive and one is negative; they\u2019re offsetting. That\u2019s how I think of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b646 The Commission was faced with: (1) an expert\u2019s conclusion that one cannot know the precise spillover and free ridership numbers; and (2) testimony stating they could neither prove nor disprove that given hypothesis. The same expert provided a range of hypothetical values from 0.9 to 1.1 and provided anecdotal evidence of other states using a 0.9, while some used 1.0. Finally, the expert admitted the only hard research available in the proceeding was done according to best practices and was comparable with that done by other respected researchers.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b647 Our role is not to re-weigh the evidence, but rather, to determine if substantial evidence existed \u201cand not whether, on the same evidence, [we] would have arrived at the same conclusion.\u201d <em>Johnson v. W. Transp., LLC, </em>2011 MT 13, \u00b6 18, 359 Mont. 145, 247 P.3d 1094 (citing <em>Ward v. Johnson, </em>242 Mont. 225, 228, 790 P.2d 483, 485 (1990)). We hold the Commission\u2019s facts were supported by substantial evidence. The actual data collected by Dr. McRae and SBW provided a 0.908 NTG, which falls in the range of hypothetical values provided by the expert. It is also in the range of values used by other commissions, as testified to by Dr. McRae. Dr. McRae admitted there was no actual, hard data to support her conclusion that the values perfectly offset each other. And, finally, the only hard data available was collected per best practices and was consistent with the research done by other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>respected firms.</p>\n<p id=\"ANhA\">\u00b648  As an administrative agency, the Commission\u2019s \u201cexperience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge may be utilized in the evaluation of evidence.\u201d Section 2-4-612(7), MCA. The Commission had substantial evidence to rely upon and it appropriately used is expertise to evaluate that evidence.
