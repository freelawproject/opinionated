We address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court correctly determined that Harrison may petition for early termination of his lifetime prohibition on hunting, fishing, and trapping.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court correctly determined that Harrison may petition for early termination of his lifetime prohibition on accompanying any hunter, angler, or trapper.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\u00b62 We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u00b63 On June 25, 2015, Harrison pled guilty to \u2014 and was convicted of \u2014 five felony charges: unlawful possession, shipping, or transportation of a game fish, bird, game animal, or far-bearing animal pursuant to a common scheme in violation of \u00a7 87-6-202(1), (5), and (6)(f), MCA; tampering with witnesses and informants in violation of \u00a7 45-7-206(l)(a), MCA; tampering with or fabricating physical evidence in violation of \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA; and two counts of tampering with public records or information in violation of \u00a7 45-7-208, MCA. The charges all stemmed from Harrison\u2019s illegal baiting, killing, and transportation or assistance in illegal baiting, killing, and transportation of nine black bears between May 2009 and June 2014. On August 28, 2015, the District Court orally sentenced Harrison to ten years in prison, all suspended, with several conditions, including a \u201clifetime loss of hunting, trapping and accompaniment privileges.\u201d On September 9,2015, the District Court issued its written judgment, imposing a ten-year suspended prison sentence and twenty-six conditions. The two conditions at issue in this appeal, Conditions 23 and 24, provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-11\">23. The Defendant shall be prohibited from hunting, fishing, or trapping in the State of Montana during his lifetime. Pursuant to \u00a746-18-208, the Defendant may file a petition for early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>termination of this sentence and/or this condition after 2/3 of the suspended sentence time has elapsed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">24. The Defendant shall be prohibited from accompanying in the field any hunter, angler, or trapper in the State of Montana during his lifetime. Pursuant to \u00a746-18-208, the Defendant may file a petition for early termination of this sentence and/or this condition after 2/3 of the suspended sentence time has elapsed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADJ\">\u00b64 On October 5, 2015, the State filed a motion to conform the District Court\u2019s written judgment to its oral pronouncement of Harrison\u2019s sentence. The State argued that the District Court\u2019s written judgment did not conform to its oral pronouncement of Harrison\u2019s sentence because the District Court never mentioned at sentencing that Harrison could seek an early termination of his lifetime hunting, fishing, trapping, and accompaniment prohibitions. The State further argued that Harrison\u2019s loss of these privileges is an independent criminal penalty, not a condition of his suspended sentence. According to the State, allowing Harrison to petition for an early termination of his lifetime prohibitions would render the sanctions meaningless because, \u201cwhen a [djistrict [cjourt terminates the time remaining on a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-208, MCA, all of the conditions that were imposed as a condition of that sentence are also terminated.\u201d On October 26, 2015, the District Court issued an order denying the State\u2019s motion. The District Court concluded that the lifetime prohibitions were conditions of Harrison\u2019s sentence, not independent penalties, and therefore modifiable pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-208, MCA. The State appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">\u00b65 We generally review a criminal sentence for legality; \u201cthat is, whether the sentence falls within the statutory parameters.\u201d <em>State v. Duong, </em>2015 MT 70, \u00b6 11, 378 Mont. 345, 343 P.3d 1218. A district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review for correctness. <em>Duong, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">\u00b66 <em>1. Whether the District Court correctly determined that Harrison may petition for early termination of his lifetime prohibition on hunting, fishing, and trapping.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">\u00b67 Pursuant to \u00a7 87-6-202(6)(f), MCA, a person convicted of possessing, shipping, or transporting an unlawfully killed game fish, bird, game animal, or fur-bearing animal worth more than $1,000 \u201cshall forfeit... the privilege to hunt, fish, or trap in this state for not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>less than 3 years up to a revocation for life from the date of conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ahs\">\u00b68 Section 46-18-208(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">When imposition of a sentence has been deferred or execution of a sentence has been suspended, the ... defendant may file a petition to terminate the time remaining on the sentence if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAyR0\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">(b) in the case of a suspended sentence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">(i) the defendant has served two-thirds of the time suspended; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">(ii) the defendant has been granted a conditional discharge from supervision under 46-23-1011 and has demonstrated compliance with the conditional discharge for a minimum of 12 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">\u00b69 The oral pronouncement of a criminal sentence in the presence of the defendant is the \u201clegally effective sentence and valid, final judgment.\u201d <em>State v. Claassen, </em>2012 MT 313, \u00b6 16, 367 Mont. 478, 291 P.3d 1176 (quoting State <em>v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6 40, 288 Mont. 286, 957 P.2d 9). In the event of a conflict between the oral pronouncement and the written judgment, the oral pronouncement of a sentence controls. <em>Claassen, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">\u00b610 The State contends that Harrison\u2019s lifetime hunting, fishing, and trapping prohibition is not subject to early termination under \u00a7 46-18-208, MCA, because it is a separate penalty, not a condition of his suspended sentence. We agree. Statutory interpretation \u201cmust be reasonable,\u201d \u00a7 1-3-233, MCA, and \u201cshould not lead to absurd results if a reasonable interpretation would avoid it.\u201d <em>State v. Sommers, </em>2014 MT 315, \u00b6 22, 377 Mont. 203, 339 P.3d 65. Section 46-18-208, MCA, applies to early termination of \u201cthe time remaining\u201d on a suspended sentence. Section 87-6-202(6)(f), MCA, provides a separate, independent penalty, that allows for a lifetime prohibition on hunting, fishing, or trapping. It is not subject to early termination under \u00a7 46-18-208, MCA. Holding otherwise would lead to the absurd result of rendering Harrison\u2019s \u201clifetime\u201d prohibition meaningless, because it would end not with Harrison\u2019s lifetime, but with the termination or expiration of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqsz\">\u00b611 The District Court incorrectly applied the law when it denied the State\u2019s petition to conform its written judgment to its oral pronouncement by striking the provision in Condition 23 that allows Harrison to petition for early termination of his lifetime hunting, fishing, and trapping prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">\u00b612 <em>2. Whether the District Court correctly determined that Harrison may petition for early termination of his lifetime prohibition on accompanying any hunter, angler, or trapper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A847\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u00b613 Unlike his lifetime hunting, fishing, and trapping prohibition, Harrison\u2019s lifetime prohibition on accompanying any hunter, angler, or trapper is not provided for by statute. Because there is no independent statutory basis for it, the accompaniment prohibition would necessarily be a condition of Harrison\u2019s sentence, not an independent penalty. Although the District Court did not expressly advise Harrison that he had the right to petition for early termination of this condition during its oral pronouncement, in denying the State\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment, the District Court correctly noted that petitioning for early termination of a suspended sentence pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-208, MCA, \u201cis a statutory right, enacted by the Legislature, and therefore has no need to be orally expressed.\u201d Whether or not the District Court orally advised Harrison of his statutory right to seek early termination of his suspended sentence \u2014 including the lifetime prohibition on accompanying any hunter, angler, or trapper \u2014 does not change the fact that Harrison has that right. The District Court merely advised him of that right in the written judgment. It did not substantively alter the oral pronouncement or create a conflict between the oral pronouncement and the written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b614 We affirm in part and reverse in part the District Court\u2019s order. We remand for the District Court to strike the following sentence from Condition 23 of its written judgment: \u201cPursuant to \u00a746-18-208, the Defendant may file a petition for early termination of this sentence and/or this condition after 2/3 of the suspended sentence time has elapsed.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b257-6\">JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b257-7\">JUSTICE COTTER,</author>\n<p id=\"AqI\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b615 I dissent. I would uphold the order of the District Court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u00b616 The Court states at \u00b6 10 that it agrees with the State\u2019s contention that the lifetime hunting, fishing, and trapping prohibition imposed pursuant to \u00a7 87-6-202(6)(f), MCA, is a separate penalty and not a condition of Harrison\u2019s suspended sentence. While the lifetime ban is indeed a penalty, it is also clearly a condition of Harrison\u2019s suspended sentence, as the Court itself notes in \u00b6 3. This being so, the provisions of \u00a7 46-18-208, MCA, permitting early termination of a suspended sentence may apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">\u00b617 There is no language in \u00a7 87-6-202, MCA, to support the proposition that a penalty which is imposed as a condition of sentence may not be terminated early pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-208, MCA. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>87-6-202(6)(f), MCA, requires only that, if the value of the game exceeds a certain dollar figure, the person shall forfeit his privilege to hunt, fish, or trap for not less than 3 years. Here, the sentence imposed was a prison sentence of 10 years with all time suspended. Thus, the earliest opportunity in this case for either the prosecutor or defendant to invoke the benefit of \u00a7 46-18-208, MCA, would be after two-thirds of the suspended time \u2014 or 6 years and 8 months \u2014 has been served. This penalty would exceed by 3 years and 8 months the minimum forfeiture requirements of \u00a7 87-6-202(6)(f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b618 Similarly, \u00a7 46-18-208, MCA, contains no language precluding its application to sentences involving conditions of suspended sentences that can also be considered penalties. Therefore, neither statute supports the Court\u2019s categorical statement in \u00b6 10 that the penalty imposed under Title 87 is not subject to early termination under \u00a7 46-18-208, MCA, nor does the Court cite any statutory reference or case law for its conclusion. The Court\u2019s conclusion is <em>ipse dixit </em>and nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b619 Finally, I would conclude that the fact that the oral pronouncement of sentence did not reference \u00a7 46-18-208, MCA, or the possibility of early termination of the suspended sentence is of no consequence. The written sentence merely informed Harrison of his right to seek early termination of his suspended sentence \u2014 a statutory right that every defendant enjoys regardless of whether it is referenced by a court at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b620 For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
