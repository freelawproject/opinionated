After a jury trial, Colburn was convicted of two counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>of attempted possession of child pornography. On appeal, he challenges his convictions and we affirm, addressing the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">\n<em>Was there sufficient evidence to support Colburn\u2019s convictions of attempted sexual abuse of children?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b62 In July of 2010, Colburn was a houseguest of his supervisor, at the youth center/video store where he volunteered, staying in her converted garage. His supervisor first became concerned when she noticed that, on the computer at the video store, someone had entered the term \u201cpreteen pussy\u201d in an internet search engine. To investigate further, she asked Colburn via text message if she could use his personal computer in the converted garage. Colburn consented, and the supervisor discovered similar search terms on Colburn\u2019s personal computer. She reported these details to the Stevensville Chief of Police, who applied for, obtained, and executed a search warrant of the garage, removing Colburn\u2019s personal computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\u00b63 A forensic examiner for the State of Montana, Agent Jimmy Weg, examined Colburn\u2019s personal computer and found eleven photographs that had been downloaded to the computer\u2019s hard drive. The pictures depicted young-appearing females, some naked and some in various stages of undress, in sexually provocative poses. Agent Weg testified at trial that these images had been downloaded to Colburn\u2019s desktop computer on four separate occasions, based on the internal timestamp the computer had assigned to downloaded files.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">\u00b64 Agent Weg also recovered the searching and browsing history from internet search engines, discovering five separate searches from Colburn\u2019s computer that indicated, in his view, the user was seeking child pornography. On the respective dates of the charges, for which the jury found Colburn guilty of attempted possession of child pornography, Colburn had entered the search terms \u201cpreteen tube,\u201d \u201cpreteen + tube + xxx,\u201d \u201cpreteentube.com,\u201d \u201cpreteen pussy,\u201d and \u201cpreteen pussy stores.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">\u00b65 Trial on the nine charged counts proceeded in April 2014. The State called Colburn\u2019s supervisor, the Stevensville Chief of Police, and Agent Weg as witnesses. Agent Weg testified that the computer files revealed that the first of the eleven recovered images was initially downloaded onto Colburn\u2019s computer on January 23, 2010. Agent Weg further testified that search terms suggestive of child pornography were entered into internet search engines via Colburn\u2019s computer, and child images were downloaded onto his computer\u2019s hard drive, on alternating dates over the next six months. Agent Weg testified as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>expert witness, stating that, based on his training and experience, the images recovered from Colburn\u2019s computer constituted child pornography. One image featured a young-appearing female wearing a headband with the term \u201cClub 17.\u201d Agent Weg testified that \u201cClub 17\u201d is a reference to a pornography company based in the Netherlands, and the company\u2019s name serves to communicate that subjects used in the company\u2019s images and videos are under the age of 17. He also testified that several of the search terms, such as \u201cpreteen tube,\u201d were terms of art within child pornography culture that would be expected to obtain search results containing child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b66 After the State rested its case-in-chief, Colburn moved as a matter of law for \u201ca finding of not guilty with regard to all nine counts I, I\u201d based in part on insufficiency of the evidence. The District Court denied the motion. The jury deadlocked on the counts of actual possession, entering \u201c[u]ndecided/[h]ung\u201d on the verdict form rather than selecting either \u201c[gluilty or [n]ot [gluilty\u201d for those charges. The jury acquitted Colburn of three of the counts of attempted possession of child pornography, and found him guilty on two of those counts. After the jury returned its verdict, the State moved to dismiss the four counts of actual possession of child pornography, and the District Court granted the motion. Colburn was sentenced in June 2014 on the two counts of attempted possession. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u00b67 \u201cThe standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict is \u2018to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Gardner, </em>2003 MT 338, \u00b6 29, 318 Mont. 436, 80 P.3d 1262 (quoting <em>State v. Bauer, </em>2002 MT 7, \u00b6 15, 308 Mont. 99, 39 P.3d 689). \u201cWhether sufficient evidence exists to convict a defendant is ultimately an analysis and application of the law to the facts and, as such, is properly reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 58, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74 (citing <em>State v. Swan, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 19, 337 Mont. 326, 160 P.3d 511).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">\u00b68 <em>Was there sufficient evidence to support Colburn\u2019s convictions of attempted sexual abuse of children?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">\u00b69 Section 45-5-625(1)(e), MCA (2013), provides: \u201cA person commits the offense of sexual abuse of children if the person ... knowingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>possesses any visual or print medium, including a medium by use of electronic communication in which a child is engaged in sexual conduct, actual or simulated.\u201d The statute defines \u201cIslexual conduct\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">(i) (F) lewd exhibition of the genitals, breasts, pubic or rectal area, or other intimate parts of any person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pApQ\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"27\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAMUAAAAbAQAAAADkd3YCAAAARUlEQVR4nGP8z4Ad/GTCIcHAMCozSGT+O0DZn2CCJ6Ay/x5ABd7DZPYQNI1JAcoWhAm6QGUYYfZwwWQ0GBgYGBgHPO0AAA61C5HKcH8xAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"197\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">(ii) depiction of a child in the nude or in a state of partial undress with the purpose to abuse, humiliate, harass, or degrade the child or to arouse or gratify the person\u2019s own sexual response or desire or the sexual response or desire of any person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Section 45-5-625(5)(b)(i)(F), (ii), MCA (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\u00b610 Section 45-4-103(1), MCA, addresses the inchoate offense of attempt: \u201cA person commits the offense of attempt when, with the purpose to commit a specific offense, the person does any act toward the commission of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">\u00b611 We have stated that \u201cnot all acts towards the commission of a crime are sufficient [to qualify as an attempt]. There must be an \u2018overt act\u2019 that reaches \u2018far enough towards the accomplishment of the desired result to amount to the commencement of the consummation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 59 (quoting State <em>v. Mahoney, </em>264 Mont. 89, 97, 870 P.2d 65, 70 (1994); <em>State v. Ribera, </em>183 Mont. 1, 11, 597 P.2d 1164, 1170 (1979)). We have also stated that \u201c \u2018there must be at least some appreciable fragment of the crime committed, and it must be in such progress that it will be consummated unless interrupted by circumstances independent of the will of the attempter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mahoney, </em>264 Mont. at 97, 870 P.2d at 70 (quoting <em>Ribera, </em>183 Mont at 11, 597 P.2d at 1170; <em>State v. Rains, </em>53 Mont. 424, 426, 164 P. 540, 541, (1917)). These principles were included in the instructions given to the jury by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">\u00b612 Colburn argues that the State failed to meet its evidentiary burden at trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an appreciable fragment of the crime was, to paraphrase <em>Mahoney, </em>\u201cin such progress\u201d that Mr. Colburn would have knowingly possessed child pornography unless \u201cinterrupted by circumstances independent\u201d of his own will. Colburn\u2019s argument focuses only on the evidence of the search terms, which he argues is insufficient because \u201cit only shows the fact that Mr. Colburn entered words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">\u00b613 At trial, the State produced evidence that eleven images of youthful appearing females in sexually provocative poses had been downloaded onto Colburn\u2019s computer. The State provided expert forensic testimony that these images were child pornography. One of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the images contained a reference to \u201cClub 17,\u201d a known pornography producer that advertises the subjects in its images are no more than 17 years old. Even though the jury did not convict Colburn of actual possession based upon these images, the evidence was nonetheless properly before the jury, which could consider and make proper inferences from the images. <em>See State v. Meredith, </em>2010 MT 27, \u00b6 45, 355 Mont. 148, 226 P.3d 571 (\u201cMontana law clearly permits a jury to draw inferences from circumstantial evidence presented at trial.\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b614 The State also produced evidence of various search terms entered on Colburn\u2019s computer, such as \u201cpreteen tube\u201d and \u201cpreteen pussy.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Agent Weg testified that, \u201ca person who would search for preteen tube, from what I\u2019ve seen, invariably is looking to find child pornography.\u201d During cross-examination, Colburn\u2019s defense counsel challenged Agent Weg about the significance of these search terms, which Agent Weg resisted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">Q. And so it follows, doesn\u2019t it, that those search terms used by an unsophisticated computer user could actually be used to find lawful adult pornography?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">A. I haven\u2019t seen that. And that takes into consideration what else I find on a computer. I would say, absent finding any child pornography, that would be the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Agent Weg explained that Colburn\u2019s search terms suggested he was seeking images or videos of underage subjects, and explained that the purpose behind those search terms was corroborated by the multiple images ofyouthful-appearingfemales in sexual poses actually found on Colburn\u2019s computer, which had been downloaded after multiple searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">\u00b615 While it is correct the State introduced no direct evidence that Colburn had accessed or downloaded child pornography on the same dates as he entered the search terms, it is not correct that the State\u2019s case demonstrated merely that \u201cColburn entered words.\u201d The particular \u201cwords\u201d used by Colburn as search terms included terms of art within child pornography culture. Further, the State established that Colburn was actually successful in accessing and downloading images of provocative youthful subjects on other dates, some of which were interspersed among the dates on which the charges were based. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Taken as a whole, sufficient evidence was presented for the jury to determine that Colburn had not just entered \u201cmere words\u201d into his internet search engine.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b616 The State argues that \u201c[t]he proper focus here is on all of the affirmative acts Colburn took towards completion of [possession of child pornography], not whether his plan was ultimately successful on the search dates in question.\u201d Considering the evidence as a whole, we agree that Colburn committed an overt act \u201cfar enough towards the accomplishment of the desired result to amount to the commencement of the consummation.\u201d <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 59. The evidence allowed the jury to permissibly find Colburn had committed an overt act \u201cfar enough towards the accomplishment\u201d of possessing child pornography that the crime would be consummated. <em>Mahoney, </em>264 Mont. at 97, 870 P.2d at 70; <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 59.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aql\">\u00b617  Colburn offers as an issue of law that evidence of \u201ca second, dispositive step\u201d on his part \u201cshowing an attempt to access illegal content\u201d was necessary for conviction, arguing that, \u201c[wjithout a second step to indicate what content was actually sought, those words remain plain speech - merely words.\u201d However, the law has never required a distinct \u201csecond step\u201d in order for an \u201cappreciable fragment of the crime\u201d to be completed for purposes of attempt. <em>Mahoney, </em>264 Mont. at 97, 870 P.2d at 70. The statute provides the crime of attempt can be based upon \u201cany act\u201d toward the commission of the offense. Section 45-4-103(1), MCA. As discussed above, the jury was presented with sufficient evidence to permit it to find the commission of an \u201covert act\u201d that went far enough to the accomplishment of obtaining child pornography to satisfy the statute, and thus support the conviction. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u00b618 Affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b132-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, SHEA and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\"> The jury necessarily accepted the State\u2019s position that Colburn had entered the search terms and downloaded the images onto his computer, a finding that Colburn does not challenge on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\"> Colburn relies on <em>State v. Fuller, </em>266 Mont. 420, 880 P.2d 1340 (1994), where we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on three counts of sexual assault on grounds of insufficient evidence. There, the defendant made sexually provocative comments and gestures to three young girls, which Colburn argues bears \u201cmarked similarity\u201d to his actions here. However, the <em>Fuller </em>case was tried before a judge, who stated, in contradiction to the ultimate guilty verdicts, that \u201cthe evidence does not show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant actually intended to touch the victims.\u201d <em>Fuller, </em>266 Mont. at 423, 880 P. 2d at 1342. We reversed based upon this single finding, and not upon the sufficiency of the evidence, as a whole, to support the verdict. <em>Fuller, </em>266 Mont. at 423, 880 P.2d at 1343. The posture of <em>Fuller </em>is anomalous to the usual sufficiency of the evidence inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\"> In his reply brief, Colburn makes a brief constitutional argument regarding content-based bans on speech, claiming the State is unilaterally prohibiting speech, such as his search terms. This issue was neither presented at, nor ruled on at the District Court, and we decline to address it for the first time on appeal. <em>See In re A.N.W., </em>2006 MT 42, \u00b6 41, 331 Mont. 208, 130 P.3d 619 (\u201cThis Court does not consider an issue presented for the first time on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b132-6\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"A30\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u00b619 The issue presented in this appeal is whether the State produced sufficient evidence of an overt act indicating that Colburn, absent an intervening circumstance independent of Colburn\u2019s will, would have consummated the crime of possession of child pornography. The only evidence of an overt act produced in support of counts six and nine, attempted possession of child pornography on the specific dates of May 30, 2010, and July 17, 2010, was that Colburn entered words into the search field of an Internet search engine. An expert witness indicated these were search terms that could lead to child pornography cites. While this, together with other circumstantial evidence, may be enough for a jury to find Colburn harbored the requisite criminal mens rea to commit the offense, it is insufficient proof for a \u201crational trier of fact [to find] the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Fuller, </em>266 Mont. 420, 422, 880 P.2d 1340 (1994). As in <em>Fuller, </em>reviewing an attempt conviction presents an issue \u201crelating to the fundamental principle subsumed in this standard: that the prosecution must establish each and every element of the charged offense by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Fuller, </em>266 Mont. at 422 (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 316, 99 S. Ct. 2781 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">\u00b620 Montana\u2019s attempt statute provides: \u201c[a] person commits the offense of attempt when, with the purpose to commit a specific offense, the person does any act toward the commission of the offense.\u201d Section 45-4-103(1), MCA. The criminal offense of possessing child pornography occurs when a person \u201cknowingly possesses any visual or print medium ... in which a child is engaged in sexual conduct, actual or simulated.\u201d Section 45-5-625(1)(e), MCA. The elements of the offense thus clearly provide that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the person acted knowingly; (2) the person possessed the image; (3) the image was that of a child; and (4) the image involved the child in sexual conduct, actual or simulated. The State may not be relieved of its burden of proving each and every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>element of the offense merely by charging an attempt to commit the crime. The State must prove that the image Colburn <em>would </em>have possessed on May 30, 2010, and July 17, 2010, was that of a child involved in sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b621 An overt act is not simply an affirmative act or an act in preparation; it is an act towards <em>consummation </em>of the offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">This Court has stated that an overt act \u2018must reach far enough towards the accomplishment of the desired result to amount to the commencement of the consummation.\u2019 In addition, the Court stated that \u2018there must be at least some appreciable fragment of the crime committed, and it must be in such progress that it will be consummated unless interrupted by circumstances independent of the will of the attempter.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\"><em>State v. Ribera, </em>183 Mont. 1, 11, 597 P.2d 1164, 1170 (1979) (citing <em>State v. Rains, </em>53 Mont. 424, 164 P. 540 (1917)); <em>see also State v. Mahoney, </em>264 Mont. 89, 97, 870 P.2d 65 (1994). This requirement in the law exists in order to ensure that the State, by charging only an attempt, is not relieved of its burden of proving each element of the offense. A criminal penalty may be based only upon the defendant\u2019s actions which, absent an interruption independent of the defendant, would have resulted in the commission of an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u00b622 Here, the State failed to prove that Colburn completed an appreciable fragment of the crime or that the crime would have been completed had an intervening circumstance not occurred beyond Colburn\u2019s control. Importantly, the jury was unable to decide whether images downloaded by Colburn on other dates constituted child pornography and, as a result, the State dismissed counts one through four. Of the remaining five attempt charges, the jury found the State had not proven three of the counts. While evidence offered in support of these other counts may be circumstantial evidence of Colburn\u2019s intent on the two counts for which he was convicted, the State is not relieved of its burden of proving the remaining elements of the offense for the specific dates charged on May 30 and July 17. There was no evidence presented of what the image would have been\u2014that the image would have been that of a child\u2014or that the child would have been engaged in sexual conduct. At most, there was only speculation, based on the evidence presented on other counts found insufficient by the jury, that Colburn would have eventually possessed a pornographic image of a child on the dates charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\u00b623 As much as we dislike child pornography and want to protect children, it is impermissible to impose a criminal penalty on the basis of an act which is only speculative as to the offense that would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>been committed. I dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that there was sufficient evidence of an overt act by Colburn upon which the jury could find an attempt to possess child pornography.</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-5\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
