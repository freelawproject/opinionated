(S&amp;P) sued STEMCO LP (STEMCO) for breach of an alleged oral contract for a five-year arrangement to produce and sell remanufactured brakes. STEMCO claimed that the statute of frauds barred the oral contract and that the parol evidence rule precluded evidence of its formation. The District Court denied STEMCO\u2019s motions for summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law. A Yellowstone County jury found in favor of S&amp;P and awarded damages on the oral agreement. STEMCO appeals. We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court erred in denying STEMCO\u2019s motion for summary judgment because the alleged oral contract was barred by the statute of frauds;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in submitting the questions of part performance and promissory estoppel to the jury;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-13\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in excluding evidence proffered by STEMCO to rebut S&amp;P\u2019s breach of contract and damages claims;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\n<em>4. Whether the District Court erred in denying costs to STEMCO for prevailing on its counterclaim.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u00b63 S&amp;P is a Montana corporation that remanufactures brakes for semi-truck vehicles. STEMCO is a Texas company with a division that manufactures replacement brake parts, including brake linings. On March 2, 2011, STEMCO and S&amp;P representatives met to discuss entering into a business relationship. The two parties agreed that S&amp;P would become a \u201cSTEMCO authorized remanufacturer.\u201d This meant that STEMCO would sell its brake linings to S&amp;P, S&amp;P would remanufacture brakes using the STEMCO brake linings, S&amp;P would label the remanufactured brakes as STEMCO products, and then S&amp;P would sell the remanufactured brakes to certain \u201cSTEMCO authorized distributors\u201d \u2014 companies to which STEMCO permitted its \u201cauthorized remanufacturers\u201d like S&amp;P to sell the remanufactured brakes. At the meeting, S&amp;P\u2019s president signed a STEMCO \u201cAuthorized Brake Remanufacturer Program Agreement\u201d (Program Agreement), which STEMCO required in order for S&amp;P to become an \u201cauthorized remanufacturer. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u00b64 The parties dispute whether the Program Agreement served as a final expression of their agreement and therefore constituted a contract. S&amp;P alleged that, at the March 2011 meeting, STEMCO guaranteed S&amp;P the right to sell remanufactured brakes to STEMCO authorized distributors in a five-state region for a period of five years. Among those authorized distributors was Kenworth Sales Company (Kenworth), with locations in Utah and Idaho. Following the meeting, S&amp;P made substantial expenditures on new inventory and equipment, a new trailer, a commercial lease for additional warehouse space in Salt Lake City, and additional employees. S&amp;P asserted that it made these expenditures in reliance on STEMCO\u2019s promise that S&amp;P could sell remanufactured brakes to Kenworth for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\u00b65 For roughly the next year and a half, S&amp;P remanufactured brakes using STEMCO brake linings and sold those brakes to Kenworth. In about August 2012, Kenworth broke ties with S&amp;P and instead began purchasing its remanufactured brakes from a company called Gorilla Brake, another STEMCO authorized remanufacturer. S&amp;P sued STEMCO for breach of contract, among other claims. S&amp;P argued that STEMCO violated the terms of the parties\u2019 alleged oral five-year contract by allowing Gorilla Brake to replace S&amp;P as Kenworth\u2019s supplier of remanufactured brakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u00b66 STEMCO moved for summary judgment. It argued that the statute of frauds rendered the alleged oral contract unenforceable. STEMCO contended further that the terms of the oral contract contradicted the terms of the Program Agreement, and thus that the parol evidence rule barred S&amp;P from introducing evidence of the oral contract. The District Court denied STEMCO\u2019s motion in part, concluding that genuine issues of fact existed as to whether S&amp;P could satisfy an exception to the statute of frauds and whether the Program Agreement constituted a final expression of the parties\u2019 agreement such that the parol evidence rule would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b67 At trial, the District Court instructed the jury, over STEMCO\u2019s objections, on the doctrines of part performance and promissory estoppel as possible exceptions to the statute of frauds. The court rejected STEMCO\u2019s proposed instruction on promissory estoppel that would have included a requirement that S&amp;P prove that STEMCO intentionally misled S&amp;P. The District Court also excluded certain evidence that STEMCO offered to rebut S&amp;P\u2019s claim for damages and to show that S&amp;P lost Kenworth\u2019s business as a result of its own inadequate service rather than anything STEMCO did.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b68 At the close of S&amp;P\u2019s case in chief, STEMCO moved for judgment as a matter of law, contending that insufficient evidence existed to allow a reasonable jury to find that any exception to the statute of frauds applied to the alleged oral contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court denied the motion, concluding that sufficient evidence existed to support a jury finding that either the part performance or promissory estoppel exception applied. The jury found for S&amp;P and awarded it $344,532 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u00b69 The jury also found in favor of STEMCO on its counterclaim against S&amp;P for $63,990.48 worth of inventory it delivered to S&amp;P but for which S&amp;P had not paid. Each party submitted a bill of costs. The court awarded costs to S&amp;P, but denied costs to STEMCO, reasoning that although STEMCO prevailed on its counterclaim, it was not entitled to costs because it did not prevail on the \u201cmain issue in controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b610 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment, applying the criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). <em>Citizens for a Better Flathead v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2016 MT 256, \u00b6 10, 385 Mont. 156, 381 P.3d 555. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Citizens for a Better Flathead, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b611 Whether judgment as a matter of law should be granted or denied is a question of law, and therefore the appropriate standard of review is de novo. <em>Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6 18, 336 Mont. 105, 152 P.3d 727. Judgment as a matter of law is proper only when there is a complete absence of any evidence that would justify submitting an issue to a jury; all such evidence and any legitimate inferences that might be drawn from the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b612 A district court has discretion when it decides how to instruct the jury, and this Court will not reverse a district court on the basis of its instructions absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Cechovic v. Hardin &amp; Assocs., </em>273 Mont. 104, 116, 902 P.2d 520, 527 (1995). Although a district court has broad discretion, the principle that jury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law limits its discretion. <em>Goles v. Neumann, </em>2011 MT 11, \u00b6 9, 359 Mont. 132, 247 P.3d 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u00b613 A district court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible. <em>Stokes v. Ford Motor Co., </em>2013 MT 29, \u00b6 11, 368 Mont. 365, 300 P.3d 648. We thus review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Stokes, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u00b6 14 We review for correctness a district court\u2019s determination whether a party is statutorily entitled to costs. <em>Total Indus. Plant Servs. v. Turner Indus. Grp., LLC, </em>2013 MT 5, \u00b6 61, 368 Mont. 189, 294 P.3d. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">\u00b615 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in denying STEMCO\u2019s motion for summary judgment because the alleged oral contract was barred by the statute of frauds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">\u00b616 The District Court denied STEMCO\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that genuine issues of fact existed as to whether the Program Agreement constituted the final expression of the parties\u2019 agreement and what the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement were. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The court reasoned also that genuine issues of fact existed as to whether S&amp;P could demonstrate that statutory and equitable exceptions shielded the alleged oral contract from the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"A8M\">\u00b617 STEMCO argues that it was entitled to summary judgment because the Program Agreement constituted a final expression of the parties\u2019 agreement and the parol evidence rule barred evidence of the alleged oral contract. STEMCO contends that the doctrines of part performance and promissory estoppel do not exempt the alleged oral contract from the statute of frauds. Even if promissory estoppel could be invoked, STEMCO claims that Montana law permits the doctrine to defeat the statute of frauds only when the party asserting promissory estoppel shows that the promisor engaged in fraud or intentional deception, which S&amp;P did not allege.</p>\n<p id=\"AC2\">\u00b618 The parties agree that the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) applies to their contractual relationship, but they also cite to general contract law to support their arguments. The UCC applies to \u201ctransactions in goods.\u201d Section 30-2-102, MCA. \u201cGoods\u201d include \u201call things... which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale.\u201d Section 30-2-105, MCA. The agreement between the parties involves the sale of brake linings from STEMCO to S&amp;P and the sale of remanufactured brakes from S&amp;P to Kenworth. The brake linings and remanufactured brakes constitute moveable goods under \u00a7 30-2-105, MCA. The alleged oral contract thus pertains to \u201ctransactions in goods\u201d and falls within the ambit of the UCC. Section 30-2-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AfzT\">\u00b619 Montana\u2019s UCC statute of frauds governs contracts for transactions in goods. It provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Section 30-2-201(1), MCA. It is undisputed that the goods transacted between the parties exceeded $500 in price.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">A. Whether the Program Agreement was a final expression of the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\u00b620 When the parties have entered into a written agreement and one party asserts the existence of an additional oral contract, the UCC parol evidence rule may apply to bar evidence of the alleged oral contract. That rule provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Section 30-2-202, MCA. This statute requires that a court make an \u201cinitial determination\u201d whether the parties intended a written document to constitute the final expression of their agreement. <em>Norwest Bank Billings v. Murnion, </em>210 Mont. 417, 423, 684 P.2d 1067, 1071 (1984). The presence of a \u201cclear and unequivocal promise\u201d in writing may indicate the parties\u2019 intent that the writing constitutes a final expression of their agreement. <em>Norwest Bank Billings, </em>210 Mont. at 426, 684 P.2d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b621 The parol evidence rule bars evidence of oral agreements only \u201cwhen the terms of a written agreement indicate the intent of the parties that the written memorialization represents the complete and final agreement between the <em>parties.\u201d Brimstone Mining, Inc. v. Glaus, </em>2003 MT 236, \u00b6 46, 317 Mont. 236, 77 P.3d 175. \u201cIf it is determined that the parties did not intend the writing to be final with respect to the terms expressed therein,\u201d then the parol evidence rule does not apply, and a court may admit parol evidence \u201cto elucidate the true nature of the parties\u2019 agreement <em>\u201d Norwest Bank Billings, </em>210 Mont. at 424, 684 P.2d at 1071. This is consistent with the principle that if the language of a purported contract is ambiguous, \u201ca factual determination must be made as to the parties\u2019 intent in entering into the contract.\u201d <em>Mary J. Baker Revocable Trust v. Cenex Harvest States, Coops., Inc., </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6 19, 338 Mont. 41, 164 P.3d 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b622 The Program Agreement S&amp;P signed states in part, <em>\u201cTo qualify </em>for the STEMCO Duroline CRM Program, you hereby agree to the following.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The document then lists five policies that STEMCO requires its \u201cauthorized remanufacturers\u201d to follow. The Program Agreement provides also, \u201cTo get more information or <em>to become an authorized brake remanufacturer, </em>contact your local STEMCO Duroline Regional Sales Manager. This program is subject to change, or may be discontinued at any time.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"AXB0\">f 23 The District Court held that the Program Agreement\u2019s language creates doubt as to whether the parties intended it as a \u201cfinal expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein.\u201d Section 30-2-202, MCA. The language indicates that S&amp;P would need to take further action in order to become an authorized brake remanufacturer. The document does not set forth any obligation assumed by STEMCO or reflect a \u201cclear and unequivocal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>promise\u201d between S&amp;P and STEMCO. <em>Norwest Bank Billings, </em>210 Mont. at 426, 684 P.2d at 1072. We agree with the court\u2019s \u201cinitial determination\u201d that the Program Agreement did not clearly evidence a final expression of the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>Norwest Bank Billings, </em>210 Mont. at 423, 684 P.2d at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"AU0Y\">\u00b624 Once the court made this initial determination, it properly denied summary judgment and allowed the jury to consider evidence \u201cto elucidate the true nature of the parties\u2019 agreement.\u201d <em>Norwest Bank Billings, </em>210 Mont. at 424, 684 P.2d at 1071. The District Court did not err in concluding that a genuine issue of fact existed on the question whether the Program Agreement represented a final expression of the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">B. Whether STEMCO was entitled to summary judgment on S&amp;P\u2019s claim that part performance exempted the alleged oral contract from the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b625 The District Court declined to award summary judgment to STEMCO on this ground because STEMCO had not adequately briefed the issue. Because the court allowed this claim to go to the jury, we address it later in this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">C. Whether the promissory estoppel doctrine was available to S&amp;P as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">\u00b626 The District Court also held that a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether S&amp;P could satisfy one or more exceptions to the statute of frauds. STEMCO argues that the promissory estoppel doctrine was not available to S&amp;P as a matter of law, and thus that it should have been awarded summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">\u00b627 The statute of frauds provides that a contract that does not satisfy the writing requirement still may be enforceable under certain enumerated circumstances. Section 30-2-201(3), MCA. The statute does not explicitly name promissory estoppel as an exception. But a separate UCC provision, titled \u201cSupplementary general principles of law applicable,\u201d provides, \u201cUnless displaced by the particular provisions of this code, the principles of law and equity, including ... estoppel... shall supplement its provisions.\u201d Section 30-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A_8O\">\u00b628 Relying on \u00a7 30-1-103, MCA, this Court has allowed estoppel to be raised to defeat the statute of frauds in a UCC case. <em>N.W. Potato Sales v. Beck, </em>208 Mont. 310, 317, 678 P.2d 1138, 1141 (1984). <em>InNorthwest Potato Sales, </em>we held that estoppel by silence applied to enforce an oral contract otherwise barred by the UCC statute of frauds. <em>N.W. Potato Sales, </em>208 Mont. at 317, 678 P.2d at 1141. We reasoned that \u201c[t]he UCC expressly mentions estoppel as one of the general principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>law that supplement the UCC (Section 30-1-103, MCA), unless other parts of the UCC expressly displace that principle. Here no provision of the UCC states that estoppel cannot be applied to defeat a statute of frauds defense.\u201d N.W. <em>Potato Sales, </em>208 Mont. at 315-16, 678 P.2d at 1140-41. We observed that equitable estoppel, promissory estoppel, and estoppel by silence all are recognized doctrines under Montana law that \u201cblend with each <em>other.\u201d N.W. Potato Sales, </em>208 Mont. at 316-17, 678 P.2d at 1141 (citing <em>Keil v. Glacier Park, Inc., </em>188 Mont. 455, 614 P.2d 502 (1980)). Although we observed that the facts also \u201cmay fit... equitable estoppel,\u201d we rested our decision on estoppel by silence, the theory applicable in that case. N.<em>W. Potato Sales, </em>208 Mont. at 317, 678 P.2d at 1141. We did not address whether promissory estoppel might also apply to enforce a contract otherwise barred by the UCC statute of frauds. <em>N.W. Potato Sales, </em>208 Mont. at 317, 678 P.2d at 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b629 Outside the UCC context, we have held that where a contract clearly is within the statute of frauds, promissory estoppel is inapplicable, unless the statute would otherwise operate to perpetuate a fraud. <em>Schwedes v. Romain, </em>179 Mont. 466, 473-74, 587 P.2d 388, 392 (1978). We decided <em>Schwedes </em>under general contract law principles. <em>Schwedes, </em>179 Mont. at 470-71, 587 P.2d at 390-91. \u201cWith the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code, however, litigation arising out of a transaction\u201d for the sale of goods \u201cshould be controlled by the principles of the Code, with the law of contract being used only to supplement Code provisions.\u201d <em>Norwest Bank Billings, </em>210 Mont. at 422-23, 684 P.2d at 1070. Here, the alleged oral contract pertains to transactions in goods, and the principles of the UCC apply. The statutes governing contracts generally, found in Title 28, MCA, do not contain a provision like \u00a7 30-1-103, MCA. Our holding in <em>Schwedes, </em>which applies to transactions covered by general contract law, therefore is not determinative. Contrary to our holding in <em>Schwedes, </em>we had \u201cno difficulty\u201d in <em>Northwest Potato Sales </em>concluding that estoppel may apply to a UCC statute of frauds transaction, based on \u00a7 30-1-103, MCA. <em>N.W. Potato Sales, </em>208 Mont. at 315, 678 P.2d at 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"A34\">\u00b630 A majority of jurisdictions have adopted the rule that promissory estoppel may remove an oral contract from the requirements of the UCC statute of frauds. 10 Samuel Williston, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Contracts </em>\u00a7 27:18, 250 (Richard A. Lord ed., 4th ed. 2011); <em>e.g., B&amp;W Glass v. Weather Shield Mfg., </em>829 P.2d 809, 814 (Wyo. 1992); <em>Allied Grape Growers v. Bronco Wine Co., </em>249 Cal. Rptr. 872, 878 (Cal. Ct. App. 5th 1988). These jurisdictions rely on UCC \u00a7 1-103 (the equivalent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>of \u00a7 30-1-103, MCA), which states, \u201cUnless displaced by the particular provisions of this code, the principles of law and equity, including ... estoppel,\u201d may supplement the UCC\u2019s provisions. The majority jurisdictions reason that because promissory estoppel is not explicitly displaced by any particular provision of the UCC, \u00a7 1-103 allows for promissory estoppel to supplement the UCC statute of frauds. <em>See, e.g., B&amp;W Glass, </em>829 P.2d at 814 <em>(citing Allen M. Campbell Co., Gen. Contractors, Inc. v. Va. Metal Indus., Inc., </em>708 F.2d 930 (4th Cir. 1983); <em>Ralston Purina Co. v. McCollum, </em>611 S.W.2d 201 (Ark. Ct. App. 1981); <em>Potter v. Hatter Farms, Inc., </em>641 P.2d 628 (Or. Ct. App. 1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b631 In addition, courts from other jurisdictions have cited our holding in <em>Northwest Potato Sales </em>as support for the proposition that promissory estoppel \u2014 not just estoppel by silence \u2014 may serve as an exception to the UCC statute of frauds. <em>Hoffmann v. Boone, </em>708 F. Supp. 78, 81 (S.D.N.Y. 1989); B&amp;W <em>Glass, </em>829 P.2d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u00b632 We have referred to other jurisdictions when interpreting a \u201cuniform act\u201d in order to \u201ceffectuate the general purpose of making uniform the [law] among states enacting it.\u201d <em>McCone Cnty. Fed. Credit Union v. Gribble, </em>2009 MT 290, \u00b6 23, 352 Mont. 254, 216 P.3d 206. We find the reasoning of these courts persuasive and consistent with our own previous construction of \u00a7 30-1-103, MCA. Like other forms of estoppel, promissory estoppel is not \u201cdisplaced by the particular provisions\u201d of the UCC. Section 30-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AUgv\">\u00b633 We therefore conclude that promissory estoppel may apply to remove a transaction from the UCC statute of frauds. The District Court thus did not err in denying STEMCO summary judgment and allowing the question whether S&amp;P could satisfy the promissory estoppel exception to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b634 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in submitting the questions of part performance and promissory estoppel to the jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">\u00b635 Having concluded that the Program Agreement did not clearly evidence the final expression of the parties\u2019 agreement, the District Court permitted S&amp;P to introduce evidence at trial of the alleged oral contract over STEMCO\u2019s ongoing objection. At the close of S&amp;P\u2019s case in chief, the District Court denied STEMCO\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, reasoning that sufficient evidence existed to warrant the jury in finding that both the promissory estoppel and part performance exceptions applied to the alleged oral contract. STEMCO argues that the statute of frauds rendered the alleged oral contract unenforceable and that neither the part performance nor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>promissory estoppel exceptions applied to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">A. Part Performance</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b636 STEMCO argues that the part performance exception to the statute of frauds does not apply to the alleged oral contract. STEMCO asserts that even if the part performance doctrine did apply, S&amp;P\u2019s actions after the creation of the alleged oral contract did not constitute part performance. S&amp;P argues in response that it made substantial investments in reliance on the contract, and that these investments constituted S&amp;P\u2019s part performance of the contract,</p>\n<p id=\"Ax9\">f 37 Among the enumerated exceptions to the UCC statute of frauds, a contract that does not satisfy the writing requirement still may be enforceable \u201cwith respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted.\u201d Section 30-2-201(3)(c), MCA. The comments to the Montana UCC explain that \u201c \u2018[p]artial performance\u2019 as a substitute for the required memorandum can validate the contract <em>only </em>for the goods which have been accepted or for which payment has been made and accepted.\u201d Section 30-2-201, MCA, cmt. 2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u00b638 S&amp;P\u2019s theory was that STEMCO promised that S&amp;P would retain the right to sell remanufactured brakes to Kenworth for a period of five years. S&amp;P argued that because it invested heavily in inventory, facilities, equipment, and personnel in reliance on the oral agreement, STEMCO should not be allowed to repudiate the agreement because it was not in writing. S&amp;P relies on cases outside the UCC to argue that partial performance may render an oral contract enforceable. <em>See Morton v. </em>Lanier, 2002 MT 214, 311 Mont. 301, 55 P.3d 380; <em>Quirin v. Weinberg, </em>252 Mont. 386, 830 P.2d 537 (1992); <em>Somont Oil Co. v. Nutter, </em>228 Mont. 467, 743 P.2d 1016 (1987). But \u201clitigation arising out of a transaction\u201d for the sale of goods, like the transaction here, \u201cshould be controlled by the principles\u201d of the UCC. <em>Norwest Bank Billings, </em>210 Mont. at 422, 684 P.2d at 1070. Unlike estoppel, the principle of partial performance is \u201cdisplaced by the particular provisions of [the UCC].\u201d Section 30-1-103, MCA. The \u201cpart performance\u201d exception to the UCC statute of frauds is much more limited than the part performance doctrine outside the UCC context. STEMCO\u2019s alleged promise for a five-year arrangement does not pertain to \u201cgoods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted.\u201d Section 3 0-2-20 l(3)(c), MCA. S&amp;P thus cannot rely on a \u201cpartial performance\u201d exception to exempt the alleged oral contract from the UCC statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"Ath\">\u00b639 The District Court erred in denying STEMCO\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>judgment as a matter of law to the extent that it relied on the part performance exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">B. Promissory Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u00b640 STEMCO challenges the District Court\u2019s determination that sufficient evidence existed to support a jury finding that S&amp;P met the required elements of promissory estoppel. STEMCO contends that S&amp;P was required to demonstrate that STEMCO intended to mislead S&amp;P and that no such evidence was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u00b641 S&amp;P presented testimony at trial from Joe Smith, a STEMCO representative, that Smith met with S&amp;P\u2019s owner, Joe Hoppman, to discuss making S&amp;P an authorized remanufacturer. Smith testified that he guaranteed Hoppman that if S&amp;P became an authorized remanufacturer, S&amp;P would retain the right to sell remanufactured brakes to Kenworth for a period of five years. S&amp;P introduced evidence of the investments it made after the alleged oral contract was formed, and offered testimony that such investments were made in reliance on STEMCO\u2019s promise. Hoppman and S&amp;P\u2019s sales manager, Tony Parish, testified that they told Smith prior to the formation of the oral contract that S&amp;P would have to invest a substantial amount of money in brake parts, remanufacturing equipment, and additional storage space in Salt Lake City in order to meet Kenworth\u2019s demand for remanufactured brakes. S&amp;P presented testimony that when it lost Kenworth\u2019s sales, S&amp;P incurred substantial economic losses in the form of wasted overhead expenses on excess inventory, lost sales, and a long-term lease on a warehouse it no longer needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u00b642 STEMCO argued that the evidence was insufficient because promissory estoppel requires a showing that the promisor intended to mislead the promisee. It proposed an instruction that would have included a requirement that \u201cSTEMCO had an intent to mislead S&amp;P Brake Supply, or a willingness that S&amp;P Brake Supply would be deceived, and S&amp;P Brake Supply was misled to the extent that applying the statute of frauds would operate to perpetrate a fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Al8S\">\u00b643 The District Court denied STEMCO\u2019s proposed instruction. It instructed the jury that the promissory estoppel doctrine served as an exception to the statute of frauds and that S&amp;P had to prove the following elements: \u201c(1) a promise clear and unambiguous in its terms; (2) reliance on the promise by the party to whom the promise was made; (3) reasonableness and foreseeability of the reliance; and (4) the party asserting the reliance must be injured by the reliance.\u201d STEMCO argues on appeal that the court erroneously refused its instruction on a fifth element.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\u00b644 This Court has held that a party asserting promissory estoppel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>must prove four elements: a clear and unambiguous promise, reliance by the promisee, reasonableness and foreseeability of the reliance, and resulting injury to the promisee. <em>Turner v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>2012 MT 213, \u00b6 24, 366 Mont. 285, 291 P.3d 1082 (citing <em>Keil, </em>188 Mont. at 462, 614 P.2d at 506). We held in <em>Northwest Potato Sales </em>that estoppel by silence requires an additional showing of an intent to mislead, because \u201cmere silence cannot work an <em>estoppel.\u201d N.W. Potato Sales, </em>208 Mont. at 317, 678 P.2d at 1141. But, although they are related doctrines, equitable estoppel, promissory estoppel, and estoppel by silence are \u201cthree legally distinct estoppel claims,\u201d and we have \u201ccreated multi-factor tests for each of those three distinct estoppel claims.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>\u00b6 22. Unlike estoppel by silence, promissory estoppel requires an express \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d promise. <em>Turner, </em>\u00b6 24. This element obviates the concern about \u201cmere silence\u201d working an estoppel. The elements of promissory estoppel are distinct from the elements of estoppel by silence. We declined in <em>Turner </em>to \u201cmerge\u201d the elements of equitable estoppel and promissory estoppel, <em>Turner, </em>\u00b6 23, and we decline here to merge the elements of promissory estoppel and estoppel by silence. Our case law establishes that promissory estoppel does not require a showing of an intent to mislead. The District Court thus \u201cfully and fairly instructed] the jury\u201d on the elements of promissory estoppel. <em>Goles, </em>\u00b6 9. It did not abuse its discretion in refusing STEMCO\u2019s proposed instruction. <em>See Goles, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"Adv\">\u00b645 We conclude that the District Court properly submitted S&amp;P\u2019s promissory estoppel claim to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b646 <em>3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in excluding evidence proffered by STEMCO to rebut S&amp;P\u2019s breach of contract and damages claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b647 STEMCO attempted to elicit testimony at trial regarding \u201ccore credits\u201d that S&amp;P owed to Kenworth. Kenworth accumulated \u201ccore credits\u201d by delivering used brake \u201ccores\u201d to S&amp;P, which in turn used the cores in its brake remanufacturing process. S&amp;P would credit Kenworth\u2019s account balance for the value of these cores. STEMCO sought to introduce testimony that S&amp;P owed unpaid \u201ccore credits\u201d to Kenworth and that S&amp;P had failed to provide Kenworth with \u201ccore credit reports\u201d in a timely manner. STEMCO attempted further to elicit testimony and admit evidence regarding the sales that Gorilla Brake, S&amp;P\u2019s replacement, made to Kenworth after Kenworth broke ties with S&amp;P.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u00b648 The District Court prohibited STEMCO from eliciting testimony that S&amp;P owed money to Kenworth in the form of these \u201ccore credits.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>The court reasoned that this issue was not relevant to the case at hand, and that it did not wish to \u201copen the door to trying a case concerning S&amp;P and Kenworth.\u201d The District Court also excluded testimony and evidence of Gorilla Brake\u2019s sales to Kenworth, reasoning that such evidence was irrelevant and that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b649 STEMCO argues on appeal that the District Court erred by excluding evidence and testimony of the \u201ccore credits\u201d S&amp;P owed to Kenworth and of Gorilla Brake\u2019s sales of remanufactured brakes to Kenworth. It contends that evidence of the \u201ccore credits\u201d S&amp;P owed to Kenworth was relevant to rebut S&amp;P\u2019s claim of lost profits by showing that S&amp;P owed money to Kenworth. This evidence was relevant also, in STEMCO\u2019s view, to show that S&amp;P lost Kenworth\u2019s business as a result of its own poor service rather than as a result of STEMCO\u2019s alleged breach of contract. STEMCO claims that the District Court\u2019s exclusion of this evidence prejudiced its ability to demonstrate that S&amp;P lost Kenworth\u2019s business because of S&amp;P\u2019s own failings and not because of STEMCO\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u00b650 STEMCO argues that the evidence of Gorilla Brake\u2019s sales to Kenworth was relevant to rebut S&amp;P\u2019s damages claim. S&amp;P had based its lost profits calculation on its history of sales to Kenworth. STEMCO contends that Gorilla Brake\u2019s actual sales of remanufactured brakes to Kenworth would have provided a more accurate basis for calculating the sales S&amp;P could have expected to make to Kenworth had it kept Kenworth\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u00b651 Montana law provides that relevant evidence is generally admissible. M. R. Evid. 402. But relevant evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by... confusion of the issues, ... misleading the jury, ... [or] waste of time.\u201d M. R. Evid. 403. A district court does not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence that it reasonably determines is \u201cnot probative of the central issues in the case\u201d and \u201cwould likely lead to unnecessary confusion.\u201d <em>Tarlton v. Kaufman, </em>2008 MT 462, \u00b6 39, 348 Mont. 178, 199 P.3d 263. Even if a court abuses its discretion in an evidentiary ruling, that abuse \u201cdoes not necessarily constitute reversible error.\u201d <em>In re A.N., </em>2000 MT 35, \u00b6 55, 298 Mont. 237, 995 P.2d 427. A court\u2019s exclusion of evidence constitutes reversible error only if \u201ca substantial right of the party is affected.\u201d M. R. Evid. 103(a). We have held that a substantial right of a party is not affected unless the challenged evidence is \u201cof such character to have affected the result\u201d of the case. <em>In re A.N., </em>\u00b6 55 (citation and internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u00b652 Here, the District Court concluded that evidence of the \u201ccore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>credits\u201d that S&amp;P owed to Kenworth and of Gorilla Brake\u2019s sales to Kenworth did not directly pertain to the central issue in the case \u2014 a breach of contract dispute between S&amp;P and STEMCO. Kenworth and Gorilla Brake were not parties to the action. The court expressed concern that allowing STEMCO to introduce evidence regarding S&amp;P\u2019s business dealings with Kenworth or Kenworth\u2019s transactions with Gorilla Brake would consume a substantial amount of time and lead to a mini-trial about issues collateral to the case. The District Court\u2019s rulings are entitled to broad deference on appeal. <em>Stokes, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b653 The District Court did not prevent STEMCO from introducing evidence to support its contention that S&amp;P lost Kenworth\u2019s business as a result of its own failings rather than anything STEMCO did. The court permitted STEMCO to introduce an email from Mike McKay, a Kenworth employee, to Tony Parish, S&amp;P\u2019s sales manager, in which McKay complained about S&amp;P\u2019s failure to provide \u201ccore reports\u201d upon request. McKay notified Parish of Kenworth\u2019s dissatisfaction with S&amp;P and suggested that S&amp;P might lose Kenworth\u2019s business as a result. The court admitted deposition testimony from McKay and another Kenworth employee, William Peterson, that Kenworth stopped buying remanufactured brakes from S&amp;P because of the poor quality of the brakes and because of S&amp;P\u2019s delays in shipping product to Kenworth.</p>\n<p id=\"AJq7\">\u00b654 Despite the District Court\u2019s exclusion of some of STEMCO\u2019s proferred evidence, STEMCO was able to present a defense that S&amp;P lost Kenworth\u2019s business because of S&amp;P\u2019s own failings and not because of STEMCO\u2019s actions. STEMCO has not persuaded us that the court\u2019s exclusion of evidence affected its substantial rights or the outcome of the case. <em>See </em>M. R. Evid. 103(a); <em>In re A.N., </em>\u00b6 55. The court likewise did not abuse its discretion in determining that evidence of the \u201ccore credits\u201d S&amp;P owed to Kenworth and of Gorilla Brake\u2019s sales to Kenworth would have confused the issues, was not relevant to the central issues in the case, and was therefore inadmissible. <em>See Stokes, </em>\u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b655 <em>4. Whether the District Court erred in denying costs to STEMCO for prevailing on its counterclaim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u00b656 The District Court awarded costs to S&amp;P, but denied them to STEMCO. The court reasoned that even though STEMCO prevailed on its counterclaim, S&amp;P prevailed on the \u201cmain issue in controversy\u201d \u2014 its breach of contract claim against STEMCO. The court thus concluded that S&amp;P was the only party entitled to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\u00b657 STEMCO argues that the District Court erred in failing to award costs to STEMCO. In STEMCO\u2019s view, it was entitled to costs because the jury awarded it the full balance of its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u00b658 Montana law provides that \u201c[c]osts are allowed, of course, to the plaintiff upon a judgment in the plaintiffs favor in the following cases: ... (3) in an action for the recovery of money or damages, exclusive of interest, when plaintiff recovers over $50.\u201d Section 25-10-101(3), MCA. We have held that if \u201ca party initiates a law suit [sic], the defendant counterclaims, and the judgment awards both parties part of the relief they seek, the party prevailing on the main issue in controversy in the case must be allowed costs.\u201d <em>Medhus v. Butter, </em>184 Mont. 437, 447, 603 P.2d 669, 674 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"A1qC\">\u00b659 S&amp;P initiated the breach of contract lawsuit against STEMCO, and STEMCO counterclaimed. The judgment awarded \u201cboth parties part of the relief they [sought].\u201d <em>Medhus, </em>184 Mont. at 447, 603 P.2d at 674. The jury\u2019s verdict awarded S&amp;P relief on the breach of contract claim but not on STEMCO\u2019s counterclaim. Likewise, STEMCO did not prevail on all of its claims. It lost the argument that it did not breach an oral contract with S&amp;P. That was the theory that led to a net judgment in favor of S&amp;P. S&amp;P prevailed \u201con the main issue in controversy in the case\u201d \u2014 its claim that STEMCO breached an oral contract. <em>Medhus, </em>184 Mont. at 447, 603 P.2d at 674; <em>cf. Rod &amp; Rifle Inn v. Giltrap, </em>273 Mont. 232, 236, 902 P.2d 38, 41 (1995) (holding that where jury found neither party entitled to recover damages, defendant prevailed on the main issue in controversy by defeating plaintiffs claim for breach of contract damages). As such, S&amp;P was entitled to costs. <em>Medhus, </em>184 Mont. at 447, 603 P.2d at 674; <em>see also Lewistown Miller Constr. Co. v. Martin, </em>2011 MT 325, \u00b6 32, 363 Mont. 208, 271 P.3d 48 (holding that where plaintiff obtained a net judgment in its favor and defendant won on its counterclaim, defendant was not the prevailing party and was not entitled to contractual attorney fees). Because STEMCO did not prevail on the main issue in controversy, it was not entitled to costs. The District Court was correct in denying costs to STEMCO. <em>See Total Indus. Plant Servs., </em>\u00b6 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u00b660 We conclude that the statute of frauds did not bar the alleged oral contract. The District Court correctly determined that a genuine issue of fact existed as to the parties\u2019 intent in entering into an agreement. The court properly admitted evidence of STEMCO\u2019s promise that formed the alleged oral contract. Although the court improperly submitted the question of part performance to the jury, the evidence was sufficient for the court to allow the jury to consider promissory estoppel. The court correctly instructed the jury on the four elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>of promissory estoppel and properly refused STEMCO\u2019s proposed instruction including a fifth element of intent to mislead.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b661 We conclude further that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding STEMCO\u2019s proffered evidence of \u201ccore credits\u201d and Gorilla Brake\u2019s sales, based on its conclusion that the evidence was not probative of the central issues in the case and was likely to confuse the jury. Finally, STEMCO did not prevail on the main issue in controversy \u2014 the breach of contract claim \u2014 and therefore was not entitled to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u00b662 The District Court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b530-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\"> The parties refer in their briefs to STEMCO\u2019s M.
