Shepp appeals an order of the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, denying his motion to suppress the results of a blood test that led to his conviction for Driving Under the Influence (DUI). We address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-26\">\n<em>Whether or not the District Court erred by denying Shepp\u2019s motion to suppress the results of his blood test.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-27\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b63 On September 19, 2014, Ravalli County Deputy Sheriff Gordy Jessop pulled Shepp over after observing Shepp fail to signal a turn. Deputy Jessop asked Shepp if he had been drinking, and Shepp responded that he had \u201cfive or six beers\u201d before driving. Deputy Jessop conducted a series of field sobriety tests and asked Shepp to consent to a preliminary breath test. Shepp refused. Deputy Jessop then asked Shepp to consent to a blood test at Marcus Daly Memorial Hospital in Hamilton. After several minutes of indecision, Shepp stated: \u201cSure, I\u2019ll take the blood test.\u201d Deputy Jessop helped Shepp into his patrol car and explained the blood test procedure, to which Shepp responded: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b64 When he arrived at the hospital, Shepp was given a \u201cPatient Consent and Financial Agreement\u201d (Patient Consent Form) to sign. The Patient Consent Form provided: \u201cI consent to the treatment and procedures to be performed in connection with my inpatient, outpatient and/or emergency medical treatment at Marcus Daly Memorial Hospital....\u201d After Shepp studied the Patient Consent Form for several minutes without signing it, Deputy Jessop took it from him and signed on the signature line. Seconds later, Shepp\u2019s blood was drawn. Shepp did not verbally or physically resist the blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b65 On September 19, 2014, the State charged Shepp in the Ravalli County Justice Court with DUI in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. Shepp filed a motion to suppress the results of his blood test, which the Justice Court denied. Shepp then pled guilty, reserving his right to appeal the Justice Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. On May 14, 2015, Shepp filed a notice of appeal in the District Court. On June 18, 2015, Shepp filed a motion to suppress, asking the District Court to suppress the results of his blood test and dismiss the case. On July 13, 2015, the District Court held a suppression hearing, during which both Shepp and Deputy Jessop testified. On July 20, 2015, the District Court issued an order denying Shepp\u2019s motion to suppress. Shepp appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\u00b66 An appeal from a justice court that is not a court of record \u201cmust be tried anew in the district court on the papers filed in the justice\u2019s ... court unless the [district] court, for good cause shown and on terms that are just, allows other or amended pleadings to be filed in the action.\u201d Section 25-33-301(1), MCA. Additionally, \u201c[e]ach party has the benefit of all legal objections made in the justice\u2019s... court.\u201d Section 25-33-301(1), MCA. Thus, the parties\u2019justice court filings are subsumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>into the district court record. In all other ways, the district court acts as a trial court \u2014 rather than an intermediate appellate court \u2014 and we review its decision applying the same standards that we would to any other district court decision. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 25-3.3-301(2), MCA (\u201cWhen the action is tried anew on appeal, the trial must be conducted in all respects as other trials in the district court.\u201d) (applying to appeals from justice courts that are not courts of record), <em>with State v. Hodge, </em>2014 MT 308, \u00b6 11, 377 Mont. 123, 339 P.3d 8 (\u201cIn an appeal from a justice court established as a court of record, the district court functions as an intermediate appellate court and, as such, is confined to review of the record and questions of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to suppress \u201cto determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court correctly interpreted and applied the law to those facts.\u201d <em>State v. Wagner, </em>2013 MT 159, \u00b6 9, 370 Mont. 381, 303 P.3d 285. \u201cA factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the court made a mistake.\u201d <em>State v. Brave, </em>2016 MT 178, \u00b6 6, 384 Mont. 169, 376 P.3d 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u00b68 <em>Whether or not the District Court erred by denying Shepp\u2019s motion to suppress the results of his blood test.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u00b69 Shepp concedes that he verbally consented to a blood test at the scene of the stop but contends he withdrew his consent by not signing the Patient Consent Form. \u201cWe have held that certain uncooperative actions by the motorist may comprise a refusal. A refusal to take a blood test does not have to be express but may be implied ....\u201d <em>Wessell v. State, </em>277 Mont. 234, 239, 921 P.2d 264, 266 (1996) (citing <em>Johnson v. Division of Motor Vehicles, </em>219 Mont. 310, 711 P.2d 815 (1985) (holding that a defendant impliedly refused to take a breath test by continuing to ask for an attorney to be present before the test)); <em>see Hunter v. State, </em>264 Mont. 84, 869 P.2d 787 (1994) (holding that a defendant impliedly refused to take a breath test because she was capable of completing the test but gave a deficient performance). Shepp contends that the facts of this case are analogous to the facts of <em>Hunter </em>and <em>Johnson. </em>The District Court rejected this argument, holding that Shepp gave express verbal consent to a blood test and never withdrew that consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">\u00b610 In reachingits decision, the District Court found: \u201cShepp admitted he never informed Deputy Jessop or hospital personnel that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>changed his mind and withdrawn his consent, nor did he give any verbal indication that he refused consent.\u201d This finding also is supported by Shepp\u2019s testimony at the July 13, 2015 suppression hearing, from which the District Court further found that Shepp gave contradictory testimony regarding whether he intended to revoke his consent to a blood test: initially, Shepp testified that he changed his mind about consenting to the blood test, but then testified that he could not decide whether to sign the Patient Consent Form because he was not sure how best to protect himself. The District Court determined that Shepp\u2019s latter testimony was more credible. We repeatedly have held that \u201c[i]t is not this Court\u2019s function, on appeal, to reweigh conflicting evidence or substitute our evaluation of the evidence for that of the district court.\u201d <em>State v. Deines, </em>2009 MT 179, \u00b6 20, 351 Mont. 1, 208 P.3d 857 (quoting <em>State v. Gittens, </em>2008 MT 55, \u00b6 27, 341 Mont. 450, 178 P.3d 91). Rather, \u201c[w]e defer to the district court in cases involving conflicting testimony because we recognize that the court had the benefit of observing the demeanor of witnesses and rendering a determination of the credibility of those witnesses.\u201d <em>Deines, </em>\u00b6 20 (quoting <em>Gittens, </em>\u00b6 27). The District Court thus properly weighed the credibility of Shepp\u2019s testimony, and we will not disturb its finding on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Atoo\">\u00b611 Finally, the District Court found that the Patient Consent Form has no bearing on consent under Montana\u2019s DUI law. The District Court found that the Patient Consent Form is \u201can agreement between the hospital and its patients that encompasses issues regarding treatment, services, and payment.\u201d We agree with the District Court\u2019s assessment, and note that Shepp has not pointed to any evidence to contradict this finding. The District Court\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous, and the District Court correctly interpreted and applied the law to those facts. <em>See Wagner, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b6 12 The District Court\u2019s order denying Shepp\u2019s motion to suppress the results of his blood test is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
