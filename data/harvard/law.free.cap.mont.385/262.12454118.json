We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\"><em>Issue one: Did the Water Court err in its interpretation of the 1906 Decree in the case of Montana Water, Electric and Mining Co. v. </em>Schuh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\"><em>Issue two: Did the Water Court err in deciding whether to apply claim preclusion doctrines to limit Granite County\u2019s arguments concerning application of the </em>Schuh Decree?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">\u00b63 This case arises from McDonald\u2019s objection to three water right claims owned by Granite County, 76GJ 40733-00, 76GJ 94401-00, and 76GJ 94402-00. The County\u2019s water claims all involve its storage of Flint Creek water in Georgetown Lake reservoir. McDonald claims senior water rights in the natural flow of Flint Creek, which she diverts from the Creek below Georgetown Lake. Both the County claims and McDonald\u2019s objections arise from the terms of the 1906 Decree in <em>Montana Water, Electric and Mining Co. v. Schuh, </em>by the Circuit Court of the United States, Ninth Circuit, District of Montana. Both parties are successors in interest to water rights decreed to parties in the <em>Schuh </em>case. Granite County is a successor to the plaintiff Montana Water, Electric and Mining Company, and McDonald is a successor to one of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">\u00b64 The County\u2019s predecessors built a dam on Flint Creek, creating a reservoir now known as Georgetown Lake. The purpose of the reservoir was to generate electric power. The County owns the dam and hydroelectric facility, which it acquired from the Montana Power Company in 1997. The operation of the facility is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Two of the County\u2019s water rights used in the reservoir-hydroelectric facility arise from the <em>Schuh </em>Decree while the third is a subsequent use right. The County\u2019s rights total 1200 miner\u2019s inches<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or 30 cubic feet per second. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The water used for power generation is returned to Flint Creek below the dam.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b65 This Court reviews a lower court\u2019s interpretation of a judgment as a question of law to determine whether it is correct. <em>Harland v. Anderson Ranch Co., </em>2004 MT 132, \u00b6 20, 321 Mont. 338, 92 P.3d 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b66 <em>Issue one: Did the Water Court err in its interpretation of the 1906 decree in the case of Montana </em>Water, Electric and Mining Co. v. Schuh?</p>\n<p id=\"AmC\">\u00b67 McDonald objected to the County\u2019s water right claims in proceedings before the Water Court, contending that the <em>Schuh </em>Decree requires the County to maintain a constant flow of 30 CFS in Flint Creek below the Georgetown Lake dam during irrigation season, regardless of the amount of natural flow into the Lake. McDonald requested that \u201cinformation remarks\u201d be included with the abstract of each of the County\u2019s water rights from Flint Creek, to provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">At all times during the irrigation season of each year the owner of this right is to let, turn down and cause to flow into the Flint Creek channel below the power generation facilities not less than 1200 miner\u2019s inches (30 CFS) of water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Granite County counters that the downstream irrigators are entitled to have the natural inflow of Flint Creek released below the dam, but that it is not required to release storage water from the reservoir when the natural inflow from Flint Creek falls below 30 CFS. Granite County contends that its obligation to McDonald is to assure that the natural inflow of Flint Creek passes through Georgetown Lake and the hydroelectric facility for release back into the natural channel.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">\u00b68 The Water Court defined \u201cnatural flow\u201d for purposes of this case as the amount of water that would flow through a stream if there were no interference from the dam. The Water Court defined storage water as impoundment of the natural flow of a stream for use during times of low natural flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">\u00b69 The Water Court considered the terms of the <em>Schuh </em>Decree as it affected the respective rights of the parties, summarized as follows: Georgetown Lake was created in 1901 when the Montana Water, Electric Power and Mining Company (the Company) built a dam across Flint Creek, creating Georgetown Lake. The Company brought the <em>Schuh </em>action because of claims by downstream irrigators that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>reservoir was interfering with their senior water rights. The <em>Schuh </em>Decree determined that the average flow of Flint Creek \u201chas not exceeded and does not exceed\u201d 1200 miner\u2019s inches of water, but the Decree did not define the time of the year covered by that determination. The Water Court construed that flow finding to apply to the natural flow of Flint Creek during the irrigation season because the dispute before the <em>Schuh </em>Court pertained to disputes over irrigation rights. The Water Court determined that the <em>Schuh </em>Court\u2019s reference to an average flow \u201cimpliedly recognizes that natural flows vary from season to season and from year to year, with actual flows often falling either above or below the described average\u201d which is \u201cnormal on Montana streams.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b610 The <em>Schuh </em>Court determined that the Company returned 1200 miner\u2019s inches of water to Flint Creek \u201cwithout deterioration in quality or quantity,\u201d and that the Company had not impeded \u201cthe ordinary and natural flow or passage of the water of said Flint Creek.\u201d Therefore, the <em>Schuh </em>Court concluded that none of the downstream water users had been damaged by operation of the dam and hydroelectric plant. The Water Court determined that these statements by the <em>Schuh </em>Court \u201crecognize that the [downstream water users] rights were based on natural flow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b611 The <em>Schuh </em>Decree also included a determination of the water rights of the downstream appropriators, totaling about 5000 miner\u2019s inches of water. The Decree listed the flow of the appropriation right of each downstream appropriator for irrigation purposes at the water duty of one and one half miner\u2019s inches of water per acre. While most of the downstream rights were senior to the Company\u2019s rights, the Decree did not grant any downstream user a right in the storage water behind the Georgetown Lake dam. The Water court noted that the <em>Schuh </em>Decree entitled the Company to continue using its water rights as long as it \u201cuses the water in such a manner that every appropriator further down the stream shall have, during the irrigating season of each year, the use and enjoyment of it substantially <em>according to its natural flow.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The Water Court reasoned that the term \u201cevery appropriator\u201d must cover only appropriators with rights senior to those held by the Company, because the Company had no duty under the principles of prior appropriation to preserve the flow of Flint Creek for junior appropriators.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b612 The root of the present controversy is the statement in the <em>Schuh </em>Decree that during the irrigation season the Company must \u201clet, turn down and cause to flow in the channel of said creek, to-wit Flint Creek, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>below its electric plant, not less than 1200 miner\u2019s inches of water.\u201d The <em>Schuh </em>Court enjoined the Company from \u201cdiverting from the channel of Flint Creek the water herein decreed to [downstream users].\u201d At the same time, the <em>Schuh </em>Court recognized that the downstream users\u2019 rights were limited to the natural flow of Flint Creek, enjoining them from demanding that the Company release \u201cany greater amount of water than the average natural flow of said stream which in the irrigating season of each year does not exceed 1200 miner\u2019s inches or 30 cubic feet per second of water.\u201d The Water Court determined that this language supported Granite County\u2019s argument that the <em>Schuh </em>Decree did not require it to release storage water to benefit downstream users.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b613 Both sides moved for summary judgment in the Water Court, McDonald relying upon the portion of the <em>Schuh </em>Decree that ordered that 1200 miner\u2019s inches must be discharged into Flint Creek \u201cat all times\u201d during the irrigation season. The Water Court found that McDonald\u2019s position conflicts with the express recognition in the <em>Schuh </em>Decree that the rights of the downstream users were limited to the natural flow of Flint Creek and with the injunction against the downstream users from demanding any more than the natural in-flow of Flint Creek. The Water Court found no indication that the <em>Schuh </em>Court intended to depart from the established Montana precedent that \u201cmakes a clear distinction between the natural flow rights held by McDonald and the storage rights held by Granite County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b614 The Water Court explained that limiting the downstream users to the natural flow of Flint Creek was consistent with established Montana law. The Water Court cited <em>Beaverhead Canal Co. v. Dillon Electric Light &amp; Power, </em>34 Mont. 135, 140, 85 P. 880, 882 (1906) (appropriator\u2019s rights are limited to the natural conditions of the stream at the time of the appropriation); <em>Kelly v. Granite Bi-Metallic, </em>41 Mont. 1, 108 P. 785 (1910) (stored water is not available to satisfy rights of downstream users); <em>Donich v. Johnson, </em>77 Mont. 229, 250 P. 963 (1926) (downstream users had the right to use the natural flow of the stream to the extent of their appropriations); and <em>Federal Land Bank v. Morris, </em>112 Mont. 445, 116 P.2d 1007 (1941) (water released from artificial impoundments is not part of the natural flow). The principle of separating stored water from the natural flow is recognized by Montana statute, \u00a7 85-2-411, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b615 The Water Court summarized the relationship between upstream storage and downstream senior appropriators:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">To summarize, downstream appropriators of irrigation rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>with senior priority dates are entitled to the natural flow of a stream as it existed at the time of appropriation but they cannot demand release of water from storage when natural flows are unavailable. This has long been the rule in Montana. And, although the <em>Schuh </em>Decree did not expressly state this rule, the language of the Decree implicitly recognizes it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">The <em>Schuh </em>Decree\u2019s reference to natural flow was consistent with the law applicable to storage rights. That law required operators of reservoirs to make the natural flow of a stream available to senior downstream appropriators during time of shortage. Under this rule, natural flow can only be stored when there is enough water to satisfy senior rights or when senior rights are not being used. At the same time, the law on storage does not require release of lawfully impounded storage water when natural flows drop below the amounts needed by downstream irrigators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The Water Court also rejected McDonald\u2019s contention that the <em>Schuh </em>Court made a factual finding that \u201cnatural flows in Flint Creek equal 30 CFS every day of the irrigation season.\u201d To the contrary, the Water Court determined that read in context, the <em>Schuh </em>Decree enjoined the downstream users\u2019 demands for water beyond a greater amount of water than the amount of natural flow of the stream above the dam. Further, the Water Court determined that the statement in the Decree that the flow of Flint Creek \u201chas not exceeded and does not exceed twelve hundred (1200) miner\u2019s inches\u201d was only an observation that natural flows <em>average </em>that amount of water. The Water Court determined that the Court in <em>Schuh </em>was undoubtedly aware \u201cthat stream flows vary from year to year and from month to month within the same year.\u201d In conclusion, the Water Court determined that the <em>Schuh </em>Decree\u2019s instruction to release 1200 miner\u2019s inches \u201cat all times\u201d was designed to ensure that whatever the Company used for hydroelectric generation was returned to the stream rather than being diverted elsewhere. \u201cIt was not a literal command to release 1200 miner\u2019s inches every day of the irrigation season regardless of how much water was naturally available in Flint Creek.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b616 Accordingly, the Water Court denied McDonald\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied McDonald\u2019s request to add \u201cinformation remarks\u201d to the statements of the County\u2019s water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"AaN\">\u00b617 Turning to the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Water Court reiterated its construction that the <em>Schuh </em>Decree did not direct that the downstream irrigators receive a benefit\u2014mandatory release of storage water\u2014that the law does not provide. The Water Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>determined that water lawfully impounded in Georgetown Lake is not \u201csubject to a servitude in favor of downstream irrigators requiring releases to supplement the natural flows of Flint Creek.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b618 The Water Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">The Court in Schuh did not intend to obligate the owner of Georgetown Lake to supplement the natural flows of Flint Creek with storage water. Granite County\u2019s water rights are not subject to a condition requiring use of storage water from Georgetown Lake to maintain 30 CFS flows in Flint Creek throughout the irrigation season.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The Water Court granted summary judgment to Granite County, holding that its water claims to Flint Creek \u201care not subject to a servitude in favor of McDonald requiring releases of storage water to supplement the natural flows of Flint Creek.\u201d McDonald appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u00b619 This Court reviews the Water Court\u2019s interpretation of a prior decree as an issue of law, to determine whether it is correct. <em>Harland, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Levens v. Ballard, </em>2011 MT 153, \u00b6 10, 361 Mont. 108, 255 P.3d 195.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">Judgments are to have a reasonable intendment; where a judgment is susceptible of two interpretations the one will be adopted which renders it the more reasonably effective and conclusive and which makes the judgment harmonize with the facts and law of the case. It is imperative, in view of the contradictory findings and conclusions of the court in the Smith and consolidated decrees, to ascertain the intention of the court. A decree will not be construed so as to result in a positive wrong where that result can possibly be avoided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-9\"><em>Gans &amp; Klein v. Sanford, </em>91 Mont. 512, 522, 8 P.2d 808, 811 (1932) (internal citations omitted). When a decree is obscure or ambiguous the reviewing court may \u201crefer to the record in the original case,\u201d <em>Harland, </em>\u00b6 23, and a decree is ambiguous \u201cif reasonable persons differ as to its effect and meaning.\u201d <em>Harland, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">\u00b620 McDonald argues that the <em>Schuh </em>Decree was ambiguous and that the Water Court failed to properly apply the pleadings in that case while interpreting the Decree. She argues that the \u201centire purpose\u201d of the action was to \u201cdetermine a quantified flow\u201d that the dam operator must release for downstream users. To the contrary, the Water Court expressly construed the <em>Schuh </em>Decree to require the County to release the natural inflow of Flint Creek during irrigation season, but to not require release of stored water to do so. This is entirely consistent with the pleadings that McDonald cites.</p>\n<p id=\"acx-dedup-0\">\u00b621  While McDonald also asserts that the Decree should be read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>as expressing the intent to continue the \u201chistoric\u201d operation of the dam, this overlooks the facts that the dam was built in 1901 and the Decree was issued in 1906. So, while there was some record of the operation of the dam before the case was submitted for decision, it can hardly be relied upon as an \u201chistoric\u201d record. The <em>Schuh </em>Decree was clearly issued in the context of established prior appropriation law. The Decree listed the name of each appropriator with rights from Flint Creek for irrigation purposes, along with the flow rate of each right and, by implication, the number of acres to be irrigated based upon the express water duty of one and one half miner\u2019s inches of water per acre. This is similar to many other water adjudication decrees of the early twentieth century under Montana\u2019s law of prior appropriation. <em>Gwyn v. City of Philipsburg, </em>156 Mont. 194, 478 P.2d 855 (1970) (City owned a dam that diverted the outflow of a mountain lake from Fred Burr Creek, into its municipal water system. Upon suit by downstream appropriators on Fred Burr Creek, this Court held that the City was required to release water \u201cnot to exceed\u201d the natural flow from the lake whenever the water in the stream below was less than the amount required to satisfy downstream rights.). The Water Court therefore properly construed the prior Decree by concluding that a downstream appropriator has no rights to water stored behind an upstream dam as long as the dam operator releases the natural inflow into the stream below the dam.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b622 The Water Court was tasked with construing and applying a decree drafted over 100 years ago and did so consistently with the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b623 <em>Issue two: Did the Water Court err in deciding whether to apply claim preclusion doctrines to limit Granite County\u2019s arguments concerning application of the </em>Schuh Decree?</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b624 The Water Court considered McDonald\u2019s argument that principles of claim preclusion estopped the County from contending that it was not required to release 30 CFS from Georgetown Lake continuously during the irrigation season. First, McDonald argued that res judicata barred the County from \u201cattempting to redefine its rights\u201d already determined in the <em>Schuh </em>Decree. The Water Court disagreed, noting that both parties \u201cagree the narrow issue is interpretation of the rights already recognized in the <em>Schuh </em>Decree\u201d and that \u201cI i Interpreting a decree is not the same as re-litigating matters already decided in it.\u201d For similar reasons, the Water Court determined that the County was not collaterally estopped by the existence of the <em>Schuh </em>Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u00b625 The Water Court considered McDonald\u2019s argument that judicial estoppel barred the County from arguing that it was not required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>make continuous releases of 30 CFS of water during the irrigation season. McDonald relied upon a statement by the County in FERC and other prior proceedings about its obligations under the <em>Schuh </em>Decree. The Water Court cited <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 33, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620, for the principles of judicial estoppel, the purpose of which is to \u201csuppress fraud and prevent abuse of the judicial process by deliberate shifting of positions to suit the exigencies of a particular action.\u201d The Water Court determined that McDonald\u2019s judicial estoppel argument failed because that doctrine \u201cdoes not apply to changes of position relating to matters of law. Interpretation of the <em>Schuh </em>Decree involves a statement of opinion regarding a matter of law, not a statement of fact.\u201d Finding no evidence that the County intended to commit fraud or abuse the judicial process, the Water Court found that McDonald did not demonstrate all the elements of judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"asf-dedup-0\">\u00b626  The Water Court dismissed McDonald\u2019s argument that principles of claim preclusion estopped the County from contending that it was not required to release 30 CFS from Georgetown Lake continuously during the irrigation season. The Water Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">Although Granite County has taken contradictory positions in other proceedings, those proceedings did not involve McDonald, and there is no evidence that Granite County meant to perpetuate a fraud or abuse the judicial process. Granite County\u2019s arguments in this case are not precluded by the doctrines of res judicata, judicial estoppel or collateral estoppel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">We agree with the Water Court\u2019s conclusion that res judicata does not bar the County\u2019s arguments made in this case. The County is not attempting to re-litigate settled issues, but, like McDonald, is only arguing its case for how the ambiguities in the <em>Schuh </em>Decree should be construed. The Water Court noted that both parties \u201cagree the narrow issue is interpretation of the rights already recognized in the <em>Schuh </em>Decree\u201d and that \u201c[ijnterpreting a decree is not the same as re-litigating matters already decided in it.\u201d For similar reasons, we agree with the Water Court\u2019s determination that the County was not collaterally estopped in its arguments by the existence of the <em>Schuh </em>Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b627 Therefore, the Water Court properly considered and applied the principles of claim preclusion relied upon by McDonald.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u00b628 The Water Court\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b296-9\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, BAKER, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-13\"> Montana law provides that \u201c100 statutory or miner\u2019s inches shall be considered equivalent to a flow of 2.5 cubic feet (18.7 gallons) per second.\u201d Section 85-2-103(2), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"AiO\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"aok-dedup-0\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\u00b629 I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201ca downstream appropriator has no rights to water stored behind an upstream dam as long as the dam operator releases the natural inflow into the stream below the dam.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21.1 write separately, however, to address what I believe was ultimately decided in the <em>Schuh </em>Decree and to recognize what remains unresolved between the parties. The provisions of the <em>Schuh </em>Decree must be read together, along with the findings regarding natural flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b630 The <em>Schuh </em>Decree recognized that the Company was the owner of, and entitled to, a total of 1200 miner\u2019s inches of Flint Creek by virtue of certain appropriations made in 1888,1889, and 1891. <em>Schuh </em>Decree, \u00b6 2. The purpose and beneficial use of these appropriations was to generate electricity. <em>Schuh </em>Decree, \u00b6 2. In 1901, as owner of these appropriations, the Company\u2019s predecessor completed construction of a dam, begun in 1891, for the purpose of storing water diverted pursuant to its appropriations. <em>Schuh </em>Decree, \u00b6 2. In 1902, the Company filed a complaint in federal district court requesting a determination of the \u201camounts of water which your orator shall be compelled to allow to flow from the said storage reservoir during the irrigation season ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b631 The <em>Schuh </em>Decree must be evaluated within the context of the Company\u2019s request to establish a quantity or amount of instream flow. The <em>Schuh </em>court found specifically that \u201cthe amount of water reasonably and necessarily required to run and operate said electric plant of the complainant to its full capacity, and which has been and now is so used by the complainant, is about 30 second feet, or 1200 miner\u2019s inches of water.\u201d <em>Schuh </em>Decree, \u00b6 5. Significantly, the <em>Schuh </em>Decree further found that through its electric power plant, the Company has permitted to flow down through the natural channel 1200 miner\u2019s inches of water, in such a manner that none of the downstream users have been damaged. <em>Schuh </em>Decree, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 14. More specifically, the <em>Schuh </em>court determined that the Company</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">had not\u2014during the irrigating seasons since the construction of its dam, detained or deprived the defendants of, the ordinary and natural flow or passage of the water of said Flint Creek, that is in quantities as the same would naturally run at such times, otherwise than is necessary to the reasonable and proper operation of its electric plant and machinery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\"><em>Schuh </em>Decree, \u00b6 9. The <em>Schuh </em>court determined the natural flow rate of Flint Creek above the dam to be 1200 miner\u2019s inches, which the Company was entitled to divert as long as it was returned to Flint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Creek, <em>in the amount of 1200 miner\u2019s inches, </em>for the lands of downstream users. <em>Schuh </em>Decree, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b632 Importantly, the <em>Schuh </em>court continued to recognize entitlement by downstream water users to appropriate amounts greater than 1200 miner\u2019s inches, many of which had senior appropriation dates to the Company. <em>Schuh </em>Decree, \u00b6 15. As observed by the Water Court, those combined rights far exceeded 1200 miner\u2019s inches. Therefore, the <em>Schuh </em>Decree determined <em>only </em>the amount of instream flow the Company was entitled to divert and, <em>thereafter return, </em>to Flint Creek. The <em>Schuh </em>court\u2019s conclusion that downstream users are \u201cenjoined and restrained\u201d from \u201cobstructing or interfering with the use and enjoyment of said dam and reservoir and the storing of water therein,\u201d and that the natural flow was 1200 miner\u2019s inches, refers to the amount of water the court previously established as the natural flow of Flint Creek, which the Company demonstrated it could use <em>and return </em>to Flint Creek without harm to downstream appropriators. <em>Schuh </em>Decree, \u00b6 20. Downstream appropriators were restrained from demanding \u201cany greater amount of water than the average natural flow\u201d be returned for downstream appropriators. <em>Schuh </em>Decree, \u00b6 20. Therefore, I agree, based on the entirety of the <em>Schuh </em>Decree, that the Company is not required to release storage water in favor of downstream users to <em>supplement </em>natural flows of Flint Creek which are below 1200 miner\u2019s inches. The <em>Schuh </em>Decree clarified instream flow which, if available, could be diverted by the Company, and returned for the lands of downstream users.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b633 While the <em>Schuh </em>Decree made a specific finding that quantifies Flint Creek\u2019s average natural flow above the dam, it did not enjoin downstream users with senior rights from appropriating amounts in excess of 1200 miner\u2019s inches when the flow exceeded 1200 miner\u2019s inches in Flint Creek. These downstream rights, together with those of the Company, remain subject to the doctrine of prior appropriation. The Water Court correctly recognized that the law requires operators of reservoirs to make the natural flow of a stream available to senior downstream appropriators during times of shortage. Thus, natural flow can be stored only when there is enough water to satisfy senior rights, or when senior rights are not being used.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b634 Therefore, I would clarify and definitively reject McDonald\u2019s argument that the <em>Schuh </em>Decree enjoins downstream users from appropriating no more than 1200 miner\u2019s inches during the irrigation season. In my opinion, the <em>Schuh </em>Decree established a quantity of natural flow above the dam only, and it did not enjoin downstream <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>users with senior rights from appropriating amounts in excess of 1200 miner\u2019s inches when the flow exceeded 1200 miner\u2019s inches in Flint Creek. It similarly did not compel the Company to draw from its reservoir to supplement instream flow when those rates were below 1200 miner\u2019s inches\u2014the amount the <em>Schuh </em>Decree quantified as a finding of fact as the average instream flow.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
