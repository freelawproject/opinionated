The issue to be determined on appeal is whether Pepper\u2019s statutory right to speedy trial guaranteed under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, was violated. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b62 Pepper was charged with two counts of theft and two counts of deceptive practices in the City Court of Red Lodge on March 26, 2014. The charges alleged that Pepper made purchases on two credit cards that did not belong to him. Pepper pleaded not guilty to the offenses on April 3, 2014, at his initial appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b63 The City Court issued its first scheduling order on April 25, 2014, directing the Appellee City of Red Lodge (City) to provide discovery by May 22, 2014; setting an omnibus hearing for July 3, 2014; setting a motions hearing for July 31,2014; and a jury trial for August 15,2014.</p>\n<p id=\"AL0\">\u00b64 The City provided Pepper with some discovery on April 16, 2014. However, missing from that discovery was a recorded interview of Pepper, recorded interviews of several witnesses; a video that allegedly showed one of the criminal acts; written statements from Pepper and a witness; and a police report. On June 19,2014, Pepper\u2019s counsel sent a letter to the City\u2019s attorney informing her of the several key pieces of missing discovery which had not been provided in compliance with the court\u2019s scheduling order. Pepper\u2019s counsel also communicated to the City\u2019s attorney by email that given the amount of discovery outstanding, she planned to continue the omnibus hearing, \u201calong with other deadlines in the Scheduling Order,\u201d and asked if there was any objection. The City\u2019s attorney did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u00b65 On July 3,2014, Pepper filed a Motion to Vacate Scheduling Order and Reset Omnibus. The motion detailed the numerous items of discovery still not produced by the City, and requested \u201cthe Court to vacate the deadlines in the April 25, 2014 Scheduling Order and reset the omnibus hearing in this matter.\u201d Pepper\u2019s counsel indicated that \u201cIgliven the dearth of information currently in Defendant\u2019s possession, Defendant does not have the ability to address the issues that should be discussed during the omnibus hearing.\u201d The court granted Pepper\u2019s motion and rescheduled an omnibus hearing for August 7, 2014, but did not vacate or address any of the other dates set forth in the April 25, 2014 scheduling order.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u00b66 On July 15,2014, Pepper\u2019s counsel sent another email to the City\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>attorney and inquired, again, of the missing discovery. The City responded that the officer involved in the case had been on vacation, but that the missing discovery would be provided shortly. Pepper subsequently received the City\u2019s entire discovery on July 30, 2014. Thereafter, on August 6, 2014, Pepper filed a Motion for Scheduling Order requesting a new motions deadline; new motions hearing; and a new trial date. Pepper represented that he now had the necessary discovery to prepare his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b67 On August 8, 2014, the City Court issued a second scheduling order that set a motions deadline of August 21, 2014; an omnibus hearing of September 11, 2014; a final pretrial hearing of September 25, 2014; and a jury trial of September 26, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b68 On September 16, 2014, the City filed a motion to continue trial, representing that one of its witnesses had moved to Arizona and that the jury trial date of September 26, 2014, did not allow sufficient time to purchase an airline ticket without being cost prohibitive. Pepper objected to any continuance. The court addressed the City\u2019s request for continuance at the motions hearing and inquired whether any party had previously moved for a continuance. In response to the City\u2019s representation that he had previously requested a continuance, Pepper maintained that he had to ask for the continuance in order to prepare his motion to suppress because the City had not complied with discovery deadlines previously imposed by the court. After considering that the City Attorney was not available for trial on dates which would have been within the six-month statutory speedy trial deadline\u2014as well as the need for the court to have adequate time to consider the motion\u2014the court set Pepper\u2019s jury trial for October 31, 2014, nearly one month outside the six-month statutory speedy trial period.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b69 On October 23, 2014, Pepper filed a motion to dismiss due to a violation of his statutory six-month speedy trial right. The City Court denied Pepper\u2019s motion, concluding that the speedy trial statute was inapplicable because Pepper had requested a new scheduling order. Additionally, the court found good cause because of the financial hardship to secure a material witness and the need to consider and resolve Pepper\u2019s motion to suppress, which was more complicated than initially appeared from the written submissions of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b610 Pepper was tried on October 31, 2014, and found guilty of one count of deceptive practices. Following imposition of sentence in City Court, Pepper appealed his conviction to the District Court. The District Court stayed Pepper\u2019s sentence pending the outcome of his appeal. Pepper challenged on appeal, among other issues, the City Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss for violation of his statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>speedy trial right. The District Court affirmed the City Court\u2019s order. Pepper appeals to this Court the denial of his statutory speedy trial right under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, and to conform the oral pronouncement of his sentence with the written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b611 On appeal from a municipal court, the district court functions as an intermediate appellate court. Sections 3-5-303, 3-6-110, MCA; <em>City of Kalispell v. Gabbert, </em>2014 MT 296, \u00b6 12, 377 Mont. 17, 338 P.3d 51. In its appellate capacity, the district court is confined to review of the record and questions of law. Section 3-6-110, MCA; <em>Gabbert, </em>\u00b6 12. When reviewing the decision of the district court in such an appeal, we review the case as if the appeal had originally been filed in this Court, applying the appropriate standard of review. <em>Gabbert, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>City of Helena v. Broadwater, </em>2014 MT 185, \u00b6 8, 375 Mont. 450, 329 P.3d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"aqb-dedup-1\">\u00b612 Whether the statutory right to a speedy trial has been violated is a question of law. <em>Gabbert, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>State v. Luke, </em>2014 MT 22, \u00b6 10, 373 Mont. 398, 321 P.3d 70; <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>2014 MT 173, \u00b6 11, 375 Mont. 374, 328 P.3d 1132. We review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of law is correct. <em>Gabbert, </em>\u00b6 13. The trial court\u2019s underlying factual findings are reviewed to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Gabbert, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b613 Pepper argues that his right to a speedy trial pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, was violated. Section 46-13-401(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">After the entry of a plea upon a misdemeanor charge, the court, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, shall order the prosecution to be dismissed, with prejudice, if a defendant whose trial has not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion is not brought to trial within 6 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">\u00b614 This Courthas explained that \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, mandates the dismissal of any misdemeanor charge not brought to trial within six months only if two conditions are met: (1) the defendant has not asked for a continuance; and (2) the State has not shown good cause for the delay. <em>City of Helena v. Roan, </em>2010 MT 29, \u00b6 9, 355 Mont. 172, 226 P.3d 601. We have also explained that \u201cany pretrial motion for continuance filed by a defendant which has the incidental effect of delaying the trial beyond the six month time limit could be said to \u2018postpone trial\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.\u201d <em>State v. Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont. 162, 166-67, 940 P.2d 108, 111 (1997). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>Fitzgerald, </em>the defendant filed two requests to continue the omnibus hearing which had the incidental effect of continuing the trial. Although finding that the trial date fell within the \u201cgood cause to the contrary exception\u201d of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, this Court rejected Fitzgerald\u2019s suggestion that we limit the statutory speedy trial right to only those cases where a defendant specifically requests that a trial date be extended beyond the six-month period. In <em>City of Helena v. Heppner, </em>2015 MT 15, \u00b6 16, 378 Mont. 68, 341 P.3d 640, however, we specifically determined the statutory speedy trial right is inapplicable where a defendant files a motion to vacate his trial date for a change of plea. Because Heppner had moved to vacate the initial trial date for a change-of-plea hearing and then moved, first individually and then jointly with the State, to continue the change-of-plea hearing, we determined that Heppner\u2019s actions removed him from the statutory protections of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b615 Pepper filed a motion to continue the omnibus hearing and requested that all of the dates in the scheduling order be vacated. These dates included the motions hearing and scheduled trial date. Although Pepper argues he was forced to request the continuance because the City had not provided its discovery in time for him to prepare his motion to suppress, Pepper could have raised any discovery violations at the omnibus hearing without implicating or otherwise jeopardizing his statutory right to a speedy trial under the statute. In light of the clear and unequivocal language of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, which conditions mandatory dismissal on the defendant having not previously filed a motion which causes the trial to be postponed, Pepper should have availed himself of other options: for example, a motion to compel discovery or a motion for sanctions. Instead of pursuing either of these options, Pepper chose to file a motion to vacate all of the scheduled dates, including the trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"Apm\">\u00b616  The plain language of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, allows for dismissal on speedy trial grounds only if \u201ctrial has not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion.\u201d Here, it is undisputed that Pepper filed at least one motion to continue and to vacate the trial date. Therefore, under the plain language of the statute, Pepper is not entitled to rely on \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, for dismissal of his charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u00b617 Asa final matter, Pepper maintains his written judgment does not accurately reflect the sentence the City Court imposed and requests this Court to order the City Court to amend the written judgment. At Pepper\u2019s sentencing hearing, the City Court sentenced Pepper to six months at Yellowstone County Detention Facility (YCDF), with all but twenty days suspended, and did not prevent Pepper from participating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>in the YCDF work program. The written judgment, however, orders Pepper to serve six months at YCDF \u201cwith all but twenty (20) days of jail unsuspended\u201d and that the \u201cwork program at YCDF is not authorized.\u201d The State has not responded to this issue. As the sentence orally pronounced from the bench in the presence of the defendant is the legally effective sentence and the oral pronouncement controls, <em>State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6 40, 228 Mont. 286, 957 P.2d 9, we remand for correction of the written judgment. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 46-18-116(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b618 The City Court did not err in determining that Pepper waived his right to the six-month speedy trial requirement of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, when he filed on July 3, 2014, his motion to vacate the scheduling order and to reset the omnibus hearing. Because Pepper filed a motion to vacate the scheduling order which included the trial date, he may not avail himself of the statutory protections afforded by \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. For this reason, it is not necessary to address whether the City had good cause for continuing the September 26, 2014 trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\u00b619 The order of the District Court affirming the City Court\u2019s denial of Pepper\u2019s motion to dismiss is affirmed. We remand, however, for correction of the written judgment to conform to the City Court\u2019s oral pronouncement of Pepper\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b496-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-10\"> We remand for the limited purpose of conforming the written judgment to the oral pronouncement of Pepper\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
