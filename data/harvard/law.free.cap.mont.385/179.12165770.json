The jury returned a verdict of guilty. Dobrowski appeals, alleging numerous errors at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">\n<em>Issue one: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in instructing the jury on the theory of accountability when the State did not charge Dobrowski with accountability in the Information?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\"><em>Issue two: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed the State to admit Dobrowski\u2019s medical marijuana provider </em>application?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">\n<em>Issue three: Did the prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing argument constitute prosecutorial misconduct?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-13\">\n<em>Issue four: Did the District Court err when it denied Dobrowski\u2019s request for a surrebuttal closing argument?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ACa\">\u00b63 In the fall of 2012, Dobrowski andhis wife Traci Dobrowski (Traci) lived on property located in Custer County, Montana, owned by Michael Burk (Burk) and Geraldine Burk (Geraldine). Dobrowski, Burk, Traci, and Geraldine each had medical marijuana patient cards issued to them by the Department of Public Health and Human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Services (DPHHS), which allowed each individual to possess four mature plants, twelve submature plants, and one ounce of usable marijuana. Burk and Dobrowski began growing marijuana on the property. Dobrowski and Traci moved to Miles City, Montana, in December of 2012. In February 2013, Dobrowski applied for a medical marijuana provider license, listing Burk\u2019s property as the address where he would grow marijuana. His application was later denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b64 On March 14, 2013, law enforcement officers executed a search warrant on Burk\u2019s property after a criminal investigation discovered evidence consistent with a marijuana cultivation operation. Officers discovered 66 mature plants and 22 submature plants. Officers spoke to Dobrowski after the search. He acknowledged that he had been growing marijuana on the property and helped to set up the building where the marijuana was found. On December 5, 2013, the State filed an Information charging Dobrowski with criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs. A jury convicted Dobrowski on February 27, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b65 Other facts will be noted as necessary to discuss the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding jury instructions for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v.

Alden, </em>282 Mont. 45, 49, 934 P.2d 210, 213 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b610 <em>Issue one: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in instructing the jury on the theory of accountability when the State did not charge Dobrowski with accountability in the Information?</em></p>\n<p id=\"As_\">\u00b6 11 The State\u2019s information filed against Dobrowski did not include an accountability charge. Rather, the State sought jury instructions on the theory of accountability on the second day of trial. The District Court admitted two instructions on accountability over Dobrowski\u2019s objection. Dobrowski now asks us to revisit our prior case law, namely <em>State v. Tellegen, </em>2013 MT 337, 372 Mont. 454, 314 P.3d 902 and <em>State v. Tower, </em>267 Mont. 63, 881 P.2d 1317 (1994), arguing that the allowance of the accountability instruction violated Dobrowski\u2019s right to due process and his right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b6 12 Under the Sixth Amendment, a criminal defendant has the right \u201cto be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation\u201d brought against him. U.S. Const, amend. VI. To this end, \u00a7 46-11-401(1), MCA, requires charging documents to state the name of the offense and, for each count, to state \u201cthe official or customary citation of the statute, rule, regulation, or other provision of law that the defendant is alleged to have violated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b613 Section 45-2-302, MCA, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAzZ\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">(3) either before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose to promote or facilitate the commission, the person solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid the other person in the planning or commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">We have repeatedly held that \u201caccountability is not a separate or different offense from the one charged, but rather, is \u2018merely a conduit by which to find a person criminally liable for the acts of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tellegen, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting <em>State v. Maetche, </em>2008 MT 184, \u00b6 16, 343 Mont. 464, 185 P.3d 980; <em>State v. Abe, </em>1998 MT 206, \u00b6 31, 290 Mont. 393, 965 P.2d 882; <em>Tower, </em>267 Mont. at 67-68, 881 P.2d at 1320). <em>Stare decisis </em>\u201cis of fundamental and central importance to the rule of law,\u201d which \u201creflects our concerns for stability, predictability, and equal treatment.\u201d <em>State v. Gatts, </em>279 Mont. 42, 51, 928 P.2d 114, 119 (1996). As such, we decline to reconsider our prior holdings in <em>Tower </em>and <em>Tellegen. </em>Given our well-established principle of law regarding the theory of accountability, a defendant should be able to predict and plan for the possibility that the State may request an accountability instruction during trial. <em>Tellegen, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing <em>Tower, </em>267 Mont. at 68, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>881 P.2d at 1320).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b614 In <em>Tower, </em>we found unpersuasive a defendant\u2019s claim that he was surprised by an accountability instruction given that he was provided all the evidence the State intended to present at trial. <em>Tower, </em>267 Mont. at 68, 881 P.2d at 1320. We concluded that \u201c[i]n light of the defense\u2019s knowledge of the State\u2019s case, and the consistent history of the law of accountability in Montana, there was every reason to anticipate an accountability instruction.\u201d <em>Tower, </em>267 Mont. at 68, 881 P.2d at 1320. Likewise, in <em>Tellegen, </em>we held that a defendant had sufficient notice of a possible accountability instruction when the State presented evidence at trial that she assisted others in committing the crime for which she was charged. <em>Tellegen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b615 The facts in this case are similar to the facts in <em>Tower </em>and <em>Tellegen. </em>One week after the search of Burk\u2019s property, Dobrowski admitted to officers that he was cooperatively growing marijuana on the property and helped to set up one of the buildings where the plants were found. The State then charged Dobrowski with criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs. During trial, the prosecution elicited testimony from Dobrowski that sought to establish his participation in the growing operation on Burk\u2019s property. Dobrowski testified that he previously taught Burk to grow marijuana and told officers that he and Burk had a cooperative grow on the property. In short, Dobrowski was charged for his participation in the growing operation, and Dobrowski himself testified that he was involved in the operation. The facts underlying Dobrowski\u2019s case and the State\u2019s presentation of evidence at trial, which sought to establish that he did not act alone in growing marijuana on Burk\u2019s property, put him on notice that the State could potentially request an accountability jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"AfYg\">\u00b616 Dobrowski attempts to rely on <em>State v. Spotted Eagle, </em>2010 MT 222, 358 Mont. 22, 243 P.3d 402. In <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>the State initially charged the defendant under \u00a7 45-5-206(l)(a), MCA, then later sought to instruct the jury under \u00a7 45-5-206(l)(c), MCA. <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6 11. Since this changed the essential elements of the charge against Spotted Eagle, the Court held that the district court abused its discretion in allowing an instruction on the separate and distinct offense not charged in the State\u2019s information. <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 16. As in this case, the defendant in <em>Tellegen </em>also attempted to rely on <em>Spotted Eagle </em>to contend that, like the statutory subsections in that case, the statute on accountability is a separate and distinct offense requiring express notice from the prosecution. <em>Tellegen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>However, we distinguished <em>Spotted Eagle </em>from Montana\u2019s case law on accountability, holding that \u201c[ajccountability is not a separate or different offense from the one charged, it is merely a theory to establish criminal liability for the charged offense\u201d and \u201cdoes not constitute a substantive shift in the charge.\u201d <em>Tellegen, </em>\u00b6 14. Thus, as we previously held in <em>Tellegen, Spotted Eagle </em>does not apply to the case at bar. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury on the theory of accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b617 <em>Issue two: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed the State to admit Dobrowski\u2019s medical marijuana provider application?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b618 On the first day of trial, the State learned that Dobrowski intended to offer into evidence various letters between DPHHS and Dobrowski, Burk, Traci, and Geraldine. The District Court allowed Dobrowski to introduce this correspondence through the testimony of a DPHHS employee. The State then asked the court to issue an investigative subpoena for Dobrowski\u2019s medical marijuana provider application. Dobrowski objected to the State\u2019s motion, claiming that it was untimely. The court issued the investigative subpoena, concluding that the State had a compelling state interest in obtaining the application, but that it could only be used on rebuttal. During trial, both Dobrowski\u2019s counsel and the State questioned the defendant about his application and it was subsequently admitted during the State\u2019s rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b619 For the first time on appeal, Dobrowski argues that the court erred in approving the State\u2019s motion for investigative subpoena without requiring a supporting affidavit by the prosecutor, as mandated by \u00a7 46-4-301, MCA. However, \u201c[i]t is well established that this Court will not review an issue that was not raised in the district <em>court.\" Paulson v. Flathead Conservation Dist., </em>2004 MT 136, \u00b6 37, 321 Mont. 364, 91 P.3d 569. Dobrowski did not ask for relief from the improper issuance of an investigative subpoena in the trial court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-4-303, MCA. Thus, we will not put the District Court in error for an issue it never had the opportunity to consider. <em>Paulson, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b620 Dobrowski also argues that the District Court abused its discretion in allowing the State to admit Dobrowski\u2019s medical marijuana provider application during rebuttal. He argues that because the State failed to disclose the document in a timely manner, the court\u2019s subsequent admission of the application during rebuttal sanctioned the use of a prejudicial, dilatory tactic by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"AzV\">\u00b621 Section 46-15-322, MCA, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">(1) Upon request, the prosecutor shall make available to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>defendant for examination and reproduction the following material and information within the prosecutor\u2019s possession or control:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAMH\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\">(d) all papers, documents, photographs, or tangible objects that the prosecutor may use at trial or that were obtained from or purportedly belong to the defendant....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u201cThe policy behind \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA, is to provide notice and prevent surprise.\u201d <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2000 MT 379, \u00b6 22, 303 Mont. 507, 16 P.3d 391. Prosecutors also have a continuing duty to disclose \u201cadditional information or material that would be subject to disclosure had it been known at the time of disclosure.\u201d Section 46-15-327, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b622 In this case, Dobrowski\u2019s medical marijuana provider application was not in the State\u2019s possession or control until the District Court approved the motion for investigative subpoena during trial. Furthermore, when DPHHS provided the State with Dobrowski\u2019s application, the State immediately gave the document to the defense. From these facts, it is evident that the State provided the application to Dobrowski at the \u201cearliest opportunity.\u201d <em>See Weitzel, </em>\u00b6 33. Thus, we cannot say that the State failed to meets its initial or continuing duty to disclose Dobrowski\u2019s provider application when the prosecutor was not in possession or control of the document before the subpoena was issued, 'and when the State gave Dobrowski a copy of the application upon possession of the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b623 While Dobrowski attempts to rely on <em>Stewart </em>to support his argument that the District Court abused its discretion when it permitted the State to introduce the provider application in rebuttal, we instead find our holding in <em>Weitzel </em>more on point and dispositive. In <em>Weitzel, </em>we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing rebuttal evidence showing the defendant had pawned a handgun where the defendant\u2019s trial testimony included statements denying gun ownership. <em>Weitzel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35, 38. This Court concluded that because Weitzel did not provide the State with pre-trial notice of his plan to suggest to the jury that he did own or possess an handgun, it was \u201cillogical\u201d to hold that the prosecution had a pre-trial duty to disclose the pawn shop record rebuttal evidence, even where the State had discovered the pawn shop transaction before trial. <em>Weitzel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31, 33.</p>\n<p id=\"A7OT\">\u00b624 In this case, we agree with the State that it was entitled to question Dobrowski about the provider application and admit the document in the State\u2019s rebuttal case. Like the facts in <em>Weitzel, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>record here shows that Dobrowski belatedly disclosed evidence, in the form of various letters between the DPHHS and Dobrowski, Burke, Traci, and Geraldine, which he admitted through the testimony of a DPHHS employee. Although it is unclear what tactical reason Dobrowski had in introducing these documents, he made a decision to open the door on the issue of his provider application without disclosing the application itself. <em>See Weitzel, </em>\u00b6 35. As such, the State was entitled to present what became, through Dobrowski\u2019s own making, relevant evidence of Dobrowski\u2019s complete correspondence with DPHHS. Given Dobrowski\u2019s testimony and the admission of the DPHHS letters by him, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State to admit Dobrowski\u2019s medical marijuana provider application during rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b625 <em>Issue three: Did the prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing argument constitute prosecutorial misconduct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b626 Dobrowski claims that two statements made during the prosecution\u2019s closing argument were improper. In the first statement, the prosecutor attempted to draw an analogy between a recent accident of his and the case at bar. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">Well, I got rid of my crutches. I like to think that my case is like my foot, just keeps getting better....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAlb\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">[I] was trying to figure out a way to present to you my theory on this case, and I had several thoughts go through my mind. I mentioned in opening, I think these two gentlemen got the cart before the horse. I got to thinking what happened here is a lot like what happened to me when I hurt my foot. What happened to me...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Dobrowski\u2019s counsel objected to the prosecutor\u2019s statement, arguing that the prosecutor was vouching for the credibility of a witness. The District Court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">\u00b627 The prosecutor then began to address a juror\u2019s concern, expressed in voir dire, that Dobrowski might serve a long sentence if convicted. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">I want to tell you that sentencing is a matter of law for the |j judge. Finding guilt or innocence is a matter of fact for the jury. Sentencing, consequences, they may be very substantial. They may be minimal. Depends on who you ask. It\u2019s not an issue that the jury should consider or can consider. That\u2019s a legal issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A--\">The only issue the jury should consider is whether the [djefendant is guilty of the crime charged. He\u2019s entitled to a fair hearing, if we do go to sentencing. He\u2019s got some due process rights that apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>if he feels he wasn\u2019t treated fairly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Dobrowski\u2019s counsel objected to this statement and the court directed the prosecution to \u201cmove on.\u201d The defense moved for a mistrial after the State concluded its closing statement, citing the prosecution\u2019s alleged vouching statement, referral to evidence outside the record, and reference to sentencing procedure. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AWpI\">\u00b628 Prosecutorial misconduct is determined by reference to established norms of professional conduct. <em>State v. Martin, </em>2001 MT 83, \u00b6 63, 305 Mont. 123, 23 P.3d 216. To determine whether a prosecutor\u2019s statement constitutes reversible error, we must first examine whether the comments were improper. <em>Labbe, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>State v. Kolb, </em>2009 MT 9, \u00b6 10, 349 Mont. 10, 200 P.3d 504; <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>2008 MT 27, \u00b6 51, 341 Mont. 240, 177 P.3d 444). \u201cIf so, we then determine whether the comments prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>Labbe, </em>\u00b6 23 <em>(citing Kolb, </em>\u00b6 10). Prejudice is not inferred; rather, the defendant \u201cmust demonstrate, from the record, that the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements prejudiced him.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 55. This Court will consider an alleged improper statement by the prosecutor during closing argument in the context of the entire argument. <em>Labbe, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>State v. Roubideaux, </em>2005 MT 324, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 521, 124 P.3d 1114).</p>\n<p id=\"Aue\">\u00b629 As to the first statement concerning the prosecutor\u2019s purported attempt to analogize his accident with this case, Dobrowski does not argue on appeal, as he did at trial, that the comments improperly vouched for the credibility of a witness. Rather, he only argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement \u201cwas a very clearly prohibited reference to facts outside the trial record,\u201d in contravention of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct 3.4(e). We cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s first statement was improper on this basis. The Montana Rules of Professional Conduct prohibit an attorney from alluding to irrelevant matters or \u201casserting] personal knowledge of facts in issue except when testifying as a witness.\u201d Mont. R. Prof. Cond. 3.4(e). Here, when the prosecutor stated \u201cmy case is like my foot, just keeps getting better,\u201d he was simply commenting on the strength of his case by attempting to draw an analogy to his injury. It is not improper for a prosecutor to comment upon the strength of his case based upon the evidence. <em>See State v. Glaudue, </em>1999 MT 1, \u00b6 21, 293 Mont. 1, 972 P.2d 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b630 On the other hand, it is well-settled law in Montana that \u201cclosing arguments which reflect a prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion as to the guilt of the defendant are improper.\u201d <em>Glaudue, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>State v. Statczar, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>228 Mont. 446, 457, 743 P.2d 606, 613 (1987)). However, the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Dobrowski and Burk \u201cgot the cart before the horse\u201d was simply a way for the prosecution to explain its theory of the case; namely, that Dobrowski helped Burk grow marijuana in excess of the amount allowed by law without getting a provider license which would have allowed him to do so legally. Thus, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor made an improper statement of his personal opinion regarding Dobrowski\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"A7N\">\u00b631 Dobrowski also contends that the prosecutor\u2019s second statement concerning sentencing was improper and prejudicial. The State argues that the prosecutor correctly informed the jury that sentencing matters are decided by the court and, unlike the case law relied upon by Dobrowski, did not specifically discuss the type of sentence the defendant might receive if convicted. We have held that it is improper for the prosecutor to inform the jury about possible sentences in closing argument. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 65. In this case, the prosecutor was responding to a juror\u2019s previously stated concern over the possible sentencing consequences for Dobrowski. The prosecutor replied by accurately stating that sentencing decisions are solely the duty of the trial court and outside the province of the jury. The prosecutor also referred to the fact that sentences vary widely and the defendant would have rights \u201cif we do go to sentencing.\u201d Such general statements are unlike those in <em>Stewart, </em>where the prosecutor attempted to assure the jury by stating that the judge had the authority to get the defendant into treatment and not sentence him to jail time. <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 43. Unlike <em>Stewart, </em>the prosecution in this case was not attempting to give assurance to the jury that Dobrowski\u2019s sentence would be light; rather, the prosecutor was informing the jurors that it was impermissible for them to weigh potential punishment because such matters are left to judge and subject to the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Thus, we cannot say that this statement was improper or that the District Court erred in denying Dobrowski\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b632 Since we have determined that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were not improper, there is no need to discuss whether Dobrowski was prejudiced by the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b633 <em>Issue four: Did the District Court err when it denied Dobrowski\u2019s request for a surrebuttal closing argument?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u00b634 Prior to trial, Dobrowski filed a motion <em>in limine </em>requesting a departure from the customary order of trial; specifically, he asked to be allowed to present a surrebuttal closing argument. The District Court denied Dobrowski\u2019s motion, characterizing it instead as a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>deviate from the statutory order of trial and finding it untimely. Dobrowski argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion because he demonstrated good cause to depart from the order of trial and was thus entitled to present a surrebuttal argument at closing. The State contends that no rule or statute requires a district court to grant a defendant\u2019s request for a surrebuttal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"ASo\">\u00b635 Section 46-16-402, MCA, allows a court to deviate from the order of trial \u201c[f]or good cause shown and in the discretion of the court.\u201d <em>See State v. Otto, </em>2014 MT 20, \u00b6 11, 373 Mont. 385, 317 P.3d 810. While \u00a7 46-14-401(3), MCA, allows the prosecution and defense to offer rebutting testimonial evidence \u201cat any time before the close of evidence,\u201d the decision to allow a surrebuttal closing argument is within the discretion of the trial court. The cases Dobrowski cites in support of his argument to the contrary are either irrelevant or inapplicable to the case at bar and we decline to address them. Because the District Court found Dobrowski\u2019s motion to deviate from the statutory order of trial untimely under its pre-trial omnibus order, and because the court found that Dobrowski presented no basis under Montana law to deviate from the trial order, we conclude that the District Court acted within the proper bounds of its discretion when it denied Dobrowski\u2019s request to present a surrebuttal argument at closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b636 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
