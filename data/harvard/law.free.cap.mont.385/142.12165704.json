Warren Schweitzer and Ingela Schnittger (Appellants) appeal the order of the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, granting the City of Whitefish\u2019s (City) cross-motion for summary judgment. We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">Did <em>the District Court err by granting summary judgment on the basis of claim preclusion ?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">\u00b63 Appellants own Lots 28 and 29 of the Houston Lake Shore Tracts located, at 2154 Houston Drive, in Whitefish. This property is adjacent to Whitefish Lake, which the City has annexed. Appellants have owned this property for several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">\u00b64 In 2005, Appellants decided to tear down their home and build a new house on the property. The building plans called for replacing the existing septic tank and leach field. Contractors and architects on the project advised Appellants they could hook up to the City\u2019s water and sewer services if the property was annexed into the City. Consequently, Appellants petitioned the City for annexation of their property, and their petition was granted, in November 2005. Later, Appellants learned they would be required to pay for the extension of water and sewer lines to the property. Finding the cost to be prohibitive, Appellants abandoned this option.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">\u00b65 In 2010, Appellants petitioned to have their property de-annexed, citing their nonuse of city services and the higher property taxes in the City. Their petition was denied by the City Council, and they commenced a declaratory action in the District Court, challenging the decision. The Appellants did not serve their complaint within three years as required by M. R. Civ. P. 4. The District Court dismissed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>2010 complaint on the basis of lack of service under Rule 4 and on the ground the statute of limitations for Appellants\u2019 claims, set forth in \u00a7 27-2-209(5), MCA, would bar any re-filed action. The dismissal was entered in August 2014, with prejudice, and was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b66 A month later, Appellants filed another petition with the City for de-annexation of their property, citing: 1) their nonuse of city services; 2) the higher taxes in the City; 3) the purported lack of contiguous city property; and 4) the termination of an interlocal agreement between the City and Flathead County. In 2005, the City and County had entered an interlocal agreement regarding City planning and zoning authority over land near Whitefish Lake where the Appellants\u2019 and their neighbors\u2019 properties were located. <em>See Phillips v. City of Whitefish, </em>2014 MT 186, \u00b6\u00b6 8-12, 375 Mont. 456, 330 P.3d 442. Flathead County passed a resolution to withdraw from the agreement in 2008, leading to negotiation of a new agreement in 2010. <em>Phillips, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Litigation ultimately ensued, resulting in termination of the agreement and the loss of city planning and zoning jurisdiction over the area not within the City. The City\u2019s jurisdiction over the Appellants\u2019 property did not change because it had been annexed by the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u00b67 The City Council denied Appellants\u2019 second petition for de-annexation, noting Appellants\u2019 property was within an area that was the City\u2019s \u201cfirst priority for annexation\u201d and finding it would be in the City\u2019s best interests to deny the request.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants then filed another declaratory action in the District Court challenging the denial of their second petition, and served their complaint upon the City, who raised claim preclusion as a defense. The District Court held the Appellants\u2019 action was barred by claim preclusion and entered summary judgment, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">The relevant facts in the first lawsuit are the same as those in this lawsuit. The issue continues to be whether the City Council proceeded contrary to [\u00a7] 7-2-4805, MCA. The substantive facts remain the same even though Plaintiffs pled the legal claims slightly differently. Reframing issues or raising novel contentions does not avoid <em>res judicata </em>preclusion. The facts must differ substantially. [(Internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\u00b68 Appellants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b69 We conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of summary judgment orders and conduct the same analysis as does a district court under Rule 56, M. R. Civ. P. <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 36, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186. Summary judgment is granted when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56; <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 37. \u201cA material fact is a fact that involves the elements of the cause of action or defense at issue to an extent that necessitates resolution of the issue by a trier of fact.\u201d <em>Roe v. City of Missoula, </em>2009 MT 417, \u00b6 14, 354 Mont. 1, 221 P.3d 1200. \u201cThe party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of establishing both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Roe, </em>\u00b6 14. If the moving party has met its burden then the burden shifts to the non-moving party and \u201cthe non-moving party must set forth <em>specific facts\u201d </em>to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Thomas v. Hale, </em>246 Mont. 64, 67, 802 P.2d 1255, 1257 (1990) (emphasis in original); <em>Roe, </em>\u00b6 14. The non-moving party \u201ccannot simply rely upon ... [its] pleadings, nor upon speculative, fanciful, or conclusory statements\u201d to establish a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Thomas, </em>246 Mont. at 67, 802 P.2d at 1257. If no genuine issue of material fact exists, then we, like a district court, determine if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Roe, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s application of the \u201cdoctrine of <em>res judicata </em>[or claim preclusion] is a question of law.\u201d <em>Thornton v. Alpine Home Ctr., </em>2001 MT 310, \u00b6 10, 307 Mont. 529, 38 P.3d 855. We review this question of law <em>de novo </em>and examine a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the doctrine as it has been established by this Court. We examine a district court\u2019s application of claim preclusion for correctness. <em>Brilz v. Metro Gen. Ins. Co., </em>2012 MT 184, \u00b6 13, 366 Mont. 78, 285 P.3d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment on the basis of claim preclusion ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u00b612 Claim preclusion provides finality and \u201cembodies \u2018a judicial policy that favors a definite end to litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Asarco LLC v. Atl. Richfield Co., </em>2016 MT 90, \u00b6 15, 383 Mont. 174, 369 P.3d 1019 (quoting <em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2006 MT 51, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 281, 130 P.3d 1267). Historically, we have analyzed claim preclusion under a four-part test requiring: 1) the parties or their privies are the same; 2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>subject matter of the present and past actions is the same; 3) the issues are the same and relate to the same subject matter; and 4) the capacities of the persons are the same in reference to the subject matter and to the issues between them. <em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>Berlin v. Boedecker, </em>268 Mont. 444, 451, 887 P.2d 1180, 1185 (1994); <em>Brannon v. Lewis &amp; Clark Cnty., </em>143 Mont. 200, 207-08, 387 P.2d 706, 711 (1963); <em>State ex rel. Sullivan v. School Dist., </em>100 Mont. 468, 472, 50 P.2d 252, 253 (1935). The third element contains a nuance \u2014 that preclusion extends to an issue that could have been raised, and the parties had an opportunity to litigate, in the first action. <em>See Fisher v. State Farm Gen. Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 308, \u00b6 10, 297 Mont. 201, 991 P.2d 452; <em>First Bank v. Dist. Ct. for Fourth Judicial Dist., </em>226 Mont. 515, 737 P.2d 1132 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b613 Implicitly, this test also requires the first action end with a final judgment on the merits. <em>Meagher Cnty. Newlan Creek Water Dist. v. Walter, </em>169 Mont. 358, 361, 547 P.2d 850, 852 (1976) (\u201cThe doctrine of res judicata states that a final judgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive as to causes of action or issues thereby litigated.\u201d); <em>Sullivan </em>100 Mont. at 473, 50 P.2d at 253 (\u201c[T]he judgment there rendered on the merits is binding between the same parties or their privies as to all matters there decided.\u201d). <em>See also Touris v. Flathead Cnty., </em>2011 MT 165, \u00b6 15, 361 Mont. 172, 258 P.3d 1 (dismissal of an action with prejudice \u201cwas a final judgment on the merits for purposes of res judicata.\u201d); <em>Hawkes v. Mont. State Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>2008 MT 446, \u00b6 19, 348 Mont. 7, 199 P.3d 260 (\u201cAn order of dismissal with prejudice is a final judgment on the merits.\u201d); <em>Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Brainard, </em>82 Mont. 39, 44, 265 P. 10, 12 (1928) (res judicata applies when \u201cthe same point was in issue upon the former trial.\u201d). <em>In Brilz, </em>we stated the requirement of a final judgment on the merits as a fifth element of the test. <em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 22 (\u201cand (5) a valid final judgment has been entered on the merits in the first action by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b614 Neither party contests the satisfaction of elements one and four. The parties agree they are the same litigants, and their capacities are the same in reference to the subject matter and the issues between them. We have no reason to disagree. We also concur with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cdismissal of the earlier action ... with prejudice on the basis of the running of the statute of limitations was a judgment.\u201d As noted above, \u201c[a]n order of dismissal with prejudice is a final judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Hawkes, </em>\u00b6 19. Therefore, the fifth element is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u00b615 Under the second element (same subject matter), Appellants argue their 2010 complaint sought a declaration that the annexation was void because the City failed to furnish water and sewer services, and that \u00a7 76-3-510, MCA, which assesses costs for the extension of local services, applies only to subdividers, not to private individuals. Appellants contend their 2014 complaint not only challenged the City\u2019s failure to provide water and sewer services, but also arose from a change in the zoning jurisdiction over the surrounding properties. The City responds that both claims arose from the denial of Appellants\u2019 de-annexation petitions, which is the key fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b616 We have explained the subject matter element is focused on the underlying factual basis and whether the two cases arose from the same set of material facts. <em>Touris, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>State ex rel. Harlem Irrigation Dist. v. Mont. Seventeenth Judicial Dist. </em>Ct., 271 Mont. 129, 133-34, 894 P.2d 943, 945 (1995). <em>Harlem Irrigation </em>is illustrative. There, the plaintiffs filed an action against the irrigation district alleging damages caused by the district\u2019s termination of their water supply. <em>Harlem Irrigation, </em>271 Mont. at 130-131; 894 P.2d. at 943. After dismissal of that action, the plaintiffs filed another action against the district alleging wrongful denial of water on later occasions over a period of years. <em>Harlem Irrigation, </em>271 Mont. at 131; 894 P.2d at 944. Despite the differing occasions, we found the subject matter element was satisfied because the claims boiled down to the same key fact, which we described as \u201cthe District\u2019s failure to provide water.\u201d <em>Harlem Irrigation, </em>271 Mont. at 134; 894 P.2d at 945. Similarly, in the action before us, both cases arose from the City\u2019s denial of the Appellants\u2019 petitions for exclusion. Both of the Appellants\u2019 declaratory complaints have the same basic factual underpinnings: 1) the Appellants\u2019 voluntary petition for annexation; 2) the City\u2019s annexation of the property; 3) the Appellants\u2019 decision not to pay for the extension of services to their property; 4) the Appellants\u2019 petition for exclusion; and 5) the City\u2019s denial of the petition. We conclude the subject matter element is satisfied because the same substantial facts underlie both proceedings initiated by the Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b617 Under the third element, the issue must likewise be the same and be related to the same subject matter. We begin with Appellants\u2019 de-annexation requests. Appellants\u2019 2010 and 2014 petitions to the City listed similar issues and reasons for their requests, including: 1) an objection to the cost of extending water and sewer lines to the property; 2) a complaint about a change in property value; 3) the level of the City\u2019s taxes; and 4) a statement that Appellants had not received any city services in exchange for taxes they had paid. Likewise, Appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>2010 and 2014 declaratory complaints were also similar. The primary claim in the 2010 complaint sought declaratory judgment and was titled: \u201cDECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT CITY\u2019S REJECTION OF PLAINTIFFS\u2019 PETITION FOR DE-ANNEXATION IS VOID FOR FAILURE TO CONFORM TO STATUTORY REQUISITES.\u201d The primary claim in the 2014 complaint sought declaratory judgment and was titled: \u201cDECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT PLAINTIFFS\u2019 PETITION FOR EXCLUSION MET THE STATUTORY REQUISITES OF \u00a7 7-2-4805, MCA, TO SUPPORT A RESOLUTION OF INTENT TO EXCLUDE LAND.\u201d The gravamen of both complaints was that the City failed to follow the requirements of \u00a7 7-2-4805, MCA, which governs the process of excluding land from a municipality. Additional claims in each of the two declaratory complaints were directly premised on this initial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajq\">\u00b618 Appellants\u2019 second de-annexation petition and second declaratory complaint also raised the issue of the termination of the interlocal agreement between the City and Flathead County. Appellants argue this new issue demonstrates the third element is lacking, and that claim preclusion cannot occur. Under the interlocal agreement, the area surrounding the Appellants\u2019 annexed property was likewise placed under the City\u2019s zoning authority. Appellants assert that, after the interlocal agreement was terminated, their property became \u201can island\u201d of City property, surrounded by land under Flathead County jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, we conclude this was not a material fact for purposes of either issue similarity or summary judgment. Since 2005, when Appellants\u2019 property was annexed, the jurisdiction of the City over their property has not changed. On each occasion when Appellants sought de-annexation, the City expressed its continuing objective to annex the area in which Appellants\u2019 property was located, describing the area as its \u201cfirst priority for annexation\u201d in response to the second petition, and noting that granting Appellants\u2019 request would be contrary to the City\u2019s goals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While termination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>interlocal agreement may have given Appellants another argument to make in support of their petition, it did not materially alter the issue before the District Court, which was the same issue raised in the first action: that the City had failed to comply with \u00a7 7-2-4805, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar9\">\u00b619 We conclude the issues presented in both cases were the same and related to the same subject matter. All elements of our claim preclusion test are thus satisfied, barring Appellants\u2019 claim. Summary judgment was appropriately entered by the District Court, and we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b175-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-9\"> The City has acted to annex the Houston Lake Shore Tracts area, where Appellants\u2019 property is located, and a legal challenge to that annexation action is pending before the courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\"> The City contests this factual issue, and notes that the City Council\u2019s Resolution denying the second de-annexation petition stated that Appellants\u2019 lots \u201care currently within the corporate limits, not on the border and wholly surrounded by the City of Whitefish.\u201d However, for purposes of summary judgment review, we accept Appellants\u2019 factual assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\"> The City Manager stated, in response to the first petition, \u201c[w]e should try to annex more properties in this vicinity and other areas of Whitefish rather than exclude these properties already inside city limits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
