He sought to dismiss his Partner or Family Member Assault (PFMA) charge on the ground that the statute under which he was charged violated his right to equal protection because it did not apply to persons in same-sex intimate relationships. The Eleventh Judicial District Court upheld the Justice Court\u2019s denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u00b63 In September 2012, Theeler was arrested after his girlfriend reported that he had \u201cbeen beating on her all night.\u201d The State charged Theeler in Flathead County Justice Court with PFMA pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA (2011). At that time, the statute defined \u201cpartners,\u201d in part, as \u201cpersons who have been or are currently in a dating or ongoing intimate relationship with a person of the opposite sex.\u201d Section 45-5-206(2)(b) (2011). In 2013, the Legislature struck \u201cwith a person of the opposite sex\u201d from the definition of \u201cpartners.\u201d 2013 Mont. Laws 803, 804.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b64 Theeler filed a motion to dismiss the PFMA charge. He argued that \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, violated his right to equal protection under the United States and Montana constitutions because the statute treated similarly-situated individuals unequally. The Justice Court denied the motion, reasoning that there was \u201cnot a difference in treatment under the law for equal protection purposes.\u201d The Justice Court found Theeler guilty. He appealed to the District Court. The District Court concluded that the Justice Court correctly analyzed Theeler\u2019s equal protection claim and therefore affirmed its denial of Theeler\u2019s motion to dismiss. Theeler appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u00b65 We review cases that originate in justice court and are appealed to district court as if the appeal originally had been filed in this Court. <em>State v. Kebble, </em>2015 MT 195, \u00b6 14, 380 Mont. 69, 353 P.3d 1175. Accordingly, we undertake an independent examination of the record apart from the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Kebble, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">\u00b66 We review de novo a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss. <em>State v. Kant, </em>2016 MT 42, \u00b6 11, 382 Mont. 239, 367 P.3d 726. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>review of constitutional questions is plenary. <em>State v. Covington, </em>2012 MT 31, \u00b6 13, 364 Mont. 118, 272 P.3d 43. We may uphold a judgment on any basis supported by the record, even if the lower court applied a different rationale. <em>Rooney v. City of Cut Bank, </em>2012 MT 149, \u00b6 25, 365 Mont. 375, 286 P.3d 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b67 <em>Whether Theeler was entitled to dismissal of the PFMA charge because the statute violated his constitutional right to equal protection.</em></p>\n<p id=\"aik-dedup-1\">\u00b68 The Justice Court reasoned that \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, did not violate Theeler\u2019s right to equal protection because the statute does not treat similarly-situated individuals unequally. The District Court affirmed the Justice Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b69 On appeal, Theeler asserts that \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, \u201cby its plain terms,\u201d discriminates between similarly-situated individuals in opposite-sex and same-sex relationships. Such a discriminatory classification, Theeler contends, violates the equal protection clauses of the United States and Montana constitutions. Theeler argues that the statute fails even rational basis review because the classification\u2014sexual orientation\u2014is not rationally related to the statute\u2019s primary purposes\u2014to protect victims of domestic violence and to punish abusers.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">\u00b610 Theeler acknowledges that he was not in a same-sex relationship, but points out that the statute exposes him to greater punishment than a same-sex abuser would face if charged with simple assault. Theeler argues that the statute facially discriminates against similarly-situated classes without justification. He relies, in part, on our decisions in <em>Snetsinger v. Montana University System, </em>2004 MT 390, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445, and <em>Gryczan v. State, </em>283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112 (1997), and on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S. Ct. 2472 (2003), <em>Obergefell v. </em>Hodges, _ U.S. _, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015), and <em>United States v. </em>Windsor, _ U.S. _, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), to support his position. He also cites empirical evidence showing similar or higher incidence of domestic violence among same-sex partners as among heterosexual partners. Because the statute unconstitutionally violates his right to equal protection, Theeler argues that his conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"At8k\">\u00b611 For purposes of Theeler\u2019s appeal, and based upon the cited authorities, we accept his argument that the former version of \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, under which he was charged violated equal protection by defining \u201cpartners\u201d as \u201cpersons who have been or are currently in a dating or ongoing intimate relationship with a person of the opposite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>sex.\u201d </em>It does not necessarily follow, however, that Theeler\u2019s PFMA conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b612 Whenever possible, we attempt to \u201cconstrue statutes in a manner that avoids unconstitutional interpretation.\u201d <em>Williams v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2013 MT 243, \u00b6 64, 371 Mont. 356, 308 P.3d 88. So, if a statute \u201ccontains both constitutional and unconstitutional provisions, we examine the legislation to determine if there is a severability clause.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 64; <em>accord United States v. Jackson, </em>390 U.S. 570, 585, 88 S. Ct. 1209, 1218 (1968) (applying severability in a criminal case and concluding that the \u201cunconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not necessarily defeat... the validity of its remaining provisions\u201d) (citation and internal quotations omitted). \u201cThe inclusion of a severability clause in a statute is an indication that the drafters desired a policy of judicial severability to apply to the enactment.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 64. If a statute does not contain a severability clause, we still may sever an unconstitutional provision. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 64. In doing so, we \u201cmust determine whether the unconstitutional provisions are necessary for the integrity of the law or were an inducement for its enactment.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 64 (citation and internal quotations omitted). In order to sever an unconstitutional provision, \u201cthe remainder of the statute must be complete in itself and capable of being executed in accordance with the apparent legislative intent.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 64. That is, if severing \u201cthe offending provisions will not frustrate the purpose or disrupt the integrity of the law, we will strike only those provisions of the statute that are unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 64. We have long held that \u201c[i]f an invalid part of a statute is severable from the rest, the portion which is constitutional may stand while that which is unconstitutional is stricken out and rejected.\u201d <em>Sheehy v. Public Employees Retirement Div., </em>262 Mont. 129, 141, 864 P.2d 762, 770 <em>(1993); Mont. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Greely, </em>193 Mont. 378, 399, 632 P.2d 300, 311 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b613 Here, the statute as originally enacted contained a severability clause. 1985 Mont. Laws 1575, 1577. A 1995 bill that partially amended the statute\u2019s definition of \u201cpartners\u201d also included a severability clause. 1995 Mont. Laws 1108, 1128. These severability clauses indicate that the Legislature \u201cdesired a policy of judicial severability to apply to the enactment\u201d of \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b614 With or without severability clauses in each amendment since the statute\u2019s enactment, we conclude that the unconstitutional provision is unnecessary \u201cfor the integrity of the law.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 64. It is undisputed that the purpose of \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, is to protect victims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>of domestic violence and to punish and rehabilitate abusers. Severing the phrase \u201cwith a person of the opposite sex\u201d from \u00a7 45-5-206(2)(b), MCA\u2014as the Legislature did in 2013\u2014\u201cwill not frustrate the purpose or disrupt the integrity of the law.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 64. Further, severing the unconstitutional provision so as to construe the statute \u201cin a manner that avoids unconstitutional interpretation\u201d leaves the \u201cremainder of the statute . . . complete in itself and capable of being executed in accordance with the apparent legislative intent.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 64. The statute still would protect victims of domestic violence and provide for the punishment and rehabilitation of abusers.</p>\n<p id=\"abo-dedup-0\">\u00b615  We reject Theeler\u2019s claims to the contrary. We are not persuaded by his argument that severing the offending provision violates his right to due process. As a heterosexual male, Theeler received every constitutional protection he was due when prosecuted for physically assaulting his female partner. We conclude that Theeler was not entitled to dismissal of his PFMA charge. Accordingly, even though we do so applying a different rationale, we conclude that the Justice Court and the District Court correctly denied Theeler\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b616 We affirm Theeler\u2019s PFMA conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b501-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, SHEA, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-12\"> Unless otherwise noted, all subsequent citations to \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, in this Opinion refer to the 2011 version of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b501-9\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"ahb-dedup-1\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">\u00b617 I write separately to adequately address the remedy of severability which we apply following our determination that \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, violated equal protection guarantees by defining \u201cpartner\u201d in a manner that excluded same-sex partners. The problem is one of underinclusiveness of the statute; that is, it criminalizes only heterosexual conduct and does not include as criminal those assaults occurring between same-sex partners. When a statute is constitutionally defective because of underinclusion, a court may either strike the statute, and thus make it applicable to nobody, or extend the statute\u2019s coverage to those excluded. Thus, the unconstitutionality of one part of the statute does not necessarily render the entire statute void.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">\u00b618 This Court must discern what course the Legislature would have followed had it foreseen our determination as to underinclusiveness of the statute. Nearly fifty years ago, Judge Cardozo stated, \u201c[t]he question is in every case whether the Legislature, if partial invalidity had been foreseen, would have wished the statute to be enforced with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the invalid part exscinded, or rejected altogether.\u201d <em>People v. Mancuso, </em>175 N.E. 177, 181 (N.Y. 1931). \u201cUnless it is evident that the legislature would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>390 U.S. 570, 585, 88 S. Ct. 1209, 1218 (1968). More recently, in the landmark severability case of <em>Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood, </em>546 U.S. 320, 126 S. Ct. 961 (2006), the Court declared the following principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">Three interrelated principles inform our approach to remedies. First, we try not to nullify more of a legislature\u2019s work than is necessary[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">Second, mindful that our constitutional mandate and institutional competence are limited, we restrain ourselves from \u2018rewriting state law to conform it to constitutional requirements\u2019 even as we strive to salvage it. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">Third, the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent, for a court cannot \u2018use its remedial powers to circumvent the intent of the legislature.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\"><em>Ayotte, </em>546 U.S. at 329-30, 126 S. Ct. at 967-68 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AGv\">\u00b619 Montana similarly has followed these principles of severability. If an invalid part of a statute is severable from the rest, the portion which is constitutional may stand while that which is unconstitutional is stricken out and rejected. <em>State v. Fire Department Relief Association, Etc., </em>138 Mont. 172, 178, 355 P.2d 670, 673 (1960). A statute \u201cis not destroyed in toto because of an improper provision, unless such provision is necessary to the integrity of the statute or was the inducement to its enactment.\u201d <em>Hill v. Rae, </em>52 Mont. 378, 389-90, 158 P. 826, 831 (1916). If, when an unconstitutional portion of an act is eliminated, the remainder is complete in itself and capable of being executed in accordance with the apparent legislative intent, it must be sustained. <em>Gullickson v. Mitchell, </em>113 Mont. 359, 375, 126 P.2d 1106, 1114 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">\u00b620 Theeler argues the remedy he should receive for having been convicted pursuant to a constitutionally defective statute is reversal. The Court fails to address this argument and Theeler\u2019s contention that, because other same-sex partners have escaped prosecution prior to 2013, Theeler should likewise escape accountability. Principles of severance, however, do not require that a statutory provision constitutionally defective for underinclusiveness be declared invalid as to those legitimately included within the class on the basis that others have escaped accountability. Principles of severance still apply where elimination of an invalid exemption will nonetheless impose burdens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>on those not formerly burdened by the statute. <em>Orr v. Orr, </em>440 U.S. 268, 271-72, 99 S. Ct. 1102, 1107-08 (1979). Further, severability principles apply although the exemption is part of a criminal statute and the equal protection analysis occurs within the context of a criminal trial where the defendant is cloaked with numerous constitutional and statutory protections. <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. 535, 543, 62 S. Ct. 1110, 1114 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b621 The question, then, is whether the Legislature would prefer to have statutes which cover all partners in partner family member assaults, with no exemption for same-sex couples, or instead to have no statutes at all proscribing partner family member assaults which involve persons in an intimate relationship, regardless of sexual orientation. In all cases where the court must decide whether to sever an exemption or instead declare an entire statute or definition a nullity, the court must look to the importance of the statute and the significance of the exemption within the overall statutory scheme. Statutes prohibiting partner family member assaults are of utmost importance to public safety. To nullify, in its entirety, that portion of the statute offering protection to \u201cpersons who have been or are currently in a dating or ongoing intimate relationship\u201d would have a disastrous effect on public safety and the protection of victims of domestic violence. Although the Legislature struggled prior to 2013 with the very phrase the Court has found unconstitutional, the inevitable conclusion that I would reach is that the Legislature would prefer to eliminate \u201cof the opposite sex\u201d rather than nullify that portion of the statute offering protection to partners in intimate relationships. By expanding the definition of \u201cpartners\u201d to all persons in intimate relationships, the Legislature\u2019s concerns for public safety and protection of victims of domestic violence are preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b622 Pursuant to this analysis, a court does not \u201ccreate a crime,\u201d but does, however, <em>enlarge the scope </em>of the partner family member statute which was constitutionally defective for its underinclusiveness. Accordingly, by choosing a remedy which expands the definition of \u201cpartner,\u201d Theeler cannot claim that he was convicted pursuant to a constitutionally defective provision because the statute under which he is being convicted has not been struck down. By eliminating an unconstitutional exception to a criminal statute we have expanded and enlarged the scope of the statute. We have not rendered the valid provision pursuant to which Theeler was convicted unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"AU3\">\u00b623 Moreover, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that an accused have had fair warning at the time of committing an offense that such conduct was made criminal by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>State. Theeler\u2019s conduct was covered by the statute and he received fair warning that it was criminal. The remedy chosen by the Court to extend coverage of \u201cpartner\u201d to all those to whom the provision can constitutionally be applied, does not deprive Theeler of a constitutionally protected right to equal protection or due process. To reverse Theeler\u2019s conviction would mean that all those persons who were convicted of partner family member assault would be entitled to have their conviction vacated and that a conviction could additionally not be considered as a predicate offense for an enhanced penalty. The equal protection clause and due process do not require that we reach such as result.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b624 Therefore, pursuant to the foregoing analysis, the remedy for the underinclusiveness of the statute is to expand coverage to those formerly excluded by striking that portion of the statute which defines \u201cpartners\u201d as \u201cthose of the opposite sex.\u201d Because the portion of the statute under which Theeler has been convicted has not been struck down, his conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
