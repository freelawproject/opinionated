P.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-34\">In the court below, Peter S. Duncan, Sarah F. Duncan and John W. Duncan filed their bill in equity against the Hollidaysburg &amp; Gap Iron Works, showing their title to certain ore lands under tbe will of Peter Shoenberger, who died in 1854, and, averring that tbe defendants were \u201c constantly, continuously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>and daily \u201d trespassing upon said lands and taking ore therefrom, prayed: 1. For discovery of the defendants\u2019 title. 2. For an injunction. 3. For \u201can account, which would be such an account as would depend upon the construction of the rights of the defendants; being total, if the court are of opinion that the defendants possess no rights in complainants\u2019 property; or partial, if the court are of opinion that although such right existed the suppty taken was excessive.\u201d The provisions of the will of Peter Shoenberger, deceased, the averments of the bill and of the answers filed, sufficiently appear in the opinion of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-5\">Issue having been joined, the cause was referred to <em>Mr. H. M. </em>Baldridge, as examiner and master, who subsequently reported in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-6\">The principal subject of contention arises upon the construction of the last will and testament of Dr. Peter Shoenberger, under whom both parties claim, and relates to the ore rights or privileges pertaining to what is known as the Bloomfield Furnace Mines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-7\">Dr. Shoenberger, in his lifetime, was extensively engaged in the iron business, and owned large and valuable properties, including rolling-mills, furnaces, forges, ore-banks, etc. Among his properties were Bloomfield Furnace, Sarah Furnace, Rebecca Furnace, Gap Furnace and Forge, and a large body of valuable iron-ore deposits known as the Bloomfield Mines. Dr. Shoenberger died in June, 1854, leaving a will dated June 14, 1852, with six codicils thereto, the last of which was dated May 11, 1854, and which will and codicils were duly admitted to probate in Philadelphia on the 28th and 29th of June, 1854. By the seventh clause of his said will he devised unto his daughter Martha Duncan during her natural life, inter alia, Bloomfield Furnace, with all the lands and tenements thereto belonging in a schedule therein mentioned, and, also, generally, all other lands which he might in his lifetime purchase for and attach to said Bloomfield Furnace, although not specifically named, and in said devise made the following reservation:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-8\">\u201c And further reserving and excepting any such lands that may be otherwise devised herein, and the right and privilege hereinbefore and hereinafter devised to the owners of Rebecca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Furnace, Sarah Furnace, and Gap Furnace, for to mine and take away iron ore from any of the afore-mentioned or described lands enough to supply one furnace at Rebecca, one furnace at Sarah, and one furnace at Gap Works. But the said right and privilege is not to be so exercised as to interfere with the operations of said Bloomfield Furnace and the Maria Forges; and I do hereby reserve the right and privilege to the owners of Sarah Furnace to make all such railroads or common roads through or over said Bloomfield Furnace lands (having reference to the best location of such roads, in doing as little violence and injury to said Bloomfield Furnace lands .and property as possible) as shall be necessary to enable the owners of Sarah Furnace to convey their iron ore from the mine banks to said furnace; \u201d And at her death he devised said lands, etc., unto her surviving children as tenants in common, and \u201cas purchasers, and not by descent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-6\">Mrs. Martha Duncan died March 28,1863, leaving surviving her her husband, John W. Duncan, and three children, viz., Peter S. Duncan, John Collins Duncan, and Sarah F. Duncan. John Collins Duncan died September 1,1878, intestate, unmarried, without issue, and leaving to survive him his father John W. Duncan, and his brother Peter S. Duncan, and sister Sarah F. Duncan. The said John W. Duncan having died since the closing of the testimony in this case, the whole title to the Bloomfield Furnace property becomes vested in Peter S. Duncan and Sarah F. Duncan, who with John W. Duncan were the complainants in this bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-7\">The respondents are the present owners of the Gap Furnace property, which at one time belonged also to Dr. P. Shoenberger.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-8\">\u2014The master then traced the title to the Gap Furnace property, from Peter Shoenberger through the Juniata Iron Manufacturing Co., and others, into the defendants; and, having stated the grounds upon which the plaintiffs claimed in their bill to be. entitled to the relief prayed for, proceeded:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-9\">And the learned counsel of complainants in their arguments before the master did not abandon any of these positions. They denied that the defendants had any rights whatever in the premises. They claimed that under the will of Dr. Shoenberger there was no express devise of an ore privilege to Gap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Furnace; that, while by the seventh clause or item in the will, Dr. Shoenberger reserved, and excepted in the devise of Bloomfield Furnace to Mrs. Duncan and her children, \u201cthe right and privilege hereinbefore and hereinafter devised to the owners of Rebecca Furnace, Sarah Furnace, and Gap Furnace,\u201d yet in the fourth and fifth items of the will no ore rights were given to the devisees, and there was no hereinafter devise to Gap Furnace; and that the conveyance between the date of his will and the last codicil was a revocation of the devise. They further urged that there was no implied right or privilege under the reservation in the seventh clause of the will, and that, if there was, it was personal to the McCormicks, to whom Gap Furnace was first devised; and that if it could be held that there was some sort of an implied right which in some manner passed by subsequent devise, then such subsequent devise would merely vest the personal right in E. F. Shoenberger, and would not pass to his vendee. And in the amended bill the prayer is, \u201c And if it be decreed that the defendants have any rights whatever in the premises, then in the alternative,\u201d &amp;c. The complainants, therefore, denying that the defendants have. any rights whatever in the premises, has the equity side of the court jurisdiction of the matter in controversy ? The master is of the opinion it has not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-5\">The questions are purely legal, and depend entirely on the construction to be placed on the will of Dr. Shoenberger. Courts of equity will interfere by injunction to protect the clear rights of suitors, but not when they are uncertain, doubtful, or disputed, and depend on the legal construction of deeds, etc. The Supreme Court, in Grubb\u2019s App., 90 Pa. 228, say that the proper construction of a deed is a legal question, and is not the subject of equity jurisdiction. On the same principle, equity has not jurisdiction where the title depends on the construction of a will. The reason for the rule is the same. The same case rules that \u201c a bill in equity is not a panacea; \u201d it was never intended nor has it ever been used to settle disputed rights in trespass; that where the right is clear it will restrain the commission of repeated acts of trespass, on the sole ground of preventing a multiplication of suits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-6\">Here the plaintiffs *chavge the defendants to be trespassers, having no rights in the premises; while the defendants claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>they have a clear right, exercised and recognized for years. In North Penna. Coal Co. v. Snowden, 42 Pa. 488, it was held that while it may be admitted that a bill will lie by one tenant in common to restrain waste or procure partition, yet even in such cases, confessedly within the jurisdiction of a court of equity, such a court would not interfere if complainant\u2019s title be denied, without he has vindicated it at law; that, to obtain an injunction the plaintiff\u2019s right must be acknowledged or established; that, where the title is legal, the case is not within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. There, no tenancy in common was charged, and the bill, as in this case, as the gravamen of complaint denied the defendant\u2019s title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-6\">In Long\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 179, it was ruled that when an account prayed for is but incidental to and dependent upon the determination of the title, the title must first be settled in favor of the plaintiff or he can have no account. An injunction will never be granted except in a clear case; never, when the whole title is in dispute; nor, unless the plaintiff is without an adequate legal remedy. If the defendants have no rights, they are trespassers and plaintiffs have a complete remedy. If suit were brought by plaintiffs for damages and a recovery were had, no doubt the defendants would desist their mining operation ; or, if not, after the title should thus be established then injunction would lie ; but, until plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive rights are acknowledged or established, we are of opinion an injunction would not be allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-7\">The plaintiffs claim that this is not an ejectment bill, as claimed by defendants, because they as well as the defendants are in possession, and therefore it is unlike the case of Tillmes v. Marsh, 67 Pa. 507, cited by defendants. We are inclined to the opinion that ejectment would lie, if plaintiffs were entitled to the exclusive possession, and they were deprived of this by reason of the joint possession of the defendants. But, however this may be, an action of trespass would be an adequate legal remedy, if the defendants have no rights in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-8\">Plaintiffs further reply that the court has jurisdiction, because the bill is one for discovery of defendants\u2019 title and is in the alternative; and in the fourteenth paragraph of the bill they pray \u201cthat should said will be otherwise'construed, and should ,the court be of the opinion that under and by virtue of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>last will and codicils a right and privilege to mine and take away ore from the complainant\u2019s lands were owned and possessed by said Ed. F. Shoenberger and in such wise as to inure to the benefit of his vendees, and if it should be made to appear that these defendants are the lawful successors to and owners of said right and privilege, yet the claims and acts of said defendants in mining and carrying away iron ore in quantities largely in excess of what would be sufficient to supply and furnish one furnace of the size and capacity of said Gap Furnace, as. described and referred to by said testator in his said last will and testament, are contrary to equity and good conscience.\u201d They cite Wilhelm\u2019s App., 79 Pa. 120, and especially that part of the opinion where the Supreme Court say \u201c that a bill containing a prayer framed with a double aspect forms no objection to it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-5\">The rule has been accurately stated by Lord Hatherly in Rawlings v. Lambert, 1 Johns. &amp; Hem. 466: \u201cYou have no right to allege two inconsistent states of fact, and ask relief in the alternative, for the two cannot be true; but you have always a right to state the facts of the case, the documents, and deeds, and ask the conclusion of the court on those facts and documents, and say the court may come to one conclusion of law, or it may come to another. And you may ask the court to come to a conclusion on the facts you have disclosed, having stated everything that will enable the court to form a proper judgment; you may ask the judgment of the court on two alternatives.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-6\">Plaintiffs, of course, would be entitled to file a bill for a discovery of title, but the answer fully disclosed that. That part of the bill is but incidental; and so as to the prayer for an account, as there is no dispute as to the quantity of ore mined. The real object of the bill is undoubtedly to establish the rights of the parties. Can suitors, by the introduction of incidental matters, about which there is no dispute, by framing a bill in the alternative give jurisdiction to disputed questions of title ? There is no doubt that, when the court has jurisdiction as to part of the property, the entire subject will be adjudicated, even if an action of ejectment would be an adequate remedy for a part, as was ruled in Socher\u2019s App., 104 Pa. 609. And, if plaintiffs conceded that the defendants had any rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>the will of Dr. Shoenberger, but contended that they were limited in their rights to a.sufficient quantity of ore for the supply of one furnace, of the capacity at the time of the reservation in the will, then the case would be very similar to Alden\u2019s App., 98 Pa. 182, and we would have no doubt as to the jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-6\">But Wilhelm\u2019s Appeal, so much relied on by the plaintiffs, is entirely different in its circumstances. That was a bill praying for an account of ores taken from a tenancy in common, setting forth title, &amp;c. Afterwards, the bill was amended by charging that ores had been taken outside the limits of what had been described as the common property in the original bill, and contained a prayer in the alternative, asking an account coextensive with what the court should decide, from the title set forth, to be the tenancy in common. In the opinion, the court say: \u201cNor is there any doubt that, though a question of title may be necessarily involved, it is within the jurisdiction ; for, where there is jurisdiction of the subject matter, that carries with it the jurisdiction to decide every incidental question that is necessarily involved.\u201d \u201c If, upon a bill for an account between tenants in common, a question arise as to the extent of the land comprised in the title, surely it must be competent for the court to determine it in order to make an end of the controversy.\u201d In Allison\u2019s App., 77 Pa. 221, also cited by plaintiffs, the court say, \u201c as a general principle, where the court has obtained jurisdiction for one purpose, it may retain it for general relief.\u201d Sheetz\u2019s App., 35 Pa. 88; Unangst\u2019s App., 55 Pa. <em>128; </em>Gass\u2019s App., 73 Pa. 39; Carty\u2019s App., 5 W. N. <em>241; </em>and numerous other authorities were cited by plaintiffs, but in our judgment they are not analogous cases. None of them conflict with the rule as laid down in North Penna. Coal Co. v. Snowden, 42 Pa. 488 ; Long\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 171; Tillmes v. Marsh, 67 Pa. 507 ; and most of them are referred to in argument of counsel in Grubb\u2019s App., 90 Pa. 228, which, we think, rules this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-7\">We think the defendants should have demurred to the bill, and the question has been suggested whether the defendants are not too late, after an answer to the bill on its merits, to raise the question of jurisdiction; but Mr. Justice Paxson, in Grubb\u2019s Appeal, says that all orders and decrees in equity, where there is no jurisdiction, are simply coram non judice, and that the Supreme Court had, on its own motion, dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>a bill for this reason. As the question can be raised at any time, and the defendants have raised it on the argument, and our opinion being that it is well taken, we can do nothing more than suggest the dismissal of the bill at the costs of complainants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-4\">To the foregoing report, the plaintiffs filed exceptions alleging that the master erred in not reporting that the plaintiffs were entitled to relief under the pleadings and evidence, and in recommending the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill. These exceptions were overruled by the master and renewed on the filing of his report. After argument thereof before Furst, P. J., 49th district, holding special term, they were dismissed, the master\u2019s report confirmed, and a final decree entered dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 bill at the costs of the plaintiffs. Thereupon the plaintiffs took this appeal, specifying the dismissal of their exceptions and the decree dismissing their bill, for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-5\"><em>Mr. A.

That by the first and fifth codicils to his will the testator devised Gap Forge and Furnace to trustees for Edwin F. Shoenberger, whose title the defendants claim that they acquired by certain conveyances unknown to the plaintiffs. That the defendants are constantly, continuously, and daily trespassing on complainants\u2019 lands, pretending that they have a right to do so under the above-recited provision in the devise of Bloomfield to these complainants, and that they further claim a right to take away iron ore sufficient to supply not only the Gap Furnace, which existed at the time of testator\u2019s devise, but an entirely new furnace which they have erected, requiring five times as much iron ore as the former one. That the claims of the defendants are without foundation; for, if any such right or privilege was devised in any way, it was devised to testator\u2019s daughter, Sarah McCormick, and not to Edwin F. Shoenberger, the defendants\u2019 predecessor in title; and that, even if otherwise, the said right was personal in said Edwin F. Shoenberger, and, if any right existed, the amounts of ore taken were wholly inordinate and excessive. The prayers of the bill' are, 1. for discovery of defendants\u2019 title ; 2. for an injunction ; and 3. for an account corresponding with the rights of the defendants, if any they have, as the same may be determined by the court. The amended bill avers that if the defendants have any rights at all in the premises, they must, under the express terms of the devise, be exercised in such manner as not to interfere with complainants \u2019 works and the operation of their mines, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In their answers, the defendants aver that by divers conveyances the right and title to Gap Forge and Furnace became vested in them; that, by his last will and testament, Dr. Shoenberger devised to the owners of Gap Furnace, and as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>appurtenant thereto, the right to take iron ore from Bloomfield mines sufficient to supply one furnace at Gap; that the right to take ore, as aforesaid, from Bloomfield mines, as an appurtenant of Gap Furnace, has always been recognized, and was never questioned until the same was denied by the plaintiffs in their bill. The defendants also deny that they are restricted in the- quantity of ore to be taken from Bloomfield, to the size and capacity of the original structure of Gap Furnace.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">It appears from the record that the claim of the defendants to mine and take ore from the Bloomfield lands is grounded on their alleged legal right to do so. That right is not only expressly denied by the plaintiffs, but they also deny that the defendants have any title to the Gap Furnace and Forge, and call upon them to set out in their answer an abstract of their title. The legal right of the defendants to do the acts complained of, was thus the controlling question in the case. In view of that, the learned master rightly held that the plaintiffs had mistaken their remedy, and in a clear and exhaustive opinion, fully sustained by reason as well as authority, he recommended' that the bill be dismissed. Exceptions to his report were overruled by the court, and the bill was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The familiar principle recognized in the cases cited by the learned master and court below is, that, where the case hinges upon a disputed legal title, that title must be first settled in an action at law. As was said in North Penna. Coal Co. v. Snowden, 42 Pa. 488: \u201cThe right of the plaintiff must be acknowledged, or established at law, before he can resort to a chancellor.\u201d In Grubb\u2019s App., 90 Pa. 229, the right of a party to take ore from the land of another was disputed, and depended on the construction of a deed, etc. The bill for an account was dismissed, on the ground that the question was a legal one, properly belonging to a court of law. Again, in Ferguson\u2019s App., 117 Pa. 426, the principle is thus stated by the present Chief Justice: \u201cWhere rights which are legal are asserted on one side and denied on the other, the remedies are at law. They cannot be settled under equity forms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">It is not our purpose to elaborate the principle on which the court acted in adopting the recommendation of the master and dismissing the bill. - That has. been sufficiently done in the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>port of the learned master, and in the opinion of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed, at the costs of appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
