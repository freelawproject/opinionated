Punning stated in substance, that a few days previous to the June term, 1863, of the Circuit Court, he came from his residence in Wisconsin, to Middleport, Iroquois county, to take some proceedings for himself, and the complainants for whom he was acting in the premises, for the partition and assignment of dower to Achshah Dunning the widow, in what was known in that county, as the \u201c Dunning Farm \u201d\u2014that a few days before the sitting of the court at the June term, he called on the widow and Margaret King, two of the defendants in the partition suit, to make some arrangements about a partition and the assignment of dower for the widow in that farm; that he told them, that he wished it done at the coming June term; that they hoth objected to taking any steps to have the dower set off, alleging it would damage the sale. The widow remarked, that she was old and did not wish to live on the farm, and would not if the farm was given to her, but they both stated they were willing, and anxious to have the farm sold, provided the widow could have in money, the portion to which she was entitled, in lieu of dower. We then proposed to them to make a mutual-arrangement to get a sale of the farm, and if it could be effected, the widow to have an annuity or money in lieu of her dower, and to expedite the business and save costs, he proposed to proceed at once and get a decree at the coming June term. This they all agreed to, and agreed also, to em- \u2022 ploy attorneys and waive all process and come into court the next June term, and obtain a decree as proposed, provided that George it. Dunning, a son of Achshah, and brother of Margaret, and one of the defendants, was willing, and would assent to the proposed proceeding; and he further said that the next day, or the next day but one, he went to see Geo. R Dunning and Oren King, the husband of Margaret, also one of the defendants whom he did see, and each expressed himself willing and was desirous that matters should be mutually arranged and proceedings had as the said Achshah Dunning, Margaret King, and he, had before agreed.

Roff to appear for himself, for Achshah Dunning and for Margaret King; and further said they would go on at the June term of court, as proposed and agreed upon; he further said that a few days after, he called on these parties, and told each of them it would be necessary for them all to go to Middleport and appear, or give their consent to the arrangement which they had made, to which Achshah and George agreed, and they both went to Middleport with him, but Margaret said she could not well go, but would agree to anything Achshah and George should do in the business; that George also, at that time, when at Middleport, informed him, that he had employed Asa B. Boff, attorney for himself and Achshah, and Margaret; he further said the suit could now be got up and the parties could go ahead with it, whereupon he called upon Boff, who also said he was employed as attorney in the cause; and he further said that Boff did appear in the cause, as also Chester Kinney on the part of the defendants with Boff, and he further said that George B.

He also said that George B. Dunning and Oren King, were both present in court when the decree in the case was being settled, and that George particularly interested himself in the decree, which was finally settled to suit him; and he further says that George, and Oren King were both present at the public sale of the farm which was sold under the decree of the court, that they both interested themselves at the sale to get bidders, and to have the farm sold at a good price, and that neither of them made objections to the sale; he also says further, that he had a conversation with Margaret King the day before the farm was sold by O. F. McNeil, Esq., commissioner, who made no objections tohhe sale, but she stated that she had understood Dr. Fowler and Charles Sherman had intended to bid on the farm; that they owned land on each side of it, and if they bought it they would divide it to suit their convenience; he further said he was at the house of Oren King the day after the sale of the farm and heard him remark to his wife, Margaret King, that Mr. Wright, the purchaser of the farm, wished to negotiate, and buy up the back payments at 10 per cent, discount, and Margaret said she would not negotiate, but that she preferred that the payments should be secured by a mortgage on the farm, and have her interest; and he farther said that Dr. Fowler and Charles Sherman both bid on the farm at the public sale, and also, that at least one other person, bid on the farm at the sale to his knowledge, and also that others bid as he was informed and believes.</summary><summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\" pgmap=\"309\">A.

R., 302; 7 Iowa, 320, and 30 Verm., 285. Tney also contended, that the whole proceedings were amicable, and that setting them asi.de, at this late day, would work great injury to the purchasers, who purchased ignorant of any objections.</p> <opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b313-5\" pgmap=\"313\">Mr. Justice Breese</author> <p id=\"Aqc\" pgmap=\"313\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p> <p id=\"b313-6\" pgmap=\"313\">This was a motion in the Circuit Court of Iroquois county, to set aside a sale on partition, and all the orders made in the cause.</p> <p id=\"b313-7\" pgmap=\"313\">The suit was for the partition of the land of Eben Dunning, and filed by a portion of his heirs at law against the widow and the other heirs at law. The defendants duly appeared and filed their answers to the petition, and such proceedings were thereupon had, that the court decreed a partition of the lands and appointed commissioners for that purpose, with directions to set off the widow\u2019s dower in the lands. At the same term the commissioners reported the land could not be divided without prejudice to the owners, whereupon an order was made for a sale of the land and a jury was empannelled to enquire of the yearly value of the widow\u2019s dower, and to allot the same to her, instead of a portion of th\u00e9 land. The jury assessed the yearly value of the dower at two hundred and twenty-five dollars. A sale was made by the Master in Chancery of the land, subject to this allotment to the widow, which was approved by the court.</p> <p id=\"b313-8\" pgmap=\"313\">A motion was made to set aside all the proceedings, which the court denied.</p> <p id=\"b313-9\" pgmap=\"313\">Many reasons were assigned as grounds of the motion, all which, it is not necessary to notice. The one most important is the first; that the petition was not sworn to as the statute requires. This objection would have prevailed, doubtless, if made at the outset, and before answer filed. After a regular appearance by attorney, answer filed, decree had, and a sale of the premises, and the report thereof approved, this objection comes too late. It is, at most, but a dilatory motion, and must be made in apt time, which is at the earliest moment.</p> <p id=\"b314-4\" pgmap=\"314\">As.to the second point, process is unnecessary in any case, where the party voluntarily appears and pleads. Process could do no more than compel appearance, and the purpose is answered if the party comes voluntarily into court. But it is said, the attorneys who appeared for the defendants, and put in the answer to the petition, had no such authority. On this point there are several affidavits, and the weight of testimony contained in them, greatly preponderates in favor of the right of the attorneys to enl er an appearance and file an answer. It seemed to be an amicable proceeding between all the parties interested. This disposes of the third objection. As to the fourth, there is no law with which we are familiar, requiring the presiding judge of a Circuit Court to sign a decree which he directs the clerk to enter. The entry of the decree on the record gives it its validity.</p> <p id=\"b314-5\" pgmap=\"314\">As to the fifth objection that the plaintiff was a non-resident and filed no cost bond, it comes too late, after answering to the merits. It if a dilatory motion, and if not interposed at the proper time, will be considered as waived. The objection cannot be made after answer or plea filed. Trustees of Schools v. Walters, 12 Ill., 154.</p> <p id=\"b314-6\" pgmap=\"314\">It is unnecessary to pass upon the other points in detail, but we will come to the eleventh, which seems to present the gist of the controversy. It is this. \u201c Because the lands were sold for one-half their value.\u201d None of the affidavits show that there was any unfairness at the sale, It is admitted by all, that the whole proceeding was regular, and the sale had in the presence of two of the defendants and their attorneys, and no objections made. The evidence is quite strong, that with the yearly incumbrance of two hundred and twenty-five dollars on the land, in favor of the widow, fifteen dollars per acre was a full price for the land.</p> <p id=\"b314-7\" pgmap=\"314(46) 315(57)\">But an insuperable objection to allowing the motion, is, that the purchaser of the land had no notice of the motion. He was a party in interest and entitled to notice. Nor could the court, on the motion to set aside the sale, look into any irregularities preceding the sale. There being, then, a ratification by the defendants of the acts of the attorneys, Boff and Kinney, if not an implied original authority to enter their appearance, and the court having thus jurisdiction of the defendants, we do not feel authorized on this motion, to go back of the decree of sale.</p> <p id=\"b315-6\" pgmap=\"315\">On the merits of the controversy, the whole case shows that the proceedings for partition and for an allowance to the. widow, were of that amicable character, at the start, families often enter into, but which sometimes terminate, as this has done, in an expensive law suit.</p> <p id=\"b315-7\" pgmap=\"315\">The judgment, on the motion, must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b315-8\" pgmap=\"315\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
