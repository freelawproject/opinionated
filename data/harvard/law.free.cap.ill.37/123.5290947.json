There is no prayer in the bill, nor facts in the case, authorizing or justifying a perpetual injunction, on the collection and payment of so great a sum as $4000; nor the appropriation of $3000, to satisfy a judgment of $1523, even if the same were a sufficient foundation for the bill.</p><p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-11\" pgmap=\"130\">2. Judgment cannot be rendered against a garnishee, as the maker of a promissory note, until the same is due, ( Scates\u2019 Comp., 232,) nor until after judgment is had against the defendant in the attachment, (sec. 15, p. 231 Scates\u2019 Com.) A' large portion of said notes were not due when the bill was filed, and judgment in favor of Hart was rendered, and some of them were not due when the decree was rendered.</p><p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-12\" pgmap=\"130\">3.

The judgment against W. &amp; B., for want of personal service or seizure of property, is not evidence of a debt, and is not sufficient to authorize the bill.

The merits of the entire controversy were settled in the question of making the injunction perpetual; ordering the money into court, and the distribution, and the pleadings and proofs taken, all constituted the basis of such a decree. The prayer of this bill was for an injunction; that was granted. Defendants sought to dissolve it; complainants to perpetuate it, and the decree of the court was in accordance with the prayer of the bill, that it should be made perpetual; that the garnishee should be enjoined from paying the money to the fraudulent assignee.</p><p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-8\" pgmap=\"131(54) 132(34)\">2. Although the notes of the garnishees were not due, when the bill was filed, yet the' rights of the complainants or the decree of the court, on hearing the motion to dissolve, could in no manner whatever be affected by that circumstance. The purpose of the bill was to set aside a fraudulent assignment of the notes and chattel mortgages' made by the garnishees to restrain their payment until the court should order them paid; and then to have payments made as the court should direct.</p><p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-5\" pgmap=\"132\">3. The order of the court making the injunction perpetual, was not erroneous, but was fully sustained by the facts developed in the evidence, and on the settled principles of equity and the practice of the courts thereof.</p><p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-6\" pgmap=\"132\">4. The evidence of the facts, showing the most outrageous frauds in the contracting of the debt due to complainants, by the defendant, Clapp, under the alias of Wightman; that the pretended debt due from him to his kinsman, for which he assigned this large amount of notes, and the chattel mortgages taken on the vessels, all establish to a demonstration that the whole transaction of Q. A. Wightman, alias C. W. Clapp, by which the debts due to complainants were contracted; his sale of his property, absconding from the State, and the pretended assignment of the notes and chattel mortgages, were all acts of the grossest fraud and downright villainy, carried on by the principal defendant, under an alias for a series of years; and culminating by his absconding from the State. On the principles of the ease already cited, and the facts -as adduced by the evidence, we claim that the decree was in accordance with the law and the evidence. The evidence is conclusive, that Albert Clapp was not a bona fide purchaser of these securities; that he had no means to purchase with; that he was a mere adjunct in the hands of his kinsman, Q. A. Wightman.</p> <opinion data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b132-7\" pgmap=\"132\">Mr. Chief Justice Walker</author> <p id=\"Ak8\" pgmap=\"132\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p> <p id=\"b132-8\" pgmap=\"132(40) 133(111)\">The bill alleges, that defendant in error, in the month of October, 1862, recovered a judgment against Q. A. Wightman and Edward Benton, in an attachment suit in the Superior Court of Chicago. But, inasmuch as there was no service on the defendants, or levy on property, no execution could issue upon the judgment, against them. Also, that Wight-man\u2019s real name was Charles W. Clapp, and that he and Benton had been engaged in the commission business in the city of Chicago, as partners, for about two years, before the commencement of the attachment suit. That in January, 1862, C. W. Clapp absconded, to defraud his creditors, and that Benton was insolvent and left the city about the same time. That C. W. Clapp,under the false name of Wightman, sold to one Johnson the schooner Palmetto, receiving therefor ten notes of $200 each, secured by a mortgage on the vessel.</p> <p id=\"b133-5\" pgmap=\"133\">That soon afterwards, C. W. Clapp returned secretly to Chicago, and fraudulently and without consideration transferred the notes and mortgage to Albert Clapp. That the notes are due and unpaid, and that Albert holds them in trust for Charles. That Albert knew his nephew had absconded from Massachusetts, owing large sums of money, for the purpose of delaying creditors, and that Albert also knew that Charles assumed the name of Wightman for fraudulent purposes. And that he knew that he absconded from Chicago owing O ( O money, and the sale of the vessel was in contemplation of so absconding, to defraud defendant' in error.</p> <p id=\"b133-8\" pgmap=\"133\">That he also sold to F. &amp; C. Kaehler the schooner Argo, receiving therefor five notes of five hundred dollars each, two of which were secured by mortgage on that vessel, which were transferred, under the same circumstances, to Albert Clapp, who holds them in trust for Charles. And charges a secret agreement that Albert will reassign the notes and mortgages to C. W. Clapp, and that these notes are due and unpaid.</p> <p id=\"b133-9\" pgmap=\"133(72) 134(34)\">It is further alleged, that in the attachment suit, garnishee process was served on F. Kaehler and Johnson, and that, to their answer, they attached an affidavit of Albert, stating that the assignment was made in good faith, and for a valuable consideration. That Blanchard, as attorney of Albert and C. W. Clapp, holds the notes, and is apprised of all the circumstances of the case. The bill requires answers under oath. Prays that defendants he decreed to pay complainant his judgment, interest and costs, out of the notes; that the assignment he canceled, and that the Clapps be enjoined from collecting the notes.</p> <p id=\"b134-5\" pgmap=\"134\">Albert Clapp answered, admitting the sales of the vessels, the taking of the notes by Charles, and the recovery1 of the judgment in the attachment suit, as alleged. Also the assignment of the notes to him, but denies that it was fraudulent; and insists that it was done in good faith, and to secure bona fide indebtedness, due from Charles to him: Denies all fraud, and all the material allegations of the bill.</p> <p id=\"b134-6\" pgmap=\"134\">The question ai\u2019ises, whether the sworn answer of Albert \" Clapp has been overcome by the evidence of two witnesses, or that of'one, and circumstances equal to the-testimony of another. A careful examination of complainant\u2019s evidence shows that there is, we think, an entire want of direct or circumstancial evidence to show that the assignment was without consideration, or was fraudulent. \u25a0 Hor does it show that Albert Clapp was insolvent, or of such limited means that Charles could not have been indebted to him. On the contrary, some of complainants\u2019 witnesses speak of his having some property, and most of them say he was engaged in business on his own account, or for others, and none of them seem to know anything definitely of his means. On the other hand, his testimony shows that he had means. Some of his witnesses say he was successful in business, and that they never heard his'solvency questioned. It also appears that he owned a house in Boston, and another in Salem, and loaned money. The assignment of the notes is prima fade evidence that a eonsidetion was paid, and the complainants\u2019 evidence, we think, fails to overcome it, and the sworn answer, and defendant\u2019s evidence, which seems to support the transaction as fair.</p> <p id=\"b134-7\" pgmap=\"134(31) 135(166)\">It is true that the evidence shows that Charles W. Clapp left Massachussets in debt, and without the knowledge of his creditors. That he left Chicago in the same manner, and and it may be reasonably inferred that he was insolvent at both places. But we are at a loss to perceive how this proves the transaction fraudulent, or that Albert Clapp, his uncle, had no claims against him. For aught that appears, the debt to his uncle may have been a portion of the debts that rendered him insolvent. Albert swears that he was indebted to him at the time, and to satisfy which, the assignment was made, and we find no positive evidence that it was not true, and we think the circumstances fail to show that he did not owe him. For does the fact, that Albert and Charles were relatives, prove fraud. It may be a circumstance to excite suspicion, but, of itself, is not prooffcnor do we think, in connection with other circumstances, that it overcomes the sworn answer responsive to the allegations of the bill. The decree of the court below must, therefore, be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b135-6\" pgmap=\"135\">Decree reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
