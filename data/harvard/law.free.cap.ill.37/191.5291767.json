Gibbs, Webster C. Gibbs, Lauretta C. Gibbs, and Ellen L. Gibbs, against Bussell Gibbs and Frederick P. Brown. The bill alleges, that Asahel Gibbs died, on the 17th day of July, 1859, intestate, leaving complainant, Eliza Ann Gibbs, widow, and the other complainants his sole heirs at law. *</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\" pgmap=\"190\">That in the lifetime of Asahel, defendant Bussell Gibbs, on tne 23d day of August, 1855, purchased of defendant Brown, the S. W. J, T. 17, N. B. 2, E. of the fourth meridian, and took a bond for a deed therefor. That on the 20th of September, 1857, Asahel Gibbs agreed with Bussell Gibbs, that he would pay Brown $169, of the purchase money, and Bussell agreed that Brown should convey to Asahel when he should make the payment, forty acres, in the Northeast corner of the quarter section, ninety rods long and seventy rods wide. That Asahel made the payment to Brown, and Bussell gave him a written order to Brown for the conveyance.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\" pgmap=\"190\">That Asahel presented the order to Brown, who made the deed, but held it as an escrow. That Asahel took possession, and erected a house and broke and fenced it, and made other lasting and valuable improvements on the land. That Bussell Gibbs on the 13th of January, 1859, told Brown that Asahel preferred the land in a square form, and induced Brown to convey the whole quarter to him, under a promise that he would make a deed to Asahel, for his portion of the land. That Bussell refused to make the conveyance.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-7\" pgmap=\"190\">That Bussell pretends, that Asahel was indebted to him as executor of their father\u2019s estate.

That he is informed, that Bussell and Asahel made the agreement charged in the bill. That Asahel paid him the $169, and presented an order on him from Bussell Gibbs, for a conveyance of the forty' acres, which he made, but did not deliver, because Asahel did not call for it; that Asahel took possession of the land and made the improvements as alleged in the bill.

Admits that he gave the written order to Brown, to convey to Asahel, and that he told Brown that Asahel wanted the land in a square form. Denies fraud in procuring the deed, but admits that it was in accordance with an agreement between himself and Asahel. Admits that Asahel made the improvement on the land as charged.

The whole estate, after the death of Euphenia, was, under the will of John Gibbs, Sr., held for his sole use and benefit, and to be applied solely 1o his maintenance and support. He then was virtually interested in the result of the suit. He was incapable of supporting himself, as all the proof shows, and this property was all he had to depend upon. It seems to us a stronger case cannot be found.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-8\" pgmap=\"192\">The heirs at law of John Gibbs, Sr., are all interested as entitled to the remainder of the estate, as the will provides that it shall go to them after the death of the idiot.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-9\" pgmap=\"192\">2.

Shaw, for defendants in error.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b193-5\" pgmap=\"193\">Mr. Chief Justice Walker</author> <p id=\"AmE\" pgmap=\"193\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p> <p id=\"b193-6\" pgmap=\"193\">This was a bill in equity exhibited for the purpose of compelling a specific performance of a contract, and to enforce a conveyance of the land in controversy. The bill alleges that the purchase was made, the consideration was paid, possession taken, and valuable improvements put upon the land, by the purchaser. That a deed was executed by Brown at the request of defendant Gibbs, of whom the ancestor of complainants had purchased, which was never delivered, but Bussell Gibbs induced Brown to convey to him, he at the time promising to convey to Asahel Gibbs, according to their agreement. The facts are admitted by the answers of defendants; but Bussell Gibbs sets up, to defeat a conveyance to complainants, that the money which was paid for the land, was a trust fund of John Gibbs, Jr., an idiot, which had come to the hands of Asahel, under the will of their father, for the support and maintenance of John. Defendant Gibbs submits to convey the property to any suitable person the court may appoint, to hold the same in trust, according to the original design of its creation.</p> <p id=\"b193-7\" pgmap=\"193\">The question as to the relief sought by the cross bill was not urged on the argument, and we therefore treat it as abandoned. It is, however, insisted that the court erred in refusing to treat the property as a trust fund, and in not dismissing the bill for want of proper parties. According to the view which we take of the case, it is unnecessary to inquire whether the land was trust property, or the money with which it was purchased was a trust fund. If it was such, then John Gibbs had the beneficial interest in the property; and the general rule that all persons having an interest in the subject matter of the suit must be made parties, is urged for a reversal. To this rule there are some well recognized exceptions, and it is insisted by the other side that this case falls within one of them.</p> <p id=\"b194-4\" pgmap=\"194\">In Story\u2019s Equity Pleadings, sec. 226, b, whilst considering who ought not, or need not he made parties to a bill, the author says: \u201c So in case of a common bill for a specific performance of a contract of sale of real estate, the only proper parties, in general, are the parties to the contract itself. Special cases, indeed may exist, in which the rule may be otherwise; but they stand on their own peculiar ground.\u201d He is treating of parties to bills without reference to whether they must he plaintiffs or defendants. According to this authority, it is wholly immaterial whether John Gibbs, Jr. was made a party or not, and this rule is fully sustained by reason and authority. Hor do we discover in the facts of this ease any peculiar circumstances which should take it out of the operation of the rule. The vendor is a party on one side, and the heirs of the vendee are parties on the other, and so far as we can see, full and complete justice can be done without having other parties before the court. If defendant Gibbs had claims against the idiot which were a charge on the trust fund, or if equities existed between them proper to be adjusted in this proceeding, then John Gibbs, Jr., should have been made a party; but the case discloses no such circumstances.</p> <p id=\"b194-5\" pgmap=\"194\">If the heirs of Asahel Gibbs are liable to account to John Gibbs for the trust fund, he or his conservator can, when they choose, compel them to do so, and then if he has rights, they, if established will be fully protected. From the evidence there can be no doubt, that Asahel in his lifetime, was entitled to a conveyance of the property to himself. And wc do not perceive that it matters in the slightest degree, to Bussell Gibbs, whether it was to be held as a trust fund or in his own right. Asahel held the equitable title and had the undoubted right to have united with it, the legal title. Hor could Bussell Gibbs exonerate himself from the liability to convey, by showing, that as between his vendee and some other person, there were unadjusted equities in reference to the property.</p> <p id=\"b195-5\" pgmap=\"195\">It is also insisted that the decree, requiring defendant Brown to convey with covenants for title, .was erroneous. The decree in terms does not require such a conveyance, but requires him to convey by a \u201c good and sufficient conveyance.\u201d It appears that when it was proposed that Brown should convey to Asahel Gibbs, he prepared a warranty deed. And when it is remembered that this deed was prepared according to the agreement of all the parties, we may safely conclude that Asahel was to have a deed containing a covenant of warranty, and this the decree has required, and no other. And if such was the understanding, Bussell Gibbs could not defeat it by receiving a quit claim deed for the premises from Brown. He had agreed to convey to Bussell Gibbs by warranty deed, and no reason is perceived why he should not, under the agreement to convey to Asahel, execute to him the same kind of a conveyance. It in no way increases his liability, but is in accordance with his contract. There is no evidence that there was any agreement that Asahel should receive from Brown a quit claim deed. We perceive no error in this portion of the decree.</p> <p id=\"ATu\" pgmap=\"195\">Upon a careful examination of the entire record we perceive no error requiring the reversal of the decree, and it must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b195-7\" pgmap=\"195\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
