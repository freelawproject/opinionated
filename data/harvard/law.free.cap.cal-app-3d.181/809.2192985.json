(Pen. Code, \u00a7 4501; all future undesignated statutory references will be to the Penal Code.) He was also found to have intentionally inflicted great bodily injury. (\u00a7 12022.7.) The court sentenced him to the upper term of six years with a three-year enhancement for the infliction of great bodily injury, the nine years to be served consecutive to the term he was serving at the time. The court also assessed a $1,000 restitution fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">On appeal, the defendant sows the seeds of a number of arguments. In the published portion of this decision, we reject his claim that section 12022.7 is unconstitutionally vague. Similarly fruitless are his arguments (1) expert testimony is required to support a section 12022.7 enhancement; (2) his cross-examination was improperly limited as to the permanent nature of the victim\u2019s great bodily injury; (3) photographs of the wounds were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>improperly admitted; (4) the prosecutor committed misconduct in his opening statement; (5) instructional error negated his theory of self-defense; and (6) the sentencing court failed to consider factors in mitigation, all six of which we find barren in the unpublished portion of this opinion. Thus, his conviction will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The defendant admitted stabbing inmate Ricky Reese six or seven times with a knife while assisted by several other inmates at the Susanville Correctional Center. The victim, whose testimony we are bound to accept on appeal following a judgment of conviction, stated he was the object of an unprovoked attack by the other men. The defendant claimed he acted in self-defense. Among other facts upon which this defense was predicated was his testimony the victim allegedly had been harassing him for several months and had warned the defendant to arm himself before the confrontation. Further, during the melee, the victim supposedly attempted to hit him by swinging a \u201clock in a sock\u201d at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">The defendant makes three arguments relating to section 12022.7 which we collect under one heading.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">We first consider his argument that section 12022.7 is unconstitutionally vague because one cannot tell from instance to instance what injuries will be considered significant or substantial enough to constitute great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">The orthodox test under the United States or California constitutions for unconstitutional vagueness is whether the statute \u201c \u2018either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application^] violating] the first essential of due process of law.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Grubb </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 614,619 [47 Cal.Rptr. 772,408 P.2d 100] [citing <em>Connally v. General Construction Co. </em>(1926) 269 U.S. 385, 391 [70 L.Ed. 322, 328, 46 S.Ct. 126]].) However, \u201ca statute is sufficiently certain if it employs words of long usage or with a common law meaning, \u2018notwithstanding an element of degree in the definition as to which estimates may differ.\u2019\u201d <em>(Lorenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 49, 60-61 [216 P.2d 859] [citing <em>Con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number><em>nally, supra, 269 </em>U.S. at p. 391 [70 L.Ed. at p. 391]].) As we have stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kimbrel </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 869, 876 [174 Cal.Rptr. 816], \u201cWe are persuaded by the long acceptance of \u2018great bodily injury\u2019 as a term commonly understandable to jurors that it has not acquired a technical legal definition requiring in the absence of special circumstances a clarifying instruction.\u201d While the defendant may be correct in that an \u201cI know it when I see it\u201d standard is applied to injuries under section 12022.7 <em>(cf. Jacobellis </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 184, 197 [12 L.Ed.2d 793, 803-804, 84 S.Ct. 1676] [Stewart, J., concurring]), men of common intelligence can apply these words of long usage to discern what injuries they are forbidden to inflict under pain of enhancement. \u201cIf appellant is suggesting that he didn\u2019t understand that [repeatedly stabbing] a person . . . [would] result in great bodily injury, his lack of understanding snaps the bounds of credulity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Covino </em>(1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 660, 668 [161 Cal.Rptr. 155].) Section 12022.7 is constitutional. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 960, 962-963 [170 Cal.Rptr. 872] [\u00a7 245, subd. (a), is not unconstitutionally vague for use of term \u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d]; <em>Covino, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.3d at p. 668 [same]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Poulin </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d54,59-61 [103 Cal.Rptr. 623] [\u00a7 12310 is not unconstitutionally vague for use of term \u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">B.-V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Sims, J., and Carr, Acting P.
