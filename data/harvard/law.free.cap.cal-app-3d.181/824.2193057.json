J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACi\">Anthony D. Oliver, M.D. (petitioner or Dr. Oliver) appeals from a judgment denying his petition for a writ of mandate to compel the Board of Trustees of Eisenhower Medical Center (EMC) to set aside its order denying his application for membership to the Consulting Medical Staff of EMC and to reconsider his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">\n<em>Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">EMC is a private, nonprofit hospital in Coachella Valley. State licensing law vests final authority and responsibility for an acute care hospital such as EMC in the hospital\u2019s governing body. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 22, \u00a7 70035.) Every hospital in California must have an \u201corganized medical staff responsible to the governing body for the adequacy and quality of the medical care rendered to patients in the hospital.\u201d (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 22, \u2022\u00a7 70703, subd. (a).) The governing body is responsible for the appointment and reappointment of members to the hospital\u2019s medical staff (Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Admin. Code, tit. 22, \u00a7 70701, subd. (a)(1)(B)) and for assuring that the medical staff establishes controls designed to insure the maintenance of high standards of professional and ethical practices at the hospital (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 22, \u00a7 70701, subd. (a)(7)). The medical staff must establish bylaws which provide formal procedures for \u201cthe evaluation of staff applications and credentials, appointments, reappointments, assignment of clinical privileges, appeals mechanisms and such other subjects or conditions which the medical staff and governing body deem appropriate.\u201d (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 22, \u00a7 70703, subd. (b).)  While the actions of private hospitals do not constitute \u201cstate action\u201d triggering the constitutional guarantees of due process <em>(Anton </em>v. <em>San Antonio Community Hospital </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 638, 653-654 [183 Cal.Rptr. 423]), hospitals are required when considering an application for staff membership to afford the applicant certain minimal requirements of \u201cfair procedure.\u201d <em>(Id.; </em>see also <em>Ezekial </em>v. <em>Winkley </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 267, 278-279 [142 Cal.Rptr. 418, 572 P.2d 32]; <em>Lewin </em>v. <em>St. Joseph Hospital of Orange </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 368, 385 [146 Cal.Rptr. 892]; <em>Ascherman </em>v. <em>San Francisco Medical Society </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 623, 649 [114 Cal.Rptr. 681].)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">There are five categories of medical staff membership at EMC: Active, Associate, Courtesy, Consulting, and Honorary.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The Honorary Staff is comprised of practitioners of outstanding reputation who are not active at EMC or hold emeritus positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Members of the Active Staff consist of \u201cphysicians, dentists and podiatrists who regularly utilize the hospital facilities, who are located close enough to the hospital to provide continuous care for their patients, who assume all the functions and responsibilities of membership on the Active Medical Staff, including, where appropriate, emergency service care and consultation assignments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The Associate Staff \u201cis the entry level for applicants who are being considered for advancement to the Active Medical Staff,\u201d and members must meet the same basic qualifications as Active Staff members.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">The Courtesy Staff consists of \u201cphysicians, dentists, and podiatrists qualified for staff membership, but who only occasionally utilize the hospital facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Members of the Active, Associate and Courtesy Staffs have various administrative responsibilities, including service on committees, attendance at medical staff meetings, and payment of annual dues. In addition, these staff members must provide emergency service care. Lastly, members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>these categories of the staff have admitting privileges, and they provide the vast majority of medical services furnished at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">In contrast, the Consulting Staff is limited to \u201cthose physicians, dentists and podiatrists of widely renowned professional ability and reputation in the area of their specialty or whose specialty is not represented on the staff at the time of appointment . . . .\u201d Members of the Consulting Staff \u201cmay provide consultative services to other members of the staff.\u201d Consulting Staff members, however, do not have admitting privileges, nor are they required to pay medical staff dues or attend staff or departmental meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Petitioner purports to be an expert in neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry, particularly forensic psychiatry. He practices in Riverside and does not maintain an office in the Coachella Valley. He is on the Active Staff at Riverside Hospital and maintains staff privileges at Parkview Community Hospital in Riverside.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Petitioner applied for Consulting Staff membership at EMC and in due course his application was denied. EMC\u2019s internal review of petitioner\u2019s application included an investigation by the medical staff credentials committee, a review by the executive committee, a formal hearing before a judicial review committee of five physicians on EMC\u2019s medical staff, and appellate review by the board of trustees. Denial of petitioner\u2019s application was recommended at each step of the review process. Upon completion of the hospital\u2019s review, petitioner challenged the board\u2019s decision by filing a petition for writ of mandate in the Superior Court of Riverside County. The trial court conducted a hearing and upheld the board\u2019s decision to deny petitioner\u2019s application for privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">\n<em>Contentions on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">On appeal, petitioner raises three principal arguments: (1) EMC did not proceed in the manner required by law because the membership standard applied to Consulting Staff membership is not rationally related to providing high quality medical care; (2) the findings of the board are not supported by substantial evidence on the whole record; and (3) the medical staff did not offer evidence to support the board\u2019s findings. Petitioner\u2019s contentions are not meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">On May 7, 1982, petitioner applied for medical staff membership at EMC. Following a review by the credentials committee, the application was referred to the executive committee for consideration. The executive committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>initially processed the application as one for Associate Staff membership and denied the application because, inter alia, it was determined that petitioner did not satisfy article IV, sections 1 .A and l.B, of the medical staff bylaws (bylaws),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which require members of the Associate Staff to limit their practice to the Coachella Valley on a full-time basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Petitioner requested and was granted a hearing before the judicial review committee. At the hearing, it became apparent that petitioner intended to apply for consulting rather than Associate Staff membership. The application therefore was remanded to the credentials committee for further recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Following review and recommendation by the credentials committee, the executive committee recommended denial of petitioner\u2019s application for privileges. Petitioner was advised of that recommendation by letter of March 15, 1983, which stated that petitioner had shown: \u201c. . . No evidence of nationally or internationally renowned professional ability and reputation in the area of [his] specialty, and [his] qualifications are not considered unique in that they are already represented on the EMC Medical Staff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">At petitioner\u2019s request, and pursuant to the bylaws, a hearing was scheduled before the judicial review committee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 21, 1983, the committee met, reviewed the matter, heard oral testimony and argument, and voted unanimously to affirm the executive committee\u2019s recommendation. The judicial review committee found, inter alia:</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">\u201c4. There is no evidentiary support for Dr. Oliver\u2019s contention that he has \u2018widely renowned professional ability and reputation\u2019 in the field of Psychiatry. To the extent that Dr. Oliver has any demonstrable renown or reputation, it is as to Forensic Psychiatry and is confined to Riverside County.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">\u201c5. There is no Department of Forensic Psychiatry at EMC and it is unlikely that Dr. Oliver\u2019s expertise in that field would be of any significant value to Staff Physicians at EMC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">Petitioner then requested review of the judicial review committee\u2019s decision by the appellate review committee of the board of trustees. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>appellate review committee considered the matter and affirmed the judicial review committee\u2019s decision. On September 29, 1983, petitioner was advised of the hospital\u2019s decision to reject his application for staff membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">1. <em>Rationally Related Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Article IV, section 1, subsection D, of the bylaws of EMC provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Consulting Medical Staff shall consist of those physicians, dentists, and podiatrists of widely renowned professional ability and reputation in the area of their specialty or whose specialty is not represented on the staff at the time of appointment . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">In urging that this standard is not rationally related to the hospital\u2019s providing high quality medical care, petitioner urges, in essence, that the standard does not relate to physician competence and asserts that all competent physicians must be admitted to the medical staff. For these propositions he cites <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Eisenhower Medical Center </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 614, 631-632 [166 Cal.Rptr. 826, 614 P.2d 258] where, in analyzing a particular requirement for medical staff admission, the court stated in pertinent part: \u201cThe bylaw provision here before us, as we have indicated, must be read to preclude the rejection of an otherwise qualified physician from medical staff membership unless it can be shown that he manifests an inability to \u2018work with others\u2019 in the hospital setting which, by reason of its particular character, presents a real and substantial danger that patients treated by him at the facility might receive other than a \u2018high quality of medical care\u2019 if he were admitted to membership.\u201d Petitioner asserts in substance that the lack of \u201cwidely renowned professional ability and reputation in the area of [one\u2019s] specialty\u201d would not pose a \u201creal and substantial danger that patients treated by him . . . might receive other than a \u2018high quality of medical care\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">For the most part, however, petitioner\u2019s reliance on the <em>Miller </em>decision is unwarranted. Dr. Miller was an applicant for membership on the Active or Associate Staff at EMC, which would have entitled him to admit and actively treat patients at the hospital.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consulting Staff members, by contrast, may provide only consultative services to other members of the medical staff and do not have admitting privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>The distinction between the Associate or Active Staff and the Consulting Staff is critical. While Associate and Active Staff members admit and are responsible for new patients, Consulting Staff members do not admit patients nor add to the existing population, but simply provide consultative services to members of the medical staff to raise the level of care available to patients admitted by the other physicians. Denial of a physician\u2019s application for Associate Staff membership restricts access to the hospital for the physician\u2019s patients. Denial of Consulting Staff membership does not restrict patient access to the hospital. It therefore is not essential to make Consulting Staff membership available to <em>all </em>competent physicians. The hospital may apply a standard for membership on the Consulting Staff more closely related to the Consulting Staff\u2019s function.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">When viewed in relationship to the other categories of medical staff membership, the purpose of the Consulting Staff is clear: to permit the hospital, its physicians, and the public to reap the benefit of having resources available from those physicians of exceptional or unique talent who would otherwise be ineligible for staff membership at the hospital and thus be unavailable. The Consulting Staff enhances patient care by making available an educational and clinical resource to the other members of the medical staff which otherwise would not be available and is thus rationally related to providing high quality health care to EMC patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The requirement that physicians whose specialties are represented on the staff be \u201cwidely renowned\u201d in the area of their specialties furthers the objective of high quality patient care since those physicians will be among the most likely to possess unique and outstanding skills and qualifications. The availability of Consulting Staff membership to physicians whose specialities are not represented on the staff furthers medical staff education and, therefore, improves patient care. The location of EMC makes the availability of Consulting Staff members especially important. Exceptional practitioners are not as numerous in the Coachella Valley as in a metropolitan area. Hence, while membership in the Consulting Staff rarely is extended,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is a necessary category to allow the hospital to attract physicians of exceptional reputation and/or unique skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\"> The standards for Consulting Staff membership satisfy the substantial rationality test enunciated by the California Supreme Court in Miller.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>2. <em>Claimed Failure to Present Evidence and Absence of Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Contrary to fundamental tenets of appellate practice (see <em>Aceves </em>v. <em>Regal Pale Brewing Co. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 502, 507 [156 Cal.Rptr. 41, 595 P.2d <em>619]) the </em>facts stated and the inferences drawn in petitioner\u2019s appellate briefs are those most favorable to him rather than to EMC. No attempt is made to fairly state all of the evidence as is required. <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Fallon </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 881 [92 Cal.Rptr. 162, 479 P.2d 362]; <em>Strutt </em>v. <em>Ontario Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 866, 874 [105 Cal.Rptr. 395], and cases there cited.) Indeed, petitioner is content to make the rather outlandish assertion that no competent evidence was presented against him. Petitioner\u2019s briefs constitute merely a challenge to EMC to set forth or this court to find the evidence supporting the hospital\u2019s order and the trial court\u2019s judgment. Given this type of presentation the contention that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence may be deemed waived. <em>(Pick </em>v. <em>Santa Ana-Tustin Community Hospital </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 970, 979 [182 Cal.Rptr. 85], and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Happily, EMC has set forth its position and referred to considerable evidence supporting the order denying petitioner\u2019s application and the judgment of the trial court. For the benefit of the California Supreme Court in the event it is called upon to consider a petition for review, we include it in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The rejection of petitioner\u2019s application for staff privileges was based upon recommendations of the credentials committee, the executive committee, and the judicial review committee, all of which indicated that petitioner had failed to meet his burden of proof in satisfying the standard for Consulting Staff membership. In reaching its decision, the board specifically relied upon evidence introduced by the medical staff representative, which indicated that petitioner failed to meet the applicable bylaws standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Petitioner\u2019s purported areas of expertise are neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry. However, during the course of review, it became clear that petitioner is not board eligible in either neurosurgery or neurology, and although eligible in psychiatry, he has never become board certified. Hence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>petitioner has not undertaken to have his knowledge and skill evaluated by his peers, nor has he attempted to be certified as an expert in any specialty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">There is virtually no evidence showing petitioner is of wide renown. Petitioner has no academic affiliation, and he has authored or co-authored only six articles, three of which pertain to neurology and neurosurgery and were published more than 10 years ago. Only three of the articles relate to petitioner\u2019s current specialty, psychiatry, and one of the articles is a brief two-page note appearing in Psychiatric News, the \u201cNewspaper of the American Psychiatric Association.\u201d This clearly does not demonstrate wide renown in neurology, neurosurgery, or psychiatry, and indicates that petitioner is of no greater renown and accomplishment than many of the physicians in other staff categories who are certified by specialty boards in their fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Petitioner points to a variety of administrative appointments to support his position. While those might reflect that petitioner is reputedly competent and even well regarded in the area in which he practices, they do not necessarily support the contention that petitioner is of wide renown or possesses exceptional skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Petitioner\u2019s background was examined by three members of EMC\u2019s medical staff, and none of them found petitioner to be widely renowned in his specialty. Dr. Teicher, a psychiatrist, stated that: \u201cOutside of Riverside [petitioner] is not known. Dr. Oliver is not Board Certified in any specialty and his publications would not warrant appointment beyond assistant clinical professor, despite his experience. In no way does Dr. Oliver qualify for Consulting Medical Staff. He is not widely renowned professionally. He may be a good psychiatrist and expert in forensics\u2014locally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Dr. Cohen, a neurologist, stated: \u201c. . .1 find no evidence to indicate that Dr. Oliver is \u2018widely renowned\u2019 in his professional ability and reputation in any area. I find his self-representation to be pretentious rather than convincingly factual. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Dr. Oygar, a neurosurgeon, indicated: \u201cThe numerous enumerations [petitioner] has in his letter do not seem to appropriately correlate with the Bylaws requirement of the Consulting Medical Staff category that he is of widely renowned professional ability and reputation and should be included in the Consulting Staff. The only extensive background of experience that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>he seems to have is his exposure to a research fellowship for one year. The social appointments which he enumerates ... do not . . . make him \u2018renowned in his field,\u2019 to make him eligible to be on the Consulting Staff</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The opinions of Drs. Teicher, Cohen and Oygar, petitioner\u2019s lack of board certification, the paucity of petitioner\u2019s publications, his lack of board eligibility in neurology and neurosurgery, and the lack of any significant evidence to demonstrate wide renown constitute substantial evidence in support of the Board\u2019s decision. The three memoranda in question were competent evidence, admissible at the judicial review committee hearing. Article VIII, section 3(g) of the bylaws provides in part: \u201cAny relevant evidence shall be admitted by the presiding officer if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the admissibility of such evidence in a court of law. \u2019 \u2019 That standard regarding admissibility of evidence has been approved by this court. (See <em>Pick </em>v. <em>Santa Ana-Tustin Community Hospital, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d at p. 980.) The three memoranda in question are the type of evidence \u201con which responsible parties are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Although petitioner raises the specter of potential bias by asserting that Drs. Teicher, Cohen and Oygar are \u201cprospective competitors,\u201d this contention was apparently not raised at any level during the administrative process and may not be raised for the first time on judicial review. Moreover, the record contains not a shred of evidence to support this assertion; the record is devoid of any evidence demonstrating bias or improper motive on the part of the doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Petitioner provides this court with an enumeration of his accomplishments. However, the issue before this court is not petitioner\u2019s accomplishments or competence, but whether there is substantial evidence to support the hospital\u2019s findings. Clearly there is.  In reviewing for substantial evidence, all reasonable and legitimate inferences must be drawn to uphold the findings of the Board. <em>(Packer </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 63 [112 Cal.Rptr. 76].)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Finding No. 5 indicates that petitioner\u2019s expertise in forensic psychiatry would be of no significant value to staff physicians at EMC. The record clearly demonstrates that petitioner\u2019s skills in neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry already were represented on the staff at EMC. Dr. Williams testified that there was no \u201ccase since the opening of this institution which required the services of a forensic psychiatrist.\u201d It would make little sense and it is not a proper function of the courts to require the hospital to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>extend Consulting Staff privileges to a physician whose medical skills are not needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">McDaniel, J., and Rickles, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-11\">All bylaw references are to the medical staff bylaws and rules and regulations at Eisenhower Medical Center, approved by the medical staff on March 27, 1979, and by the board of trustees on October 5, 1979.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b687-12\">The judicial review committee is appointed by the executive committee for purposes of conducting a hearing and reviewing the executive committee\u2019s recommendation with regard to an application for staff membership or a limitation on staff privileges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Although the <em>Miller </em>opinion is not clear on this point, this court may take and has, after notice to the parties, taken judicial notice of the \u201cPETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE\u201d in the <em>Miller </em>case (Riverside Superior Court No. Indio 23351), which indicates that Dr. Miller filed an application for membership on either the Active or Associate Staff of EMC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Only two physicians have been admitted to EMC Consulting Staff membership to date.
