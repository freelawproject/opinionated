We find that appellant\u2019s foreclosure action is barred by Civil Code section 3144<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">The appellant herein, Sawyer Nurseries (hereinafter Sawyer), plaintiff below, is a contractor who provided labor and materials to improve certain real property located in Malibu, California (hereinafter Eagle Pass Property), owned by Lawrence J. Galardi, dba Lawrence J. Galardi, a professional corporation and Shari J. Galardi (hereinafter, jointly, Galardi). The respondents, defendants below, are the beneficiaries of a first (Tokai Bank, hereinafter, Tokai) and second (Cambridge Group, hereinafter, Cambridge) deed of trust. Galardi, the owner of the Eagle Pass Property and the trustor of the first trust deed to Tokai and the second trust deed to Cambridge is not a party to the proceedings herein by reason of his prior bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>In the course of Galardi\u2019s bankruptcy, Cambridge, the holders of the second deed of trust, sought relief from the United States Bankruptcy Court from the automatic stay imposed during such bankruptcy proceedings on all actions to collect or enforce claims against the bankrupt. Relief was granted with respect to the Eagle Pass Property and shortly thereafter Cambridge foreclosed upon its security and had a trustee\u2019s deed recorded. One hundred and sixty-six days after recordation of Cambridge\u2019s trustee\u2019s deed, Sawyer filed this action to foreclose its mechanic\u2019s lien on the Eagle Pass Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Times and dates of various events in issue in this matter are of particular importance and, accordingly, are set forth herein as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">September 22, 1978\u2014Galardi\u2019s first deed of trust to defendant Tokai is recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">August 9, 1979\u2014Sawyer commenced its work of improvement on the property owned by Galardi.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">February 8, 1980\u2014Galardi\u2019s second deed of trust to Cambridge is recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">July 19, 1981\u2014Galardi\u2019s chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">February 4, 1981\u2014Sawyer, describing itself as a secured creditor, files its request for notice with the United States Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">February 20, 1981\u2014Sawyer\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien claim in regard to labor, materials and other work provided to Galardi\u2019s Eagle Pass Property is prepared and recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">February 20, 1981\u2014Sawyer\u2019s secured creditor\u2019s claim, which notes its security status by virtue of a mechanic\u2019s lien on the subject real property for labor, materials and other work provided, is prepared and filed with the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">January 14 to November 9, 1982\u2014Sawyer, through its attorney, communicates with the bankruptcy trustee, with Galardi, and with Tokai and Cambridge through their respective counsel, asserting Sawyer\u2019s position as a secured creditor and claiming its interest in the Eagle Pass Property by means of \u201cvalid and perfected mechanic\u2019s liens.\u201d No secured creditor objected to Sawyer\u2019s claim of its secured status in the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">June 29, 1982\u2014Sawyer filed its complaint for marshaling of assets and for sale of real property free and clear of liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>July 9, 1982\u2014Cambridge filed its answer to Sawyer\u2019s complaint to marshal assets, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">November 9,1982\u2014The trustee in bankruptcy, through its counsel, enters into a stipulation with Sawyer, through its counsel, agreeing to the validity and amount of Sawyer\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien (without taking a position as to its priority).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">January 10, 1983\u2014Cambridge files its complaint in bankruptcy court to be relieved from the automatic stay (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362) of the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">January 17 to May 31, 1983\u2014Communication is had between Sawyer and Cambridge, through their respective counsel, regarding Sawyer\u2019s asserted claim. No agreement respecting that claim is had.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">June 6, 1983\u2014The bankruptcy court terminates and annuls the automatic stay on the Eagle Pass Property and permits foreclosure by Cambridge.

However, there are certain exceptions from that general principle. One of them is when the automatic stay occasioned by 11 United States Code section 362 is terminated. (2 Collier on Bankruptcy (15th ed.) par. 108.04, pp. 108-8ff.) Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Act automatically stays all proceedings to collect or enforce a claim against a bankrupt as long as the debtor or his property is in bankruptcy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Appellant properly filed its claim in the bankruptcy proceeding in accordance with section 501 of title 11 of the United States Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Without objection having been made thereto, appellant\u2019s filed claim was prima facie evidence of its validity for all purposes in the bankruptcy proceedings. (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(a).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; also <em>Matter of Colorado Corp. </em>(10th Cir. 1976) 531</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>F.2d 463; <em>In re Morales Vda. de Cruz </em>(D.C.P.R. 1973) 357 F.Supp. 1118; <em>In re Sabre Shipping Corporation </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1969) 299 F.Supp. 97; <em>Matter of Paul R. Dean Co., Inc. </em>(D.C.N.Y. 1978) 460 F.Supp. 452.)  As a result thereof, appellant contends that its filed claim in the bankruptcy proceeding, while the automatic stay imposed by the Bankruptcy Act was in effect, constituted evidence of its validity, amount and scope and negated appellant\u2019s obligation to institute a state court mechanic\u2019s lien foreclosure action once the automatic stay had been lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Appellant further argues that the filing of its secured creditor\u2019s claim shifted the burden to respondents, as secured creditors claiming an interest in the Eagle Pass Property, to challenge appellant\u2019s claim. Sawyer contends that respondents\u2019 failure to do so for the lengthy time period involved, in light of the fact that communication and correspondence between the respective parties had provided respondents with due notice and specific opportunities to challenge Sawyer\u2019s asserted secured creditor\u2019s claim, caused Sawyer to rely upon respondents\u2019 silence. Consequently, appellant proceeded to obtain a stipulated agreement, in response to its complaint to marshal assets, from the trustee for the debtor Galardi. Appellant claims that such agreement perfected the validity of its mechanic\u2019s lien, leaving only the issue of its priority open for future resolution. Appellant concludes, therefrom, that respondents are properly and justifiably to be charged with laches and have lost their rights to contest, challenge or deny appellant\u2019s allowed claim. <em>(In re Pittsburg Lead &amp; Zinc Consolidated </em>(D.C.Mo. 1912) 198 Fed. 316; <em>In re Williams </em>(D.C.Ga. 1915) 224 Fed. 984; <em>In re Hinckel Brewing Co. </em>(D.C.N.Y. 1903) 123 Fed. 942; also <em>In re Nichols, </em>(N.D.N.Y. 1909) 166 Fed. 603.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Finally, appellant claims that when Galardi\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy entered into the November 9, 1982, stipulation with Sawyer confirming the validity and amount of the mechanic\u2019s lien claim, the trustee\u2019s act not only bound the debtor, Galardi, but also respondents. Appellant contends that the trustee had the power to bind the debtor Galardi and all those in privity with him. Sawyer proffers the argument that respondents Tokai and Cambridge were in privity with Galardi by virtue of their respective deeds of trust against the Eagle Pass Property and, therefore, respondents should have been barred by the doctrine of res judicata from attempting to assert defenses and claims against the validity and amount of Sawyer\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Respondents did not contest the amount or the legitimacy of appellant\u2019s claim in the bankruptcy proceedings as against the debtor, Galardi. Respondents concede that appellant is entitled to participate in and obtain distribution from Galardi\u2019s estate pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>court. Respondents argue, however, that the matter before this court concerns itself with real property over which the bankruptcy court had terminated its jurisdiction and had lifted the automatic stay that had theretofore prevented appellant from perfecting its mechanic\u2019s lien rights on that real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Respondents take the position that the action of the trustee in bankruptcy with respect to the various creditor\u2019s claims filed in the bankruptcy case affects such creditor\u2019s interests only in regard to their respective rights to participate in and obtain distribution from the debtor\u2019s estate pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court. They argue that the filing of its secured creditor\u2019s claim in the bankruptcy court did not relieve appellant from the need to move expeditiously, as required by state law, to protect its rights and interests in property over which the bankruptcy court terminated its jurisdiction. Further, respondents argue that there were no issues of fact presented at trial that was sufficient to estop them from raising the statute of limitations bar of Civil Code section 3144. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The purpose of a bankruptcy proceeding is to allow for the orderly distribution of the debtor-in-bankruptcy\u2019s assets. Creditors are permitted to file claims in such bankruptcy proceedings in order to share in the distribution of the debtor\u2019s assets. (11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 501, 502.) A properly filed claim is deemed prima facie evidence of its validity and means that the claimant may participate in distribution of the bankrupt\u2019s assets, absent disallowance of the claim. (3 Collier on Bankruptcy (15th ed.) par. 50201, pp. 502-9ff; 9A Am.Jur.2d, Bankruptcy (15th ed.) \u00a7 595, pp. 268ff.) Appellant acted appropriately to protect its rights in Galardi\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding when it filed its claim. The filing of such a claim, however, is a purely ministerial or administrative act and not a judicial act. Judicial consideration of the claim occurs only in respect to its allowance, sua sponte, or upon an objection being filed in accordance with the Bankruptcy Act. <em>(In re Hart Ski Mfg. Co. Inc. </em>(Conn.D.C. 1982) 18 B.R. 154, 159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Coincidental with the filing of its secured creditor\u2019s claim in the bankruptcy proceeding, appellant properly recorded its mechanic\u2019s lien on the Galardi property with the Los Angeles County Recorder\u2019s office,  The necessity of initiating action to foreclose on that mechanic\u2019s lien was automatically stayed pursuant to 11 United States Code section 362 by Galardi\u2019s filing of its petition for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court. <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>S &amp; S Development </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 13,18 [63 Cal.Rptr. 663].) The tolling of the statute, however, exists only for the time that the real property in issue remains within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and is property of the debtor\u2019s estate. <em>(In re Perry </em>(D.C.Md. 1983) 29 B.R. 787, at p. 794.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>When, on June 6, 1983, the bankruptcy court terminated and annulled the Galardi bankruptcy case stay to permit foreclosure by Cambridge of its security deed of trust on the Eagle Pass Property and, when, on August 31, 1983, Cambridge foreclosed on said deed of trust and recorded the trustee\u2019s deed 400on the following day, September 1,1983, the property ceased being property of the debtor\u2019s estate and the automatic stay provided by 11 United States Code section 362 terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In the <em>Perry </em>case, the United States District Court, quoting from the United States House Report No. 95-595, reprinted in 1978 United States Code Congressional and Administrative News at page 6299, stated as follows: \u201c[s]ubsection (c) of Section 362 specifies the duration of the automatic stay. Paragraph (1) terminates a stay of an act against property of the estate when the property ceases to be property of the estate, such as by sale, abandonment, or exemption.\u201d The applicable principle is that the automatic stay remains in effect as long as the property in issue remains in the debtor\u2019s estate. When the property leaves the dominion of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, as in this matter, by sale pursuant to the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, and becomes the property of others, it no longer has the protection of the stay provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Once the automatic stay tolling Civil Code section 3144 terminated, appellant was required to act within the 90-day statutory time limitation set forth therein in order to protect its mechanic\u2019s lien rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Neither of the authorities cited by appellant in support of its \u201cprivity/res judicata\u201d argument are applicable here. <em>Swafford Bros. Dry Goods Co. </em>v. <em>Owen </em>(1913) 37 Okla. 616 [133 P. 193], deals with (1) the doctrine of estoppel and its application in preventing a creditor, because of his past dealings with the entity, from denying the corporate status of a technically deficient corporate entity and (2) the determination that a creditor\u2019s election to proceed with a claim in bankruptcy against such technically deficient corporate entity waives any right that may exist to pursue that same claim against a shareholder of the company outside of the bankruptcy proceedings. <em>In re Merrick </em>(D.C.Mich. 1873) case No. 9463, 17 Fed. case No. 75 deals with (1) the powers and duties of a register to whom a cause in bankruptcy was referred under the Bankruptcy Act of 1868, (2) the method of establishing proof of a debt owed under that same Bankruptcy Act and, (3) the necessity of a creditor\u2019s use of an attorney to present such a claim in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">This court assumes that appellant\u2019s counsel neither deliberately nor through, gross misconduct intended to direct this court to authorities totally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>unrelated to the issues before it as such conduct would be inexcusable upon the part of any lawyer and only places additional burdens on this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The term \u201cprivity\u201d is an elusive concept, without any precise definition of general applicability. However, it is not necessary for us to explore all of its subtleties here. <em>(St. Louis Typographical Union No. 8 </em>v. <em>Herald Company </em>(E.D.Mo. 1967) 277 F.Supp. 276, 284.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u201cPrivity\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as used when applying the doctrine of res judicata in the circumstances in issue here means mutual or successive relationship to precisely the same right of property; as testator and executor, ancestor and heir, assignor and assignee, grantor and grantee, and lessor and lessee. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Stull </em>(D.C.Conn. 1952) 105 F.Supp. 568, 571; <em>Estate of Hanson </em>(1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 71 [271 P.2d 563]; <em>Bernhard </em>v. <em>Bank of America Nat. Trust &amp; Sav. Ass\u2019n. </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 807 [122 P. 892].)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Respondents\u2019 interests in this case, as secured creditor claimants, are adverse to the interests of the bankrupt and not derivative of those interests so as to be in \u201cprivity\u201d with the bankrupt and thereby bound by the doctrine of res judicata by the action of the bankruptcy court in allowing or disallowing claims presented by other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The authority cited by appellant, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walley </em>(S.D. Cal. 1958) 160 F.Supp. 67, is factually inapplicable to the matter in issue here. There, the court, in applying the res judicata bar against relitigating the merits of a tax claim that was allowed without contest in the bankruptcy proceeding, held that the bankrupt would not be permitted to challenge the bankruptcy court\u2019s holding in a subsequent suit and neither would those parties whose interests are derived from and stand in place of the bankrupt as, in that case, the decedent bankrupt\u2019s representative. The court there held that \u201cit is hardly necessary to add that since defendant\u2019s decedent [the debtor in bankruptcy] would have been precluded by the doctrine of res judicata from relitigating the merits of the tax claim, the defendant as the decedent\u2019s personal representative is similarly precluded, an executor being \u2018in privity\u2019 with his decedent for res judicata purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Further, in the instant case, respondent Cambridge was not required to nor did it have any standing to object to appellant\u2019s claim in Galardi\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>The trustee in bankruptcy, once he qualifies, is the party in interest within the meaning of section 502(a) of the Bankruptcy Act to object to claims filed by creditors. Section 704(4) of the same act provides that the debtor\u2019s trustee shall: \u201cif a purpose would be served, examine proofs of claims and object to the allowance of any claim that is improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The general rule applicable in such matters is that the trustee acts as the spokesman for all the creditors in the discharge of the trustee\u2019s duty unless the trustee refuses to take action. The right of individual creditors to object to the claim of another creditor, apart from the line of cases permitting some indirect mode of contest, is restricted in much the same manner as is the debtor\u2019s right. While either may object before a trustee qualifies or when there is no trustee, once such officer has qualified it is on him that the duty rests to examine and take action concerning claims which would appear to be disallowed against the debtor\u2019s assets. (3 Collier on Bankruptcy (15th ed.) \u00a7 502.01, p. 502-14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">While the courts have, on occasion, distinguished the interests of a secured creditor from those of general creditors regarding their respective rights to bypass the trustee and challenge the claims of other creditors unless the trustee on application refuses to do so, it has done so in very limited situations and only for very narrow purposes, such as permitting a secured creditor to serve interrogatories on an unsecured creditor. <em>(Henry Ansbacher &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Klebanow </em>(2d Cir. 1966) 362 F.2d 569.) In <em>Ansbacher, </em>the court, at page 570, noted specifically that \u201cDiscovery matters are of an administrative character. They are not actions within the bankruptcy proceedings affecting title to property in a bankrupt\u2019s estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Respondents did not challenge appellant\u2019s secured creditor\u2019s claim in the bankruptcy court since they had no standing to do so once a trustee had been qualified for those purposes,  Respondents were not guilty of laches and after the subject property had been released from the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy proceedings the filing of the appellant\u2019s claim in bankruptcy did not absolve it from complying with the 90-day foreclosure action requirement of Civil Code section 3144.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">For the reasons set forth herein, this court finds that appellant\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien foreclosure action was not timely filed and affirms the judgment of the trial court. That conclusion is dispositive of the matter and makes unnecessary any discussion of the other contentions of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Feinerman, P.
