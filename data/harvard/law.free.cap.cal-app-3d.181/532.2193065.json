We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">The lower court\u2019s description of the \u201cabbreviated and skeletal nature of the trial in this case\u201d may be something of an understatement. It was submitted on the following stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">Royal Globe issued a comprehensive business insurance policy to Jerry L. Knighten Construction Co. (Knighten) in 1979. In the general liability schedule of the policy, the basic coverage was described as \u201c[t]he company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become <em>legally obligated to pay </em>as damages because of [f] A. <em>bodily injury </em>or [11] B. property damage [11] to which this insurance applies, <em>caused by an occurrence, </em>and the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages <em>on account of such bodily injury </em>or property damages, even if the allegations are groundless, false, or fraudulent. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) In the general provisions applying to the general liability schedule, \u201coccurrence\u201d was defined as meaning \u201can accident . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured, ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">In 1980, Knighten contracted with the appellants. Knighten promised to build a house, sell it to the appellants and to close escrow on a particular date. Instead, escrow closing was delayed by Knighten three weeks to appellants\u2019 detriment. Appellants filed suit against Knighten alleging two causes of action; the first was for breach of contract; the second was for fraud, i.e., that when Knighten promised to close escrow on the stated date he had no intention of performing that promise. The complaint alleged that as a proximate result of Knighten\u2019s \u201cfraud and deceit and the facts herein alleged, [appellants] have suffered great mental anguish, nervousness, anxiety, worry and disappointment all to [their] damage in the sum of $20,000. \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Knighten was served with the complaint and requested Royal Globe to defend him. Royal Globe declined to defend. Knighten and the appellants entered into a stipulation for the entry of a judgment in favor of appellants and against Knighten \u201c. . . in the sum of $6,850.00 with respect to the first cause of action on file herein for breach of contract and in the sum of $10,000.00 with respect to the second cause of action for alleged intentional misrepresentations and mental and emotional distress in the sum of $10,000 for a total sum of $16,850, . . .\u2019\u2019In return for a covenant not to execute, Knighten assigned to the appellants his rights to defense and indemnity from Royal Globe. Royal Globe filed a declaratory action, claiming it was not obligated to indemnify or defend. The appellants cross-complained for money. The case was tried on stipulated facts and documents including the judicially noticed underlying action. The trial court in its statement of decision after noting the high potential for collusion in this situation ruled for Royal Globe on the ground there was no reasonable expectation on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>part of the appellants\u2019 assignor for a defense in this suit. A motion for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The construction of the policy before us is one of law because it is based on stipulated evidence and the terms of the insurance contract. We thus are not bound by the trial court\u2019s interpretation and it is our duty ultimately to resolve the question under the applicable principles of law. <em>(Economy Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 641, 645 [204 Cal.Rptr. 135].)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168], the basic coverage in the contract before the court made \u201ctwo wide promises:\u201d to pay for all damages for bodily injury for which the insured was liable, and to defend any suit in which bodily injury damages were alleged. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 272.) It <em>excluded </em>from these broad promises any coverage for bodily injury damages \u201c\u2018. . . caused intentionally by or at the direction of the insured.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 267.)  Looking to \u201cthe nature and the kind of risk covered by the policy as a limitation upon the duty to defend,\u201d <em>{id. </em>at p. 275), the court held that since the complaint filed in the underlying action alleged bodily injury, and since the exclusion for intentional acts was unclear because an act can be intentional but cause unintentional harm <em>{id. </em>at pp. 269-275), \u201cthe insurer bore the obligation to defend because the policy led plaintiff reasonably to expect such defense, and because the insurer\u2019s exclusionary clause did not exonerate it, . . .\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 275.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As an alternative holding, the court pointed out \u201cthe carrier must defend a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy . . . .\u2019\u2019An insurer, therefore, bears a duty to defend its insured whenever it ascertains facts which give rise to the potential of liability under the policy. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 275, 276-277 [italics deleted].) The appellants seek to invoke these doctrines in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">However, as pointed out in <em>Giddings </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 213, 218 [169 Cal.Rptr. 278], \u201cThe present case is readily distinguishable from <em>Gray </em>and many of the cases following it, which have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>broadly interpreted the insurer\u2019s duty to defend. [Citing, inter alia, <em>Mullen </em>v. <em>Glen Falls Ins. Co. </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 163 (140 Cal.Rptr. 605).] In each of these cases, damages of the type covered by the policy had undisputably occurred, and the insurer relied on an unclear exclusionary clause in asserting it was not obligated to defend its insured.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] <em>Here, on the other hand, the question concerns the scope of the basic coverage itself. </em>. . .\u201d (Italics added.) (Accord, <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 1199, 1203 n. 1 [208 Cal.Rptr. 5] <em>[St. Paul].) </em>The significance of this distinction lies in the burden of proof.  While the burden is on the insurer to prove a claim covered falls within an exclusion <em>(Clemmer </em>v. <em>Hartford Insurance Co. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 865, 880 [151 Cal.Rptr. 285, 587 P.2d 1098]), the burden is on the insured initially to prove that an event is a claim within the scope of the basic coverage. <em>(California Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Trinity River Lands Co. </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 104, 111 [163 Cal.Rptr. 802]; <em>American Home Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Essy </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 19, 23 [3 Cal.Rptr. 586].)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The language of the basic coverage in this case is readily distinguishable as well from that used in <em>Gray</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and is indistinguishable from that used in <em>St. Paul, supra, </em>161 Cal.App.3d at p. 1201; <em>Economy Lumber, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at p. 646; and <em>Giddings, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at p. 217.  In each of those cases and here, the insurer only promises to indemnify or defend actions involving bodily injury caused by <em>an accident </em>resulting in bodily injury neither expected nor intended by the insured. It was therefore the appellants\u2019 burden to show they came within this definition. All the evidence they have adduced shows the act by their assignor, Knighten, was intentional.  An intentional act is not an \u201caccident\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> within the plain meaning of the word. <em>(St. Paul, supra, </em>161 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1202-1203; <em>Economy Lumber, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at pp. 647-648; cf. <em>Giddings, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at pp. 218-220 [construing \u201cproperty damage\u201d].)  The same roadblock at the definition of \u2018 \u2018 accident \u201d halts any argument claiming the appellants\u2019 assignor intended his act but not the resulting harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>To the extent that <em>Gray\u2019s </em>\u201calternative holding\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> constitutes a separate analytic framework <em>(Mullen, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d at p. 172 [citing <em>Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at pp. 275-277]), the present case is again distinguishable on the ground the appellants\u2019 have failed to satisfy their burden of proof. In <em>Gray, </em>the insured offered evidence he had made his insurer aware of the complaint and the facts of his defense which would negate intention; the same is true in <em>Mullen. </em>(73 Cal.App.3d at p. 170.) Here, there is a total failure of proof of what facts were before Royal Globe when it made its decision not to defend. For all we know, it may have made an investigation uncovering facts which brought the claim outside the basic coverage. <em>(Dillon </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indent. Co. </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 335, 344 [113 Cal.Rptr. 396] [as later harmonized by that court in <em>Mullen, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d at p. 173]; <em>State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flynt </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 538, 548 [95 Cal.Rptr. 296].) Thus, the appellants have not shown facts known to Royal Globe that demonstrated potential liability under the policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">In addition, although the trial court apparently agreed with appellant\u2019s assertion that the underlying complaint contained a potential claim for unintentionally caused\u2014accidentally caused\u2014bodily injury,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we do not. Appellant\u2019s claim against Knighten was based on an allegation that Knighten intentionally made a promise to appellants that he did not intend to keep; that when the time came to keep that promise he did not do so; appellant\u2019s \u201cbodily injury\u201d resulted. It makes no difference whether when the time came to keep the promise Knighten intentionally or unintentionally failed to do so since the gravamen of the fraud claimed by appellants against Knighten was the mispresentation of the fact that at the time he made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>promise to close escrow on the date selected that he <em>then </em>had no intention to do so. (4 Witkin Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Torts, \u00a7 453; Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 530, 544.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Evans, Acting P.

[$] 8. As a further proximate result of defendants\u2019 fraud and deceit and the facts herein alleged, plaintiffs incurred temporary housing costs from on or about September 3, 1980, to on or about September 6, 1980, to plaintiffs damage in the sum of $30.00. [$] 9. As a further proximate result of defendants\u2019 fraud and deceit and the facts herein alleged, plaintiff Susan E. Whitaker was compelled to cancel fifteen (15) office appointments with her clients to her damage in the sum of $450.00. [$] 10. As a further proximate result of the defendants\u2019 fraud and deceit and the facts herein alleged, <em>plaintiffs have suffered great mental anguish, nervousness, anxiety, worry and disappointment </em>all to plaintiffs\u2019 damage in the sum of $20,000.00. [$] Wherefore, plaintiffs pray judgment against defendants, and each of them, as follows: [\u00dc] 1.

We hold that the language of the policy clearly defines the coverage limits on the respondent\u2019s duty to defend and appellant\u2019s claim did not fall within such coverage. It is only when the language of the policy does not clearly define the coverage that its meaning depends upon the reasonable expectation of the insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The same is true in appellants\u2019 case of <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Overton </em>(1984) 160 Cal. App.3d 843, 845-846 [206 Cal.Rptr. 823] and underlies the holding in <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hubbard </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 939, 947-948 [206 Cal.Rptr. 806] (insurer admitted duty to defend; punitive damages exclusion operating as matter of law rather than explicitly in policy did not give insured notice there would be no defense for that issue, thus insured reasonably expected defense from policy).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b413-6\">After the words \u201cproperty damage\u201d the policy in <em>Gray </em>did not contain the words \u201cto which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\">In <em>St. Paul, </em>Justice Evans, writing for the court, held that \u201cin its plain and ordinary sense, \u2018accidental\u2019 means \u2018arising from extrinsic causes [;1] occurring unexpectedly or by chance [; or] happening without intent or through carelessness.\u2019 (Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Diet. (1983) p. 49.)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1202.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We do not think it necessary to decide this issue and only do so in an abundance of caution. The <em>Gray </em>court held that <em>in that case </em>the insurer had a duty to defend all claims for bodily injury regardless of whether such injuries were intentionally or unintentionally caused. This was so even though there was no duty to indemnify if the injuries were intentionally caused. In answer to the carrier\u2019s argument that the duty to defend arises only if the pleadings disclosed a cause of action for which the insured must indemnify the insured, the court held that even if it accepted defendant\u2019s premise, so long as the suit potentially sought covered damages the carrier under such a policy was required to defend. We do not have such a policy in this case. In this case the duty to defend itself (not just the indemnity provision) is conditioned upon the accidental nature of the claim. If we were to hold that in spite of such clear limiting language the insured had a duty to defend any case no matter what kind and no matter how it arose if it <em>potentially </em>seeks damages for accidentally caused bodily injury then such limiting language would have no real effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The recent case of <em>CNA Casualty of California </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co. </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 598 [222 Cal.Rptr. 276] (\u201cCNA\u201d) is readily distinguished upon this basis.
