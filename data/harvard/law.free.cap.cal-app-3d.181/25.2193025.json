J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">Appellant Ex-Cell-0 Corporation (Ex-Cell-O) appeals from a judgment dismissing its cross-complaint against respondent Brian Holdener in his personal capacity after the trial court determined Holdener had entered into a good faith settlement with plaintiff Mid-Valley Dairy Company (Mid-Valley). Ex-Cell-O contends this settlement was not made in good faith, alleging (1) Mid-Valley had an improper motive for settling its suit and (2) the settlement amount was disproportionate to Holdener\u2019s potential liability. We find Ex-Cell-O\u2019s position to lack merit and shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">On June 20, 1981, during remodeling of Mid-Valley, a fire erupted which destroyed the dairy, with estimated damages of over $27 million to Mid-Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Mid-Valley sued a number of parties, including Ex-Cell-O and the general contractor for the remodeling, the Holdener Construction Company, Inc. (HCC) of which Brian Holdener is vice-president. Ex-Cell-0 then filed a cross-complaint for indemnity against HCC and other parties. Mid-Valley and HCC subsequently entered into a settlement agreement and HCC moved to dismiss Ex-Cell-O\u2019s cross-complaint pursuant to the good faith settlement provisions of Code of Civil Procedure sections 877 and 877.6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>court ruled the settlement was made in good faith and dismissed the cross-complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In early 1984, after the trial court dismissed the cross-complaint against HCC, Mid-Valley contacted Brian Holdener about serving as a witness on its behalf. As vice-president of HCC, Holdener was familiar with the costs of the dairy remodeling and could testify as to the damages Mid-Valley sustained. He agreed to serve as Mid-Valley\u2019s witness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In June or July 1984, Ex-Cell-0 filed a cross-complaint against Holdener personally. In the meantime, Mid-Valley\u2019s attorneys spoke to Holdener\u2019s attorney, Mr. Armenis, and informed him Mid-Valley would serve Holdener as a Doe but would then dismiss the complaint in exchange for a waiver of costs and an agreement not to sue for malicious prosecution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Armenis viewed Holdener as free of liability and agreed to this proposed course of action. Approximately 10 days after naming Holdener in its suit, Mid-Valley dismissed him as a party for a waiver of costs and an agreement not to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Holdener moved to dismiss Ex-Cell-O\u2019s cross-complaint, arguing his good faith settlement with Mid-Valley barred the cross-action. Ex-Cell-0 contended the settlement was not made in good faith and was grossly disproportionate to Holdener\u2019s potential liability. As evidence of Holdener\u2019s purported liability, Ex-Cell-0 asserted building and fire code violations contributed to the spread of the fire. Ex-Cell-0 further asserted plaintiff and Holdener settled only to permit Holdener to testify against Ex-Cell-O. Holdener disputed these claims and submitted depositions from the attorneys involved in the settlement, which set forth the belief of these attorneys that Holdener was not liable for damages and that the case was dismissed to \u201cstreamline\u201d and \u201cclean up\u201d the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The trial court, finding the settlement to be properly motivated and fairly representative of Holdener\u2019s potential liability, dismissed Mid-Valley\u2019s cross-complaint.  This appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">In our unpublished decision in the appeal of Mid-Valley\u2019s settlement with HCC <em>(Mid-ValleyDairy Company </em>v. <em>Ex-Cell-O Corporation </em>(3 Civ. 24049)), we reviewed previous court decisions interpreting the good faith settlement provisions of Code of Civil Procedure sections 877 and 877.6 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">\u201cIn <em>River Garden Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 986 [103 Cal.Rptr. 498], this court first addressed the issue [of whether a settlement was made in \u2018good faith\u2019]. After reviewing the history of section 877, we concluded \u2018the good faith release clause extends the obligation of good faith beyond the parties to the negotiations, embracing an absent tortfeasor.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 996.) We observed that \u2018the most obvious and frequent\u2019 injury created by collusion between settling parties \u2018is that created by an unreasonably cheap settlement\u2019 and that \u2018[t]he price of a settlement is the prime badge of its good or bad faith. \u2019 <em>(Ibid.) </em>We concluded, therefore, that \u2018bad faith\u2019 settlements \u2018includ[e] those which are so poorly related to the value of the case as to impose a potentially disproportionate cost on the defendant ultimately selected for suit.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 997.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">\u201cThe <em>River Garden Farms </em>approach was subsequently followed by Division Two of the First Appellate District in <em>Lareau </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Transportation Co. </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 783, 794-797 [118 Cal.Rptr. 837]. <em>River Garden Farms </em>was adhered to as well by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Commercial U. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1981) 640 F.2d 210, 214, and <em>Owen </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 713 F.2d 1461, 1465. In <em>Commercial Union, supra, </em>the court observed a dismissal of a settling tortfeasor must not be \u2018a tactical maneuver by plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019 but, rather, must \u2018reflect the cooperative decision-making between parties which is the earmark of settlement\u2019 and \u2018must represent a settlement which is a good faith determination of relative liabilities.\u2019 (640 F.2d at p. 213; accord, <em>Owen </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>713 F.2d at p. 1464.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">\u201cThe most recent appellate court opinion to follow <em>River Garden Farms </em>is <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Union Pacific R.R. Co. </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 499 [203 Cal.Rptr. 825], in which Division Seven of the Second District established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>a test for determining whether a settlement amount constitutes good or bad faith, holding \u2018that a defendant\u2019s settlement figure must not be grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person, at the time of the settlement, would estimate the settling defendant\u2019s liability to be.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 509.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">\u201cIn 1981, however, the Court of Appeal for the Fifth District departed from <em>River Garden Farms. </em>In <em>Dompeling </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 798 [173 Cal.Rptr. 38], the court concluded a disproportionate settlement sum is not evidence of bad faith but that bad faith is established only when the settling parties engage in some tortious or other wrongful conduct toward the nonsettling defendant. \u2018The settling parties owe the nonsettling defendants a legal duty to refrain from tortious or other wrongful conduct; absent conduct violative of such duty, the settling parties may act to further their respective interests without regard to the effect of their settlement upon other defendants.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 809-810.) The Fifth District adhered to this rule in <em>Cardio Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 880, 884-885 [176 Cal.Rptr. 254], in which the court approved a settlement that was apparently made solely for tactical reasons, and in <em>Burlington Northern R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 942.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">\u201cFinally, in <em>Tech-Bilt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woodward-Clyde &amp; Associates </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488 [213 Cal.Rptr. 256, 698 P.2d 159], the Supreme Court resolved the conflict in favor of <em>River Garden Farms, </em>specifically disapproving <em>Dompeling </em>and its progeny. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 500, fn. 7.)  The court set forth the proper line of inquiry for trial courts to follow in determining whether a settlement has been reached in \u2018good faith\u2019 within the meaning of sections 877 and 877.6.\u2018A[n] . . . appropriate definition of \u201cgood faith, \u201d . . .would enable the trial court to inquire, among other things, whether the amount of the settlement is within the reasonable range of the settling tortfeasor\u2019s proportional share of comparative liability for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. This is not to say bad faith is \u201cestablished by a showing that a settling defendant paid less than his theoretical proportionate or fair share.\u201d [Citation.] Such a rule would unduly discourage settlements. . . . Moreover, such a rule would tend to convert the pretrial settlement approval procedure into a full-scale minitrial [citation], [1] But these considerations do not lead to the conclusion that the amount of the settlement is irrelevant in determining good faith. Rather, the intent and policies underlying section 877.6 require that a number of factors be taken into account including a rough approximation of plaintiffs\u2019 total recovery and the settlor\u2019s proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial. Other relevant considerations include the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>fendants, as well as the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants. [Citations.] Finally, practical considerations obviously require that the evaluation be made on the basis of information available at the time of the settlement. \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s settlement figure must not be grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person, at the time of the settlement, would estimate the settling defendant\u2019s liability to be.\u201d [Citation.] The party asserting the lack of good faith, who has the burden of proof on that issue (\u00a7 877.6, subd. (d)), should be permitted to demonstrate, if he can, that the settlement is so far \u201cout of the ballpark\u201d in relation to these factors as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of the statute. Such a demonstration would establish that the proposed settlement was not a \u201csettlement made in good faith\u201d within the terms of section 877.6.\u2019 (38 Cal.3d at pp. 499-500.)\u201d <em>(Mid-Valley Dairy Company </em>v. <em>Ex-Cell-O Corporation </em>(Sept. 30, 1985) 3 Civ. 24049, typed opn. pp. 6-10.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><em>Tech-Bilt </em>expressly resolved a conflict in appellate court opinions, and therefore applies retroactively to the present case. <em>(Donaldson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 24, 37 [196 Cal.Rptr. 704, 672 P.2d 110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The hearing on the settlement between Holdener and Mid-Valley occurred before <em>Tech-Bilt </em>was decided but after <em>Torres, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d 499. Counsel specifically directed the trial court\u2019s attention to <em>Torres, </em>which established the test ultimately adopted in <em>Tech-Bilt, </em>i.e., that the \u201csettlement figure must not be grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person, at the time of the settlement, would estimate the settling defendant\u2019s liability to be.\u201d <em>(Torres, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at p. 509; <em>Tech-Bilt, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 499.)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The trial court held a hearing on the alleged disproportionality of Holdener\u2019s settlement and the record amply supports the trial court\u2019s decision of a good faith settlement. The court noted the fire expert\u2019s declaration submitted by Ex-Cell-0 was conclusionary and failed to explain how the fire wall did not comply with local fire codes and that Mid-Valley failed to establish how Holdener personally, rather than HCC, his company, was liable for any alleged defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The trial court further determined there was nothing improper in Mid-Valley\u2019s decision to settle with Holdener to \u201cclean up\u201d the pleadings to try the case only against appellant. We reject the concept that \u201ccleaning up the pleadings\u201d is a proper basis for finding a good faith settlement as envisioned by <em>Tech-Bilt, supra. </em>Such a purpose does not reflect \u201ca good faith determination of relative liabilities\u201d <em>(Commercial U. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., supra, </em>640 F.2d at p. 213) or the good faith toward the nonsettling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>defendant required by sections 877 and 877.6. (See <em>Tech-Bilt, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 496-497.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">However, if the reason for \u201ccleaning up\u201d the pleadings is plaintiff\u2019s belief that the settling defendant bears minimal or no liability for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, a good faith motivation may still be found. In deposition, Mid-Valley\u2019s attorneys stated they viewed Holdener as having no liability for the damages caused by the fire. Holdener\u2019s attorney stated in his deposition that he viewed Ex-Cell-O\u2019s action against his client as frivolous. No purpose is served by requiring a plaintiff to expend energy and resources to continue with a suit against a party it views as nonculpable. In this limited situation only, when upon application of the proportionality rule of <em>TechBilt </em>the basis of the settlement is lack of liability of the settlor, the incidental cleaning up of the pleadings is a mere by-product of the settlement, not the motivation for it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Sparks, J., and Stroud, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Code of Civil Procedure section 877 provides, in relevant part: \u201cWhere a release, dismissal with or without prejudice, or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith before verdict or judgment to one or more of a number of tortfeasors claimed to be liable for the same tort\u2014. . . [I] (b) It shall discharge the tortfeasor to whom it is given from all liability for any contribution to any other tortfeasors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 at the time in question read: \u201c(a) Any party to an action wherein it is alleged that two or more parties are joint tortfeasors shall be entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith of a settlement entered into by the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more alleged tortfeasors, upon giving notice thereof in the manner provided in Sections 1010 and 1011 at least 20 days before the hearing. Upon a showing of good cause, the court may shorten the time for giving the required notice to permit the determination of the issue to be made before the commencement of the trial of the action, or before the verdict or judgment if settlement is made after the trial has commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">\u201c(b) The issue of the good faith of a settlement may be determined by the court on the basis of affidavits served with the notice of hearing, and any counteraffidavits filed in response thereto or the court may, in its discretion, receive other evidence at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">\u201c(c) A determination by the court that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">\u201c(d) The party asserting the lack of good faith shall have the burden of proof on that issue.\u201d (Stats. 1980, ch. 562, \u00a7 1, p. 1549.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b49-9\">We reviewed appellant\u2019s challenge to this ruling in our unpublished decision <em>(Mid-Valley Dairy Company </em>v. <em>Ex-Cell-0 Corporation, </em>3 Civil 24049, filed September 30, 1985) in which we remanded for further hearing as the trial court had failed to apply the proportionality rule of <em>Tech-Bilt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woodward Clyde &amp; Associates </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488 [213 Cal.Rptr. 256, 698 P.2d 159], which was decided by the Supreme Court subsequent to the hearing at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated Holdener would be a percipient witness, but \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d she also designated him as an expert witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s motive for naming Holdener as a Doe is unclear as plaintiff\u2019s attorneys invoked the work-product privilege in deposition and declined to answer appellant\u2019s questions on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b49-12\">This is not an appealable order under Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">In 1984. however, section 877.6 was amended to provide for review, by writ of mandate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>a decision on whether a settlement was made in good faith. (\u00a7 877.6, subd. (e).) This amendment took effect in January 1985, after both the hearing on the instant petition and the court\u2019s order dismissing the cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Neither of the parties has raised this as an issue. However, in the interests of judicial economy, we treat this appeal as a writ of mandate and reach the merits. (See <em>Barth-Wittmore Insurance </em>v. <em>H. R. Murphy Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 124, 130 [214 Cal.Rptr. 894].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Ex-Cell-O contends the court erred in disregarding the \u201ccollusive\u201d motive for this settlement, i.e., Mid-Valley\u2019s desire to use Holdener as its expert witness. The depositions of the attorneys involved in the settlement indicate that Holdener agreed to be Mid-Valley\u2019s witness <em>after </em>the trial court determined Mid-Valley\u2019s settlement with HCC was made in good faith and <em>before </em>Ex-Cell-O filed its cross-complaint against Holdener. In <em>Commercial U. Ins. Co., supra, </em>640 F.2d at pages 213-214, the court severely criticized plaintiff\u2019s settlement with a deep-pocket defendant, finding the settlement was made solely for the purpose of removing the defendant\u2019s potentially harmful expert witness. In the instant case, the settlement between plaintiff and Holdener did not prevent relevant evidence from being heard. In fact, using Ex-Cell-O\u2019s theory, a contrary result occurs. Given these circumstances and Holdener\u2019s lack of personal liability, we conclude the court did not err.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b53-10\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
