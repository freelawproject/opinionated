(Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352.) It was further alleged that appellant was convicted on July 5, 1983, of possession of marijuana for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359) within the meaning of Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (b), and Health and Safety Code section 11370, subdivisions (a) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>At a bifurcated court trial on his prior conviction, appellant admitted the prior conviction after advisement and waiver of his constitutional rights. The jury found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Appellant approached an undercover police officer and told him to pull his car out of the street because \u201che [appellant] didn\u2019t like doing his business in the middle of the street.\u201d He told the officer that if he \u201cwanted some cocaine,\u201d appellant could get him some, and he would be right back. Appellant walked back toward an apartment where a female, who had earlier approached the officer, had gone. Appellant\u2019s female associate returned and gave the officer cocaine. The officer handed her $30 in prerecorded bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Appellant was arrested. He had a $10 bill and $20 bill in his left hand which matched the serial numbers of the xerox copy of the bills that the officer gave to the female.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to bar impeachment with his prior felony conviction for possession of marijuana for sale, as the crime does not involve moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">This case was tried after <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111], which addressed the issue of the effect of Proposition 8 on impeachment with prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">The court declared: \u201cWe shall hold that\u2014always subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion under section 352\u2014subdivision (f) [of article I, section 28] authorizes the use of any felony conviction which necessarily involves moral turpitude, even if the immoral trait is one other than dishonesty. On the other hand, subdivision (d), as well as due process, forbids the use of convictions of felonies which do not necessarily involve moral turpitude.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 306.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">In <em>Castro, </em>the jury found defendant Maria Castro guilty of receiving stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496). The trial court denied a pretrial motion to bar impeachment with then unspecified priors. On appeal defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>contended that she could not be impeached with her prior convictions of possession of heroin and possession of heroin for sale. The court held that simple possession of heroin does not necessarily involve moral turpitude, but possession for sale does. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Subdivision (f) of article I, section 28 of the California Constitution provides that: \u201cAny prior felony conviction . . . shall ... be used without limitation for purposes of impeachment. ...\u201d However, the court said that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment demands that even inferences\u2014not just presumptions\u2014should be based on a rational connection between the fact proved and the fact to be inferred. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The court quoted Justice Holmes: \u201c\u2018[W]hen it is proved that a witness has been convicted of crime, the only ground for disbelieving him which such proof affords is the <em>general readiness to do evil </em>which the conviction may be supposed to show. It is from that general disposition alone that the jury is asked to infer a readiness to lie in a particular case, and thence that he has lied in fact. The evidence has no tendency to prove that he was mistaken, but only that he has perjured himself, and it reaches that conclusion solely through the general proposition that he is of <em>bad character </em>and unworthy of credit. \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal. 3d at p. 314, quoting <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Railroad </em>(1884) 137 Mass. 77, 78; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The prior felony conviction therefore should show a \u201creadiness to do evil\u201d to support an inference of \u201creadiness to lie.\u201d Otherwise, impeachment with this prior conviction would violate the Fourteenth Amendment. \u201cObviously it is easier to infer that a witness is lying if the felony of which he has been convicted involves dishonesty as a necessary element than when it merely indicates a \u2018bad character\u2019 and \u2018general readiness to do evil.\u2019 Nevertheless, it is undeniable that a witness\u2019 moral depravity of any kind has some \u2018tendency in reason\u2019 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210) to shake one\u2019s confidence in his honesty.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The court specified how the trial court should determine the presence of moral turpitude in the prior conviction. As in the <em>People </em>v. Crowson<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> line of cases, \u201ca witness\u2019 prior conviction should only be admissible for impeachment if the least adjudicated elements of the conviction necessarily involve moral turpitude.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 317.) In view of this requirement, appellant asserts that possession of marijuana for sale does not involve moral turpitude since the courts have to review the underlying facts of the particular conviction before they have been able to find the presence of moral turpitude, citing <em>In re Kreamer </em>(1975) 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Cal.3d 524 [121 Cal.Rptr. 600, 535 P.2d <em>728]; In re Cohen </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 416 [113 Cal.Rptr. 485, 521 P.2d 477]; and <em>In re Higbie </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 562 [99 Cal.Rptr. 865, 493 P.2d 97].</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">However, these cases were decided before Proposition 8. The court in addressing the impact of Proposition 8 concluded that \u201cwhile simple possession of heroin does not necessarily involve moral turpitude [citations], possession [of heroin] for sale does\u2014though the trait involved is not dishonesty but, rather, <em>the intent to corrupt others.'\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 317; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The court in <em>United States </em>ex rel. <em>De Luca </em>v. <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>(8th Cir. 1954) 213 F.2d 759, 762, observed: \u201cWhile it is no doubt true that there may be technical, inadvertent and insignificant violations of the laws relating to narcotics, which do not involve moral turpitude, there can be nothing more depraved or morally indefensible than conscious participation in the illicit drug traffic. . . . Even the federal laws relating to the domestic traffic in narcotic drugs, which were sustained as revenue measures, were recognized as having a <em>moral purpose </em>as well as that of raising revenue. [Citations.]\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">There is no question that possession of marijuana for sale constitutes illicit drug trafficking. That is why it is punishable by imprisonment in state prison for sixteen months, two years, or three years. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359; Pen. Code, \u00a7 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">It is true that heroin is an opium derivative, and marijuana is a hallucinogenic substance, but both are listed in the Schedule I List of Controlled Substances (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11054). The Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines a hallucinogen as a substance that induces hallucinations. Common experience tells us that to sell a substance that induces hallucinations is to corrupt others.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">As the trial court correctly pointed out, the difference between the sale of cocaine and that of marijuana may only lie in the degree of corruption, but both have the same intent\u2014to corrupt others. We hold that possession of marijuana for sale involves moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">The trial court thereafter engaged in the weighing process of Evidence Code section 352 before concluding that the probative value outweighed the prejudicial effect. It did not err in ruling that appellant could be impeached with his prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Woods, P. J., and Arguelles, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 21, 1986.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Crowson </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 623, 633-635 [190 Cal.Rptr. 165, 660 P.2d 389].</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
