(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459, 460.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>serving a prior separate prison term for a Florida burglary in 1980. (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b).) He appeals from a judgment sentencing him to a total unstayed term of 17 years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">In an unpublished portion of this opinion, we consider and reject defendant\u2019s claims of error set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here we consider defendant\u2019s contention that a magistrate erred in refusing to entertain a section 1538.5 motion at a preliminary examination. We conclude the magistrate erroneously refused defendant the opportunity to make his motion but the error does not require reversal of the judgment because defendant made a section 1538.5 motion de novo in superior court. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">On July 25, 1983, a preliminary hearing was held before Magistrate U. Defendant stood charged in this case with nine counts of burglary. Evidence at this hearing consisted mainly of fingerprint comparisons between those found at burglarized residences and defendant\u2019s booking prints. Defendant moved pursuant to section 1538.5 to suppress the fingerprint comparisons on the theory the comparisons and subsequent matchup were the fruit of an allegedly unlawful seizure of certain stolen property and defendant\u2019s confession. Defendant attempted to make the motion orally, without previous notice to the district attorney. Magistrate U. denied the motion on the ground prior notice to the prosecution was required. The magistrate also refused to entertain a motion for continuance so that notice could be given. Defendant was held to answer on seven of the nine counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Defendant later moved de novo in superior court to suppress the same evidence. (\u00a7 1538.5, subd. (i).) At the conclusion of a hearing the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Defendant contends the magistrate erred when he refused to let him make his oral section 1538.5 motion at the preliminary hearing on the ground advance notice of the motion was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Surprisingly, we have found no case precisely on point. Cases have assumed without addressing the issue that an oral motion to suppress may be made at the preliminary hearing without prior notice. (See, e.g., <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 519, 526 [186 Cal.Rptr. 373]; <em>Chivers </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 929, 931 [131 Cal.Rptr. 221].)</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Subdivision (f) of section 1538.5 provides in pertinent part: \u201cthe defendant may make the motion at the preliminary hearing in the municipal or justice court but the motion in the municipal or justice court shall be restricted to evidence sought to be introduced by the people at the preliminary hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">The phrase \u201cat the preliminary hearing\u201d means <em>during </em>the preliminary hearing. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 496, 498, 500-501 [190 Cal.Rptr. 408].) Moreover, subdivision (i) of section 1538.5 expressly requires that at least 10 days notice be given the People when the motion is made in superior court. The lack of any analogous notice provision in subdivision (f) of the same statute permits a reasonable inference the Legislature intended no prior notice is required where the motion is made at the preliminary hearing. (See <em>Gonzales &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic Bev. Control </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 172, 178 [198 Cal.Rptr. 479].) \"</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Moreover, we have an obligation to construe the statute to promote its purpose and render it reasonable. <em>(In re Atiles </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 805, 810, fn. 4 [191 Cal.Rptr. 452, 662 P.2d 910].) (lb) Despite modern discovery, a defendant will often be unaware of all evidence to be introduced by the prosecution at a preliminary hearing or of the manner in which the evidence was obtained.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently a requirement of advance notice would mean either that defense counsel would have to be clairvoyant, or that a preliminary hearing would have to be interrupted and continued in order to allow notice to be given, or that valid constitutional objections to a search or seizure could not be made at the preliminary hearing. None of these alternatives is reasonable. Perhaps for these reasons, the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Manning </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 586 [109 Cal.Rptr. 531] opined in dictum that \u201cin felony cases a motion to suppress may be made at the preliminary hearing ... a course which obviously does not lend itself to prior written notice of motion.\u201d (P. 597, citation omitted.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree and add no prior oral notice should be required either.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">To be sure, a defendant moving to suppress evidence at a preliminary hearing must clearly put the prosecution and the magistrate on notice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>a motion pursuant to section 1538.5 is being made and must identify with reasonable particularity the evidence sought to be suppressed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Freeman </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 917, 922-923 [157 Cal.Rptr. 454].) Moreover, the magistrate clearly retains discretion to continue the hearing upon an appropriate motion of a surprised prosecutor. However, we hold the motion may be made during the preliminary examination without prior notice to the prosecution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1538.5, subd. (f).) The magistrate erred in concluding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Nonetheless, the magistrate\u2019s error does not require reversal of the conviction. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Pompa-Ortiz </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 519 [165 Cal.Rptr. 851, 612 P.2d 941] our Supreme Court held that \u201cHenceforth irregularities in the preliminary examination procedures which are not jurisdictional in the fundamental sense shall be reviewed under the appropriate standard of prejudicial error and shall require reversal only if defendant can show that he was deprived of a fair trial or otherwise suffered prejudice as a result of the error at the preliminary examination.\u201d (P. 529.)</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Our Supreme Court recently followed <em>Pompa-Ortiz </em>in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aston </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 481 [216 Cal.Rptr. 771, 703 P.2d 111]. There, defendant claimed he had been denied a fundamental right at his preliminary hearing when the court had failed to grant a motion to disclose the address of a \u201cpaid narcotics assistant\u201d so defendant could subpoena him for the preliminary hearing. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 494.) However, the Supreme Court concluded any impropriety in the preliminary examination was subsequently cured when the trial court ordered that the assistant be made available to appellants before the hearing on the motion to suppress in superior court, and the assistant testified at the hearing. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 495.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>Similarly, in the instant case defendant cannot show prejudice because he received a de novo section 1538.5 hearing in superior court at which he had the opportunity to litigate all issues he would have litigated before Magistrate U. Thus, defendant\u2019s conviction need not be reversed. <em>(Ibid People </em>v. <em>Mardian </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 16, 37 [121 Cal.Rptr. 269]; see <em>Cuevas </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 406, 411, fn. 1 [130 Cal.Rptr. 238].)</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Nonpublished Portion<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Evans, Acting P.

Although written notice of a motion may be deemed a motion, <em>notice </em>of a motion is not the same as the motion itself, particularly where the motion is made orally. (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Proceedings Without Trial, \u00a7 5, p. 330; see Witkin, Criminal Procedure (1963) \u00a7 22, p. 24.) By its terms, local rule 13 applied only \u201cWhenever notice of a motion is given, . . .\u201d Since no notice of motion was required by law nor given, former local rule 13 was inapplicable. (Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 817, 820 [139 Cal.Rptr. 673].) Also, by this interpretation, former local rule 13 did not unlawfully conflict with the statutory authorization for oral motions implicit in subdivision (f) of section 1538.5. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 68070; <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 510, 515-516 [200 Cal.Rptr. 526].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b945-11\">See footnote, page 1142, <em>ante.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
