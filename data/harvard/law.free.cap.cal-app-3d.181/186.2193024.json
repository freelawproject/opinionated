J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai5\"> Petitioner Richard Bussear (applicant) seeks review of a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) denying reconsideration of an order of the workers\u2019 compensation judge who in turn had denied applicant\u2019s appeal from an order of the Rehabilitation Bureau (Bureau) terminating rehabilitation benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons we explain, we annul the challenged decision and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Applicant, a 25-year-old working foreman and heavy-equipment operator employed by respondent Russell L. Pillard, dba Red Lava Products, sustained industrial injury on August 24, 1978, when his right arm was caught in the conveyor of a rock crusher. Applicant underwent 18 operations but was left with little functional use of his right arm. After applicant had reached maximum improvement, respondent insurance carrier, State Compensation Insurance Fund (Fund), offered applicant vocational rehabilitation services and assigned a vocational rehabilitation consultant, James C. McGowan, to develop an appropriate plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">McGowan ultimately developed a Bureau-approved plan to retrain applicant under the provisions of Labor Code section 139.5 to be a class 1 heavy-duty truck driver. We will hold that the retraining of an essentially one-armed injured worker to be a heavy-duty truck driver does not qualify, under the circumstances shown to exist in this matter, as \u201cservices reasonably necessary to provide an injured worker with the opportunity to return to <em>suitable gainful </em>employment.\u201d (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 10003, subd. (f), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Section 139.5 provides for the establishment, within the Division of Industrial Accidents, of a rehabilitation unit, to include appropriate profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>sional staff, with the duty to foster, review, and approve rehabilitation plans developed by a qualified rehabilitation representative of the employer, insurance carrier, state agency, or employee. Section 139.5, subdivision (c), provides: \u201cWhen a qualified injured worker chooses to enroll in a rehabilitation program, he . . . shall continue to receive temporary disability indemnity payments, plus additional living expenses necessitated by the rehabilitation program, together with all reasonable and necessary vocational training, at the expense of the employer or the insurance carrier, as the case may be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The statutory objective sought to be achieved is to get the injured worker from \u201cthe bed to the job\u201d by the provision of appropriate vocational training. <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 232-233 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].)  Furthering the injured worker\u2019s rehabilitation subserves the primary purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation laws, which is \u201c\u2018to insure to the injured employee and those dependent upon him adequate means of subsistence while he is unable to work and also to bring about his recovery as soon as possible in order that he may be returned to the ranks of productive labor. By this means society as a whole is relieved of the burden of caring for the injured workman and his family, and the burden is placed upon the industry.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 233; <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 823, 828 [198 Cal.Rptr. 116].)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The record shows that prior to drafting the vocational rehabilitation plan, McGowan was in possession of certain medical reports, including a report by Dr. Hadley dated March 21, 1981, which described applicant\u2019s disability as one which \u201ccompletely precludes the use of the right upper extremity\u201d and recommended rehabilitation training <em>commensurate with a one-armed individual. </em>In a May 6, 1981, report, Dr. Brownstein expressed full agreement with Dr. Hadley\u2019s opinion; several months later Dr. Brownstein reported that the \u201csevere functional limitations of the right arm [created] doubt that any useful work could be performed using it.\u201d Thus McGowan was aware that the proposed plan would have to take into account the fact of applicant\u2019s \u201cessentially . . . non-functional right upper extremity.\u201d During vocational testing, McGowan learned that applicant had an above-average mechanical aptitude and explored several vocational possibilities with applicant, including truck driving. Applicant, whose educational limitations ruled out certain occupational prospects, expressed interest in truck driving. Applicant believed that with his extensive experience operating heavy equipment, he could continue to operate heavy rigs equipped with power steering and shift controls. Although McGowan had reservations about retraining as a truck driver due to the limitations of applicant\u2019s \u201csevere disability\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the potential job discrimination posed by the injury, he resolved his doubts by sending applicant to the United Truck Driving School for training and \u201cevaluation.\u201d The supervised training consisted of taking applicant out for a \u201ctest drive on the freeway near the school and then off into industrial/ warehouse areas where he could complete figure 8\u2019s and U-turns.\u201d The consultant concluded from the resulting evaluation (based on one and one-half hours operating a diesel-powered tractor trailer rig performing figure 8\u2019s and U-turns) that he was \u201cphysically capable\u201d of performing that type of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In March of 1982, a detailed vocational rehabilitation plan was presented to applicant and submitted to the Bureau by the employer. The plan describes the nature of applicant\u2019s \u201ccrushing injury,\u201d including nerve and tissue damage, and listed the medically diagnosed physical limitations which precluded use of the entire right upper extremity and \u201cfingers\u2019 activities involving grasping, lifting, pulling, holding, pushing, carrying or any gross/ fine maneuvers of dexterity of fingers of right hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The plan as approved by the consultant provided for five weeks of combination classroom and on-the-road truck driving training at United Truck Driving School, the Department of Motor Vehicles test for a class 1 driver\u2019s license,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> followed by an additional four weeks of job search assistance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Upon completion of the prescribed training and qualification for a class 1 driver\u2019s license, applicant continued to receive vocational rehabilitation temporary disability benefits during the ensuing 12 weeks while he diligently sought employment. On May 25, 1982, McGowan reported to the Fund that despite applicant\u2019s best efforts, there had been no movement in the labor market that would indicate a job opportunity for him. Two months later, McGowan reported that applicant had been unable to find employment in the depressed labor market and that no further rehabilitation services were in order. He recommended that the case be closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">On August 10, 1982, the Fund filed with the Bureau a request for case closure (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 10004, subd. (e)) on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the rehabilitation plan had been completed, although applicant had been unable to find employment. Applicant\u2019s counsel objected that \u201ceven in the best of times, there is [no] substantial labor market for a one-armed truck driver,\u201d arguing that the Fund\u2019s obligation was unfulfilled until applicant had been successfully rehabilitated for suitable occupation. The Bureau\u2019s consultant reviewed the vocational reports and notified applicant of her intention to close the case and terminate carrier liability unless other convincing evidence was furnished within 20 days. In reply, applicant\u2019s counsel advised he had recently learned that applicant had encountered difficulties during training after driving a four-hour shift, and that the plan was improperly \u201cbeyond the employee\u2019s physical capabilities.\u201d Counsel requested continuance of temporary disability indemnity pending arrangements for a further medical/legal examination due to the onset of symptoms encountered by applicant in favoring his right side causing torsional back strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">On October 18, 1982, the Bureau rejected applicant\u2019s claim of the original plan\u2019s inadequacy and issued its decision finding that the Fund had provided the employee with a reasonable opportunity to return to suitable gainful employment by providing substantial vocational rehabilitation services, and that no further services would be authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Applicant renews his argument below, that retraining him as a truck driver does not constitute adequate rehabilitation, that respondents have not discharged their responsibilities, and that he should be afforded a \u201csecond\u201d or \u201creal\u201d chance to obtain the full benefit of the remedial statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">At the hearing on appeal from the Bureau\u2019s closure order, applicant testified that as a result of the injury to his major hand, he had yet to attain a reasonable level of facility using his left hand. He had chosen truck driving, he testified, in the belief it would be easier\u2014in fact experiencing little difficulty during the pretraining evaluation involving only <em>one </em>gear operation\u2014but soon discovered that the work was far more strenuous than anticipated. Applicant stated that he drove only 22 hours during the training course, usually in 4-hour shifts. At the end of each shift, he felt exhausted and experienced pain from both his injured arm and back. As a consequence, applicant began to doubt his ability to perform as a working truck driver; however, he neglected to inform his school instructors or the rehabilitation consultant (during the three-month job-search period) in the hope he might succeed once a job became available. Despite applicant\u2019s diligent efforts, he remained unemployed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">McGowan testified as to his own reservations about the retraining plan because of applicant\u2019s physical limitations and the restricted labor market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>in Lake County. McGowan\u2019s concern motivated the pretraining evaluation by the school director who ultimately provided a positive evaluation and progress report. At McGowan\u2019s request, Dr. Brownstein, applicant\u2019s attending physician, reviewed the plan and reported on April 14, 1982, that he had given him a \u201cmedical release for <em>job-search.'' </em>(Italics added.) The terse report contained no expression of opinion, however, concerning applicant\u2019s ability to perform the full range of duties of a heavy-rig operator. McGowan denied that applicant told him that he could not drive a truck longer than four hours a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Numerous medical reports were introduced at the hearing. Dr. Damon reported that applicant had low back pain resulting from major adjustments to his body mechanics caused by the injury to his dominant arm. Dr. Damon felt that applicant had not been \u201cadequately rehabilitated\u201d and recommended training in an occupation that would enable him to use only his left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In contrast, Dr. Kilgore\u2019s March 21, 1983, report in behalf of the Fund noted that applicant was \u201calready rehabilitated\u201d and was \u201c [considered able to work as a truck driver <em>in a limited </em>capacity. \u201d (Italics added.) Finally, Dr. McCarroll\u2019s corroborating report of August 29, 1983, that applicant was already rehabilitated to perform as a truck driver was contradicted by his earlier report (Mar. 21, 1983) in which he stated that the patient\u2019s recent complaints of limited painful use of his injured arm and the concomitant unlikelihood of employment as a truck driver <em>\u201cseem quite justified considering the severe nature of his right upper extremity problem. I would think that rehabilitation in a different line of work would be reasonable. </em>\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">A review of the governing regulations is instructive. A \u201c\u2018Qualified Injured Worker\u2019\u201d is defined as \u201can employee: (1) The effects of whose injury, whether or not combined with the effects of a prior injury or disability, if any, permanently preclude, or are likely to preclude the employee from engaging in his or her usual and customary occupation or the position in which he or she was engaged at the time of injury; and [11] (2) Who can reasonably be expected to return to <em>suitable gainful employment </em>through the provision of vocational rehabilitation services.\u201d (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 10003, subd. (c), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">\u201c\u2018Vocational Rehabilitation Service\u2019\u201d is defined as \u201cthose services required to determine an employee\u2019s eligibility as a qualified injured worker, and those services reasonably necessary to provide an injured worker with the opportunity to return to <em>suitable gainful employment. </em>Such services may include, but are not limited to, medical and/or vocational evaluation, counseling, job analysis, job modification assistance, retraining, including on-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the-job training or training for alternative employment with the same employer, and job placement assistance.\u201d (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 10003, subd. (f), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u201c \u2018Suitable Gainful Employment\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201cthat employment or self-employment which is <em>reasonably attainable and which offers an opportunity to restore the employee as soon as practicable and as near as possible to maximum self-support, </em>due consideration being given to the employee\u2019s qualifications, interests and incentives, pre-injury earnings and future earning capacity, and the present and future labor market.\u201d (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 10003, subd. (h), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The workers\u2019 compensation judge concluded that the decision of the Bureau was correct because applicant himself chose the field of truck driving despite knowledge of the potential problems and failed to raise any objections to the rehabilitation plan at any relevant time.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">It thus appears that the judge adopted the Bureau\u2019s implicit position that applicant would have to live with the consequences of his informed choice. But unlike the Bureau\u2019s consultant whose decision rested on the reports on file, the judge heard the testimony of the employer\u2019s rehabilitation consultant concerning his reservations from the outset whether retraining as a heavy-duty truck driver was a suitable plan, and that he did not learn of the four-hour limitation until the day of the hearing. In addition, applicant\u2019s testimony of his limited performance ability was unrefuted as was evidence of applicant\u2019s failure to mention his limitation to his consultant or the school as well as his attorney who learned of it only after the Fund had sought closure of the case and subsequent discussion with his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">It bears emphasis that the legislative purpose in enacting section 139.5 was to enable injured workers to participate in rehabilitation training to the fullest extent possible. <em>(LeBoeuf </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 234, 244 [193 Cal.Rptr. 547, 666 P.2d 989].)  Although the applicant\u2019s \u201cinterests\u201d are among the factors to be considered by the vocational rehabilitation consultant in preparing a vocational rehabilitation plan (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 10003, subd. (h)), we think the rehabilitation consultant, possessed of training and expertise in this area, should have considered the applicant\u2019s interests <em>in light of his physical limitations. </em>As applicant points out, if the injured employee were capable of formulating a suitable rehabilitation plan, there would be no need for rehabilitation consultants. Since the proposed plan was suspect from the start, once applicant\u2019s attorney had communicated to the Bureau the limitations disclosed during training casting further doubt upon the suitability of the plan, the Bureau had the responsibility, before closing the case, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>inquire further into the matter and to order necessary and reasonable medical examinations, if required (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 10007, subd. (a)),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in order to determine whether it might be appropriate to \u201cmodify, interrupt or terminate\u201d the plan <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 10007, subd. (c)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Here applicant, profoundly injured at the age of 25, faces another 40 years in a competitive labor market. The purpose of rehabilitation\u2014to return the injured worker to a productive status in the interests of himself and his family\u2014is not met by a vocational rehabilitation plan beyond the injured worker\u2019s physical capacity and which does not provide him with a meaningful opportunity.to return to suitable gainful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The order of the Board is annulled, and the matter is remanded to the Board for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Newsom, J., and Holmdahl, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The Bureau was established within the Division of Industrial Accidents pursuant to the authority of Labor Code section 139.5 (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 10003), and rules and regulations were duly adopted which authorized the initiation of vocational rehabilitation services <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 10005). The rules provide that rehabilitation plans shall be submitted to the Bureau for approval or disapproval <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 10006), and where questions arise concerning an employee\u2019s entitlement to benefits, the Bureau is authorized to make its own determination <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 10007). An injured worker may appeal to the Board an adverse decision of the Bureau <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 10008). Thus, in the area of rehabilitation benefits, the Bureau operates under the appellate supervision of the Board. <em>(Bekins Moving &amp; Storage Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp.
