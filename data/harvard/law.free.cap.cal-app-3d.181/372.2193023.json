We conclude that such removal may not be compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Virginia Sandoval filed a declaration of candidacy for the governing board of the East Side Union High School District in San Jose. The election was scheduled for November 5, 1985. Less than 88 days before the election, Sandoval publicly announced that because of the press of her duties as a junior high school teacher \u201cI feel compelled to formally announce my decision to withdraw from the . . . election\u201d but that she would \u201cremain involved in the race by actively supporting\u201d three other candidates. Sandoval wished to have her name removed from the ballot; her attorney advised her that in a previous case respondent superior court had mandated removal of a candidate\u2019s name upon the petition of a registered voter. The attorney then, in Sandoval\u2019s behalf, prepared a \u201cpetition for writ of mandate and alternative complaint\u201d under Elections Code section 10015, for removal of Sandoval\u2019s name from the November 5 ballot. The petition was prepared in the name of registered voter Sharon J. Layne, and Layne verified it. The petition was filed on October 7, 1985, and respondent superior court, over the opposition of Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters, George Mann, issued its peremptory writ as prayed on October 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Mann then filed this petition on October 28, requesting an immediate stay of respondent court\u2019s writ. Perceiving that there was insufficient time to receive briefing and to effect a disposition on the merits before the November 5 election, we denied the stay. Sandoval\u2019s name was removed from the ballot and the election was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\"> The election mooted the dispute between Sandoval and Mann. We have concluded, however, that respondent court\u2019s writ was issued in error and that public interest in proper conduct of elections and the probability that the issue will arise again warrant a decision on the merits of the issue presented. (Cf. <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 291, 294 [204 Cal.Rptr. 154, 682 P.2d 349]; <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Cal.3d 132, 141 [137 Cal.Rptr. 14, 560 P.2d 1193]; <em>Sweatt </em>v. <em>Foreclosure Co. </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 273, 279 [212 Cal.Rptr. 350].) For similar reasons we proceed to the merits in this writ proceeding, notwithstanding that Mann could have maintained a direct appeal from respondent court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Elections Code section 10015 provides that \u201c[a]ny voter may seek a writ of mandate alleging that an error or omission has occurred or is about to occur in the placing of any name on, or in the printing of, a ballot, sample ballot, voter pamphlet or other official matter, or that any neglect of duty has occurred or is about to occur. [H] A peremptory writ of mandate shall issue only upon proof that the error, omission or neglect is in violation of this code or the Constitution and that issuance of the writ will not substantially interfere with the conduct of the election. [1i] Such action or appeal shall have priority over all other civil matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">To demonstrate \u201can error or omission\u201d within the meaning of Elections Code section 10015, in respondent court Layne argued that to leave Sandoval\u2019s name on the ballot would promote \u201cvoter confusion.\u201d Layne relied primarily on <em>Bordwell </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1916) 173 Cal. 283 [159 P. 869], in whicjht Bordwell, a candidate for his party\u2019s nomination to be a United States senator, withdrew before the primary election and then sought mandate to compel the county clerk to omit his name from the primary ballot. The Supreme Court affirmed that no California statute then in effect abrogated Bordwell\u2019s right to withdraw before the primary, and concluded that the writ should issue to effectuate the withdrawal \u201cto enable the voters to exercise a free, orderly, and intelligent choice. We can conceive of no good reason why a ballot should contain the name of a person who is not in fact a candidate for nomination .... The presence of his name (like that of a candidate who has died) could operate only to deprive uninformed electors of their votes .... We believe . . . that the [\u2018direct primary law\u2019] contemplates a submission to the electors of a choice between persons who are candidates in fact . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Layne also cited cases in which courts had ordered removal from ballots of the names of candidates who were unqualified or otherwise ineligible for the office sought, or whose names had been placed on the ballot by fraud or other irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">None of Layne\u2019s cases is in point, in each case the candidate either should not have been on the ballot in the first place or was empowered to withdraw. Here, Sandoval had properly become a candidate, and by virtue of Education Code section 5012 could not withdraw at the time she purported to do so. In light of section 5012, the presence of Sandoval\u2019s name on the ballot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>could not be regarded as \u201can error or omission,\u201d or as evidence of \u201cany neglect of duty,\u201d within the meaning of Elections Code section 10015.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Had either Layne or Sandoval chosen to participate in the proceedings in this court, they might have argued that by perpetuating the candidacy of one who for whatever reason is no longer willing to serve, section 5012 promotes the very \u201cperversion of the true popular will\u201d which <em>Bordwell </em>sought to avoid. Perhaps such an argument would warrant renewed legislative attention. But from the judicial perspective we find Mann\u2019s policy argument persuasive: \u201cThe clear intent of the law is to force candidates to consider their qualifications for the ballot seriously and to face election once the qualification process is completed and the 88th day prior to the election has passed. To allow such removal from a ballot encourages undue influence by more powerful candidates, political \u2018teams\u2019 who may withdraw in favor of one another, and the deterrence of potential candidates who may consider the race overcrowded or their views represented by potential declared candidates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Sandoval\u2019s name should have remained on the ballot. Respondent court should not have issued its peremptory writ. But because the election has been held, it would serve no purpose to order respondent court to vacate its writ. For this reason only, the petition for writ of mandate or prohibition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Agliano, P.
