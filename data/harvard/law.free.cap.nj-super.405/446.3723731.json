On appeal, defendant argues that this business activity is expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment and consequently the Atlantic City ordinances could not be constitutionally applied to prohibit it. He also argues that one of those ordinances is unconstitutionally vague and violates due process by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>conferring unbridled discretion upon the mayor to decide whether to issue a special events permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We conclude that defendant\u2019s business activity does not serve predominantly expressive purposes and therefore is not entitled to protection under the First Amendment. We also conclude that, as applied to defendant, the municipal ordinances under which he was prosecuted are not unconstitutionally vague and do not confer unbridled discretion upon the mayor. Therefore, defendant does not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of those ordinances. Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s constitutional arguments and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Around 2 a.m. on October 22, 2006, two police officers on patrol observed defendant on the boardwalk in front of the Wild Wild West Casino in Atlantic City taking pictures of persons walking on the boardwalk. Defendant not only had a camera but also a printer and a display board with photographs and prices of particular size photographs attached to it. Defendant also had a suitcase to carry this paraphernalia. One officer told defendant he could not solicit persons to take their photographs without a permit. Defendant responded that the officer was \u201cviolating his civil rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">The officers charged defendant with violating Atlantic City\u2019s municipal ordinance 145-1, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">No person shall hawk, peddle or vend any ice cream, food, beverages, confections, goods, wares, merchandise or commodities of any nature or description on the public Boardwalk in the City of Atlantic City or upon any of the approaches thereto except as permitted by a special events permit issued by the Mayor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">Defendant did not take the stand in his trial in municipal court. Consequently, the charging officers\u2019 description of the business operation defendant conducted on the boardwalk was unrebutted. However, defendant, who appeared <em>pro se, </em>argued in summation that, under an order entered by a federal district court in the <em>Bery </em>case, the selling of photographs in public places such as streets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>and boardwalks is protected by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on this precedent, defendant argued that ordinance 145-1 could not be constitutionally applied to his business activity on the boardwalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The municipal court judge concluded that defendant had engaged in the \u201chawking\u201d of photographs on the boardwalk, in violation of ordinance 145-1. The judge declined to consider defendant\u2019s constitutional argument on the ground that such a claim should be considered only in the Superior Court. The judge imposed a $206 fine for defendant\u2019s violation of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Defendant appealed his conviction to the Law Division, where he was represented by counsel. Defense counsel expanded upon defendant\u2019s argument presented in municipal court that the application of ordinance 145-1 to his business activity violated the First Amendment. In addition, defense counsel argued for the first time that ordinance 145-1 is \u201cunconstitutionally vague.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The Law Division judge found, based on the evidence presented in municipal court, that \u201cdefendant was going about carrying out some kind of photographic business on the board-walk, trying to take pictures of people and printing them out and selling them for a fee,\u201d which constituted a violation of ordinance 145-1. The judge also rejected defendant\u2019s constitutional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Defendant\u2019s second violation of a municipal ordinance for attempting to take and sell photographs of persons walking on the boardwalk occurred at approximately 10:20 p.m. on November 11, 2006. A police officer on patrol observed defendant approaching persons on the boardwalk with a placard containing eight photographs, one of which was of defendant. It appeared to the officer that defendant was attempting to sell the photographs, and defendant confirmed in a conversation with the officer that he was selling the photographs for from $2 to $5. The officer also observed a small camera in defendant\u2019s top pocket. The officer asked defendant to produce a mercantile license to engage in this commercial activity, but he did not have one. Defendant claimed in response to the officer\u2019s questions that he did not need a license to sell photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The officer charged defendant with violating Atlantic City municipal ordinance 170-2, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">No person shall engage in or carry on any business in the City of Atlantic City, nor aid or assist as employee, clerk or otherwise in carrying on such business, ... nor sell or offer for sale any goods or thing for which a license is required by the terms of this article unless a license as herein provided for shall have been first obtained therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Defendant admitted at his trial in municipal court, in which he appeared <em>pro se, </em>that he displayed the placard with the attached photographs to persons on the boardwalk. However, he claimed that his purpose was not to sell the photographs but rather to advertise his skill as a photographer so that persons who saw the photographs would hire him as a photographer for weddings or parties. Defendant also argued, as in his other trial in municipal court, that he had a right under the First Amendment to sell photographs on the boardwalk without obtaining a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The municipal court judge found, based on the charging officer\u2019s testimony and the placard that defendant displayed to persons on the boardwalk, that defendant had been engaged in offering to take photographs of persons walking on the boardwalk for sale. In making this finding, the judge stated that \u201clooking at [the placard] it\u2019s very clear that there\u2019s different people in pictures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>here, ... and it has $10 here on the back, ... there\u2019s an inference that can be drawn that [he was] offering to take pictures of people on the Boardwalk.\u201d The judge therefore concluded that defendant had violated ordinance 170-2 by engaging in the business of selling photographs without a license. As in the other case, the municipal court judge declined to consider defendant\u2019s constitutional argument. The court imposed a $106 fine for the violation of ordinance 170-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Defendant appealed his conviction to the Law Division, where he was represented by counsel. Defense counsel expanded upon defendant\u2019s argument presented in municipal court that the application of ordinance 170-2 to his business of offering photographs for sale on the boardwalk violated the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The Law Division judge affirmed the municipal court\u2019s determination that defendant\u2019s sale of photographs on the boardwalk without a mercantile license violated ordinance 170-2. The judge also rejected defendant\u2019s argument that the application of this ordinance to his form of business activity violates the First Amendment. The judge imposed the same fine imposed by the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Defendant filed separate appeals from his convictions for the violations of ordinances 145-1 and 170-2. We now consolidate the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">In his appeal from his conviction for violating ordinance 145-1, defendant argues that the part of this ordinance and other municipal ordinances that authorize the mayor to issue a \u201cspecial events permit,\u201d under which a permittee may engage in commercial activity that otherwise would be prohibited by ordinance 145-1, is unconstitutionally vague and violates due process by conferring unfettered discretion upon the mayor to decide whether to issue such a permit. In the appeal from his conviction under ordinance 170-2, defendant argues that his photography business constitutes the expression of commercial visual art, which is protected by the First Amendment, and that ordinance 170-2 and other municipal ordinances infringe upon his First Amendment rights by imposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>a <em>de facto </em>prohibition against the exhibition of such art on the Atlantic City boardwalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We conclude that defendant lacks standing to challenge the validity of the municipal ordinances governing the issuance of \u201cspecial events\u201d permits because defendant did not apply for such a permit and, in any event, his photography business clearly would not qualify for a special events permit. We also conclude that the street photography business defendant was conducting on the Atlantic City boardwalk did not constitute expressive conduct. Therefore, Atlantic City\u2019s prohibition against this activity did not violate defendant\u2019s First Amendment rights. Accordingly, we affirm both of defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Ordinance 145-1 imposes a clear and easily understood prohibition against \u201chawk[ing], peddl[ing] or vending] any ... goods, wares, merchandise or commodities of any nature or description on the public Boardwalk in the City of Atlantic City.\u201d Defendant does not contend that there is anything vague about this prohibition or that this part of the ordinance confers any discretion upon the mayor. Defendant also does not dispute the trial court\u2019s finding that he violated this prohibition by attempting to take photographs of persons walking on the boardwalk and then selling the photographs to the subjects. Defendant\u2019s appeal from his conviction under ordinance 145-1 is based solely on the final clause of this ordinance, which creates an exception from the absolute prohibition against selling merchandise on the boardwalk for any party who has obtained a \u201cspecial events permit issued by the Mayor.\u201d However, defendant did not apply for a special events permit, and it is clear that the commercial activity for which he was found guilty of violating ordinance 145-1 would not qualify for issuance of such a permit. Therefore, defendant may not challenge his conviction under ordinance 145-1 on the ground that the ordinances governing special events permits are unconsti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>tutionally vague as applied to other persons or violate due process by conferring unbridled discretion upon the mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Generally, \u201ca litigant only has standing to vindicate his own constitutional rights.\u201d <em>City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>789, 796, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2118, 2124, 80 L.Ed.2d 772, 781 (1984). The Supreme Court has recognized exceptions to this general rule for challenges to \u201claws that are written so broadly that they may inhibit the constitutionally protected speech of third parties,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 798, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2125, 80 L.Ed.2d at 782, or confer unbridled discretion upon a government official whether to issue a license for an activity that affects free speech, <em>City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ\u2019g Co., </em>486 <em>U.S. </em>750, 755-59, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2138, 2142-45, 100 L.Ed.2d 771, 781-84 (1988). However, these exceptions are limited to circumstances where a law affecting free expression is invalid in most, if not all, of its applications. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>1830, 1838, 170 L.Ed.2d 650, 662 (2008); <em>Virginia v. Hicks, </em>539 <em>U.S. </em>113, 119-20, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>2191, 2196-97, 156 L.Ed.2d 148, 157-58 (2003); <em>Taxpayers for Vincent, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 799-801, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2126, 80 L.Ed.2d at 783-84. Consequently, \u201c[r]arely, if ever, will an overbreadth challenge succeed against a law or regulation that is not specifically addressed to speech or conduct necessarily associated with speech.\u201d <em>Hicks, supra, </em>539 <em>U.S. </em>at 124, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2199, 156 L.Ed.2d at 160. Our courts apply these same principles in determining the standing of a party to challenge the constitutionality of a statutory enactment affecting free speech rights. <em>See, e.g., Twp. of Pennsauken v. Schad, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>156, 179-81, 733 A.2d 1159 (1999); <em>State v. Cameron, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>586, 593-94, 597 n. 2, 498 A.2d 1217 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Under these principles, defendant lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinances governing the issuance of special events permits. It is clear defendant could not obtain such a permit for his business of photographing persons on the boardwalk. As the name \u201cspecial events\u201d permit implies, such permits may be issued only under special circumstances, generally for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>very limited period of time, and subject to strict limitations. One subsection of the ordinance authorizes the issuance of such a permit for \u201cart exhibitions,\u201d but if the exhibition includes \u201csale of art works\u201d on the boardwalk, the term of the permit may not exceed two days. Another subsection authorizes issuance of such a permit for \u201ccommercial activities or events\u201d but limits the term to seven days and restricts such activities or events to the \u201cKennedy Plaza.\u201d Defendant has not asserted that he could conduct his business operation under the strict limitations of these ordinances. Therefore, even if these ordinances posed an issue of unconstitutional overbreadth or delegation of unbridled discretion to the mayor as applied to other parties, defendant is not subject to those provisions and therefore lacks standing under the general rule governing standing to challenge the constitutionality of statutory enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Moreover, the limited exceptions to the standing rule do not apply to this case. Neither the general prohibition imposed by ordinance 145-1 against hawking, peddling and vending on the boardwalk nor the limited exception from this prohibition provided for parties who qualify for the issuance of a special events permit are directed at First Amendment activity. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that many parties who are subject to the prohibition or may apply for a special events permit would be involved in speech or expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment protection. Consequently, even if the prohibition or the special events permit exception had the potential to inhibit the exercise of First Amendment rights in some circumstances, there still would be no basis for concluding that ordinance 145-1 \u201cprohibits a \u2018substantial\u2019 amount of protected speech in relation to its many legitimate applications.\u201d <em>Hicks, supra, </em>539 <em>U.S. </em>at 124, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2199, <em>156 L.Ed.2d </em>at 160. Therefore, any constitutional infirmity in the provisions governing the issuance of special events permits would not provide a defense to defendant\u2019s prosecution for a violation of the general prohibition against hawking, peddling and vending on the boardwalk and defendant thus lacks standing to challenge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>constitutionality of the ordinances governing issuance of special events permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Before addressing defendant\u2019s argument that his boardwalk photography business constitutes expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, we make several preliminary observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">First, we note that, even where there is no basis for a First Amendment challenge, ordinances prohibiting or regulating the sale of merchandise on a municipality\u2019s streets or, in this case, its boardwalk, may be subject to challenge under the due process and equal protection guarantees of the federal and state constitutions. <em>See Fanelli v. City of Trenton, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>582, 592-94, 641 A.2d 541 (1994); <em>Brown v. City of Newark, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>565, 571-72, 552 A.2d 125 (1989). However, apart from the constitutional arguments already addressed in section I of this opinion, defendant\u2019s challenge to the Atlantic City ordinances under which he was prosecuted is limited to the First Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Second, although one of defendant\u2019s convictions was for a violation of ordinance 170-2, which requires a mercantile license to sell any goods or service in Atlantic City, it is clear defendant could not have obtained a mercantile license to engage in his photography business on the Atlantic City boardwalk. Ordinance 170-9 specifically states that a mercantile license \u201cshall not permit ... peddling or vending ... upon ... the Boardwalk,\u201d and ordinance 145-1, upon which defendant\u2019s other prosecution was based, contains a flat prohibition against the selling of any goods \u201cof any nature or description on the public Boardwalk.\u201d The only exception to this blanket prohibition is the authorization provided by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u201cspecial event permit\u201d discussed in section I of this opinion. However, as previously discussed, it is clear such a permit could not be obtained for the kind of business activity in which defendant engages. Therefore, the Atlantic City ordinances do not simply require a permit or license for defendant\u2019s business activity but instead impose an absolute prohibition against a person selling merchandise such as defendant\u2019s photographs of persons walking on the boardwalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Third, even though defendant has presented First Amendment arguments solely in his brief in support of the appeal from his conviction under ordinance 170-2, those arguments would appear equally applicable to his conviction under ordinance 145-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The free speech guarantee of the First Amendment applies not only to the written or spoken word but also to expressive conduct. <em>See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic &amp; Institutional Rights, Inc., </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>47, 65-66, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>1297, 1310-11, 164 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>156, 175-76 (2006); <em>Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Group of Boston, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>557, 568-70, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>2338, 2344-45, 132 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>487, 500-01 (1995); <em>State v. Vawter, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>56, 63-64, 642 A.2d 349 (1994). The expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment is not limited to conduct that communicates a political, social, philosophical or religious message; First Amendment protection also extends to artistic expression such as painting, music, poetry and literature. <em>Nat\u2019l Endowment for the </em>Arts v. <em>Finley, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>569, 602-03, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>2168, 2186, 141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>500, 525-26 (1998); <em>Hurley, supra, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>at 569, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2345, 132 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 501; <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>781, 790, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2746, 2753, 105 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>661, 674 (1989). Moreover, First Amendment protection is not lost simply because compensation is paid for artistic expression. <em>See Riley v. Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Blind of N.C., Inc., </em>487 <em>U.S. </em>781, 801, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2667, 2680, <em>101 L.Ed.2d </em>669, 692 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">If a party seeks to shield conduct from governmental regulation on the basis of this First Amendment protection, the threshold question is whether the conduct was in fact expressive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>See Rumsfeld, supra, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>at 64-65, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1310, 164 L.Ed.2d at 175; <em>Tenafly Eruv Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly, </em>309 <em>F.3d </em>144, 158 (3d Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>539 <em>U.S. </em>942, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>2609, 156 L.Ed.2d 628 (2003). Most human conduct, particularly in the commercial sphere, is not expressive. Thus, the sale of merchandise such as jewelry, clothing or incense is not ordinarily expressive and therefore is not entitled to First Amendment protection. <em>See Bery, supra, </em>97 F.3d at 696; <em>Al-Amin v. City of New York, </em>979 <em>F.Supp. </em>168, 173 (E.D.N.Y.1997). Even conduct that is ordinarily expressive may not be intended to express any message in some circumstances and therefore would not be entitled to First Amendment protection. For example, the Court held in <em>Hurley </em>that a \u201cparade\u201d is entitled to First Amendment protection because it consists of \u201cmarchers who are making some sort of collective point, not just to each other but to bystanders along the way.\u201d 515 <em>U.S. </em>at 568, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2344-45, 132 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 500. However, the Court also recognized that \u201c[i]f there were no reason for a group of people to march from here to there except to reach a destination, they could make the trip without expressing any message beyond the fact of the march itself,\u201d and in that instance the conduct would not be entitled to First Amendment protection. <em>Ibid.; see also Dallas v. Stanglin, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>19, 25, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1591, 1595, 104 L.Ed.2d 18, 25-26 (1989) (noting that \u201c[i]t is possible to find some kernel of expression in almost every activity a person undertakes\u2014for example, walking down the street ...\u2014but such a kernel is not sufficient to bring the activity within the protection of the First Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The line-drawing process required to distinguish between expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment and other human conduct that does not merit this protection is illustrated by <em>One World One Family Now v. City &amp; County of Honolulu, </em>76 <em>F.3d </em>1009 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>1009, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>554, 136 L.Ed.2d 403 (1996), which involved a challenge to a municipal ordinance that prohibited the sale of merchandise on the streets, sidewalks and other public places in the Waikiki Beach area of Honolulu, as applied to the sale by non-profit organizations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>message-bearing t-shirts. The court stated that \u201cwhen the sale of merchandise bearing political, religious, philosophical or ideological messages is \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with other forms of protected expression (like distributing literature and proselytizing), the First Amendment applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1012 (quoting <em>Gaudiya Vaishnava Soc\u2019y v. City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>952 F.2d 1059, 1064 (9th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>914, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1951, 118 L.Ed.2d 555 (1992)). Therefore, the court concluded that the sale of message-bearing t-shirts was expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment protection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Another illustration of the line-drawing process involved in distinguishing between expressive conduct that is protected by the First Amendment and other human conduct is provided by <em>Mastrovincenzo, supra, </em>435 <em>F.</em>3d 78. The question presented by that appeal was whether two freelance artists who engaged in the business of selling articles of clothing decorated with texts and images in what they described as a \u201cgraffiti style\u201d were required to comply with a municipal ordinance that required all street vendors to be licensed. <em>See id. </em>at 86-87. The threshold issue was whether those artists\u2019 business activity was \u201cpredominantly expressive\u201d and therefore entitled to First Amendment protection. <em>Id. </em>at 91. The court held that to resolve this issue, it must consider both the \u201cobjective features of the merchandise itself\u2019 and the artists\u2019 \u201cstated motivation for producing and selling\u201d the merchandise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\"><em>[T]o </em>resolve whether the First Amendment protects the sale of graffiti clothing, we must ultimately determine whether the disseminators of that clothing are genuinely and primarily engaged in artistic self-expression or whether the sale of such goods is instead a chiefly commercial exercise. Because the most reliable means of resolving this difficult question is to examine objective features of the merchandise itself, however, we begin by analyzing whether plaintiffs\u2019 items, on their face, appear to serve predominantly expressive purposes. After evaluating the nature of plaintiffs\u2019 merchandise, we also take into account other factors such as plaintiffs\u2019 stated motivation for producing and selling their graffiti clothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The court indicated that this determination requires a \u201cease-by-case evaluation\u201d of the expressiveness of merchandise for which a party asserts a First Amendment protected right to sell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">[I]n the nature of things, some ... items ultimately may be characterized as \u201cexpressive\u201d while others may be deemed \u201cmere commercial goods\u201d-\u2014that is, goods whose characteristics suggest that their vendors are not engaged in protected speech.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">[M at 93.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Judged by these criteria, the court held that plaintiff-artists\u2019 \u201cgraffiti goods serve a predominantly expressive purpose, and their sale is consequently protected under the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">We have no doubt that the production and sale of photography may constitute expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment under the principles discussed in <em>One World One Family Now </em>and <em>Mastrovincenzo. </em>Indeed, art schools instruct students about modem photographic techniques and art museums often contain substantial collections of photographs by recognized masters of this art. <em>See Gilles v. Davis, </em>427 F.3d 197, 212 n. 14 (3d Cir.2005) (observing that \u201cphotography ... that has a communicative or expressive purpose enjoys some First Amendment protection\u201d); <em>ETW Corp. v. Jireh Publ\u2019g, Inc., </em>332 F.3d 915, 924 (6th Cir.2003) (holding that \u201c[t]he protection of the First Amendment is not limited to written or spoken words, but includes other mediums of expression [such as] ... photographs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">However, the fact that some photography qualifies as expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment protection does not mean that any commercial activity that involves photography falls under the umbrella of the First Amendment. Rather, to claim First Amendment protection from government regulation, a vendor of photography, like a vendor of other merchandise, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>as the t-shirts involved in <em>One World One Family Now </em>or the clothing apparel involved in <em>Mastrovincenzo, </em>must demonstrate that the production and sale of those photographs constitutes expressive conduct. <em>See Clark v. Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>288, 293, 294 n. 5, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3065, 3069, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>221, 227 (1984) (holding that \u201c[a]lthough it is common to place the burden upon the Government to justify impingements on First Amendment interests, it is the obligation of the person desiring to engage in assertedly expressive conduct to demonstrate that the First Amendment even applies\u201d); <em>see also Tenafly Eruv Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>309 F.3d at 161. This demonstration involves primarily an examination of the \u201cobjective features of the merchandise itself,\u201d that is, whether \u201c[defendant\u2019s] items, on their face, appear to serve predominantly expressive purposes,\u201d and also may take into account \u201c[defendant\u2019s] stated motivation for producing and selling [his merchandise].\u201d <em>Mastrovincenzo, supra, </em>435 F.3d at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The record in this case indicates that defendant used a pocket camera to take snapshots of persons walking on the boardwalk and then attempted to sell the photographs to the subjects. Although the record before us does not contain examples of these photographs, there is no basis for concluding that defendant\u2019s simple snapshots of persons he approached on the boardwalk \u201cservefd] predominantly expressive purposes.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Indeed, those snapshots were apparently similar to the snapshots taken in photography booths sometimes located on the boardwalk and other places of public amusement. Moreover, defendant did not claim that his motivation in taking and attempting to sell the snapshots was artistic expression. Rather, it appears evident defendant\u2019s essential purpose in engaging in this commercial activity was to make money. Therefore, we conclude that in taking and attempting to sell snapshots of persons walking on the Atlantic City boardwalk, defendant was not \u201cgenuinely and primarily engaged in artistic self-expression\u201d but \u201cinstead a chiefly commercial exercise\u201d that is not entitled to First Amendment protection. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Defendant argues, relying upon the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Bery, </em>that regardless of whether the photographs he took of persons walking on the boardwalk serve predominantly expressive purposes or his motivation in taking and selling those photographs, any commercial photographic activity is protected by the First Amendment. <em>Bery </em>was an action brought in federal district court by individual artists engaged in painting, photography and sculpture and an arts advocacy organization, which challenged a municipal ordinance that barred visual artists from exhibiting or selling their artistic works in New York City without first obtaining a general vendors\u2019 license. 97 F.3d at 691. The case was brought before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals by an appeal from the denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction. <em>Ibid. </em>In reversing this denial, the court focused on the issue of whether art constitutes expressive conduct entitled to protection under the First Amendment. <em>See id. </em>at 694-96. The court concluded that art is different from other merchandise that vendors sell on city streets and that its display and sale is entitled to First Amendment protection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">The district court seems to have equated the visual expression involved in these eases with the crafts of the jeweler, the potter and the silversmith who seek to sell their work. While these objects may at times have expressive content, paintings, photographs, prints and sculptures, such as those appellants seek to display and sell in public areas of the City, always communicate some idea or concept to those who view it, and as such are entitled to full First Amendment protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 696.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">However, because of the abstract form in which the issue of whether art constitutes expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment was presented, the court did not have occasion to consider whether all commercial activity involving photography automatically constitutes such expressive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">In <em>Mastrovincenzo, </em>the court expressed skepticism about the soundness of <em>\u201cBery\u2019s </em>analytic framework.\u201d 435 F.3d at 93. However, because any panel of the Second Circuit is \u201cbound by a prior panel\u2019s holding unless it has been called into question by an intervening Supreme Court decision or by one of [the Second Circuit] sitting <em>in banc,\u201d ibid, </em>(internal quotation omitted), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>panel was constrained to accept the <em>Bery </em>panel\u2019s holding that certain categories of merchandise, including photography, \u201c \u2018always communicate! ] some idea or concept\u2019 to viewers,\u2019 \u201d <em>ibid., </em>and therefore are entitled to First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Courts outside of the Second Circuit that are not bound by <em>Bery </em>have been critical of its conclusion that the sale of certain categories of merchandise is automatically entitled to First Amendment protection without regard to whether a specific item of merchandise is sufficiently expressive to merit First Amendment protection. In <em>White v. City of Sparks, </em>341 F.Supp.2d 1129, 1138-39 (D.Nev.2004), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>500 F.3d 953 (9th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>2062, <em>170 L.Ed.2d </em>795 (2008), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">While plaintiff would have this court adopt the <em>Bery </em>holding and find that all paintings, photographs, prints and sculptures are inherently expressive, thereby eliminating the need for any individualized inquiry into the expressiveness of a particular piece of art or a particular type of artwork, the court declines this invitation. Applying such a blanket presumption of protected status ... would ... be out of step with Ninth Circuit precedent and the First Amendment\u2019s fundamental purpose\u2014to protect <em>expression. ... </em>[T]he difficulty with <em>Bery </em>is that it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az2\">arguably at once too broad and too <em>narrow in [its] </em>scope of protection. Conceivably, not every item of painting, photograph, print or sculpture that may be offered for sale on City sidewalks by any vendor is necessarily so expressive as to categorically merit First Amendment protection, but at the same time some objects outside those four categories may also be sufficiently expressive,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsQ\">[quoting <em>Mastrovincenzo v. City of New York, </em>313 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>280, 294 n. 11 (S.D.N.Y.2004).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">There has been similar scholarly criticism of <em>Bery:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">[T]he <em>[Bery] </em>injunction is used to protect any vendor selling mass-produced pictures of celebrities or photographs of landmarks, as well as \u201cany sidewalk calligrapher or Chinese-character painter.\u201d <em>Bery </em>effectively removed expressivity from the analysis of paintings, photographs, prints, and sculpture, even as it vaunted the expressive potential of those media. Centuries of aesthetic scholarship and discourse are flattened to a legal presumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">[Genevieve Blake, Comment, <em>Expressive Merchandise and the First Amendment in Public Fora, </em>34 <em>Fordham Urb. L.J. </em>1049, 1070-71 (2007).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">We agree with this criticism of <em>Bevy\u2019s </em>holding that any business activity that involves the taking and sale of photographs automatically qualifies for First Amendment protection. We conclude, contrary to <em>Bery </em>and consistent with <em>One World One Family Now, Mastrovincenzo </em>and <em>White, </em>that such business activity is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>entitled to First Amendment protection only if it serves predominantly expressive purposes. <em>See also Rumsfeld, supra, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>at 66, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1310, 164 L.Ed.2d at 175 (holding that First Amendment protection extends \u201conly to conduct that is inherently expressive\u201d). Defendant failed to make this showing with respect to his business activity of taking and selling snapshots of persons walking on the Atlantic City boardwalk. Therefore, the Law Division correctly rejected his First Amendment defense to Atlantic City\u2019s prosecutions for this activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Moreover, even if defendant\u2019s business of taking snapshots of persons walking on the boardwalk could be found to constitute expressive conduct, we would conclude that Atlantic City\u2019s prohibition against this activity does not violate the First Amendment. \u201cExpression, whether oral or written or symbolized by conduct, is subject to reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions.\u201d <em>Clark, supra, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>at 293, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3069, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 227. \u201c[Restrictions of this kind are valid provided they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, ... are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and ... leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In <em>One World One Family Now, </em>the court held that the application of municipal ordinances prohibiting the sale of merchandise in the Waikiki Beach area of Honolulu to the selling of message bearing t-shirts by non-profit organizations satisfied these tests. 76 F.3d at 1016. In reaching this conclusion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">Cities have a substantial interest in protecting the aesthetic appearance of their communities by \u201cavoiding visual clutter.\u201d ... Honolulu\u2019s interest in eliminating the visual blight caused by unsightly vendor stands easily qualifies under this standard. Likewise, cities have a substantial interest in assuring safe and convenient circulation on their streets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Honolulu\u2019s peddling ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve these interests because they \u201cwould be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\u201d Without the ordinance, sidewalk vendors (commercial and charitable alike) would be free to peddle their wares on Kalakaua and Kuhio Avenues, undermining the city\u2019s efforts to provide a pleasant strolling and shopping area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">Honolulu\u2019s peddling ordinance isn\u2019t \u201csubstantially broader than necessary\u201d to achieve its interests. The ordinance targets precisely the activity\u2014sidewalk vending\u2014causing the problems the city legitimately seeks to ameliorate, and it doesn\u2019t sweep in expressive activity that doesn\u2019t contribute to those problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">The district court ... found that a ban throughout Waikiki didn\u2019t leave ample alternative channels for plaintiffs to communicate their messages----[I]t reasoned that a \u201ctotal ban on selling expressive T-shirts in a heavily trafficked section of town\u201d was impermissible. Neither we nor the Supreme Court have said any such thing. Rather, we have held broad and narrow bans in even the most desirable locations to the same standard. The broader the ban, of course, the more difficult it is to prove that the remaining means of communication are adequate. Difficult, however, doesn\u2019t mean impossible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 1013-16 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-11\"><em>See also United States v.

Atlantic City also has a substantial interest in assuring safe and convenient circulation of pedestrians on its often crowded boardwalk. Moreover, defendant has not made a showing that he is unable to engage in his photography business at other locations in Atlantic City. Therefore, even if we viewed that business as expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment protection, we would conclude that Atlantic City\u2019s prohibition was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Accordingly, defendant\u2019s convictions for violations of ordinances 145-1 and 170-2 are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\"> The decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Bery v.
