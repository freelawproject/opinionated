Our order stated that we did so because \u201cthe denial of a pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictment ... does not constitute a final judgment.\u201d In his motion for reconsideration, or in the alternative for leave to appeal, defendant argues that \u201c[t]he denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is a final judgment and appealable as of right.\u201d He relies on the United States Supreme Court opinion in <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>651, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\"><em>Abney </em>held that \u201cpretrial orders rejecting claims of former jeopardy [and denying a motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds] constitute \u2018final decisions\u2019 and thus satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisites of [28 <em>U.S.C.A.] </em>\u00a7 1291\u201d and, thus, are \u201cimmediately appealable\u201d to the federal courts of appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 662-63, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2042, 52 L.Ed.2d at 662. The Court first noted that the right to appeal in criminal cases \u201cis purely a creature of statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 656, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2038, 52 L.Ed.2d at 658, and that \u201c[fjinality of judgment has been required as a predicate for federal appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds was found to \u201cfall within the so-called \u2018collateral order\u2019 exception to the final-judgment rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2039, 52 L.Ed.2d at 658. Such a claim \u201cfall[s] within the \u2018small class of cases\u2019 \u201d which permit appeals as of right from interlocutory orders because defendant can obtain no relief from the trial court \u201cto avoid the trial the defendant maintains is barred by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s [double jeopardy] guarantee\u201d when \u201ca double jeopardy claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>such that it is collateral to, and separable from, the principal issue at the accused\u2019s impending criminal trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2040, 52 L.Ed.2d at 659-60. In other words, defendant \u201cis contesting the very authority of the Government to hale him into court to face trial on the charge against him\u201d irrespective of his guilt or innocence, and he could not otherwise obtain appellate relief from the claim of the government\u2019s inability to try him if there were no pretrial appellate review. <em>Ibid. </em>The protection against being twice tried for the same offense would be lost if defendant is improperly required to be tried a second time before his Fifth Amendment right is recognized. <em>Id. </em>at 661-62, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2041, 52 L.Ed.2d at 661-62.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Certainly, <em>Abney </em>examined the Fifth Amendment\u2019s double jeopardy values in construing the federal statute relating to appealability. <em>See ibid. </em>However, there is at least a debate as to whether Abney\u2019s statutory construction embodies a constitutional holding, and the existence of respectful authority that it does not, particularly in light of the fundamental principles set forth at the beginning of the opinion. <em>See, e.g., Paul v. People, </em>105 P.3d 628, 631 (Colo.2005) (noting that the United States Supreme Court has \u201cmade clear that its collateral order doctrine is not a matter of constitutional necessity and, in accord with principles of federalism, is not binding on the states\u201d); <em>State v. Apodaca, </em>123 <em>N.M. </em>372, 940 P.2d 478, 481-82 (Ct.App.1997) (questioning whether a statute governing appeals would have to be construed to require interlocutory appeal from an order denying a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds); <em>Wiley v. Altman, </em>52 N.Y.2d 410, 438 N.Y.S.2d 490, 420 N.E.2d 371, 372 n. 2 (1981) (stating that New York\u2019s article 78 procedure, which permits a defendant to \u201cseek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>review in the Appellate Division,\u201d provides a sufficient mechanism to permit pretrial review).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">There is no history supporting the treatment of orders denying motions to dismiss on double jeopardy and related grounds as final for purposes of appeal in New Jersey. This is especially so because our rules of court do not include such orders among the interlocutory orders expressly deemed \u201c[f]inal judgments of a court, for appeal purposes.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:2-3(a) (final paragraph). <em>See also R. </em>2:2-3(b); <em>R. </em>2:2-4; <em>State v. Reldan, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>187, 205, 495 A.2d 76 (1985) (granting \u201cleave to appeal an interlocutory order is itself highly discretionary\u201d); <em>State v. Alfano, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178, 190, 701 A.2d 1296 (App.Div.1997) (discussing limited reasons for pretrial appellate review of interlocutory orders). The practice permitting motions for leave to appeal from interlocutory orders provides a mechanism for pretrial appellate review where warranted. <em>See R. </em>2:2-4; <em>R. </em>2:5-6. Accordingly, we will not permit this appeal to proceed as of right from the denial of the motion to dismiss, and we deny defendant\u2019s alternative motion for leave to appeal (premised on the denial of his constitutional argument).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\"> The Court quickly added that other interlocutory orders were not subject to the same \"collateral-order exception\" unrelated to the merits of the case or the admissibility of proofs related to the merits. <em>Abney, supra, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 663, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2042, 52 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 662. Hence, other orders could not be appealed with the double jeopardy claim; otherwise, interlocutory rulings would be appealable by virtue of \"frivolous double jeopardy claims.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
