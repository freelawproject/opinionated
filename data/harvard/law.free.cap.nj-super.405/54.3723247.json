(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">This appeal requires us to revisit that portion of our decision in <em>New Jersey Coalition of Health Care Professionals, Inc. v. New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, Division of Insurance, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>207, 732 A.2d 1063 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>485, 744 A.2d 1208 (1999) <em>(N.J.Coalition), </em>that upheld the validity of personal injury protection (PIP) dispute resolution procedures, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-5.1 to -5.12, governing medical review organizations (MROs) and the health care professionals (MRO physicians) utilized by them. The regulations at issue were adopted by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>anee, Division of Insurance (DOBI), pursuant to the Automobile Insurance Cost Reduction Act (AICRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 to -35.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Plaintiff Orthopaedic Associates, as subrogee of its patient Samuel Mdigos-Mulli, contends that the MRO process, as established by the regulations and overseen by DOBI, is so inherently flawed that it violates the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5.2, which require DOBI, in consultation with the Commissioner of Health and Senior Services, to establish standards of performance for MROs that include procedures for ensuring an \u201cimpartial review of the medical records of the injured person.\u201d More specifically, Orthopaedic Associates contends that, because MROs regularly utilize MRO physicians who also routinely perform evaluative services for insurance carriers, the required impartiality of the process is irredeemably compromised. Because we have concluded that the existing procedures, as interpreted and upheld in <em>N.J. Coalition, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 264-69, 732 A.2d 1063, provide a mechanism to contest the impartiality of the MRO physician, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">This case has its origins in an automobile accident that took place on April 2, 2001. Mdigos-Mulli sustained an injury as a result of the accident. He sought and received PIP benefits from his automobile insurer at the time of the accident, defendant Progressive Insurance Company (Progressive).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Following the April 2001 accident, Mdigos-Mulli received conservative treatment for injuries to his right and left shoulders and to his cervical and lumbar spine. In May 2001, he underwent an MRI of his right shoulder, which the radiologist interpreted as normal. Bryan Massoud, M.D., a board certified orthopedic surgeon affiliated with Orthopaedic Associates and one of Mdigos-Mulli\u2019s treating physicians, reviewed the films and diagnosed hypertrophic changes in the acromioclavicular (AC) joint of the right shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Mdigos-Mulli was involved in a second automobile accident in November 2002. He alleged, however, that the pain in his right shoulder had not subsided prior to the November 2002 accident. Shortly after the second accident, on November 12, 2002, Mdigos-Mulli had a second MRI of the right shoulder. The radiologist interpreted the second MRI as revealing rightshoulder hypertrophic changes in the AC joint, which was essentially the diagnosis reached by Massoud based upon the first MRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In December 2003, Massoud performed arthroscopic rightshoulder surgery on Mdigos-Mulli at the Saddle Brook Surgicenter. In January 2004, Orthopaedic Associates submitted a request for p\u00e1yment for its services rendered in connection with the surgery to Progressive, the insurer responsible for PIP benefits arising out of the April 2001 accident. Progressive refused payment, arguing that the right-shoulder problem was not a result of the April 2001 accident. It relied on a defense examination performed in September 2001, prior to the second accident, which concluded that no further treatment was required, and a peer review examination, conducted in February 2004, which concluded that the surgery was not medically necessary and, in any event, was not related to the first accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">On April 29, 2004, Orthopaedic Associates filed a demand for arbitration with defendant National Arbitration Forum Association (NAF), which is the dispute resolution organization (DRO) chosen by DOBI pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5.1(b). In June 2004, Progressive entered an appearance and the matter was scheduled for arbitration in September 2004. On August 17, 2004, defense counsel requested that the matter be submitted for an MRO review and that the arbitration be adjourned pending receipt of the MRO physician\u2019s report. Orthopaedic Associates objected to the request for an MRO review as untimely, but NAF granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>request for an adjournment and directed that there be an MRO review.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In December 2004, NAF provided Orthopaedic Associates with a copy of the MRO report and identified the MRO physician as defendant Jeffrey Lakin, M.D.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lakin concluded that Mdigos-Mulli\u2019s right-shoulder injury was not related to the first accident, but \u201cmost likely secondary to some event after, the [first accident],\u201d noting that there were two subsequent accidents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">In letters to both NAF and DOBI, Orthopaedic Associates objected to any consideration of Lakin\u2019s MRO report on the grounds that Lakin had a conflict of interest arising from the fact that he performed independent medical examinations and peer reviews for insurance companies in PIP and other matters. DOBI advised NAF to contact defendant First Managed Care Options (First MCO), the MRO organization assigned to provide the MRO review, about the request for Lakin\u2019s disqualification. In the interim, the arbitration was again adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Orthopaedic Associates contacted DOBI and NAF in June 2005, stating that it had not received any response to its application to disqualify Lakin. In July 2005, NAF advised Orthopaedic Associates that DOBI had instructed it that a decision on whether to disqualify Lakin would be made by First MCO. In November 2005, Orthopaedic Associates wrote to NAF, stating that it had not received any decision from DOBI or First MCO regarding its application to disqualify Lakin. The arbitration was again adjourned and rescheduled for May 2006. In December 2005, NAF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>advised Orthopaedic Associates to submit its application to disqualify Lakin directly to First MCO. Orthopaedic Associates complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">On December 16, 2005, NAF informed Orthopaedic Associates that First MCO had reviewed Orthopaedic Associates\u2019 application to disqualify Lakin and determined that there was no conflict of interest and that Lakin would not be disqualified. First MCO apparently never issued an explanation for its denial, at least none was received by Orthopaedic Associates and there is no such document in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The arbitration was finally held on May 15, 2006. The arbitration award, which was in favor of Progressive, was entered on September 8, 2006. The dispute resolution professional (DRP) determined that \u201cthe claimant failed to successfully rebut the presumption of correctness afforded to the MRO physician.\u201d Although permitted to do so by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:28A-13, Orthopaedic Associates did not seek review in the Law Division of either the DRP\u2019s decision or the determination that Lakin had no conflict of interest because of his work for automobile insurers in other contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Instead of seeking judicial review pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-13, Orthopaedic Associates sought to attack the DRP\u2019s decision collaterally through the present action. On December 4, 2006, Orthopaedic Associates filed a complaint against DOBI, First MCO, NAF, Progressive, and Lakin. The complaint sought the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">A. Vacating the arbitration award entered by [the] DKP [ ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">B. Compelling Progressive to pay Orthopaedic Associates on behalf of their insured, Samuel Mdigos-Mulli the sum of $10,572.45 together with interest, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">C. Barring Dr. Jeffrey Lakin [ ] from performing MROs as he is unqualified and conflicted pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">D. Staying MRO reviews until the DOBI [] implements fair and impartial procedures for MRO reviews as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">E. Barring First MCO [] from performing MROs pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-5 as First MCO [] does not meet the minimum requirements, is not currently certified by the DOBI [ ], the MRO process is controlled by the insurance industry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>not impartial, and deprives patients of necessary medical care and payment of their medical bills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">F. Barring MRO review with the NAF for the reasons aforementioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">G. Punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">H. For such other relief as the Court deems equitable and just.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Although the first two items of relief sought in the complaint and Orthopaedics Associates\u2019 brief on appeal clearly seek to overturn the DRP\u2019s decision and compel payment by Progressive for Mdigos-Mulli\u2019s surgery, Orthopaedic Associates has taken the position in its arguments before the Law Division and before us that it is not really seeking to circumvent the DRP\u2019s decision, but is merely seeking to challenge what it argues is an unfair procedure that is violative of the fairness requirements of AICRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">On February 21, 2007, Lakin filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:6-2 in lieu of filing an answer. On March 30, 2007, the motion judge granted Lakin\u2019s motion and, sua sponte, dismissed the entire complaint. Orthopaedic Associates filed a motion for reconsideration and other relief on April 20, 2007. Reconsideration was denied and all remaining cross-claims were dismissed by order dated May 16, 2007. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">Our opinion in <em>N.J. Coalition, supra, </em>contains a comprehensive history of New Jersey\u2019s no-fault legislation up to and including the enactment of AICRA. 323 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 215-23,732 A.2d 1063. <em>See also Coalition for Quality Health Care v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Banking &amp; Ins., </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>272, 282-85, 791 A.2d 1085 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>194, 803 A.2d 1165 (2002). AICRA was \u201ccomprehensive legislation designed to preserve the no-fault system, while at the same time reducing unnecessary costs which drive premiums higher.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1.1. As set forth in the Legislature\u2019s findings and declarations of purpose, one of the concerns that led to the enactment of AICRA was that \u201c[t]he [then] present arbitration system ha[d] not sufficiently addressed the Legislature\u2019s goal of eliminating payment for treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ments and diagnostic tests which [were] not medically necessary, leading to the belief that a revised dispute resolution mechanism need[ed] to be established [to] accomplish this goal.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-1.1. <em>See also N.J. Coalition, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 219-20, 732 A.2d 1063 (quoting the Legislative findings and declarations in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Among other changes, AICRA established a procedure for the resolution of disputes among insureds, providers of medical benefits, and PIP carriers. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-5.1. The Commissioner of DOBI was authorized by AICRA: (1) to designate an organization, the DRO, to administer the dispute resolution procedure; and (2) to promulgate regulations with respect thereto. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5.1(b). <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-5.6 (setting forth procedures for the PIP dispute resolution proceedings). The arbitration decisions are made by a DRP, who is chosen through procedures established by the statute, <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-5.1, and implementing regulations, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-5.5. While a DRP\u2019s decision is \u201cbinding,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5.1(b), it is nevertheless subject to limited judicial review pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-13. <em>N.J AC. </em>ll:3-5.6(f). <em>See Riverside Chiropractic Group v. Mercury Ins. Co., </em>404 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228, 237, 961 A.2d 21 (App.Div.2008). <em>See also </em>Cynthia Craig <em>&amp; </em>Daniel Pomeroy, <em>New Jersey Auto Insurance Law </em>\u00a7 10:2-2 at 191-92 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">When the PIP-reimbursement dispute concerns \u201cthe diagnosis, the medical necessity of the treatment or diagnostic test administered to the injured person, whether the injury is causally related to the insured event or is the product of a preexisting condition, or disputes as to the appropriateness of the protocols utilized by the provider,\u201d the DRP or one of the parties may seek \u201ca determination\u201d from an MRO. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-5.1(d). The MRO\u2019s \u201cdetermination ... shall be presumed to be correct by the [DRP], which presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also N.J. Coalition, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 264-65, 732 A.2d 1063 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5.1(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>AICRA required DOBI to establish \u201cstandards for the certification\u201d of MROs. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5.2(a). Those standards are required to \u201cset forth procedures to ensure a timely and <em>impartial </em>review of the medical records of the injured person.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added). <em>See N.J.AC. </em>11:3-5.8 (outlining permissible determinations for an MRO to make); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-5.12 (detailing the prohibited conflicts of interest for DRPs).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In reviewing the dispute-resolution regulations at issue in <em>N.J. Coalition, supra, </em>we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">Independence of the dispute resolution process was the recurring theme of statements made at the hearings [on AICRA] conducted by the Legislature\u2019s Joint Committee. To ensure this independence, former Insurance Commissioner Randall recommended that \u201cLn]o [insurance] company would be able to engage the [medical review organization] of its choice. In fact, until it became necessary to exchange certain information, the insurance company wouldn\u2019t even know which [medical] review organization had been assigned to its case.\u201d Physicians who testified at the hearing also agreed that medical review would have to be \u201cabsolutely and totally independent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">In order to ensure the independence of medical reviewers as compelled by AICRA, the Department\u2019s regulation maintains the confidentiality of certain records and information. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>U:3-5.10(g) provides that all data or information in the MRO\u2019s application for certification shall, with certain exceptions, be confidential and not disclosed to the public. The information which shall be deemed public includes the MRO\u2019s certificate of incorporation, the date of the certification and its expiration date, the MRO\u2019s address, the names of the MRO\u2019s officers and directors, and the individuals responsible for administering medical reviews. The names of all medical reviewers are available to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">The Department contends that in order to protect the identity of the medical reviewer from the insurer, the identity of the reviewer must also be protected from disclosure to the. claimant, whether the claimant is an individual insured or a treating provider. This safeguard protects the integrity of the process and allows the medical reviewer to make an independent and fair evaluation without being subject to undue influence by either party to the dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">At the conclusion of the proceeding, the determination of the dispute resolution professional and the identity of the medical reviewers are available to the parties. The final decision will also be filed with the Commissioner and subject to public inspection pursuant to right-to-know laws. <em>See </em>30 <em>N.J.R. </em>4441, where the Department responds that final decisions will be public records available for inspection with the name of the injured party redacted in order to respect medical privacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>concerns. Other documents related to individual disputes are maintained by the dispute resolution organization, but are not filed with the Department. These documents are not public records, either under the common-law right-to-know or the statutory right-to-know law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">[323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 265-66, 732 A.2d 1063 (alterations in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We then specifically addressed the concerns of the appellants in <em>N.J. Coalition </em>that the MRO process would not provide an avenue to challenge the independence of the MRO physician because the physician\u2019s identity was not revealed until after the MRO report and decision were completed and distributed to the parties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">At that time, [ie., when the report is circulated and the MRO physician identified,] the parties to the dispute may avail themselves of the information relating to the identity and background of the medical reviewer. <em>The parties are free to challenge the independence of the review. See the standards established in the Alternate Dispute Resolution Statute, N.J.S.A 2A28A-13. </em>The independence of the medical reviewer will probably not be a significant issue in light of the stringent conflicLof-interest provisions established in the regulations. For example, N.<em>J.A.C. </em>11:3-5.12 prohibits medical reviewers from having any personal and financial interest in proceedings or final determinations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">The cases cited by [the Association of Trial Lawyers of America] in its brief challenging this confidentiality procedure refer to the right of one party to the litigation to cross-examine an expert medical witness testifinng for the opposing side. <em>See e.g., State v. Smith, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 13, 242 A.2d 870 (App.Div.1968), <em>certif. denied, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>577, 252 A.2d 154 (1969) (\u201cIt is elementary that a party may show bias, including hostility, of an adverse witness.\u201d) (citations omitted). The situations are dissimilar. Medical reviewers are not like expert witnesses at a trial, retained by the parties and traditionally subject to cross-examination. The medical review organization and its medical reviewers do not represent either party to a dispute. <em>The medical reviewers are independent, akin to arbitrators or judges, but possess professional knowledge in a specialized medical field. </em>There is no justification to cross-examine the medical reviewer just as there is none to cross-examine a judge or arbitrator. We find no contrary authority. Because the confidentiality provisions in the regulations are mandated by AICRA and fulfill legislative intent, the challenge to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3\u20145.10(g) fails.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">[323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 267, 732 A.2d 1063 (emphasis added).] <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">Thus, in <em>N.J. Coalition, </em>we upheld the validity of the MRO process against a challenge based in large part on concerns about a potential for conflicts of interest and lack of impartiality. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>doing so, we noted the Legislature\u2019s concern that the process be independent and the steps taken by the Legislature and DOBI to ensure such independence. We characterized the MRO physicians as \u201cindependent, akin to arbitrators or judges,\u201d and held that parties would be \u201cfree to challenge the independence of the review,\u201d specifically pointing to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-13 as an avenue for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-13 provides for limited judicial review of an alternate dispute resolution award.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">a. A party to an alternative resolution proceeding shall commence a summary application in the Superior Court for its vacation, modification or correction within 45 days after the award is delivered to the applicant, or within 30 days after receipt of an award modified pursuant to subsection <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-12(d)], unless the parties shall extend the time in writing. The award of the umpire shall become final unless the action is commenced as required by this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">b. In considering an application for vacation, modification or correction, a decision of the umpire on the facts shall be final if there is substantial evidence to support that decision; provided, however, that when the application to the court is to vacate the award pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of subsection c., the court shall make an independent determination of any facts relevant thereto de novo, upon such record as may exist or as it may determine in a summary expedited proceeding as provided for by rules adopted by the Supreme Court for the purpose of acting on such applications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">c. The award shall be vacated on the application of a party who either participated in the alternative resolution proceeding or was served with a notice of intention to have alternative resolution if the eourt finds that the rights of that party were prejudiced by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">(1) Corruption, fraud or misconduct in procuring the award;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">(2) <em>Partiality of an umpire appointed as a neutral;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">IS) In ma\\nng ftie award, the umpire's exceeding ibeir power or so imperfectly executing that power that a final and definite award was not made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-13\">(4) Failure to follow the procedures set forth in this act, unless the party applying to vacate the award continued with the proceeding with notice of the defect and without objection; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-14\">(5) The umpire\u2019s committing prejudicial error by erroneously applying law to the issues and facts presented for alternative resolution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-15\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-16\">Although the DRP is the primary \u201cumpire\u201d involved in the dispute resolution process at issue here, it is clear from our decision in <em>N.J. Coalition </em>that the MRO physician, whose decision is statutorily presumed to be correct and whom we have charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>terized as \u201cakin to [an] arbitrator[ ],\u201d also serves as. \u201can umpire appointed as a neutral\u201d for the purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-13(e)(2). Consequently, the issue of the MRO physician\u2019s impartiality, if timely raised during the arbitration proceedings, is reviewable by the Law Division in an action to review the DRP\u2019s decision brought pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-13.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">As noted above, although Orthopaedic Associates timely raised the issue of Lakin\u2019s lack of impartiality during the dispute resolution process, it did not pursue the matter through an action to review the award in the Law Division pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:23A-13. Its time to do so had already expired and the DRP\u2019s decision had become final by the time it filed the present action. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-13(a). Consequently, the doctrine of res judicata bars Orthopaedic Associates from seeking to relitigate its claim against Progressive for reimbursement of the disputed PIP benefits in this action. <em>Velasquez v. Franz, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>498, 505, 589 A.2d 143 (1991) (\u201cIn essence, the doctrine of res judicata provides that a cause of action between parties that has been finally determined on the merits by a tribunal having jurisdiction cannot be relitigated by those parties or their privies in a new proceeding.\u201d (citing <em>Roberts v. Goldner, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>82, 85, 397 A.2d 1090 (1979))).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">To the extent Orthopaedic Associates challenges the overall fairness of the MRO process, we are satisfied that the issue was decided correctly in <em>N.J.

In addition to the fact that such documents are not appropriately considered on appeal, <em>R. </em>2:5-4(a), they concern the merits of Orthopaedic Associates\u2019 claims against Lakin, which is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-7\"> Progressive is not responsible for PIP benefits related to the second accident.

In addition, the MRO physician does not know the identity of the insurance carrier involved in the arbitration when the MRO review is taking place. To facilitate implementation of this requirement, the identity of the MRO physician is not revealed to the claimant until the report is circulated. <em>N.J.

However, we note that, because it will ultimately be subject to judicial review, the decision must be explained by the decision maker so that there will be a basis for meaningful judicial review. <em>See DiMaria v.

With respect any claims for damages against Lakin, NAF, and First MCO arising out of their participation in the adjudication of Orthopaedic Associates' claim against Progressive, the motion judge held that such claims are barred by Rule 32 of the New Jersey Noihult.
