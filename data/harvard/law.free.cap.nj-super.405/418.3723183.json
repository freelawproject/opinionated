DYFS also appeals from the denial of a motion for reconsideration and to supplement the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">A.R. is the mother of four minor children, including C.S., Jr. (\u201cJunior\u201d) who was born June 28, 2006. His sister and half-sisters are three to nine years older. A.R. is married to C.S., the father of Junior and Gwen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no contest to the judgment terminating the parental rights of the fathers, including C.S. While the Family Part declined to terminate A.R.\u2019s rights to any of her four children, DYFS appeals only from that portion of the judgment regarding A.R.\u2019s parental rights over Junior, her youngest child.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">On September 20, 2005, DYFS removed A.R.\u2019s three children from the home of A.R. and C.S. Two days later the Family Part found that \u201cthe removal ... was required due to imminent danger\u201d because of the parents\u2019 drug use and C.S.\u2019s incarceration. Legal and physical custody was transferred to DYFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">On April 5, 2006, the trial court entered a \u201cmultipurpose order\u201d allowing for reunification of the three children with A.R. once she provided \u201ca permanent plan of how a single mother would care for her children\u201d and verification that C.S. \u201chas moved out\u201d of the home. Reunification occurred on July 25, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">The court ordered the removal of the children again on September 6, 2006. A.R. was found to have allowed C.S. \u201cto return to the home and be with the children while he was actively using drugs.\u201d By that time, Junior had been born and all four children were removed and placed in the \u201cimmediate care and supervision of\u2019 DYFS. However, on November 8, 2006, the court ordered reunification, and legal and physical custody were returned to A.R. Shortly thereafter, on December 12, 2006, the children were again removed from the home because C.S. was found in the house, high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>on crack cocaine. The emergency removal was confirmed by an order entered on December 14, 2006. The children were again placed \u201cunder the care and supervision\u201d of DYFS, and a Law Guardian was appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">DYFS filed a complaint for guardianship and an order to show cause on May 8, 2007. At a hearing on December 17, 2007, the Family Part ordered that the trial commence on January 7, 2008, and that \u201c[A.R.] shall attend a bonding evaluation to be scheduled by [DYFS]\u201d in advance thereof. However, this evaluation never took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The trial occurred in January and February, 2008. In a comprehensive opinion, Judge Mark J. Nelson denied the termination and guardianship with respect to A.R. The court reinstated the protective services litigation and listed the matter for a compliance review on May 28, 2008. Judge Nelson found that DYFS satisfied its burden on only two of the four prongs of the statutory test required for termination. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1. He concluded as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">[Substantial portions of the opinion have been redacted for purposes of publication at the request of the court.]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">The Division should be proud of its conduct and actions in this matter and not be pessimistic. The Division has, in fact, fulfilled its obligations and duties in this matter. We have a very troubled family. The Division provided services and as stated made more than reasonable efforts to provide those services. The defendant, [A.R.], accepted and complied with those services. The statute requires that the Division make reasonable efforts so that defendants can comply with the services. That is what occurred in this case in regard to [A.R.] and rather than stating that this case might be a failure, the Division should feel proud that this case is a success in its providing services and the defendant [AR.] accepting and complying with services. Unfortunately, that cannot be stated in regards to the defendants [C.S.] and [M.M.].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Dr. Daniel Bromberg, a clinical psychologist, performed bonding evaluations on A.R. and her children on April 19, 2007, and evaluated A.R. and C.S. individually. Dr. Bromberg also conducted a bonding evaluation of Junior with his foster parents. Based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>on these evaluations, Dr. Bromberg determined that A.R. is unable to provide a safe and stable home for her children. He based this conclusion on her \u201clong standing history of substance abuse,\u201d her history with men who have substance abuse problems, and her failure to protect herself and her children from domestic violence. He also noted that A.R.\u2019s employment history \u201cdidn\u2019t appear to be particularly stable\u201d and her marketable skills were severely limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Dr. Bromberg stated that A.R. only attended Narcotics Anonymous (\u201cN.A.\u201d) meetings \u201conce in a blue moon,\u201d which concerned him. He was also disturbed to learn that the father of the older girls, Darlene and Barbara, A.R.\u2019s former paramour M.M., had been accused as a teenager of raping his younger sister, but A.R. did nothing when she heard this accusation and \u201cstayed with him.\u201d Dr. Bromberg believed this behavior was part of \u201ca pattern of failure to be aware of significant risks to her children and failure to protect her children from those significant risks.\u201d He also noted that psychological tests revealed A.R. was \u201cskilled in deceiving other individuals\u201d and was \u201cpreoccupied with approval.\u201d Dr. Bromberg attributed A.R.\u2019s concealing her substance abuse history from him during her evaluations to this desire for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">In sum, Dr. Bromberg determined that A.R. was \u201cunable to parent at the time of the evaluation.\u201d He stated that A.R. needed to be able to demonstrate to the court that she could provide safe, stable housing, keep up with her rent payments, hold a job, and remain clean and sober. He also opined that she needed psychotherapy, which would not be \u201cshort term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Regarding A.R.\u2019s bonds with her children, Dr. Bromberg noted that all four children had \u201cdifferent levels of emotional attachment to her.\u201d In describing A.R.\u2019s bond with Junior, Dr. Bromberg acknowledged that any analysis he could provide was limited because Junior slept through most of the evaluation. As such, \u201c[i]t was easier to assess the bond [A.R.] had to [Junior], then [sic] it was to assess the bond that [Junior], has to [A.R.]\u201d However, Dr. Bromberg observed that, while Junior was awake, he \u201cap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>peared to interact with his mother well, he was cuddling with his mother. There was mutual gazing between them.\u201d Dr. Bromberg stated that because Junior \u201cslept through a great deal of the bonding evaluation\u201d with A.R., the impact of termination was a \u201cmore difficult question to answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">When asked if Junior would suffer any harm if his ties to A.R. were permanently severed, Dr. Bromberg stated \u201cI believe that he would, certainly, miss [A.R.], ... given his age, and the amount of time that he\u2019s been in foster care, at this point, and the nature of the relationship with the foster parents. I\u2019m not convinced that that would be terribly harmful for him.\u201d He acknowledged that Junior would suffer \u201csome harm\u201d but stated that \u201cwith psychotherapy and with appropriate support\u201d he could recover. He also stated that, while terminating A.R.\u2019s parental rights would not create severe or enduring harm, another failed reunification would be \u201cdevastating\u201d to the other children.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Dr. Albert Griffith, a clinical psychologist, performed an evaluation of A.R. on June 10, 2007, and testified for the defense. He also conducted bonding evaluations on A.R. and her three oldest children.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In his evaluation of A.R., Dr. Griffith testified that, based on her performance on the Adult Intelligence Scale reading, it was likely A.R. had a learning disability. However, he found that she had \u201csufficient general abilities to learn parenting.\u201d In assessing A.R.\u2019s parenting skills, Dr. Griffith found that she maintained her visits with her children, that she was \u201cable to adequately describe her children\u201d and \u201ccould talk about their individual needs.\u201d However, Dr. Griffith noted that \u201cshe was not that aware of [Junior], simply because he had been removed so much earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Dr. Griffith also testified that A.R. needed parenting skills training, but was not \u201cgrossly deficient at this point.\u201d He \u201csaw reunification as being possible, say, placed in two stages with a period of adjustment between the 2 of about 60 days.\u201d Dr. Griffith noted that A.R. should continue to be drug tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Dr. Griffith did not perform any evaluations of Junior and, therefore, could give \u201cno opinion\u201d regarding the child or his situation. He stated that because Junior was under the age of two, an evaluation would not be \u201cappropriate\u201d based on psychological literature that \u201csuggests that children of that age really don\u2019t bond.\u201d However, later in his testimony Dr. Griffith stated \u201cthe crucial stages [of bonding], basically, begin ... when the child is born and cared for in infancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In addressing the risk that future reunifications may fail as the attempts in November and December of 2006 had, Dr. Griffith stated that a repeated failure would not \u201cnecessarily\u201d occur because A.R. was in a \u201cbetter stage in her recovery process.\u201d When asked if being reunited with her four children would be \u201coverwhelming\u201d for A.R., Dr. Griffith acknowledged that she would \u201cfeel challenged,\u201d but that \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to believe that this woman cannot cope with four children\u201d and simultaneously \u201ctak[e] care of the other issues that she needs to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Dr. Jeffrey Singer, a clinical psychologist, evaluated A.R. individually on behalf of the Law Guardian, and performed bonding assessments on her and her daughters. In evaluating A.R., Dr. J. Singer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> found that she had abused crack cocaine, and her behavior was \u201cconsistent with a woman who would be in an abusive relationship, that had certain vulnerabilities and she couldn\u2019t set appropriate limite \\\\Tiii\\ her former husband.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He opined that, while A.R. had accomplished \u201cno small feat\u201d in staying off drugs, she would need \u201congoing support\u201d to avoid getting involved with abusive men. However, he also found \u201cshe enjoys being a mother very much and has the capacity to function in that role of support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>When asked if A.R. was capable of protecting and parenting her four children on a day to day basis, Dr. J. Singer stated that she could, \u201cwith the correct combination of\u2014of therapeutic services.\u201d These services include day care and having an \u201caid\u201d who \u201ccomes in and helps around the\u2014the house.\u201d Despite these challenges, Dr. J. Singer testified on cross-examination that he thought A.R. would succeed, given \u201cher love, her commitment, and her motivation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">When questioned about the effects of another failed reunification on the children, Dr. J. Singer stated that he did not know if the harm would be \u201cenduring,\u201d but he acknowledged that it would \u201cbe upsetting and traumatic. Probably at the lower end of severe, but it\u2019s hard to know exactly how much more these kids can take.\u201d While Dr. J. Singer performed no bonding evaluation with Junior, he did testify that Junior\u2019s sisters discussed him during their bonding evaluations, knew that he was their \u201clittle brother,\u201d and were generally \u201cinclusive of him in the family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">On December 10 and 11, 2007, Dr. Mark Singer performed bonding evaluations of the girls with their foster mother and of Junior with his foster parents. He also testified for DYFS. With regard to Junior\u2019s bond with his foster parents, Dr. M. Singer found that Junior \u201cclearly exhibited many of the indicators suggesting a secure attachment between himself and his ... foster parents.\u201d He noted that Junior interacted well with his foster parents, with \u201ca lot of verbal contact, lot of smiling, lot of laughing.\u201d Also, Junior would not stay in the room with Dr. M. Singer when his foster parents left and \u201csought out his caretakers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">When asked if Junior would experience harm if the court severed his relationship with his foster parents, Dr. M. Singer responded \u201cthat the child would experience both significant and enduring harm.\u201d Because his foster parents \u201care his central parental figures,\u201d Dr. M. Singer believed that Junior would experience \u201ca lot of emotional and behavioral regression\u201d in the short term and a \u201cfeeling of insecurity, a feeling of low self esteem, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>feelings of sadness\u201d in the long term. Dr. M. Singer also noted that Junior \u201cis at an age where ... the window of opportunity to form healthy child/parental attachments closes after a period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Dr. M. Singer could not testily to Junior\u2019s bond with A.R., his sister, or his half sisters because he did not conduct any bonding evaluation with A.R. or the girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">After hearing the testimony and reviewing the documentary evidence, Judge Nelson determined that DYFS had not proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that A.R.\u2019s parental rights should be terminated as to any of her children. He addressed each of the four prongs of the statutory best interest test, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1 (a), separately and found that DYFS only established the first and third by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Judge Nelson found that DYFS failed to establish the second and fourth prongs. With respect to the second prong, the judge concluded that A.R. had complied with all the services DYFS offered her, complied with substance abuse treatment and had acquired stable employment, recently receiving \u201cpromotion to a supervisory position.\u201d Moreover, the judge found the testimony of Dr. Bromberg to be \u201cincredible, particularly, in comparison to the testimony of all of the other doctors testifying and, particularly, in comparison to all the steps that [A.R.] has undertaken and completed to provide a safe and stable home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Because of the girls\u2019 ages, they were more bonded and \u201chave a much stronger attachment and relationship to their mother\u201d than does Junior, and were \u201conly somewhat attached to their foster mother,\u201d the judge found there was \u201cno testimony that separating the girls from the resource family would cause serious or enduring harm.\u201d The judge further noted that because \u201cthe Division failed to provide a comparison bonding evaluation with his mother,\u201d DYFS could not show that separating Junior from his foster parents would cause serious and enduring emotional or psychological harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The judge also concluded that DYFS failed to meet its burden as to the fourth prong. He found that \u201cthe three girls have a much stronger and more serious and enduring bond with their natural mother than they do with their foster mother\u201d and that Junior had \u201ca very strong bond with his foster parents which is quite understandable because he spent almost his entire life with his foster parents.\u201d However, with respect to Junior, the judge again focused on DYFS\u2019s failure to provide a bonding evaluation between him and A.R., and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">he does have a bond with [A.R.] but no witness could testify that it was a meaningful bond____The one and only bonding evaluation scheduled between the mother and that child was frankly worthless as [Junior] slept during the session and Dr. Bromberg was unable to gauge the level of attachment or bond between the two.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The judge held that, because it was DYFS\u2019s burden to present evidence of that bond, \u201cand to provide evidence to compare and contrast\u201d the bonds Junior had with his foster parents and biological mother, \u201cthe Division has failed to demonstrate that termination of parental rights would not do more harm than good as to the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Based on his findings, the court dismissed DYFS\u2019s complaint to terminate A.R.\u2019s parental rights to her four children. Thereafter, DYFS filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion to supplement the record. It argued that it was unable to provide a bonding evaluation between Junior and A.R. because Junior had slept through the first one and A.R. was not ordered to attend a second bonding evaluation with Junior until December 17, 2007. According to the Deputy Attorney General trying the case, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t enough time for [Dr. Mark Singer] to do an evaluation and submit a report between December 17th and the time of trial.\u201d Judge Nelson denied the motion and held that DYFS was, in effect, arguing that he erred by not considering evidence that the Division never presented. He noted that the correct course of action should have been to ask for an adjournment, not go into trial with inadequate proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">On this appeal we must afford great deference to the Family Part\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law based on those findings. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. G.L., </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>596, 605, 926 A.2d 320 (2007); <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. M.M., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>261, 279, 914 A.2d 1265 (2007). Accordingly we must \u201cuphold the factual findings undergirding the trial court\u2019s decision if they are supported by \u2018adequate, substantial and credible evidence\u2019 on the record.\u201d <em>M.M., supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 279, 914 A.2d 1265 (quoting <em>In Re Guardianship of J.T., </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 188, 634 A.2d 1361 (App.Div.1993)). This is particularly true when findings are based on the \u201ctrial court\u2019s credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>While our scope of review is expanded \u201cwhere the focus of the dispute is ... alleged error in the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the underlying facts and the implications to be drawn therefrom,\u201d <em>ibid, </em>(internal citations omitted), we must nevertheless \u201caccord deference unless the trial court\u2019s findings \u2018went so wide of the mark that a mistake must have been made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Snyder Realty, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>65, 69, 558 A.2d 28, (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>165, 564 A.2d 883 (1989)). <em>See also G.L., supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 605, 926 A.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Even though the scope of review remains the same, we also note that in this case the Law Guardian agrees with the trial judge with respect to the denial of termination of A.R.\u2019s parental rights to Junior. While the Law Guardian has an obligation to advocate for the wishes of a child over ten who is able to express his or her own view on the issue, see <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. E.P., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>88, 112-14, 952 A.2d 436 (2008), in this case Junior cannot yet speak for himself. In evaluating our scope of review, we find the Law Guardian\u2019s position of particular significance because, while she actively represents and speaks for the child, she has to advocate for the best interests of a child too young to speak for himself, and represents neither adversary in the case. <em>Compare R. </em>5:8A, <em>with Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. Robert </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>M., </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>44, 69, 788 A.2d 888, <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>39, 803 A.2d 635 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">It is well known that a parent\u2019s right \u201cto raise a child and maintain a relationship with that child\u201d is constitutionally protected under the federal and state Constitutions. <em>E.P., supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 102, 952 A.2d 436 (citing <em>Stanley v.

[A.R.] would be unable to eliminate the risk of harm to ... [Junior] and could not, independently, provide him with a safe and stable home.\u201d As noted, Judge Nelson found that DYFS failed to establish two of the four prongs set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a). There is no cross-appeal regarding his findings as to the other two prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">(D</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The first prong of the best interests of the child standard is whether \u201c[t]he child\u2019s safety, health or development has been or will continue to be endangered by the parental relationship.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a)(l).

[A.R.] ... has admitted to free basing cocaine, has admitted to a substance abuse issue, ... has exercised poor judgment in her choice of men and has allowed or permitted [C.S.] ... back into the home, has failed to abide by court orders and has neglected the children in general by maintaining a home in an unsanitary condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>It is uncontested that DYFS satisfied the first prong by clear and convincing evidence. <em>M.M., supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 279, 914 A.2d 1265. A.R. violated a court order on two separate occasions by allowing C.S. into the home. A.R. has abused drugs and generally put her children at risk by failing to maintain a clean and healthy home environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The second prong of the best interests test requires a determination as to whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">[t]he parent is unwilling or unable to eliminate the harm facing the child or is unable or unwilling to provide a safe and stable home for the child and the delay of permanent placement will add to the harm. Such harm may include evidence that separating the child from his resource family parents would cause serious and enduring emotional or psychological harm to the child[J <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a)(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">This prong relates to a parent\u2019s unfitness, which may be established by demonstrating a parent is \u201c\u2018unwilling or unable to eliminate the harm\u2019 that has endangered the child\u2019s health and development.\u201d <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 352, 736 A.2d 1246 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a)(2)). Parental unfitness is also established when a parent fails \u201cto provide a \u2018safe and stable home for the child\u2019 and a \u2018delay in permanent placement\u2019 will further harm the child.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As already noted, the burden falls on DYFS to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthe natural parent has not cured the initial cause of harm and will continue to cause serious and lasting harm to the child.\u201d <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 10, 608 A.2d 1312 (citing <em>Santosky, supra, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 763, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1402, 71 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 616-17).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Moreover, \u201c[t]o the extent that the quality of the child\u2019s relationship with foster parents may be relevant to termination of the natural parents\u2019 status, that relationship must be viewed not in isolation but in a broader context that includes as well the quality of the child\u2019s relationship with his or her natural parents.\u201d <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 608 A.2d 1312. \u201c[T]he development of disproportionately stronger ties between a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>and foster parents may lead to a bonding relationship the severing of which would cause profound harm____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, it is not enough for DYFS to simply \u201cshow that the child has a strong relationship with the foster parents or might be better off if left in their custody____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 608 A.2d 1312 (citing <em>In re Baby M, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>396, 445, 537 A.2d 1227 (1988)). The burden is on DYFS to prove, \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that separating the child from his or her foster parents would cause serious and enduring emotional or psychological harm.\u201d <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 19, 608 A.2d 1312 (citing <em>Santosky, supra, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 768, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1402, 71 L.Ed.2d at 616-17). \u201cSuch proof should include the testimony of a well qualified expert who has had full opportunity to make a comprehensive, objective, and informed evaluation of the child\u2019s relationship with the foster parent.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">In the present case, the trial judge found that A.R. had eliminated the harm facing Junior and could now provide a safe and stable home for him. The court based this determination on AR.\u2019s compliance with the services DYFS had provided, except for a brief drug relapse in November 2005. He also noted that she had an apartment, a stable job, and had \u201cproven that she can comply and will comply with [future] services.\u201d Concern and efforts by a natural parent after his or her child has been removed from the home, and making genuine and successful efforts to overcome the cause of the removal is of enormous significance. As such, Judge Nelson determined that DYFS failed to satisfy prong two of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">DYFS argues that the findings are \u201ccontrary to the evidence.\u201d The Division supports this contention by citing the testimony of the psychological experts during the trial. DYFS notes that Dr. Bromberg concluded that A.R. \u201ccontinues to present a risk to the children because of her \u2018involvement with men who engage in behaviors that potentially threaten her children\u2019s well-being.\u2019\u201d DYFS also notes that Dr. J. Singer expressed concern over A.R.\u2019s choice in men and her \u201cpsychological vulnerabilities.\u201d He recommended reunification with continued services. However, DYFS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>asserts that it provided A.R. with those services during her two failed reunification attempts.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">As Judge Nelson found, A.R. is currently employed as a manager at McDonald\u2019s. She has complied with the services and support DYFS has provided and has completed domestic violence counseling since her children were last removed from her custody. She has filed for divorce from C.S. Dr. J. Singer and Dr. Griffith both testified that A.R. had the ability to succeed if she were given a chance at reunification. While DYFS\u2019s expert, Dr. Bromberg, testified she was incapable of parenting with the proper support, Judge Nelson expressly found Dr. Bromberg\u2019s testimony was not credible, particularly \u201cin comparison to all the steps that [A.R.] ... has undertaken and completed to provide a safe and stable home\u201d and the work she did following Dr. Bromberg\u2019s evaluation. Furthermore, the judge noted \u201c[t]he court never heard Dr. Bromberg indicate that [A.R.] ... was presently unfit to parent her children. Rather, Dr. Bromberg couched his opinion more in terms that it would be \u2018risky\u2019 to return the children to [A.R.] ... based on her personal failures and the two prior failed reunifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Based on A.R.\u2019s compliance and response to the services provided, Judge Nelson\u2019s credibility determination, and the testimony of the other experts, especially with respect to A.R.\u2019s progress, the determination as to the second prong must be upheld based on our scope of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">DYFS also argues that the evaluations of the other experts, and particularly Dr. Griffith, should be discounted. Its arguments before us sound like a summation for presentation to the trial judge. As we have made clear, and as DYFS acknowledges, we are not the fact finder and cannot consider the matter <em>de novo. </em>There is no attack on the admissibility of the expert testimony; its consistency and its credibility is for the trial court to assess.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">DYFS also argues that Junior would experience enduring harm if he is separated from his foster parents, and that the Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Part erred by not giving appropriate weight to that consideration. However, as already noted, the fact that the child has a strong relationship with the foster parents is not by itself enough to terminate parental rights. <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 18-19, 608 A.2d 1312. <em>See also E.P., supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 109, 952 A.2d 436. It bears repeating that the child\u2019s relationship with foster parents \u201cmust be viewed not in isolation but in a broader context that includes ... the quality of the child\u2019s relationship with his or her natural parents.\u201d <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 608 A.2d 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In noting that Junior \u201cclearly is attached to his resource family,\u201d the judge noted that \u201cthe Division failed to provide a comparison bonding evaluation with his mother____\u201d As a result the judge determined that DYFS could not show that separating Junior from his foster parents would cause serious and enduring emotional or psychological harm. DYFS contends that, based on Dr. Bromberg\u2019s opinion, Junior \u201cwould suffer \u2018fairly minimal harm\u2019 as a result of the termination of [A.R.]\u2019s parental rights.\u201d It also points to the evaluations of all the experts with respect to Junior\u2019s bonding with his foster family, and asserts he lived with his mother for only three months, although she did maintain visitation with him. Moreover, and significantly, DYFS asserts that it did not have to provide any proof of Junior\u2019s relationship or bond with A.R. While seeking a remand to conduct a bonding evaluation if required,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> DYFS maintains <em>J.C. </em>does not require a comparative evaluation in this case because of the child\u2019s age when removed from his mother\u2019s care and because it is asserting the unfitness of the terminated parent as the basis of satisfying the second prong. Stated differently, DYFS asserts that a comparative bonding evaluation is not required when it has demonstrated parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>It is true, as DYFS contends, that <em>J.C. </em>concerned a voluntary placement, and the issue related to the adverse impact of removing children from the foster family with which they bonded. It is also true that <em>J.C. </em>discussed \u201ccases in which DYFS seeks termination of parental rights, not on grounds of current unfitness but because of potential harm to the child based on separation from a foster parent with whom a child has bonded.\u201d 129 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 608 A.2d 1312. Moreover, <em>J.C. </em>expressly held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">[i]n hearing a petition for termination in which the fitness of natural parents is neither relied on nor disputed by the agency, the trial court must also consider parallel proof of the child\u2019s relationship with his or her natural parents in assessing the existence, nature, and extent of the harm facing the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 19, 608 A.2d 1312.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">But <em>J.C. </em>noted that standards for termination of parental rights following voluntary and involuntary placements were the same, and emphasized the need for expert evaluations and testimony with respect to natural and resource families. <em>Id. </em>at 17-19, 608 A.2d 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Despite the specific issue addressed in <em>J.C., </em>Justice Handler developed the relevance and importance of both relationships, as opposed to the \u201cisolation\u201d of that with the foster parents in \u201cassessing the existence, nature and extent of harm facing the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 608 A.2d 1312. Hence, we can envision very few scenarios in which comparative evaluations would not be required. Indeed, even when not used to prove harm under the second prong, it is of great significance in evaluating comparative harm under the fourth prong in showing that \u201c \u2018termination of parental rights likely will not do more harm than good,\u2019 \u201d <em>E.P., supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 108, 952 A.2d 436 (quoting <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 354-55, 736 A.2d 1246), and in sustaining DYFS\u2019s burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 103; <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 355, 736 A.2d 1246. Accordingly, we agree that the comparative evaluation was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Had the trial judge not made his other findings and conclusions, DYFS\u2019s request for a remand to conduct the evaluation might be warranted. <em>See J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 25-26, 608 A.2d 1312 (remanding for a bonding evaluation). However, here, unlike <em>J.C., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>other evaluations were performed, and the trial judge did not deem termination to be warranted for additional reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">To satisfy the third prong of the best interests of the child test DYFS must demonstrate that it \u201chas made reasonable efforts to provide services to help the parent correct the circumstances which led to the child\u2019s placement outside the home and the court has considered alternatives to termination of parental rights[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a)(3). \u201c \u2018Reasonable efforts\u2019 may include consultation with the parent, developing a plan for reunification, providing services essential to the realization of the reunification plan, informing the family of the child\u2019s progress, and facilitating visitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>M.M., supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 914 A.2d 1265, (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(c)). However, DYFS\u2019s efforts to provide services \u201cis not measured by their success----These efforts must be assessed against the standard of adequacy in light of all the circumstances of a given case. Consistent efforts to maintain and support the parent-child bond are central to the court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship of </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>365, 393, 736 A.2d 1261 (1999). <em>See also N.J.

A.R. has had bi-weekly visits with her children since their removal. There is no dispute with respect to the services rendered. The judge found DYFS sustained its burden as to this prong, and there is no challenge by A.R. or the Law Guardian to that determination. To the contrary, A.R. insists she took full advantage of the services rendered, and succeeded to such a point that reunification was properly ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The fourth prong addresses whether \u201c[t]ermination of parental rights will not do more harm than good.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a)(4). It asks \u201cwhether, after considering and balancing the [child\u2019s] relationships [with the foster parents and the birth parents], the child will suffer a greater harm from the termination of ties with [his or] her natural parents than from the permanent disruption of [his or] her relationship with [his or] her foster parents.\u201d <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 355, 736 A.2d 1246. \u201cProng four \u2018serves as a fail-safe against termination even where the remaining standards have been met.\u2019 \u201d <em>E.P., supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 108, 952 A.2d 436 (quoting <em>G.L., supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 609, 926 A.2d 320). \u201c[T]o satisfy the fourth prong,\u201d DYFS must \u201coffer testimony of a Veil-qualified expert who has had full opportunity to make a comprehensive, objective, and informed evaluation\u2019 of the child\u2019s relationship with both the natural parents and the foster parents.\u201d <em>M.M., supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 914 A.2d 1265 (quoting <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 19, 608 A.2d 1312).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">It is well established that there is a \u201cparamount need\u201d for \u201cchildren [to] have ... permanent and defined parent-child relationships.\u201d <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 26, 608 A.2d 1312. <em>See also E.P., supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 110, 952 A.2d 436. Thus, a key consideration for the court is also the \u201cchild\u2019s need for permanency.\u201d <em>M.M., supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 914 A.2d 1265; <em>see also K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 357, 736 A.2d 1246 (holding that in applying statutory standards in guardianship and adoption cases, the trial court should be \u201ccognizant of New Jersey\u2019s strong public policy in favor of permanency\u201d). Moreover, in light of the goal of achieving a stable and permanent home for the child, there are \u201climits on the amount of time a parent may have to correct conditions at home in anticipation of reunification.\u201d <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 358, 736 A.2d 1246. However, this desire for permanency must be balanced against the need natural parents have to depend on foster care to \u201cprotect their children during difficult periods, including but not limited to experiences of home<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>lessness and domestic violence. A single-minded focus on continuity in care can result in parents who rely temporarily on foster care for needed assistance, finding it impossible to regain custody over their children.\u201d <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 20-21, 608 A.2d 1312. <em>See also E.P., supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 110-11, 952 A.2d 436 (where the \u201cunlikely possibility\u201d of a permanent placement or adoption did not outweigh the relationship with a natural parent). The same is true of parents facing problems affecting their ability to parent but who are motivated and able to overcome those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">DYFS contends that A.R.\u2019s inability to stay current on her rent and utility bills, her predisposition to relationships with violent, unstable men, and her difficulties in managing her four children while working full time and remaining in recovery should have been weighed more heavily. DYFS also emphasizes that A.R. has already had two failed reunifications and that another failure would be permanently detrimental to Junior\u2019s need for permanency and stability. However, DYFS ignores its own abilities and the progress it has helped A.R. achieve. As the trial judge found here, A.R., in essence a single mother of modest ability to earn a livelihood can nevertheless be a good parent when provided the support she does not otherwise receive from a loving, caring family. On this appeal, DYFS does not challenge the trial court\u2019s denial of termination as to A.R.\u2019s three other children\u2014 Junior\u2019s sister and half-sisters. Even though there is no dispute that the four prongs must be evaluated separately as to each child, <em>see M.M., supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 284-85, 914 A.2d 1265, the lack of appeal with respect to A.R.\u2019s older children represents DYFS\u2019s present view that A.R. has demonstrated a potential to be a good parent. The fact that Junior is younger and removed from the home at an earlier age should not, in these circumstances, deprive him of a relationship with his mother and siblings. <em>See New Jersey Div. of Youth v. S.S., </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>556, 560-62, 902 A.2d 215 (2006); <em>State Div. of Youth &amp; Fam. v.

Judge Nelson based this determination on A.R.\u2019s successful compliance with the services DYFS had provided thus far, her success in recovery, and her ability to retain steady employment. The judge also found that DYFS failed \u201cto provide evidence to compare and contrast the relationships of [Junior) with his foster parents and ... with his mother.\u201d As a result, Judge Nelson held that DYFS failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that terminating A.R.\u2019s parental rights would not do more harm than good. We cannot disturb this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">DYFS emphasizes the trauma Junior would experience if he was separated from his foster parents. However, loving-earing foster parents worthy of that role would assist in a gradual and beneficial reunification in the best interests of Junior. Moreover, the fourth prong \u201cdoes not provide an independent basis for termination where the other standards have not been satisfied.\u201d <em>G.L., supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 609, 926 A.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">AR. and the Law Guardian both complain that the judgment of the Family Part has not been implemented while Junior bonds more with his foster family and remains further separated from his mother. We do not attribute bad faith or bad motives to DYFS. Its conduct is undoubtedly based on its beliefs about Junior\u2019s best interests, and perhaps the belief that if we agree with it concerning the need for a comparative bonding evaluation, we will remand and it will then prevail after the evaluation is conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">A termination case cannot turn on procedural niceties or gamesmanship. We do not affirm merely because a second bonding evaluation was not scheduled and conducted before the trial. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>is particularly true because A.R. was advised by counsel not to attend a second bonding and psychological evaluation scheduled by DYFS before the December 17, 2007 hearing, when the issue of DYFS\u2019s request to conduct the second evaluation was to be considered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Rather, we affirm because the record and findings warrant the same in light of the experts\u2019 evaluations and their testimony, the lack of appeal with respect to the siblings and A.R.\u2019s ability to parent them and the progress that has been made. There is no suggestion that Junior had \u201cspecial needs\u201d warranting treating Junior differently than his sisters. <em>See, e.g., N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. S.A., </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>525, 536-37, 889 A.2d 1120 (App.Div.2006). <em>See also M.M., supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 269, 284-85, 914 A.2d 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">In its motion to supplement the record, DYFS points to A.R.\u2019s recent difficulty in paying her rent and utility bills on time, despite her promotion to a supervisor at McDonald\u2019s\u2014a problem faced by many good parents in this economy'\u2014but not to any harm or neglect of the children in her care and custody. In that context, we also find significant that no one suggests A.R. did not file her complaint for divorce in good faith or intend to keep C.S. away from the family when he is paroled. <em>G.L., supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 607-08, 926 A.2d 320 (2007); <em>See also M.M., supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 288-90, 914 A.2d 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">We add only that if DYFS continues to delay the ordered reunification, the trial court can appoint a professional to oversee and direct a prompt and appropriate reunification. <em>See G.L., supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 609, 926 A.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">The judgment is affirmed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\"> We use fictitious names for all the children in order to maintain the anonymity of the family.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\"> Because two experts have the same surname, we refer to them by their first initials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b455-9\"> Dr. J. Singer mistakenly referred to C.S. as A.R.'s ex-husband. A.R. had filed for divorce, but it was not final by the time of trial or the appeal before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\"> As already noted, DYFS received permission to have a second bonding evaluation with A.R. performed before trial because Junior slept through the one conducted by Dr. Bromberg. However, it was not conducted before the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
