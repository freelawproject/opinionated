Stahl contends that the DEP\u2019s decision to issue the permit without requiring compliance with the Stormwater Management Rules (SMR), <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:8-1 to -6.3, was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. Stahl also contends that the DEP deprived him of his due process rights and failed to appropriately consider his interests. We reject these contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Stahl owns approximately ten acres of land on Fostertown Road in Medford, designated as Lot 39.01, Block 302. Barresi owns two adjoining lots designated as Lots 39.05 and 39.06, Block 302, each of which are approximately 2.5 acres. The Stahl and Baressi properties are designated freshwater wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Barresi purchased his property in 1985. In 1986, he purchased a storm drainage easement on Stahl\u2019s property from a former owner. The easement permits Barresi to \u201cconstruct, alter, and maintain a twenty <em>foot wide </em>storm drainage area, and appurtenances, across\u201d a portion of Stahl\u2019s property. Stahl purchased his property in 1987, subject to and with knowledge of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">The Freshwater Water Protection Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (FWPA) divides freshwater wetlands into three categories. The first, and most highly protected category, is freshwater wetlands of exceptional resource value. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-7a. <em>See also N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-2.4(b). The two lesser protected categories are freshwater wetlands of ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>nary resource value, which includes man-made ditches, swales or detention facilities, and freshwater wetlands of intermediate resource value, which includes all other wetlands. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-7b and c. <em>See also N.J.A.C. </em>7:7a-2.4(d) and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">At the time Barresi obtained the easement, a man-made freshwater ditch/swale (the ditch) was located both on his property and within the easement on Stahl\u2019s property. The freshwater wetlands within the ditch area on Stahl\u2019s property is of both ordinary and intermediate resource value. The freshwater wetlands within the ditch area on Barresi\u2019s property is of ordinary resource value.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In 1987, the Medford Township Planning Board (Board) approved Barresi\u2019s application to subdivide one of his lots to construct a 35,400 square foot warehouse. As part of the approval, the Board reviewed drainage calculations and stormwater management. Barresi installed a foundation, but never constructed the warehouse. Thereafter, in 1994, without requiring a permit, the DEP authorized Stahl to install a parallel piping system in the ditch beginning at the northern end of the easement on Barresi\u2019s property and continuing northward to the paved driveway on Stahl\u2019s property. The DEP also authorized Stahl to raise the bottom contour elevations of the ditch without a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In 1995, Barresi sought a use variance to permit the construction of an indoor ice skating rink on the previously constructed foundation. The Board granted a use variance subject to site plan review and approval. The Board addressed drainage issues during its review and subsequently granted preliminary and final site plan approval, subject to certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">During the construction of the ice rink, in order to facilitate storm water drainage from the ice rink, Barresi relocated the ditch to align it with the parallel drainage piping that Stahl had installed. The Board, the Burlington County Soil Erosion Conservation Commission, and the township engineer and code officials approved the work. Barresi completed construction of the skating rink in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Three years later, based largely on information Stahl provided, on October 19, 2000, the DEP issued a Notice of Violation notifying Barresi of two violations: (1) the removal and relocation of an existing freshwater wetlands ditch located on Stahl\u2019s property without a freshwater wetlands general permit; and <em>(2) </em>the direct discharge of storm water from the ice rink into regulated freshwater wetlands.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The DEP instructed Barresi to either restore and stabilize the area to its pre-disturbance condition or submit the appropriate freshwater wetlands permit applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Because removal of the ditch is a regulated wetlands activity under the FWPA, a freshwater wetlands permit was required. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13.-9B-3; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-9. Two types of FWPA permits are available: general permits and individual permits. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-4.1 to -4.5, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.1 to -5.27; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7A:7.1 to 7.5. Among other requirements, all general permits require compliance with the SMR \u201c[i]f the activities under the general permit meet the definition of \u2018major development\u2019 at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-1.2.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-4.3(b)10. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-1.2 defines \u201cmajor development,\u201d in relevant part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">[AJny \u201cdevelopment\u201d that provides for ultimately disturbing one or more acres of land or increasing impervious surface by one-quarter acre or more. Disturbance for the purpose of this rule is the placement of impervious surface or exposure and/or movement of soil or bedrock or clearing, cutting, or removing of vegetation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Barresi eventually filed applications for freshwater wetlands general permit 1-Maintenance and repair of existing feature, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.1 (GP-1), or alternatively, general permit 7\u2014 Human-made ditches or swales in headwaters, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.7 (GP-7). A GP-1 authorizes \u201cactivities in freshwater wetlands ... required to carry out the repair, rehabilitation, replacement, maintenance or reconstruction of a previously authorized, currently serviceable ... irrigation or drainage ditch[.]\u201d A GP-1 requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>[T]he previously authorized ... ditch ... shall not have been and mil not be put to any use other than as specified in any permit authorizing its original construction. Activities under [a GP-1] shall not expand, widen or deepen the previously authorized feature, and shall not deviate from any plans of the original activity, except that minor deviations due to changes in materials or construction techniques and which are necessary to make repairs, rehabilitation or replacement are allowed provided such changes do not result in disturbance of additional freshwater wetlands or State open waters upon completion of the activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\"><em>[N.J.AC. </em>7:7A-5.1(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">A GP-7 authorizes \u201cactivities in freshwater wetlands that are human-made ditches or in freshwater wetlands that are swales, provided the ditch or swale is located in a headwater.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.7(a). A GP-7 may only be issued for work in ditches or swales, which by definition are ordinary resource value wetlands. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-2.4(d)2 and 3. A GP-7 permit also requires compliance \u201cwith all applicable requirements at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-4.3,\u201d including compliance with the SMR if the activities under the GP-7 meet the definition of \u201cmajor development.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-4.3; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.7(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The DEP concluded that Barresi\u2019s activities had disturbed a substantial area of intermediate resource value wetlands in the ditch area on Stahl\u2019s property. Thus, on November 1, 2005, it denied a GP-1, finding that such a permit \u201cis not applicable as the wetland feature was relocated, resized, and pipes were installed replacing portions of the feature. Based on this, the activity does not meet criteria <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>7:7\u20145.1(b) or (c)] above.\u201d The DEP also denied a GP-7, finding that \u201c[t]he submitted plans clearly indicate regulated activities have occurred in the intermediate resource wetlands, as well as the ordinary resource value wetlands. Therefore, the GP-7 application is not applicable due to the presence of intermediate resource value wetlands[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Barresi requested an adjudicatory hearing, contending that the DEP made several erroneous findings of fact. He argued, among other things, that his activity within the wetlands feature on Stahl\u2019s property concerned ordinary resource value wetlands, which qualifies for a GP-7. The DEP granted Barresi\u2019s request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>an adjudicatory hearing, and transmitted the matter to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Stahl sought to intervene in the administrative hearing and submitted a response to Barresi\u2019s contentions. Stahl contended that Barresi failed to satisfy the requirements for a GP-1 and a GP-7. He argued, as he does here, that because the construction of the ice rink was associated with the ditch relocation, it is considered an activity under the general permit for purposes of considering whether such activity met the definition of a \u201cmajor development.\u201d Thus, with the inclusion of the ice rink, the entire project created 52,000 square feet (more than one acre) of new impervious surface, it exceeded one quarter acre or more of new impervious coverage, and it disturbed one or more acres of land, qualifying it as a \u201cmajor development\u201d under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-1.2 and requiring compliance with the SMR.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Prior to the OAL hearing, the DEP requested additional documents, which Barresi provided. Thereafter, finding that it had, indeed, made factual errors, the DEP decided to reconsider the denial of a GP-7. It reviewed the history of site disturbances between 1990 and 2007; the project and its history; the wetland feature history and the relocation of the ditch; the project\u2019s general compliance with GP-7 criteria; and the project\u2019s compliance with conditions that apply to all GP authorizations under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-4.3. Finding that the project only included the activity in the ditch area on Stahl\u2019s property, the DEP concluded that the project only involved a 240 foot stretch of ordinary resource value wetlands, not intermediate resource value wetlands, and that it was Stahl\u2019s work in the ditch area that had disrupted or destroyed certain intermediate resource value wetlands. The DEP also concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">The total area of disturbance within the relocated [ditch] was approximately 7,000 sq. ft., and no impervious surface or point discharge was placed in the [ditch]. Since less than one acre of wetlands [was] disturbed, and since no impervious surface of point discharge was placed within the wetlands, the [SMR did] not apply to the project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Upon conclusion of its review, the DEP decided that Barresi qualified for a GP-7. On December 14, 2006, it proposed to settle the appeal by issuing a GP-7. It notified Stahl of the proposed settlement and invited his comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">On December 22, 2006, Baressi sent Stahl a Notice of Intent to Settle Alleged Freshwater Wetlands Violation, advising him that the DEP authorized a GP-7 and inviting his comments. On January 10, 2007, the DEP published a Notice of Settlement in the DEP Bulletin, and invited public comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Stahl submitted several letters commenting on the proposed settlement. Although he was pleased that the DEP had issued a GP-7, Stahl objected to certain portions of the settlement. He again argued that because the project included the ice rink and created 52,000 square feet of new impervious surface, it was a \u201cmajor development\u201d pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-1.2, requiring compliance with the SMR and installation of a water quality basin.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The DEP issued detailed findings of fact and an explanation of its decision in a fifteen-page letter, dated April 17, 2007, a copy of which it sent to Stahl. The decision notified Stahl that \u201cany person who is aggrieved by these decisions may request a hearing within 30 days of the decision[.]\u201d Stahl never requested such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">On May 3, 2007, Barresi sent Stahl a Notice of Settlement. On May 7, 2007, and again on June 6, 2007, the DEP published notice of the settlement in the DEP Bulletin. Also, Barresi sent Stahl a copy of a letter to the OAL withdrawing his appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Our role in reviewing an agency decision is limited. <em>Aqua Beach Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>5, 15, 890 A.2d 922 (2006); <em>In re Taylor, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>644, 656, 731 A.2d 35 (1999); <em>Brady v.

We review \u201ca final agency decision with deference, and will not reverse the ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>determination of an agency unless [we conclude] that it was \u2018arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, or that it lacked fair support in the evidence, or that it violated legislative policies\u2019 expressed or implied in the act governing the agency.\u201d <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands General Permit No. 16, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331, 341, 878 A.2d 22 (App.Div.2005) (quoting <em>Campbell v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556, 562, 189 A.2d 712 (1963)). \u201cThis deference is even stronger when the agency, like DEP in regards to wetlands, \u2018has been delegated discretion to determine the specialized and technical procedures for its tasks.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands, supra, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 593, 860 A.2d 450 (quoting <em>Newark v. Natural Res. Council Dep\u2019t. of Envtl. Prot., </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>530, 540, 414 A.2d 1304, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>983, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>400, 66 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 245 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Also, \u201c[we] extend substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations.\u201d <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands General Permit No. 16, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 341, 878 A.2d 22, (citing <em>DiMaria v. Bd. of Trs. of Pub. Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 351, 542 A.2d 498 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>638, 552 A.2d 164, (1988)). \u201c \u2018An agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rule is owed considerable deference because the agency that drafted and promulgated the rule should know the meaning of that rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341-42, 878 A.2d 22 (citing <em>Essex County Bd. of Tax. v. Twp. of Caldwell, </em>21 <em>N.J.Tax </em>188, 197 (App.Div.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">We first emphasize that the DEP had the authority to reconsider its denial of a GP-7 and to settle issues regarding the issuance of a permit. <em>Mutschler v. N.J. Dept. of Envtl. Prot., </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. 1, </em>14, 766 A.2d 285 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>168 <em>N.J. 292, </em>773 A.2d 1156 (2001); <em>Trap Rock Indus., Inc. v. Sagner, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>99, 109, 335 A.2d 574 (App.Div.1975), <em>aff'd, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>599, 355 A.2d 636 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">With that said, based upon our careful review of the record and in light of our standard of review, we conclude that Stahl\u2019s challenge to the DEP\u2019s conclusion that Barresi\u2019s activity was not a \u201cmajor development\u201d is unavailing. A GP-7 specifically governs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>only man-made ditches. Barresi\u2019s activities only involved the ditch on Stahl\u2019s property, not the ice rink on Barresi\u2019s property. Thus, the DEP\u2019s review was limited to the activities in the ditch, not the ice rink. The DEP found that Baressi\u2019s activity in the ditch disturbed less than one acre of land, and did not involve placement of impervious surface on more than one-quarter acre of wetlands. Accordingly, the DEP\u2019s conclusion that Barresi was entitled to issuance of a GP-7 was supported by substantial credible evidence in the record and is not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. We defer to the DEP\u2019s expertise and experience and the manner in which it interpreted the applicable statutes and regulations, including its interpretation of what constitutes a \u201cmajor development.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Stahl\u2019s remaining contention that the DEP deprived him of due process is without sufficient merit to warrant further discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E). However, we add the following comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Stahl received notice of the DEP\u2019s intent to settle and was afforded the opportunity to submit an objection, which he did. The DEP obviously considered Stahl\u2019s objection, as it addressed the SMR issue in its April 17, 2007 decision. Stahl was afforded the opportunity to request a hearing on that decision, which he failed to do. Stahl received all the due process to which he was entitled. An adjudicatory hearing on his objection was not required. <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Statewide Gen. Permits, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>452, 456, 888 A.2d 441 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-12\"><em> N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-1 to-30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-9\"> The DEP subsequently rescinded the second violation notice.

That new regulation clarifies the definition of a \"major development\u201d for an individual permit, not a general permit. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
