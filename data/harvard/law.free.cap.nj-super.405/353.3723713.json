To assure that the community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>spouse will be able to meet his or her own needs, a portion of the couple\u2019s assets is reserved for the community spouse\u2019s benefit. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">To determine this amount, called the \u201ccommunity spouse resource allowance\u201d (CSRA), the total of all of the couple\u2019s assets, whether owned jointly or separately, is calculated as of the date of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s institutionalization. 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(c)(l)(A)(i). One half of this total is then allocated to each spouse. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(c)(l)(A)(ii).

We conclude that under an amendment to the federal Medicaid statutes contained in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, 120 <em>Stat. </em>4, such an annuity may now be considered in determining Medicaid eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The appellant, N.M., entered King Manor Care Center, a nursing home, as a private pay patient in December 2004. N.M.\u2019s husband, A.M., remained in the couple\u2019s marital residence in Oceanport, New Jersey. When N.M. entered the nursing home, she and A.M. had bank accounts and other investments with a total value of $311,051.83.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">On July 5, 2006, an application was made on N.M.\u2019s behalf for Medicaid Only eligibility, effective July 1, 2006. Two weeks before this application, A.M. used $131,500 of the couple\u2019s assets to purchase a commercial annuity, under which he is entitled to receive monthly payments of $2,917 for forty-eight months. A.M. is the sole beneficiary of this annuity, which is non-assignable and nontransferable. However, if A.M. dies before all the payments are made, the State will become the remainder beneficiary to the extent of any Medicaid benefits paid on N.M.\u2019s behalf and the balance of the annuity will be payable to A.M.\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Respondent Monmouth County Board of Social Services (Board) denied N.M.\u2019s application for Medicaid Only benefits on the ground that she and A.M. had \u201cavailable resources\u201d that exceeded the maximum amount allowed for eligibility. In making this determination, the Board took into account the value of the income stream irom the annuity purchased by A.M. The Board found that N.M.\u2019s and A.M.\u2019s countable resources at the time of the application, including the value of the income stream from the annuity, totaled $194,818, and that after deducting the $99,540 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>CSRA protected for A.M. as the \u201ccommunity spouse\u201d and the $2,000 an applicant is permitted to retain, the couple still had $93,278.16 in resources that needed to be spent down before N.M. would become eligible for Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">N.M. appealed the denial of her application to the respondent Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (Division), which referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Law. A contested case hearing was conducted before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at which it was stipulated that \u201cthe income stream of the annuity [purchased by A.M.] can be sold ... on the secondary market.\u201d The parties also stipulated that, in addition to the $2,917 monthly payment A.M. received from the commercial annuity, A.M. received $4,068 from a government pension, $707 from social security, $192 in veteran\u2019s benefits and $68 in other income. Thus, A.M.\u2019s monthly income was nearly $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">A representative of the Board testified that the commercial annuity A.M. purchased was treated as an available asset with a value of $90,203 based on an offer by Peachtree Settlement Funding to purchase the income stream from the annuity for that amount. This asset, combined with the parties\u2019 other assets, exceeded the $99,540 CSRA that A.M. could retain while preserving N.M.\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The ALJ concluded in his recommended initial decision that under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), 120 <em>Stat. </em>4, specifically the subsection codified as 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(e)(4), the value of the income stream from the commercial annuity purchased by A.M. can be considered an available resource for the purpose of determining N.M.\u2019s Medicaid eligibility because it can be sold on the open market. He further concluded that A.M. and N.M.\u2019s available resources exceeded the maximum allowed for Medicaid eligibility, and that in the absence of a showing that this annuity income was necessary to meet A.M.\u2019s monthly mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>nance needs, the Board properly denied N.M.\u2019s application for Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The Director of the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services adopted the ALJ\u2019s proposed initial decision and affirmed the Board\u2019s denial of N.M.\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The Medicaid Program established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396 to \u00a7 1396w-1, is a joint federal-state program designed to provide medical assistance to individuals \u201cwhose income and resources are insufficient to meet the cost of necessary medical services.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396. A state\u2019s participation in the Medicaid program is optional. <em>Mistrick v. Div. of Med.

States also considered all of a married couple\u2019s jointly held assets to be resources available to both spouses. <em>See id. </em>at 480, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 967, 151 L.Ed.2d at 944. As a result, when the institutionalized spouse entered a nursing home, all of the couple\u2019s assets, except for assets held individually by the community spouse, had to be spent down to the Medicaid eligibility limits before the institution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>alized spouse would be eligible for Medicaid. <em>See Mistrick, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 169, 712 A.2d 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">However, Congress enacted the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), 102 <em>Stat. </em>754, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1398r-5, the purpose of which was \u201cto end the pauperization of the community spouse by allowing that spouse to protect a sufficient, but not excessive, amount of income and resources to meet his or her own needs while the institutionalized spouse was in a nursing home at Medicaid expense.\u201d <em>Mistrick, supra, 154 N.J. </em>at 170, 712 A.2d 188. \u201cTo achieve this aim, Congress installed a set of intricate and interlocking requirements with which States must comply in allocating a couple\u2019s income and resources.\u201d <em>Blumer, supra, </em>534 <em>US. </em>at 480, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 967, 151 L.Ed.2d at 944.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under those requirements, \u201cno income of the community spouse shall be deemed available to the institutional spouse.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r\u20145(b)(1). However, as previously discussed, any resources of the community spouse that exceed the CSRA are considered available to the institutionalized spouse and must be spent before the institutionalized spouse can become eligible for Medicaid. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Before enactment of the DRA, courts had reached conflicting conclusions as to whether the purchase of a commercial annuity for the benefit of the community spouse was a proper way to spend down resources below the CSRA in order to qualify the institutionalized spouse for Medicaid. In <em>Estate of Gross v. N.D. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>687 <em>N.W.2d </em>460, 466 (N.D.2004), the court held that such an annuity could not be used to spend down resources below the CSRA because \u201cthere was a market for the monthly payments or income stream from the annuity[.]\u201d <em>See also Dempsey v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, </em>756 A.2d 90, 95-96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>(Pa.Commw.Ct.2000); <em>cf. In re Estate of Pladson v. Traill County Soc. Servs., </em>707 N.W.2d 473, 479-81 (N.D.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">On the other hand, in <em>Mertz v. Houstoun, </em>155 F.Supp.2d 415, 426 (E.D.Pa.2001), the court held that \u201c[b]ecause at the time of [the] application [for Medicaid benefits for the institutionalized spouse] neither spouse has an ownership interest in the funds [that were] used to purchase [the] annuity, the funds are not a countable resource in calculating the CSRA.\u201d Based on this reasoning, the court concluded that \u201ca couple may effectively convert countable resources into income of the community spouse which is not countable in determining Medicaid eligibility for the institutionalized spouse by purchasing the irrevocable actuarially sound commercial annuity for the sole benefit of the community spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427. Although the court felt that this conclusion was mandated by the federal statutory provisions that then governed the Medicaid program, it also expressed the view that the ability to convert countable resources into income of the community spouse was contrary to the purposes of the Medicaid program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjA\">It is a loophole apparently discerned by lawyers and exploited by issuers who advertise such annuities as a means to qualify for Medicaid benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">The practice is inconsistent with an apparent purpose of the MCCA and indeed the whole thrust of the Medicaid program which is to provide assistance to those truly in need. It has no doubt frustrated not only the [Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare] but also program administrators in other states.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">It is not the role of the court to compensate for an apparent legislative oversight by effectively rewriting a law to comport with one of the perceived or presumed purposes motivating its enactment. It is for the Congress to determine if and how this loophole should be closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 427.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">This court had followed <em>Mertz </em>before enactment of the DRA and held in two published opinions that the purchase of an irrevocable commercial annuity under which periodic payments of income are made to the community spouse can be used to reduce the community spouse\u2019s resources below the CSRA in order to qualify the institutionalized spouse for Medicaid. <em>Estate of F.K. v. Div. of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 139-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>46, 863 A.2d 1065 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>209, 876 A.2d 283 (2005); <em>A.B. v. Div. of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>460, 465-66, 865 A.2d 701 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>38, 878 A.2d 855 (2005). In <em>F.K., </em>we rejected the Division\u2019s argument that the value of an annuity should be considered a resource in determining the CSRA \u201cbecause it has a market value given that the income stream from the annuity can be sold in exchange for a lump sum payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 863 A.2d 1065. In reaching this conclusion, we noted that \u201cnothing in the record indicates that there is a market for that income stream.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 863 A.2d 1065. Similarly, we noted in <em>A.B. </em>that \u201cDMAHS has produced no evidence that a secondary market exists for the type of commercial annuity involved in this case.\u201d 374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 468, 865 A.2d 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Unlike in <em>F.K </em>and <em>A.B., </em>the Board presented evidence at the hearing on N.M.\u2019s application that the commercial annuity purchased by A.M. had a market value of $90,203. Moreover, N.M. stipulated that \u201cthe income stream of the annuity [A.M. purchased] can be sold ... on the secondary market.\u201d However, we have no need to consider whether such evidence would have required a different result than in <em>F.K. </em>and <em>A.B. </em>even under the governing law before enactment of the DRA because we conclude that the DRA significantly changed prior law.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">By enactment of the DRA, Congress undertook to close loopholes in the federal statutory provisions governing the Medicaid program that had allowed individuals with sufficient assets to pay for their own medical care to qualify for Medicaid, including the type of loophole identified in <em>Mertz. </em>In his statement in support of this proposed law, Senator Grassley, then the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, stated that the DRA \u201ccloses loopholes in current Medicaid law concerning transfer of assets to limit the circumstances under which persons may intentionally shelter assets in order to qualify for Medicaid.\u201d 151 <em>Cong. Rec. </em>S12071. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the House hearings on the proposed law, Representative Cantor stated that the DRA would allow the government \u201cto root out the asset transfer fraud that is going on with many in this country, which essentially allows those who could otherwise afford to pay for their health care services to become wards of the State.\u201d 152 <em>Cong. Rec. </em>H9550. Similarly, another Congressman, Representative Joseph Barton of Texas, stated that enactment of the DRA would \u201cmake it more difficult to hide assets so that wealthy clients can pretend to be poor to qualify for long-term Medicaid coverage in nursing homes.\u201d 152 <em>Cong. Rec. </em>H45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">One new provision of the DRA, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(e)(l), imposes an obligation upon any applicant for Medicaid benefits for \u201clong-term care services\u201d to \u201cdisclose a description of any interest the [applicant] or community spouse has in an annuity ... regardless of whether the annuity is irrevocable or is treated as an asset.\u201d Another provision, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(e)(4), states that \u201c[n]othing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing a State from denying eligibility for medical assistance for an individual based on the income or resources derived from an annuity described in [42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(e)(l) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">There is as yet no reported opinion interpreting 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(e)(4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the Division\u2019s interpretation of this subsection is supported by the position of the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services to which the Secretary of Health and Human Services has delegated responsibility to administer and oversee the Medicaid program. <em>See </em>66 <em>Fed.Reg. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>35487 (July 5, 2001). We have previously noted that \u201cdue to the extraordinary complexity of the Medicaid Act, Congress delegated to the CMS broad authority to define eligibility requirements for Medicaid.\u201d A.B., <em>supra, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 465, 865 A.2d 701; <em>see also Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>34, 43-44, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2633, 2640, 69 L.Ed.2d 460, 469-70 (1981). Consequently, even when not formalized by adoption of an administrative regulation, the CMS\u2019s interpretation of the federal statutes governing the Medicaid program is \u201centitled to respectful consideration and deference.\u201d <em>F.K., supra, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 142, 863 A.2d 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Shortly after enactment of the DRA on February 8, 2006, the CMS issued a publication, dated July 27, 2006, entitled \u201cChanges in Medicaid Annuity Rules Under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005,\u201d which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\"><em>The State may take into consideration the income or resources derived from an annuity when determining eligibility for medical assistance </em>or the extent of the State\u2019s obligations for such assistance. <em>This means that even though an annuity is not penalized as a transfer for less than fair market value it must still be considered in determining eligibility, including spousal income and resources, </em>and in the post-eligibility calculation, as appropriate. In other words, even if an annuity is not subject to penalty under the provisions of the DRA, this does not mean that it is excluded as income or resource.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Thus, the federal agency responsible for interpreting the federal statutes governing the Medicaid program has concluded that under the DRA a \u201cState may take into consideration the income ... derived from an annuity when determining eligibility for [Medicaid].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This is precisely what the Division did in upholding the Board\u2019s denial of N.M.\u2019s application for Medicaid. In view of the deference that state agencies responsible for administering the Medicaid program and courts reviewing their decisions are supposed to extend to the CMS\u2019s interpretation of the federal statutes governing Medicaid, the CMS\u2019s interpretation should be followed unless an adversely affected party can show that this interpretation is clearly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">We recognize that 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(e)(4) is not a model of clarity. Nevertheless, we conclude that its statement that \u201cnoth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>ing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing a State from denying eligibility for medical assistance for an individual based on the income or resources derived from an annuity described in [42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(e)(l) ],\u201d can be reasonably interpreted to authorize a State to consider the value of the income stream from an annuity purchased for the benefit of the community spouse as a countable resource in determining the institutionalized spouse\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid. Therefore, the CMS\u2019s interpretation of this subsection of the DRA is reasonable and should be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">N.M.\u2019s primary argument is that the provisions of the DRA which impose a transfer penalty upon certain specified annuity purchases, <em>see </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(c)(l)(F); 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(c)(l)(G)(ii), constitute the exclusive authorization under the DRA for a State to consider an annuity purchased for the community spouse in determining the institutionalized spouse\u2019s Medicaid eligibility. However, the previously quoted CMS publication specifically rejects this interpretation of the DRA, noting that \u201ceven though an annuity is not penalized as a transfer for less than fair market value ..., it must still be considered in determining eligibility, including spousal ... resources.\u201d CMS, Enclosure to State Medicaid Director Letter No. 06-018 p. 12 (2006). Thus, the Division\u2019s determination that N.M. is ineligible for Medicaid was not a \u201cpenalty\u201d for A.M. transferring a substantial portion of the couple\u2019s assets into an annuity. It was simply a determination that the couple had too many resources for N.M. to meet the requisite level of need for Medicaid eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Moreover, although the annuity purchased by A.M. states that it is non-assignable, another publication issued by the CMS, dated August 6, 2007, entitled \u201cClarification\u201d of the previously quoted July 27, 2006 publication \u201cConcerning Treatment of Annuities Under Deficit Reduction Act of 2005,\u201d states that \u201c[i]f the ... payee [of an annuity] may be changed, it means the annuity is \u2018assignable,\u2019 which in turn means the annuity can be sold on the secondary market. In [such a] ease, an annuity ... is a countable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>resource.\u201d CMS, State Agency Regional Bulletin No.2007-09 p. 1 (2007). N.M. stipulated that \u201cthe income stream of the annuity [purchased for A.M.\u2019s benefit] can be sold by [A.M.] on the secondary market.\u201d Consequently, this annuity is considered assignable under the August 6, 2007 CMS publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">N.M. relies upon <em>James v. Richman, </em>465 F.Supp.2d 395 (M.D.Pa.2006), <em>aff'd, </em>547 F.3d 214 (3d Cir.2008), which held that an annuity purchased by a community spouse could not be considered an available resource in determining the institutionalized spouse\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid. However, the application for Medicaid benefits involved in <em>James </em>was made on September 20, 2005, 547 F.3d at 216, which was before the February 8, 2006 effective date of the DRA. Thus, <em>James </em>was controlled by the statutory provisions that governed Medicaid before enactment of the DRA. For that reason, neither the district court nor the court of appeals even cited 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(e)(4) or the July 27, 2006 and August 6, 2007 CMS publications dealing with the treatment of annuities purchased on behalf of the community spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In sum, we conclude that under the DRA a state may now consider the value of an annuity purchased for the sole benefit of the community spouse in determining whether the institutionalized spouse satisfies the resource limits for Medicaid eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">At the hearing on N.M.\u2019s application for Medicaid, the Board presented evidence that Peachtree Settlement Funding had offered to pay a $90,203 lump sum in exchange for the payments remaining on the annuity purchased by A.M. Under the DRA, this sum, combined with A.M.\u2019s other countable resources, exceeded the CSRA that governed the determination of the resource limit for Medicaid eligibility during 2006 when N.M. applied for benefits. Therefore, the Division properly denied N.M.\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-14\"> To be eligible for Medicaid, an applicant must satisfy both \u201cresource\u2019\u2019 and \"income\u201d eligibility limits. <em>See </em>42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 435.845 (resource eligibility); 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 435.831 (income eligibility). Although the community spouse\u2019s resources must be taken into account in determining whether the institutionalized spouse satisfies the resource eligibility limit, the community spouse\u2019s income may not be considered in determining whether the institutionalized spouse satisfies the income eligibility limit. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(b)(l). The income eligibility limit is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\"> The community spouse is entitled to a higher CSRA if he or she can show that a greater amount is required to realize the community spouse\u2019s \u201cmaximum monthly maintenance needs allowance.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(e)(2)(B). This potential adjustment of the CSRA is not implicated in the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\"> The transcript of this hearing was lost. Pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:5-3(f), the parties have entered into a stipulation of proceedings in lieu of transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> Congress later repealed MCCA through the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989, 103 <em>Stat. </em>1979, but the spousal impoverishment prevention provisions were retained at 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\"> A recently issued memorandum opinion of a federal district court reaches a conclusion contrary to the conclusion reached in this opinion. <em>Weatherbee v.

Therefore, it is not precedential, <em>R. </em>1:36-3, and for that reason is not discussed in this opinion. We only note that the federal district court opinion does not refer to the CMS publications discussed in this and the next six paragraphs of our opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
