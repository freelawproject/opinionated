A penalty of a ten-day suspension without pay was imposed upon Gonzalez as the result of this infraction. On appeal, Gonzalez argues that the Commissions\u2019 Media Policy is facially unconstitutional, and that the discipline imposed on him, based upon that policy, was unlawful.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gonzalez, the President of the Detectives Endowment Association, Inc., P.B.A Local 195, argues additionally that his conduct constituted protected union activity for which he could not be disciplined.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Our recitation of the facts of this matter is based upon the record of an administrative hearing conducted by a New York Administrative Law Judge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> following the service of charges upon Gonzalez, at which Jon S. Deutsch, General Counsel for the Commission, and Gonzalez gave testimony. The record discloses that Gonzalez, hired as a detective by the Commission eight years earlier, had from the outset of his employment been active in the union, occupying the positions of recording secretary, vice-president and, since 2005, president.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The record suggests that, when hired, Gonzalez was informed of the Commission\u2019s media policy, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">The Employees\u2019 Manual places the responsibility for handling \u201cpublic relations\u201d in the Office of the Executive Director. Accordingly, all contact with the media (including but not limited to the press, television and radio) will be conducted under the supervision of the Executive Director. It is the policy of the Commission that any information released to the media be accurate, be in the public interest and not compromise the agency or any investigation. To ensure the above, the following guidelines will be followed by all members of the staff:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u00edfc -I* <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">2. No staff member shall initiate contact with the media without prior approval of the Executive Director.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Deutsch explained the reason for the policy in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">The main reason is that one voice must speak for the Commission. Additionally, there are numerous divisions, as I stated, within the Commission. Unfortunately, the Chief of Police, for example, may not know, he may want to speak about something, but he may not know that the Director of Licensing is working on something which also affects that investigation. So, bottom line, it\u2019s everybody being on the same page. And, unfortunately, many times each director is not aware of what someone else may be doing within the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Deutsch testified further that \u201cthere are no exceptions\u201d to the written policy, but he acknowledged that an employee could offer a private opinion to the media regarding the performance of the Yankees and, perhaps, the Mets without invoking discipline. He later testified that whether a violation of the policy had occurred was a fact-sensitive matter, and both the content of the communication and whether the person making the communication identified himself as a Waterfront Commission employee were significant factors in determining whether a violation had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">Throughout his employment, Gonzalez worked at offices located at 117 Tyler Street, Port Newark that were owned by the City of Newark, leased to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and subleased to the Commission. Although Deutsch testified that the building was \u201chabitable,\u201d it was not a \u201cnice work place,\u201d and he was aware of complaints of rats in and around the premises. As a consequence of the building\u2019s failings, extended negotiations between the Port Authority and the Commission had taken place with the aim of leasing a more appropriate office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>location. The existing building housed both the Commission\u2019s Police Division and its Licensing Division, which also served as an employee information center for longshoremen. According to Deutseh, the location \u201cis pretty much a walk-up building\u201d where longshoremen, stevedores and hiring agents come with questions. Gonzalez confirmed that the public came in and out of the building, and would be exposed to any hazards that were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Approximately three years earlier, the Commission had removed a gasoline fuel tank from the parking lot in an area immediately adjacent to property owned by P &amp; 0 Ports. The tank had been installed by the Commission for the use of Commission employees. Upon removal, a black sludge-like material started seeping into the hole where the tank had been located, raising pollution concerns. The Commission\u2019s environmental consultants advised that the Commission should safely dispose of the dirt that had been in the hole and that the hole should be filled with clean material. The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) was advised of the sludge, but testing disclosed only trace amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The testing thus established that the tank had not leaked, but did not address the possible presence of other toxins in the sludge and excavated soil.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Deutseh testified that the Commission had not notified its employees of the sludge contamination but, eventually, problems with the soil had become common knowledge. Because a longstanding dispute between the Commission and the Port Authority existed regarding which entity would dispose of the excavated soil, the dirt pile had remained on site for almost three years. The soil removal issue was a component of the Commission\u2019s ongoing lease negotiations with the Port Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Gonzalez testified that shortly after he assumed the position of union president, Commission employees commenced contacting him regarding the condition of the Tyler Street building. During the summer of 2005, complaints regarding the dirt pile and the presence of rats in the pile also were made. Photographs, introduced at the hearing, depicted three dead rats on or near the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>pile\u2014a circumstance that led to Gonzalez\u2019s and fellow employees\u2019 concern that toxic substances in the dirt pile had led to the rats\u2019 death.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">At some point, Gonzalez wrote a letter to the Commission\u2019s Chief of Police, Brian Smith, to complain about the rats on behalf of his union members. On September 20, 2005, Gonzalez contacted union counsel, Michael Bukosky, for his advice as to how the union could protect its members from health hazards arising from conditions within the Tyler Street building and from the dirt pile. On September 27, 2005, Bukosky wrote to Deutsch, reporting that the building\u2019s main hall was littered with bird feces and that a Port Authority maintenance employee who had inspected the bathrooms had stated that they were contaminated with E. coli bacteria. Additionally Bukosky noted the removal of what he , termed a \u201cgas pump,\u201d and he stated: \u201cThe removers of the gas pump told PBA unit members that the excavated dirt was toxic and would have to be carted away by a specialized environmental company.\u201d Bukosky demanded that the Commission relocate the employees and/or \u201cimmediately ameliorate the hazardous conditions.\u201d Deutsch responded in a letter, dated November 16, 2005, stating that laboratory tests had been negative for E. coli and that an analysis of the soil was negative for the presence of VOCs.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Gonzalez testified that he was not satisfied with Deutsch\u2019s response. As a consequence, he directed Bukosky to request copies of the laboratory analyses, which Bukosky did by letter of November 30, 2005. On January 30, 2006, the results of the E. coli testing, only, were faxed to Bukosky. Because the response was incomplete, on March 30, 2006, Bukosky again requested a copy of the soil analysis. No response to his letter was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Gonzalez\u2019s suspicions were aroused by the Commission\u2019s failure to produce the requested soil analysis. As a consequence, Gonzalez contacted the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), but was informed that it did not have regulatory authority over bi-state agencies. He contacted the DEP, and he was given an identifying number for his complaint, but no invest\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>gation occurred.- Additionally, Gonzalez contacted the Newark Board of Health regarding the rat problem, without success.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Having failed to obtain a regulatory response, in early September 2006, Gonzalez contacted NBC-TV\u2019s Brian Thompson, identifying himself as the PBA\u2019s president, because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want Mr. Thompson to think that [he] was calling him as an employee of the Commission, as a Detective.\u201d Gonzalez testified that he knew what he was doing was \u201crelated to the press,\u201d so he \u201cdidn\u2019t want anybody thinking that [he] was representing the Commission in any way. [He] was representing [his] members, and not the Commission.\u201d Although Gonzalez contacted Thompson on behalf of his union\u2019s members, he confirmed at the hearing that the health and safety issues that he reported \u201cabsolutely\u201d affected the general public and other waterfront workers who visited the site or worked in areas near the dirt pile, including employees of neighboring P &amp; O Ports.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Thompson expressed interest in the matter and, on September 6, 2006, he appeared at the Tyler Street location with a cameraman. Nothing was ever aired as a result of the visit. However, the dirt pile was removed within a week, although Deutsch testified that the removal was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d the result of the press attention. Gonzalez had not obtained authorization from Executive Director DeMaria to contact the press, and DeMaria was \u201cshocked\u201d when the reporter appeared at the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">By letter dated February 27, 2007, Gonzalez was informed of the charges against him, and of a hearing to be conducted concerning the charges, at which time the hearing officer would consider whether he violated the Collective Bargaining Agreement by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">engaging] in conduct, in your public or private life, which is incompatible or creates the appearance of being incompatible or detrimental to your primary responsibility of rendering unbiased and efficient service as a member of a governmental agency by violating the <em>Media and Public Relations Policy of the Waterfront Commission, </em>in that: on or about September 3, 2006, you initiated contact with the media, without prior approval of the Executive Director.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>In a written opinion issued following the hearing, the presiding administrative law judge concluded that the Commission had presented clear and convincing evidence that Gonzalez had violated the Commission\u2019s media policy, and he recommended a five-day suspension, without pay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Gonzalez took the position at the hearing that his conduct was protected by the First Amendment, the judge did not address that issue, determining that he lacked the authority to decide constitutional matters. The Commission<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> affirmed the judge\u2019s factual conclusions, but increased the discipline to ten days without pay and stated in its decision that forfeiture of a portion of annual leave in lieu of the suspension would not be permitted. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">On appeal, Gonzalez argues that the Commission\u2019s media policy is overbroad and, consequently, facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment. He also argues that it cannot constitutionally be utilized as a basis for disciplining him under the circumstances of this case. The Commission essentially side-steps Gonzalez\u2019 facial constitutional challenge and argues that, because Gonzalez was not speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern, his speech was not constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal from a final decision of a bi-state agency. <em>See R. </em>2:2-3; <em>Port Auth.

Nonetheless,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">it cannot be gainsaid that the State has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.

In balancing employee and employer interests in this context, courts must consider not only the content of the speech, but also the \u201cmanner, time, and place in which it is delivered.\u201d <em>Connick, supra, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>at 152, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1693, 75 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 723; <em>Givhan v.

Courts have determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>that, under the <em>Pickering/National Treasury Employees </em>test, \u201cthe distinction between facial and as-applied constitutional challenges becomes unimportant.\u201d <em>Harman v. City of New York, </em>140 F.3d 111, 118 (2d Cir.1998) (citing <em>Sanjour v. Envtl. Protect. Agency, </em>56 F.3d 85, 92 (D.C.Cir.1995)); <em>see also Davis v. N.J. Dept. of Law and Public Safety, Div. of State Police, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>59, 71 n. 7, 742 A.2d 619 (Law Div.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The Court has held, in the context of a challenge based on overbreadth, that: \u201cIt has long been recognized that the First Amendment needs breathing space and that statutes attempting to restrict or burden the exercise of First Amendment rights must be narrowly drawn and represent a considered legislative judgment that a particular mode of expression has to give way to other compelling needs of society.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 <em>U.S. </em>601, 611-12, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2908, 2915, 37 L.Ed.2d 830, 839-40 (1973). In <em>Broadrick, </em>the Court recognized that claims of facial overbreadth \u201chave been entertained in cases involving statutes which, by their terms, seek to regulate \u2018only spoken words.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2916, 37 L.Ed.2d at 840.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">In such cases, it has been the judgment of this Court that the possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that protected speech of others may be muted and perceived grievances left to fester because of the possible inhibitory effects of overly broad statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\n<em>[Ibid.}</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">As a result, enforcement of an overbroad statute or regulation is \u201ctotally forbidden until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalidation so narrows it as to remove the seeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2916, 37 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 840-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">This principle was applied in New Jersey, in the factually analogous case of <em>Davis, supra, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>59, 742 A.2d 619. In that case, Judge Parillo preliminarily enjoined enforcement of a State Police regulation mandating clearance and pre-approval of contacts by State Police members with the media, accepting the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the regulation constituted an uneonstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>tional prior restraint on employees who wished to speak in their private capacities about non-confidential matters of public concern. In that opinion, the judge recognized that government \u201cmay impose restraints on the job-related speech of public employees that would be plainly unconstitutional if applied to the public at large.\u201d 327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 70, 742 A.2d 619 (quoting <em>Nat'l Treasury Employees, supra, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>at 465, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1012, 130 L.Ed.2d at 978-79). However, he cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">In the exercise of such governmental authority, vigilance is necessary to ensure that public employers do not use their power over employees to silence discourse, \u201cnot because it hampers public functions but simply because superiors disagree with the content of employees\u2019 speech.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Harman, supra, </em>140 F.3d at 119.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">In granting the injunction, Judge Parillo noted that the policy at issue failed to include \u201cnarrow, objective and definite standards\u201d by which consent to speak would be governed. <em>Id. </em>at 77, 742 A.2d 619 (quoting <em>Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, </em>394 <em>U.S. </em>147, 150-51, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>935, 938, 22 L.Ed.2d 162, 167 (1969)). As a consequence, unbridled discretion was placed in the hands of a governmental official, raising the possibility of content and viewpoint censorship and also permitting the agency to control the timing of employee speech. <em>Id. </em>at 77-78, 742 A.2d 619. The judge recognized: \u201cRegulations ... which condition the exercise of speech rights on the prior permission of a government official, constitute a prior restraint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 742 A.2d 619 (quoting <em>Fire Fighters Assoc., District of Columbia v. Barry, </em>742 <em>F.Supp. </em>1182, 1194 (D.D.C.1990)). And the judge noted a substantial number of decisions invalidating such regulations on First Amendment grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 79, 742 A.2d 619.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>We view the Commission\u2019s media policy, prohibiting employee contact with the media without the prior approval of the Commission\u2019s Executive Director, as functionally indistinguishable from those regulations invalidated on First Amendment grounds in the eases that we have just cited. In this instance, as in the decisions upon which we rely, the regulation acts as a prior restraint that is overbroad in its scope, potentially acting to dull comment by Commission employees, rendered in a private capacity, about non-confidential matters of public concern. Accordingly, we find the regulation to be unconstitutional on its face. As we will discuss more fully, as follows, the Commission has failed to meet the heavy burden of justification imposed upon it by <em>Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The record in this matter provides a clear illustration of the regulation\u2019s overbreadth. The matters upon which Gonzalez spoke\u2014the potential toxicity of the dirt pile and the presence of dead rats on it\u2014while of particular concern to Gonzalez and his unionized co-employees, were also matters of public concern. The record reflects Deutsch\u2019s concession that the Commission\u2019s offices, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>located adjacent to the dirt pile, could be characterized as a \u201cwalk-up building\u201d frequented by longshoremen, stevedores and hiring agents as well as Commission employees. Additional port facilities, operated by P &amp; 0 Ports, were in close proximity to the dirt pile. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the hazardous conditions created by the allegedly contaminated soil and the presence of live and dead rats in the area surrounding the dirt pile were of interest and concern to the public and Commission employees alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Thus, it is clear to us that Gonzalez did not speak just \u201cas an employee upon matters only of personal interest\u201d but rather as a citizen on a matter of public concern. <em>Natn\u2019l Treasury Employees, supra, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>at 466, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1013, 130 L.Ed.2d at 979 (quoting <em>Connick, supra, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>at 147, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1690, 75 L.Ed.2d at 720). That Gonzalez possessed a personal stake in the removal of the contamination does not render the issues raised any less substantial. <em>Davis, supra, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 74, 742 A.2d 619 (citing <em>Rode v. Dellarciprete, </em>845 F.2d 1195, 1202 (3d Cir.1988)). NBC-TV\u2019s interest in Gonazlez\u2019s story provides additional, but not dispositive, confirmation of the appropriate nature of our characterization. <em>Abad v. City of Marathon, Fla., </em>472 F.Supp.2d 1374, 1380 (S.D.Fla.2007) (noting that newspaper\u2019s determination to print firefighter\u2019s comments regarding quality of service provided further proof that the comments concerned matters of public interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Even if the Commission possessed studies demonstrating that the dirt at issue did not contain excess VOCs, those studies had not been disclosed, despite Gonzalez\u2019s determined efforts to obtain disclosure. Moreover, even if they had been disclosed, the studies did not address the potential presence of other toxic contaminants. Further, Gonzalez\u2019s additional concern regarding the presence of live and dead rats in the vicinity of the dirt pile remained unaddressed. As the court recognized in <em>Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Firefighters Local 3233 v. Frenchtown Charter Twp., </em>246 F.Supp.2d 734, 738 (E.D.Mich.2003), a potential violation of state occupational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>health and safety laws is \u201cof special public concern because it deals with a public agency\u2019s actions in accordance with the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Courts have concluded that a public employer has legitimate concerns regarding unauthorized employee communications with the press based upon interests such as: \u201c(1) the need to maintain discipline or harmony among co-workers; (2) the need for confidentiality; (3) the need to limit conduct that impedes the public employee\u2019s proper and competent performance of his duties; and (4) the need to encourage close and personal relationships between employees and their superiors.\u201d <em>Hall v. Mayor and Director of Public Safety in the Twp. of Pennsauken, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>229, 232, 422 A.2d 797 (App.Div.1980); <em>see also Pickering, supra, </em>391 <em>U.S. </em>at 568-73, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1734-37, 20 L.Ed.2d at 817-19 (listing as relevant factors confidentiality, the maintenance of discipline by immediate superiors, the preservation of co-worker harmony, the fostering of loyalty and confidence when necessary to the proper functioning of a particular working relationship, the promotion of efficiency in governmental operations, and the ability of the government to rebut false statements made by its employees without undue difficulty).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In its brief on appeal, the Commission asserts that its interest in \u201chaving one voice speak for it on waterfront matters to protect employee\u2019s security and the confidentiality of its investigations\u201d outweighs any interest Gonzalez may have had in expressing his concerns. However, we are satisfied that Gonzalez\u2019s conduct did nothing to jeopardize that interest. Although he exposed a potentially dangerous condition for which the Commission sought to hold the Port Authority responsible, there is nothing in the record that would suggest that Gonzalez\u2019s actions in any manner adversely affected ongoing negotiations between the parties. In this circumstance, we conclude that the Commission has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating a governmental interest in nondisclosure that would overcome Gonzalez\u2019s First Amendment rights, let alone the heavier burden imposed by <em>Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees. </em>We have not been informed of other cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>cumstances in which the Commission\u2019s media policy has been utilized to deter protected speech or utilized, unconstitutionally, as a basis for discipline. Nonetheless, we are mindful that health, safety and other concerns may form legitimate subjects of public interest upon which Commission employees have a right to comment in their private capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We therefore conclude that the media policy at issue is over-broad, and thus unconstitutional on its face. We conclude, as well, that the policy was unconstitutionally applied in this case to sanction Gonzalez\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In light of our resolution of the constitutional issues raised by Gonzalez, we need not address his argument that his media contact constituted protected union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The Commission\u2019s Media and Public Relations Policy is declared unconstitutional as overbroad insofar as it provides that \u201c[n]o staff member shall initiate contact with the media without prior approval of the Executive Director\u201d without providing \u201cnarrow, objective and definite standards\u201d as to the scope of the prohibition. <em>See Davis, supra, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 77, 742 A.2d 619. Additionally, the disciplinary sanction imposed on Ariel Gonzalez is vacated, and reimbursement of forfeited pay, with interest, is awarded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-17\"> The Commission\u2019s statutory mission is to investigate, deter, combat, and remedy criminal activity and influence in the Port of New York and New Jersey. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>See N.J.S.A. </em>32:23-2.

In doing so, the judge balanced Gonzalez\u2019s right to engage in arguably protected activity against the Commission's operational justification for its policy. He found that the Commission\u2019s interest in having one voice speak for it on waterfront matters, in order to protect employees\u2019 security and the confidentiality of its investigations, outweighed Gonzalez\u2019s interest in being able to contact the media to air a grievance, especially when alternate contractual and administrative avenues for relief existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b371-10\"> The decision was made by New York Commissioner Michael Axelrod.
