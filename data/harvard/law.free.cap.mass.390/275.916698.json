See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (7), as appearing in St. 1978, c. 553, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The facts are summarized as follows. The plaintiffs (tenants) leased residential property from the defendant (lessor) from June 1, 1978, to May 31, 1979.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The tenants gave the lessor a security deposit of $500 and the first month\u2019s rent of $350. No statement of the condition of the premises was given to the tenants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (2) (c). After giving the lessor proper notice of the termination of their tenancy, the plaintiffs vacated the premises. After the tenants had vacated the premises, the lessor inspected the premises and decided that she was entitled to retain the security deposit for damage allegedly caused by the plaintiffs in excess of ordinary wear and tear. A letter was sent by the lessor to the tenants, setting forth the damage to the premises and the cost of repairs, estimated at $580.49.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The tenants disputed the lessor\u2019s allegations of damages and filed a civil action in the Housing Court, seeking treble damages, costs, interest, and attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (7), for wrongful conversion of their security deposit. The lessor counterclaimed for damages in the amount in excess of the security deposit, $55.49.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The Housing Court judge found that the damage to the premises attributable to the plaintiffs amounted to $311.44. Ruling that the tenants were entitled to a balance of $213.56 from the security deposit, the judge entered judgment for the plaintiffs and ordered double damages in the amount of $427.12, plus interest of $31.62 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The lessor made a motion to have the judgment reduced to actual damages in the absence of any bad faith on her part. The tenants moved for treble damages. Relying on <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 931 (1980), the judge concluded that the amendment of \u00a7 15B (7) by St. 1977, c. 979, increasing damages from double to treble damages, applied to any security deposit being held on and after September 1,1978. He rejected the lessor\u2019s contention that multiple damages applied only to situations where there were findings of bad faith on the part of the landlord. Accordingly, the judge amended judgment for the plaintiffs by trebling the damages to the amount of $640.68. The amount of interest on the security deposit remained the same. The judge also ordered interest on the judgment to be added to the damages, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, and costs and attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $750. The lessor appealed the decision of the judge, which the Appeals Court affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Mellor </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 983, 984 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Subsequently, the tenants filed a motion seeking an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs arising out of the appeal. The lessor filed a motion for relief from judgment, claiming that multiple damages could not be awarded absent a finding of bad faith. The basis of her motion is a decision of this court, <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, </em>386 Mass. 74 (1982), decided subsequent to the decision by the Appeals Court. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 828 (1974). On these motions, because of the frequency of cases involving retention of security deposits, the judge reported questions of law to the Appeals Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mass. R. A. P. 5, as appearing in 378 Mass. 924 (1979). We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We turn to the reported questions. The answer to the first question, i.e., the applicability of the multiple damages provisions of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (7), regardless of the lessor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>good faith belief for retaining all or a portion of a security deposit, is largely dispositive of the questions reported. We conclude that, under the statutory provisions, an award of treble damages for improper retention of all or part of a security deposit is not conditional on a finding of bad faith or wilful violations by the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The pertinent language, found in G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (7), states that if the lessor violates certain provisions,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> including a provision requiring a lessor to return a security deposit or the balance to which the tenant is entitled, plus interest, within thirty days after termination of the tenancy, \u201cthe tenant shall be awarded damages in an amount equal to three times the amount of such security deposit or balance thereof to which the tenant is entitled plus interest at the rate of five per cent from the date when suph payment became due, together with court costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d We have already indicated our view that the statute, as written, is unambiguous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cThe statute is unambiguous. \u2018The language employed is neither peculiar nor technical, but is comprised rather of familiar words commonly combined to express, as they do here, a simple thought. Thus we construe the statute according to the common and approved use of this language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jason </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>387 Mass. 21, 24 (1982), quoting <em>New England Medical Center Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>381 Mass. 748, 750 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>388 Mass. 115, 120 (1983); <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number><em>Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 585 (1981). The plain language of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (7), indicates that the application of the multiple damages provision is not conditional on a finding of bad faith on the part of a lessor committing one of the specified violations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Ordinarily, where the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, our analysis would not look beyond the language to other sources. See <em>New England Medical Center Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 749-750; <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). The defendant argues, however, that the construction of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (7), has been brought into question by our recent decision, <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, supra. </em>That case involved a landlord found to have made deductions for unpaid rent from the tenants\u2019 security deposit in bad faith in violation of (1) G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B, (2) City of Boston Code, Ordinances, Title 10, c. 3, \u00a7 109 (1975), and (3) G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, supra </em>at 83. There, we found no error in the judge\u2019s conclusion of violations by the landlord but declined to allow the cumulation of multiple damages. <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, supra </em>at 85-86. In discussing the damages for the violation of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B, we said, \u201cAt a minimum, a landlord must have a reasonable, good faith belief that it is entitled to an amount deducted as \u2018unpaid rent\u2019 under \u00a7 15B.\u201d <em>McGrath, supra </em>at 80. Going on to address the permitted deduction for \u201cunpaid rent,\u201d we stated that the statute is \u201cclear that it was not intended to permit a deduction of \u2018rent\u2019 by a landlord who knew or should have known it was improper. There is support in the record for the judge\u2019s finding that the landlord here acted in bad faith in deducting the $135 figure for rent owed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>and that this conduct violated the provisions of \u00a7 15B.\u201d <em>McGrath, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Although the <em>McGrath </em>case involved the improper retention of a portion of a security deposit for unpaid rent, pursuant to G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (4) <em>(i), </em>and the instant case involves retention of all of a security deposit for damages to the leased premises, pursuant to G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (4) <em>(iii), </em>the defendant contends that a finding of bad faith is necessary here because the statute, applied in <em>McGrath, </em>provides for multiple damages for both types of improper withholding. See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (6) <em>(e) </em>and (7). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The discussion of a requirement of \u201cbad faith\u201d and multiple damages pursuant to G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (7), in <em>McGrath </em>was, at most, dictum. If deleted from the opinion, it would not change the outcome. The landlord in that case had been found to be in bad faith, and the court concluded that such a finding was warranted. <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, </em>386 Mass. 74, 80 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The general rule of statutory construction is that \u201ca statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature . . . considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975), quoting <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, 367 </em>Mass. 360, 364 (1975). Even were we to assume the statute to be ambiguous, the legislative intent and history of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B, refutes the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Where the Legislature has indicated its displeasure with described acts, has sought to deter their commission, and has encouraged vindicative lawsuits if wrongdoing is not stemmed, the imposition of multiple fines and penalties for a violation of statutory requirements is appropriate. <em>Hampshire Village Assocs. </em>v. <em>District Court of Hampshire, </em>381 Mass. 148, 151-152, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Ruhlander </em>v. <em>District Court of Hampshire, </em>449 U.S. 1062 (1980). Furthermore, the Legislature has the authority to provide for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the recovery of such multiple damages in cases involving \u201cconduct that it regards as particularly reprehensible.\u201d <em>Hampshire Village Assocs. </em>v. <em>District Court of Hampshire, supra </em>at 153, quoting <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Normet, </em>405 U.S. 56, 77 (1972). By enacting G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B, to limit the freedom of lessors and tenants to contract with regard to the rights and duties of the parties so far as security deposits are concerned, \u201cthe Legislature manifested a concern for the welfare of tenants in residential property who, as a practical matter, are generally in inferior bargaining positions and find traditional avenues of redress relatively useless; i.e., the legal expense of chasing a security deposit would be more than the amount of the deposit.\u201d <em>Goes </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 91 (1979). See <em>Hampshire Village Assocs. </em>v. <em>District Court of Hampshire, supra </em>at 152-153.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In 1969, \u00a7 15B merely stated that a lessor might not require a security deposit in an amount in excess of two months\u2019 rent. St. 1969, c. 244, \u00a7 1. One year later the Legislature added a penalty of double damages for the wilful withholding of a tenant\u2019s security deposit. St. 1970, c. 666, \u00a7 1. The requirement in the multiple damages provision of a wilful violation was deleted by the Legislature in 1972 and has remained omitted despite substantial changes in the form of the legislative controls on security deposits. See St. 1972, c. 639, \u00a7 1; St. 1977, c. 979, \u00a7 1; St. 1978, c. 553, \u00a7 1. The deletion of the requirement of a finding of bad faith was not accidental. Specific proposals presented to the Legislature in 1972 illustrate this point. 1972 House Doc. Nos. 248, 1676, and 3122 before the Legislature contained provisions retaining the \u201cbad faith\u201d requirement for damages for improper retention of security deposits. The Legislature declined to adopt these proposed changes to \u00a7 15B.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The legislative history of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B conclusively shows that the Legislature intends any violation of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7\u00a7 15B (6) <em>(a), (d), </em>and <em>(e), </em>to result in the imposition of treble damages. It is not for this court to judge the wisdom of legislation or to seek to rewrite the clear intention expressed by the statute. See <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>342 Mass. 222, 227 (1961). A finding of good faith, therefore, is not a basis for an exception to the multiple damages provision of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (7). The trial judge correctly applied the statute. The answer to the first reported question is, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">We go on to consider the question of attorney\u2019s fees accrued in defending this appeal. There is no question that G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (7), authorized the trial judge to award attorney\u2019s fees originally incurred at trial to the tenants. See <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., 378 </em>Mass. 758, 763-764 (1979). We turn now to the question of an award by the judge of additional attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending the appeal in a G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B, action, the Appeals Court having remained silent on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In another landlord-tenant case involving similar multiple damages provisions for interference with a tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of residential property, G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, we authorized attorney\u2019s fees attributable to an appeal to be awarded by the trial judge on remand. <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 765. General Laws c. 186, \u00a7 15B, like \u00a7 14, is silent as to the award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees. General Laws c. 261, \u00a7 22, authorizes the allowance of costs of appeal in civil actions. See also Mass. R. A. P. 26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>(a), as amended, 378 Mass. 925 (1979). General Laws c. 261, \u00a7 22, however, permits only the court or justice before whom such appeal is heard to allow the costs of the appeal to be awarded. Here, the Appeals Court was silent on the issue of both appellate attorney\u2019s fees and appellate costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Neither appellate costs nor attorney\u2019s fees for the appeal can be imposed by a trial court absent authorization by an appellate court or by virtue of a rule or statute. Mass. R. A. P. 26 (a). We, therefore, conclude that, in the absence of a directive by the Appeals Court, the Housing Court did not have the authority to award appellate attorney\u2019s fees. A litigant must bear his own expenses except when the burden is mitigated by a statute. See <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co., </em>318 Mass. 238, 241 (1945). While G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (7), provides for the award of attorney\u2019s fees, that award must be limited to trial proceedings in circumstances where the Appeals Court has not directed otherwise. Cf. <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Here, the issue has been presented in a report of questions. We conclude it would be inappropriate to assess additional attorney\u2019s fees on a matter of public concern reported by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">We answer the first question, \u201cYes.\u201d Questions 2, 3, and 4 require no answer in light of our response to question number 1. Question 5 is answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The case is remanded to the Housing Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-5\"> The premises in question constitute a town house at 35 Mattoon Street, Springfield.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\"> As G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (2) (c), requiring a statement of condition, took effect September 1, 1978, the trial judge concluded that the requirement of a statement of condition was not applicable to the plaintiffs\u2019 tenancy. See St. 1978, c. 553, \u00a7 3; St. 1977, c. 979, \u00a7 4. Cf. <em>Jason </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>387 Mass. 21, 23-24 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In his report of questions of law, pursuant to Mass. R. A. P. 5, as appearing in 378 Mass. 924 (1979), the judge found that the lessor had given proper notice. General Laws c. 186, \u00a7 15B (4) <em>(in), </em>as appearing in St. 1978, c. 553, states that if a deduction from the security deposit is made \u201cthe lessor shall provide to the tenant within such thirty days an itemized list of damages, <em>sworn to by the lessor or his agent under pains and penalties of perjury, </em>itemizing in precise detail the nature of the damage and of the repairs necessary to correct such damage, and <em>written evidence, </em>such as estimates, bills, invoices or receipts, indicating the actual or estimated cost thereof.\u201d The purpose of requiring specific itemization is to ensure that \u201clandlords do not make spurious and unfounded deductions for damage.\u201d <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, </em>386 Mass. 74, 80 (1982). The letter, signed by the defendant, itemized the damages, indicated the cost of repair and by whom, but was not signed under the pains of perjury, nor did it enclose the actual estimates or receipts. The letter did note, however, that the $500 security deposit had earned $25, at a rate of 5 % interest. See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (3) <em>(a) </em>and <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The plaintiffs argue that the lessor was not entitled to retain any portion of the security deposit because her counterclaim was forfeited as a result of improper notice. This question was not reported, however. See note 6, <em>infra. </em>Hence, the question is not before us\u2019. Similarly, we do not reach the issue of the applicability of G. L. c. 93A, as the matter is not be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>fore us. See <em>Hampshire Village Assocs. </em>v. <em>District Court of Hampshire, </em>381 Mass. 148, 154-155, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Ruhlander </em>v. <em>District Court of Hampshire, </em>449 U.S. 1062 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\"> In her appeal to the Appeals Court the lessor challenged the constitutionality of the amendment. She argued that the amendment gave a retroactive effect to the treble damages provisions. The Appeals Court found no retroactive effect because the defendant\u2019s contractual obligation to return the deposit did not arise until ten months after the effective date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>of the amendment. See <em>Mellor </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 983, 984 (1982). The issue surrounding the judge\u2019s rejection of the lessor\u2019s good faith argument was not presented to the Appeals Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\"> The questions reported are:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">\u201c1. Is a lessor, who withholds the return of a security deposit taken under the provisions of <em>G. L. c. 186S15B, </em>after giving the required notice of such withholding and who is subsequently held to be liable to return all of part of that security deposit by a Court of competent jurisdiction, subject to the penalty provisions of G. <em>L. c. 186 S 15B, </em>of \u2018three times the amount of such security deposit or balance thereof to which the tenant is entitled, plus interest at the rate of five percent from the date when such payment became due, together with court costs and reasonable attorneys fees,\u2019 regardless of the question of the good or bad faith of the lessor in so withholding?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">\u201c2. If the answer to the foregoing question is <em>NO, </em>does the burden rest on the lessor to prove he had a \u2018reasonable, good faith belief that he is entitled to an amount deducted?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">\u201c3. If the answer to #2 is <em>YES </em>and the lessor meets that burden, is the obligation of the lessor limited to a return of the amount wrongfully but in good faith withheld?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">\u201c4.

Is it within the power and authority of the trial court, having made an award of counsel fees in a G. L. <em>c. 186 S 15B </em>case, to, after rescript opinion which is silent on counsel fees, to [sic] award additional counsel fees and litigation expense encompassing services and expenses incurred in prosecuting or defending the appeal?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"Aqt\"> The other violations are provisions requiring the lessor to place the security deposit in a separate, interest-bearing account which may not be commingled with the lessor\u2019s funds, G.

The 1978 amendments provide clarification of the 1977 expansion. Section 15B (7) of G.
