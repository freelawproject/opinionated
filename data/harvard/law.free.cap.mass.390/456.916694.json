G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13D. The judge ruled that Jerez was immune from prosecution under art. 43 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and Optional Protocol on Disputes, April 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77, T.I.A.S. No. 6820 (Vienna Convention),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as he was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>sul of the Dominican Republic exercising his consular functions at the time of the alleged assault and battery. The Commonwealth appealed to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (i), 378 Mass. 882 (1979). We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm the judge\u2019s allowance of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The judge made the following findings of fact. On April 18, 1982, Jerez, in his official capacity as consul of the Dominican Republic, was invited to a cultural function to be held in the Brighton section of Boston at 8:30 p.m. Jerez had agreed to attend this event and said he would bring the flag of his country and literature on the Dominican Republic. Jerez was to occupy a table which was set aside for him to display the literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Around 8 p.m. on April 18, 1982, Jerez went to the consulate offices located in the Statler Office Building at 20 Providence Street in Boston. At that time he failed to comply with the request to sign in made by the security guard on duty. Jerez proceeded to the floor where his office was located, intending to pick up the flag and literature, and left the building shortly thereafter. The security guard feared that Jerez was a trespasser and alerted a police officer who was across the street from the building. The officer approached Jerez while he was speaking to one Roberto Noguera, an official of the Colombian consulate, who was seated in an automobile. An altercation then began in which the officer struck Jerez and Jerez began to struggle with the officer. Jerez was placed under arrest for assault and battery on a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Based on these findings of fact the judge found that Jerez was engaged in his official capacity as consul of the Domini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>can Republic, intending to participate in a cultural affair, at the time of the alleged assault and battery. Accordingly, the judge ruled that Jerez was immune from prosecution under arts. 5, 29, and 43 of the Vienna Convention. The sole issue<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> now before this court is whether at the time of the alleged assault and battery Jerez was acting in his official capacity as consul of the Dominican Republic for the purposes of immunity from prosecution under art. 43 of the Vienna Convention. We proceed to examine whether the judge\u2019s ultimate finding that Jerez was engaged in his official capacity as consul of the Dominican Republic at the time of the altercation was correct, and whether the judge\u2019s ruling that Jerez was immune from prosecution was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The Vienna Convention entered into force with respect to the United States on December 24, 1969. Article 43 provides that \u201c[cjonsular officers and consular employees shall not be amenable to the jurisdiction of the judicial or administrative authorities of the receiving State in respect of <em>acts performed in the exercise of consular </em>functions\u201d (emphasis added). See note 1, <em>supra. </em>The Commonwealth asserts that Jerez is not immune from prosecution under art. 43 because the alleged assault and battery is too far removed from Jerez\u2019s function as consul.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Article 5 of the Vienna Convention defines activities considered \u201c[cjonsular functions.\u201d It states in part that \u201c[cjonsular functions consist in: ... <em>(b) </em>furthering the development of commercial, economic, cultural and scientific relations between the sending State and the receiving State and otherwise promoting friendly relations between them in accordance with the provisions of the present Convention . . . .\u201d 21 U.S.T. 82-83. In applying this provision to the facts before us, \u201c[tjhe clear import of treaty language controls unless \u2018application of the words of the treaty according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>their obvious meaning effects a result inconsistent with the intent or expectations of its signatories.\u2019\u201d <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avagliano, </em>457 U.S. 176, 180 (1982), quoting <em>Maximov </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 49, 54 (1963). The language of art. <em>5(b) </em>defines \u201c[c]onsular functions\u201d in general terms inviting flexible construction. The clear import of such language as \u201cfurthering the development of . . . cultural . . . relations\u201d is that it not be construed restrictively. \u201c[A] narrow reading of the treaty would be inconsistent with its apparent purpose to eliminate the last vestiges of the notion that a consul was simply a \u2018commercial representative.\u2019\u201d <em>Heaney </em>v. <em>Government of Spain, </em>445 F.2d 501, 505 (2d Cir. 1971). Applying art. <em>5(b) </em>in a manner consistent with this clear import is appropriate, since doing so will foster the underlying purposes of the Vienna Convention to promote harmonious international relations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The judge was warranted in concluding that Jerez was seeking to further cultural relations between the Dominican Republic and the United States, and engaged in his consular capacity, at the time of the alleged assault and battery. The judge found that Jerez planned to attend a cultural gather<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ing that night at 8:30 p.m., where he would display his national flag and distribute informational literature, that pursuant to this end, Jerez went to his office building at approximately 8 p.m. to pick up his national flag and literature, and that the alleged assault and battery occurred immediately after he left the building which houses his office and while he was talking with a Colombian diplomat. Jerez, therefore, according to the judge, was proceeding to the cultural gathering, after making a stop necessary to fulfil his consular function when the conflict ensued. The judge\u2019s findings support his conclusion that Jerez was in the exercise of his consular function.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Other courts interpreting the Vienna Convention have reached similar results. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Heaney </em>v. <em>Government of Spain, </em>445 F.2d 501, 504-505 (2d Cir. 1971), interpreted arts. 5 and 43 of the Vienna Convention. The plaintiff in <em>Heaney </em>brought an action against the government of Spain and one of its consular representatives for breach of contract and tortious inducement to enter a contract which the defendants did not intend to perform. <em>Id. </em>at 502. The plaintiff had entered into an agreement with the defendants pursuant to which he would conduct anti-British propaganda in consideration of a sum of money. The defendants sought dismissal of the complaint based on Spain\u2019s sovereign immunity and its consul\u2019s consular immunity. The motion was allowed and the ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeals. The plaintiff challenged the consular immunity defense alleging that anti-British activities conducted in the United States fall outside normal consular duties. Taking a broad view of consular duties under art. 5, the court rejected this assertion, and concluded that the consular representative\u2019s alleged conduct was not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The scope of a consul\u2019s functions and consular immunity also was discussed in <em>Waltier </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>189 F. Supp. 319, 320-321 (S.D.N.Y. 1960). <em>Waltier </em>was decided before adoption of the Vienna Convention. Nevertheless, the case provides guidance concerning the scope of consular immu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>nity. The plaintiff in <em>Waltier </em>alleged that a Canadian consular official \u201cmade false statements which induced plaintiff to immigrate to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319. The court stated: \u201cA consular official is immune from suit when the acts complained of were performed in the course of his official duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320. The court then found the consular official\u2019s job was to encourage immigration to Canada, and ruled that the consul \u201cwas acting in the course of his official duties,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 321, in making the statements. Dismissing the complaint, the court found allegedly tortious conduct not actionable because of consular immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 320-321.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Finally, an Illinois appellate court in <em>Illinois Commerce Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Salamie, </em>54 Ill. App. 3d 465, 474 (1977), has discussed th$ scope of consular immunity. Focusing on art. 55(1) of the Vienna Convention,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which requires consuls to respect laws of the receiving State, the court stated, \u201c[Article 55 (1) ] cannot be construed to mean that the doing of a single illegal act takes the activity outside the scope of the consular functions except where specifically so provided in article 5.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But see <em>State </em>v. <em>Killeen, </em>39 Or. App. 369, 374-375 (1979) (followed State Department\u2019s position in finding that traffic violation is not within scope of consular immunity). We find no specific provision of art. 5 or other authority which takes Jerez\u2019s alleged assault and battery outside the scope of his consular functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Although we reach our conclusion in this case under the Vienna Convention, common law agency principles are instructive in analyzing whether Jerez was acting within the scope of his consular function at the time of the alleged assault and battery. We long have recognized that acts not strictly necessary for fulfilment of an agent\u2019s duties nonethe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>less may fall within the agent\u2019s scope of employment. See <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51, 54 (1913); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>194 Mass. 223, 226-227 (1907). The scope of an agent\u2019s authority is not construed restrictively in this Commonwealth, see <em>Pridgen </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>364 Mass. 696, 714 &amp; n.10 (1974), and on several occasions we have considered whether an intentional tort committed by an agent was performed within the scope of his employment. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., </em>364 Mass. 340, 345-350 (1973). <em>Orasz </em>v. <em>Colonial Tavern, Inc., </em>362 Mass. 881 (1972). <em>Hobart v. Cavanaugh, </em>353 Mass. 51, 52-53 (1967). <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Beliauskas, </em>341 Mass. 95, 98 (1960). Cf. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>DelRosso, </em>371 Mass. 768, 772 (1977). We have found such intentional torts within the scope of employment in a variety of situations. <em>Orasz </em>v. <em>Colonial Tavern, Inc., supra </em>(bartender\u2019s battery of patron). <em>Suckney </em>v. <em>Bert P. Williams, Inc., </em>355 Mass. 62, 63-65 (1968) (truckdriver\u2019s helper\u2019s battery of bystander). <em>Hobart </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, supra </em>(truckdriver\u2019s battery of service station attendant). <em>Rego </em>v. <em>Thomas Bros., </em>340 Mass. 334, 335 (1960) (public highway construction superintendent\u2019s battery of bystander). <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Beliauskas, supra </em>(use of force by bartender against patron). See <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Hearst Corp., </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 79 (1975) (truck driver\u2019s battery of person blocking passage).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">To determine whether the intentional tort of an employee occurred within the scope of his employment \u201c[w]hat must be shpwn is that the employee\u2019s assault was in response to the plaintiff\u2019s conduct which was presently interfering with the employee\u2019s ability to perform his duties successfully.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., supra </em>at 350. While <em>Miller </em>addressed employers\u2019 liability for acts by employees, we think that the standard set forth there applies in the context of the present case as well. Jerez was planning to attend a cultural gathering at 8:30 p.m. on April 18, 1982. He went to his office around 8 p.m. intending to get his national flag and some literature concerning the Dominican Republic. The alleged assault and battery occurred immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>after Jerez had left the building and while he was speaking to an official of the Colombian consulate. The police officer\u2019s actions interfered with Jerez\u2019s unimpeded ability to attend the scheduled cultural gathering. Accordingly, Jerez\u2019s alleged wrongful conduct occurred in response to conduct which was presently interfering with his ability to exercise his consular functions successfully. Under the agency principle established in <em>Miller, </em>therefore, Jerez was acting within the scope of his authority when the altercation occurred. See <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Hearst Corp., supra; Manning </em>v. <em>Grimsley, </em>643 F.2d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The Commonwealth also refers us to doctrines of official immunity developed in connection with actions by public officials. We express no opinion on these doctrines as we resolve this case under the language of the Vienna Convention and well-settled principles of agency law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">There was no error in the judge\u2019s finding that, at the time of the alleged altercation, Jerez was engaged in the exercise of his consular function as consul of the Dominican Republic, and there was no error in the judge\u2019s ruling that Jerez, therefore, is immune from prosecution. The motion to dismiss was properly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-15\"> Article 43 of the Vienna Convention provides: <em>\u201cImmunity from jurisdiction </em>1.

The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not, however, apply in respect of a civil action either: <em>(a) </em>arising out of a contract concluded by a consular officer or a consular employee in which he did not contract expressly or impliedly as an agent of the sending State; or <em>(b) </em>by a third party for damage arising from an accident in the receiving State caused by \u00bf vehicle, vessel or aircraft.\u201d 21 U.S.T. 105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\"> The Commonwealth in its brief also argues that Jerez is not entitled to diplomatic immunity.
