We, therefore, affirm the partial summary judgment that in effect ordered the Commissioner of Correction to return the \u201cplaintiffs to Massachusetts Correctional Facilities forthwith.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The facts are not in dispute, although from the information in the record appendix we cannot determine precisely what facts were uncontested on the record before the motion judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs were serving sentences in Massachusetts prisons when, in the summer of 1980, they were transferred to Federal custody without first being afforded reclassification hearings: When the department is considering the transfer of an individual to a higher custody status, various procedures must be followed before the transfer may be made. 103 Code Mass. Regs. 420.13 (1978). For example, the inmate is given the right to attend classification board meetings and an opportunity to present his position. He is entitled to notice of the transfer decision, and the reasons for it, and he may object to the initial decision. 103 Code Mass. Regs. 420.13 (2) (1978). Transfer to a \u201chigher custody status\u201d is defined to include \u201c[a] transfer to another state.\u201d 103 Code Mass. Regs. 420.01 (10) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The defendants acknowledge the department\u2019s obligation to comply with its own regulations (see <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, ante </em>425, 427 [1983]), but argue that the words \u201ctransfer to another state\u201d apply only to the transfer of an inmate to a correctional facility operated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>another State and not to a transfer to a Federal facility in another State. Literally and logically, the transfer of an inmate to a Federal prison in another State is a \u201ctransfer to another state.\u201d The defendants advance no reason, and we can think of no logical reason, why an inmate should have the procedural protections of the regulations when transfer to the custody of the correction department of another State is contemplated and should have no procedural protections when transfer to Federal custody in another State is contemplated. A transfer of an inmate out of the Commonwealth has the same disadvantages of distance whether the out-of-State facility is operated by a State or by the Federal government. Our interpretation of the regulation is consistent with the expressed \u201cGoals and Objectives\u201d of the classification system, one of which is that \u201cthe classification system provides for maximum involvement of the individual in determining the nature and direction of [his] own goals, and a mechanism for appealing administrative decisions affecting him.\u201d 103 Code Mass. Regs. 420.02 (1) (e) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">References to \u201cother states or the federal system\u201d in another portion of the department\u2019s classification regulations (103 Code Mass. Regs. 420.03 [2] [a] [1978]) do not require our rejection of the normal meaning of the words \u201cto another state.\u201d There was nothing before the motion judge to show, as now argued, that the department\u2019s consistent interpretation of its regulations has been that the procedural protections of the regulations do not apply to an inmate transferred to Federal custody. Thus we need not consider whether we would resort to such an interpretation as a guide to construing the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\n<em>Partial summary judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> The partial summary judgment was amended to state that there was no just reason for delay in its entry (Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), thus permitting the defendants to appeal immediately upon its entry. We transferred the appeal here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">We are advised by the plaintiffs\u2019 brief that a Justice of the Appeals Court allowed a partial stay of the judgment, that one plaintiff has been released from custody, and that three plaintiffs have been returned to Massachusetts prisons and classified to various facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b554-9\"> The defendants\u2019 answer to the complaint is not in the appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">The Commissioner of Correction has statutory authority to transfer State prisoners to Federal custody.
