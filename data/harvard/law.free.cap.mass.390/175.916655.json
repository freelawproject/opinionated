Fleming, a Massachusetts State police officer, and Kathleen T. Fleming, his wife, against Paul A. Benzaquin, the host of a nightly radio \u201ctalk show\u201d on radio station WBZ, and Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, Inc. (Westinghouse),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which owned and operated WBZ. The complaint specifies a number of comments allegedly made by Benzaquin during his broadcast on June 13, 1977, which the plaintiffs contend defamed Officer Fleming, caused him severe emotional distress, and deprived his wife of his consortium. A Superior Court judge denied Westinghouse\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). Subsequently, the defendants each moved for summary judgment, offering in support a transcript of relevant portions of the program,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> portions of Officer Fleming\u2019s deposition, the memorandum of the judge who denied the motion to dismiss, and a memorandum of law. The Flemings opposed the motions, offering other portions of Officer Fleming\u2019s deposition and a memorandum of law. Another Superior Court judge denied the motions without opinion. The defendants were granted leave to appeal the denials under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, by a single justice of the Appeals Court. The defendants entered their appeal in the Appeals Court and we transferred the case here on our own motion. G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 10 (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The following facts are not in dispute. Shortly after noon on June 13, 1977, Benzaquin, his daughter, and his two young grandsons were driving in Benzaquin\u2019s car on Route 123 in Norwell, on their way to the beach. As they passed the State police barracks on Route 123, they were observed by Trooper Fleming, who was exiting from the driveway of the barracks in his cruiser. Fleming noticed that Benzaquin\u2019s car did not have a license plate attached to the front, did not have an inspection sticker displayed on the windshield, and appeared to have an expired registration. Using his siren and flashing lights, Fleming directed Benzaquin\u2019s car over into a parking lot alongside the road. Benzaquin gave a number of explanations for the conditions Fleming had observed: namely, that the front plate had been stolen, that the inspection sticker had fallen from the windshield onto the dashboard, and that the Registry of Motor Vehicles or his insurance company had made an error on the registration of his car, which was newly purchased. According to Benzaquin\u2019s statement on his program later that night, \u201cI used a lot of loud voice, but I made it absolutely clear . . . the fact that I wasn\u2019t angry at him. I was angry at my insurance company and I was more angry at the Registry of Motor Vehicles for making me vulnerable on the highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Fleming wrote up a ticket and explained that he could not allow Benzaquin to proceed in his car. Rather than have the car towed, Fleming allowed Benzaquin to leave the car in the parking lot of an automobile dealership next to the lot where Benzaquin had pulled over. After securing his vehicle, Benzaquin, his daughter, and his grandsons drove off with a friend whom he had called to pick them up.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">At the start of his broadcast later that night, Benzaquin gave a description of the incident which he prefaced with statements that he was angry, felt oppressed, and was liable to be prejudiced.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He stated that he wanted to describe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the incident, \u201cbecause it seems to me important that public servants remain servants and not make us servile to them.\u201d Benzaquin expressed his opinion that, in the circumstances, Officer Fleming could simply have given him a warning, told him to clean up his affairs, and sent him on his way. Fleming alleges that some of the statements in this description of events defamed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">After describing the incident, Benzaquin invited people who were \u201coutrage[dj about any kind of government bureaucracy\u201d to telephone him during the broadcast. He also invited Officer Fleming to telephone and present his views. Benzaquin admitted that Fleming had cause to stop his car. During his discussion with one caller, Benzaquin stated that the stop occurred not far from his home and then suggested that Fleming could simply have followed him home. When another caller expressed her view that Fleming was simply doing his job, Benzaquin responded that, \u201cI commend him for doing <em>his </em>job. But what I can\u2019t commend anybody for is not being reasonable enough to let us proceed to a place where we could change vehicles, where I could get those little boys out of the hot sun and away from danger. Instead, we were grounded. The vehicle was taken away from us.\u201d When a third caller expressed disbelief \u201cthat a trooper would just leave a person standing there stranded on the side of the road after he had impounded the car\u201d and asked how Benzaquin had obtained a ride, Benzaquin replied that, \u201cI got a ride. But I did it through my own initiative, no help from the State Police,\u201d and stated that Fleming had not offered him a ride. In various conversations with other callers, Benzaquin allegedly made the rest of the statements which Fleming claims defamed him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On a number of occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>sions, Benzaquin reiterated that he was angry, likely to be biased, and that his listeners should take account of those facts. Near the end of the program, Benzaquin engaged in a discussion with a caller,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in which Behzaquin summed up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>his impression of the program, his motive for opening discussion of the incident, and his opinion that it was \u201cutterly unreasonable ... for [Fleming] to take me out of that automobile and ground those two little kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In his deposition, which was submitted to the judge in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, Fleming states that he offered to give Benzaquin and his family a ride home but that Benzaquin refused, saying he would arrange his own transportation. Fleming also states that he directed Benzaquin\u2019s car over into a parking lot where it was safe and out of the way of traffic. Other than this, the plaintiffs do not dispute the accuracy of Benzaquin\u2019s narration of the sequence of events in any significant respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The plaintiffs contend that Benzaquin\u2019s statements are false, defamatory statements of fact and therefore actionable. The plaintiffs contend further that, to the extent Benzaquin\u2019s statements represent only opinion, they are nonetheless actionable because they are based on a false statement of facts. The plaintiffs do not contend that the statements, if opinion, are actionable because they imply the existence of undisclosed, defamatory facts. See <em>Pritsker </em>v. <em>Brudnoy, </em>389 Mass. 776 (1983); <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., </em>386 Mass. 303, 312-313, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1037 (1982); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 566 (1977). We consider first whether the statements could reasonably have been understood as assertions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">1. <em>The Statements as Fact or Opinion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u201cIn deciding whether statements can be understood reasonably as fact or <em>opinion </em>\u2018the test to be applied ... requires that the court examine the statement in its totality in the context in which it was uttered or published. The court must consider all the words used, not merely a particular phrase or sentence. In addition, the court must give weight to cautionary terms used by the person publishing the statement. Finally, the court must consider all of the circumstances surrounding the statement, including the medium by which the statement is disseminated and the audience to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>which it is published.\u2019\u201d <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., supra </em>at 309, quoting from <em>Information Control Corp. </em>v. <em>Genesis One Computer Corp., </em>611 F.2d 781, 784 (9th Cir. 1980). See <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Boston Magazine Co., </em>380 Mass. 336, 341-342 (1980). We apply this test to the statements challenged here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Many of the statements complained of, in context, fall readily into the categories of ridicule and simple verbal abuse. See Restatment (Second) of Torts \u00a7 566 comments d and e (1977). The terms \u201carrogants,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201clittle monkey,\u201d \u201ctough guy,\u201d \u201cabsolute barbarian,\u201d \u201clunkhead,\u201d \u201cmeat-head,\u201d and \u201cnut,\u201d by which Benzaquin apparently referred to Fleming and the terms \u201cservile,\u201d \u201cunconscionable,\u201d \u201creprehensible,\u201d \u201cmerciless,\u201d and \u201cabsolute outrage,\u201d which Benzaquin apparently used to characterize Fleming\u2019s conduct are no more than either Benzaquin\u2019s \u201charsh judgment,\u201d clearly based on the facts he disclosed, <em>id. </em>at comment d, or \u201cmere vituperation and abuse,\u201d <em>id. </em>at comment e.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While the statements did not arise in the course of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>classic face-to-face confrontation, Benzaquin repeatedly told his audience that he was angry and upset and warned that they were \u201chearing a lot of noise that doesn\u2019t have to do with the facts.\u201d Benzaquin also disclaimed any intent \u201cto say anything about [Fleming] as a person\u201d or to \u201csay he\u2019s unfit or any of the other things that might be said by generalities.\u201d Further, as was the case with the statements at issue in <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting </em>Co., 386 Mass. 303 (1982), \u201c[t]he meaning of these statements is imprecise and open to speculation. They cannot be characterized as assertions of fact. They cannot be proved false. \u2018An assertion that cannot be proved false cannot be held libellous\u2019\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Benzaquin\u2019s statements that \u201cif [Fleming] has children of his own, I\u2019m sorry for them, already,\u201d must be viewed as an expression of opinion based on Benzaquin\u2019s description of events. There is no assertion of fact concerning Fleming within the statement. The plaintiffs do not argue that the statement implied the existence of nondisclosed, defamatory facts nor, in context, could such an implication be reasonably understood. Benzaquin\u2019s assertion that he \u201c[is] sorry . . . already,\u201d is not, in itself, a defamatory statement of fact. The comment can only be reasonably understood to suggest that, if Fleming treated any children he had as he had treated Benzaquin\u2019s grandchildren, Benzaquin would consider the treatment outrageous. Compare Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 566 comment c, illustrations 5 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Benzaquin\u2019s use of the word \u201cattack,\u201d cannot be viewed as a defamatory statement of fact. In context, it is clear that Benzaquin was using the term figuratively to express his strong criticism of Fleming\u2019s conduct. He used the term only after a caller had used it to characterize a discussion Benzaquin had had on an earlier program concerning police conduct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It could not have been understood as referring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>to a physical assault. Indeed, both within the immediate conversation and later in the program in conversation with another caller, Benzaquin used the word \u201cattack\u201d figuratively to describe his own criticism of Fleming\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Greenbelt Coop. Publishing Assn </em>v. <em>Bresler, </em>398 U.S. 6, 13-14 (1970) (use of word \u201cblackmail\u201d to describe plaintiffs\u2019 conduct could not be understood as statement of fact); <em>Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 284 (1974) (publication of Jack London\u2019s definition of \u201cscab\u201d constituted defendant\u2019s figurative expression of opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Similarly, Benzaquin\u2019s use of the words \u201cdictators and Nazis\u201d could not have been understood as statements of fact. When a caller stated that \u201c[w]e\u2019re paying [the State police] to do a job and then you\u2019re getting mad when they do that job,\u201d Benzaquin answered, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not paying them to be unreasonable. I\u2019m not paying them to be dictators and Nazis.\u201d To the extent the terms refer to Fleming at all, they no more implied that Fleming was a totalitarian ruler or a member of the Nazi party than did the term \u201ccommunism\u201d in <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, Inc. </em>v. <em>Central Broadcasting Corp., </em>379 Mass. 220 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 935 (1980), charge the plaintiff there \u201cwith complicity in the atrocities of Solzhenitsyn\u2019s Gulag Archipelago or other horrors distinctive of a totalitarian regime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229. The terms \u201cdictators and Nazis,\u201d \u201cwould most likely be taken by the audience as mere pejorative rhetoric, abusive of the plaintiff for what [he] had done or appeared to have done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, as was also the case in <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, Inc., supra, </em>\u201c[i]f the [words] carried some further meaning or overtone (which is very doubtful), it was too vague to be cognizable as the subject of a \u201cdefamation action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 268 (1974) (\u201ca traitor to his God, his country, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>family and his class\u201d); <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Littell, </em>539 F.2d 882 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1062 (1977) (\u201cfascist,\u201d \u201cfellow traveler\u201d of fascism).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Finally, we consider the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Benzaquin \u201crepeatedly stated that the plaintiff left the defendant and two small children \u2018stranded\u2019 along the road and \u2018in danger\u2019 of being hit by another vehicle. \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The transcript reveals that the only time Benzaquin used the word \u201cstranded\u201d was in the following exchange after Benzaquin explained that he had had to make a telephone call to arrange transportation:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Caller: \u201cSo you weren\u2019t stranded in the middle of a highway somewhere?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Benzaquin: \u201cNo thanks to [Fleming] I wasn\u2019t stranded.\u201d Benzaquin then stated that Fleming had not offered him a ride. Previously, the same caller had asked Benzaquin whether Fleming had \u201cactually just [left] you there stranded,\u201d and Benzaquin replied, \u201cHe told me I couldn\u2019t drive the vehicle.\u201d Later, when the same caller discussed with Benzaquin whether Benzaquin should have realized that his registration had expired, the colloquy reproduced in the margin occurred.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Even if we assume that Benzaquin adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the caller\u2019s use of the term \u201cstranded\u201d during this latter part of the conversation, it is nonetheless clear against the overall background of the program, and in light of the previous uses of the word \u201cstranded,\u201d that, as Benzaquin used or adopted it, the word could only be understood to represent Benzaquin\u2019s opinion of the plight in which he found himself after Fleming had refused to allow him to continue driving his car. As such, it would be an opinion based on disclosed, nondefamatory facts and nonactionable.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">For much the same reasons, Benzaquin\u2019s statement that Fleming \u201cwants to put me away forever and leave those two kids out there to get hit by a vehicle,\u201d cannot be viewed as an assertion of fact. Rather, the audience could only reasonably understand the comment, especially in light of the obvious hyperbole, as Benzaquin\u2019s opinion of Fleming\u2019s attitude as evidenced by Fleming\u2019s refusal to let Benzaquin continue to drive his car. It could not reasonably be understood as an assertion that Fleming desired that the children be put in peril. To the extent Benzaquin\u2019s remark here and his later statement that he thought it unreasonable to refuse to let him continue to a place \u201cwhere I could get those little boys out of the hot sun and away from danger,\u201d could be viewed as assertions that the place where Benzaquin was stopped was dangerous for the children, those assertions would again be but expressions of Benzaquin\u2019s subjective assessment of the situation as he described it, and so pure opinion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Thuma </em>v. <em>Hearst Corp., </em>340 F. Supp. 867, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>871 (D. Md. 1972) (father\u2019s statement that shooting of son by police officer was \u201ccold-blooded murder,\u201d was, in context, \u201cclearly hyperbole expressing the father\u2019s most vehement feeling that the shooting was completely unnecessary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Although Benzaquin\u2019s statements might, in the aggregate, give the impression that he considered Fleming to be unfit for police work, we note again that Benzaquin specifically disclaimed any intent to characterize Fleming as generally unfit and referred only to his one encounter with Fleming as the basis for his opinion without intimating that he possessed other information. We conclude that, individually and taken as a whole, the challenged statements could not be reasonably understood as assertions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">We consider now the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the opinions are nonetheless actionable because they are based on a false statement of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">2. <em>Liability for Opinions Based on False Statement of Fact.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The Restatement of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 566-567 (1938) took the position that expressions of defamatory opinions were themselves actionable. This position was based on a view of the common law that has been severely criticised. See Christie, Defamatory Opinions and the Restatement (Second) of Torts, 175 Mich. L. Rev. 1621, 1625-1632, 1640 &amp; n.74 (1977). Whatever the historical validity of the position, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>no longer viable in light of Supreme Court decisions beginning perhaps with <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323 (1974), where the Court stated that for First Amendment purposes, \u201c[hjowever pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas. But there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339-340. The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 566 (1977) has abandoned the position. The plaintiffs contend nonetheless that, because Benzaquin\u2019s statements were premised upon a false statement of facts, his opinions are actionable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We have, in a number of recent cases, discussed the law governing defamatory statements of opinion. See <em>Pritsker </em>v. <em>Brudnoy, </em>389 Mass. 776 (1983); <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., </em>386 Mass. 303 (1982); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Boston Magazine Co., </em>380 Mass. 336 (1980); <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, Inc. </em>v. <em>Central Broadcasting Corp., </em>379 Mass. 220 (1979). Developing the \u201ccommon ground\u201d surveyed in <em>Gertz, </em>these decisions have recognized and adopted the view expressed in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 566 comment b (1977), that statements of opinion of the \u201cpure\u201d type \u2014 that is, opinions based on disclosed or assumed non-defamatory facts \u2014 are not actionable whereas statements of opinion of the \u201cmixed\u201d type \u2014 that is, opinions apparently based on undisclosed defamatory facts \u2014 are actionable. We have indicated that Benzaquin disclosed the facts upon which he based his opinion and the plaintiffs do not contend that he implied the existence of undisclosed, defamatory facts. By arguing that opinions based on disclosed but false facts are actionable, the plaintiffs apparently attempt to chart a middle course.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The Restatement sets forth four fact patterns which demonstrate \u201cthe effect of the rule that there can be no recovery in defamation for a pure expression of opinion.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 566 comment c, at 175 (1977). Two of these are relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims here: \u201c(1) If the defendant bases his expression of a derogatory opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>of the plaintiff on his own statement of false and defamatory facts, he is subject to liability for the factual statement but not for the expression of opinion. (2) If the defendant bases his expression of a derogatory opinion of the plaintiff on his own statement of facts that are not defamatory, he is not subject to liability for the factual statement \u2014 nor for the expression of opinion, as long as it does not reasonably indicate an assertion of the existence of other, defamatory, facts that would justify the forming of the opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These examples make clear that Benzaquin and Westinghouse will not be liable to the plaintiffs for Benzaquin\u2019s expression of opinion on disclosed facts even if the facts are false. However, Benzaquin would be liable for the disclosed facts provided they were both false and defamatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The only statement of fact in Benzaquin\u2019s narration of events with which the plaintiffs take specific issue is Benzaquin\u2019s assertion that Fleming did not offer him a ride. Since Fleming states in his deposition that he did offer Benzaquin a ride, we may take this averment as true for purposes of the motion for summary judgment. However, the defendants would still be entitled to summary judgment unless the truth or falsity of Benzaquin\u2019s assertion that his party was not offered a ride presented \u201ca genuine issue of material fact,\u201d <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 554 (1976), in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Here the plaintiffs fall victim to their misperception of the defendants\u2019 potential liability. The plaintiffs contend only that Benzaquin\u2019s opinions should themselves be actionable and they fail to set forth any specific facts indicating that Benzaquin\u2019s statement that his party was not offered a ride, if false, was also defamatory. Without such facts, the truth or falsity of the statement is not a material issue in the action. Since the pleadings, taken together with the supporting materials, have failed to disclose that the plaintiffs have set forth facts in support of an action for defamation, the defendants were \u201centitled, as matter of law, to a judgment.\u201d <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Our decision would be no different if we were to assume that the pleadings and supporting materials were sufficient to raise the issue of the defamatory character of Benzaquin\u2019s statement that he was not offered a ride. He stated that he was stopped about three-quarters of a mile from his house, about one-half mile from the police barracks, \u201cin the center of Norwell.\u201d He also stated that he was able to make a telephone call to secure transportation and that he had \u201cstopped at a very reasonable automobile dealership,\u201d where he was permitted to leave his car. It is apparent from this information that even those listeners who were not familiar with the area Benzaquin described could not have concluded that he had been stopped in an isolated or unpopulated area. We think it unlikely that in these circumstances a reasonable listener would consider Benzaquin\u2019s statement that Fleming did not offer him a ride as defamatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">3. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The plaintiffs do not argue that their action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium would survive the loss of their action for defamation. We therefore need not decide the point. But see <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Proxmire, </em>579 F.2d 1027, 1036 (7th Cir. 1978), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 443 U.S. 111 (1979) (action for intentional infliction of emotional harm must fall with the action for defamation); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 566 comment f (1977) (action for intentional infliction of mental distress subject to restrictions of First Amendment). We also need not consider the issues relating to the status of police officers as public officials although we note that the weight of authority leans toward classifying police officers as public officials. See Note, Police Defamation Suits Against Citizens Complaining of Police Misconduct, 22 St. Louis U.L.J. 676, 684-685 (1978). In sum, we conclude that the challenged statements could only be reasonably understood as expressions of opinion based on nondefamatory disclosed facts. We further conclude that opinions (as contrasted with false and defamatory statements of fact) based on disclosed but false statements of fact are not actionable because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>they are mere opinion and not statements of fact. Therefore, we reverse the order of the Superior Court judge denying the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and order that judgments for the defendants be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-5\"> Since the commencement of this action Westinghouse has changed its name to Westinghouse Broadcasting and Cable, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\"> Treating the motion as a motion to strike, Mass.

Nothing that was said during or about this call is at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\"> The complaint alleges that Benzaquin\u2019s statements \u201ccontained the following false and defamatory matter: (a) \u2018. . . arrogants wearing troopers\u2019 uniforms like tights\u2019, (b) \u2018little monkey . . . you wind him up and he does his thing\u2019, (c) \u2018If someone in the car had been bleeding, that would have been tough too.\u2019 (d) \u2018. . . not paying them to be dictators and Nazis.\u2019 (e) a . . . \u2018tough guy with a big gun on his hip\u2019, (f) \u2018This man is an absolute barbarian.\u2019 (g) a \u2018lunkhead\u2019, (h) a \u2018meathead\u2019, (i) \u2018It only takes one nut like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>that to give the troop a bad name.\u2019 (j) \u2018If he has children of his own, I\u2019m sorry for them already\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The complaint also alleges that, \u201c[t]he defendant, Paul A. Benzaquin, alleged that the plaintiff did not properly perform his duties as a Massachusetts State Police Officer and repeatedly stated that the plaintiff left the defendant and two small children \u2018stranded\u2019 along the road and \u2018in danger\u2019 of being hit by another vehicle, which was untrue. Trooper Fleming did, in fact, take precautions to guard the safety of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Finally, the complaint alleges that, \u201c[t]he defendant, Paul A. Benzaquin, falsely and maliciously described the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in the performance of his duties as \u2018servile\u2019, \u2018unconscionable\u2019, \u2018reprehensible\u2019, \u2018merciless\u2019, \u2018an absolute outrage\u2019 and an \u2018attack\u2019 upon the defendant, Paul A. Benzaquin.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Benzaquin: \u201cListen to me. Listen to me, Bob. You\u2019ve heard me over the years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Caller: \u201cI been listening to you a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Benzaquin: \u201cO.K. Now, have you ever heard me attack a police force, a police policy, or a police officer before?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Caller: \u201cNo, you surprised me tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Benzaquin: \u201cAll right. And I think that I probably have a better record than most broadcasters in this city for pointing out the positive sides of police action. It happened that today I was annoyed at one police officer who happens to be a state trooper. And I thought that what he did was reprehensible. And I put it on the air. Now, granted, we did get some stories from police, from people who had bad police experiences. But we got some from people who had had good police experiences and I got just as many raps for what I said as boosts for what I said. So no harm is done there. We haven\u2019t generalized and I haven\u2019t allowed anybody to generalize about police policy or police brutality or anything else except one incident. One particular police officer, one offending motorist. And I\u2019m the offending motorist. So no harm has been done beyond that beef. One officer . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">Caller: \u201cI think if trooper Fleming is listening or any of his family is listening there\u2019s been harm done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">Benzaquin: \u201cWell, sure. I want harm done, to be done to him. I\u2019m sore at him.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">Caller: \u201cWell, you want harm to be done to him for . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">Benzaquin: \u201cYes, I do. I want him to know it was utterly unreasonable in my opinion for him to take me out of that automobile and ground those two little kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-17\">Caller: \u201cBut this is what your courts are for . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">Benzaquin : \u201cCourt can\u2019t help me when I\u2019ve got two little kids standing by the side of the road, Bob.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\"> The judge who ruled on the motion to dismiss determined that three of the allegedly defamatory statements appeared to be \u201cmatters which can be proven false \u2014 and which would therefore be legitimate grounds for suit.\u201d Because he did not have the benefit of a transcript to determine the context of the statements, the judge denied the motion to dismiss. The parties disagree as to whether the judge, by specifically referring to three statements as possibly actionable, intended thereby to dismiss the other statements as nonactionable. However, the judge made no specific disposition concerning the other statements when he denied the motion to dismiss and the record does not reveal whether the judge who ruled on the motions for summary judgment limited his consideration in any way. We therefore consider all of the allegations contained in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The judge referred to the three statements as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u201c1. The assertion that plaintiff attacked the defendant;</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">\u201c2. The allegation that plaintiff left defendant and two small children stranded along the road and in danger of being hit; and</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">\u201c3. The \u2018Nazi\u2019 reference, which in its full context might be understandable as a charge that the plaintiff is a \u2018Nazi\u2019.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b197-11\"> In the transcript, the word appears as \u201carrogance.\u201d Nothing turns on this discrepancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b197-12\"> We use the word \u201capparently\u201d because, in some instances, it is unclear whether Benzaquin was referring specifically to Fleming or to State police officers generally. For purposes of discussion here, we will assume that all of the terms referred to Fleming personally or to his conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\"> When the caller expressed his view that Benzaquin had \u201cattacked the police in a way,\u201d on an earlier program, Benzaquin replied: \u201cI didn\u2019t Barry. I don\u2019t attack police except today. If the police attack me, I\u2019ll attack them. Bum rap, though, to put two little kids by the side of the road. I\u2019m not going to forget that one.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b199-6\"> The second instance occurred when Benzaquin asked a caller, \u201cHave you ever heard me attack a police force, a police policy, or a police officer before?\u201d See note 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\"> We are unable to find any place in the transcript where Benzaquin stated that, \u201c[I]f someone in the car had been bleeding, that would have been tough too,\u201d as alleged in the complaint. We therefore do not consider the effect of this statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Benzaquin: \u201cYeah, but somebody\u2019s supposed to send you something. You\u2019re supposed to feel [sic] out one of those foolish IBM cards. I got nothing. All of a sudden I\u2019m a violator on the highway and I\u2019ve got a cop who wants to put me away forever and leave these two kids out there to get hit by a vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Caller: \u201cN\u00f3, I don\u2019t think he wanted to leave them to get hit by a vehicle out there. I\u2019m sure he has children of his own too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Benzaquin: \u201cWell, if he has children of his own, I\u2019m sorry for them, already.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">Caller: \u201cBut I really can\u2019t see that they left you there stranded. I find that very hard to believe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">Benzaquin: \u201cYou do? Okay, your husband is a State Trooper. . . . And I have a loud public voice and I\u2019ve made a lot of noise tonight, and this can\u2019t be helpful to the State Police. I want you to present this whole thing to your husband next time you see him and ask him what he would [have] done under similar circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\"> The word, as Benzaquin used or adopted it, might also be taken to refer only to the fact that he was not allowed to continue driving and therefore might be simply a statement of an undisputed, nondefamatory fact. We note that Benzaquin did repeatedly say that he had been \u201cgrounded\u201d by Fleming. However, it is clear from context that Benzaquin was referring simply to Fleming\u2019s refusal to let him continue driving the car. Fleming himself used the word in his deposition when he stated: \u201cI did deprive him of further driving of it for that day. He was temporarily grounded without transportation until I offered him some and stated that he could make his own arrangements if he wished, which he did.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\"> The plaintiffs do not argue that Benzaquin misstated any facts as to where he stopped his vehicle and do not challenge his repeated assertions that his grandchildren were forced to stand by the side of the road. Flem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ing does state in his deposition that Benzaquin \u201cpulled off the road approximately ten feet in from the highway [into a parking area] where it was safe, and that the parking lot was \u201cout of the way of traffic,\u201d but Fleming makes no reference to where the children stood. Obviously, Fleming\u2019s assessment of the danger inherent in the situation does not make Benzaquin\u2019s contrary assessment an issue of fact when the facts underlying the assessments are not disputed. Further, we find no factual support for the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that Benzaquin persisted in characterizing Fleming \u201cas a Nazi who had deliberately jeopardized the safety of the two children.\u201d As we have held, Benzaquin\u2019s remarks concerning danger could only have been understood as opinion. The plaintiffs have not indicated, and we are unable to find, any place where Benzaquin made a factual statement concerning precautions that Fleming did, or did not, take for the safety of the Benzaquin party. Indeed, Fleming does not, aside from stating that he directed Benzaquin\u2019s vehicle off the road and offered a ride, refer to any safety precaution that he did take. We consider the issues surrounding the disputed offer of a ride in part 2 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
