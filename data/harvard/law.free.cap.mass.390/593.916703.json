Art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 3, of the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Attorney General ruled in substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>that the initiative petition did not propose enactment of a \u201claw\u201d as required by art. 48. We conclude that the Attorney General was correct both in his determination that he had the authority to decline to certify the petition, and in his ruling that the petition does not propose a proper subject for the popular initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The case comes to the full court by way of reservation and report without decision by a single justice of this court, and on a statement of agreed facts. One week after the Attorney General informed the plaintiffs that he was unable to certify their petition, they commenced this action by filing their complaint in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County. At that time they requested a preliminary injunction designed to permit them to gather signatures during the pend-ency of the case. The Attorney General did not oppose issu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>anee of the requested preliminary injunction and it was entered on September 19, 1983. The single justice also permitted the President of the Senate to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">It is clear beyond dispute that the initiative petition here concerns the internal proceedings of the two Houses of the Legislature. Thus, the plaintiffs in their brief state: \u201cPlaintiffs have proposed important changes to discrete aspects of the procedures in the Legislature.\u201d Many of the measure\u2019s proposals relate to the organization and operation of the House and Senate in the form of proposed additional sections of G. L. c. 3 (see \u00a7 1 of the proposed initiative measure). Procedures are prescribed for the nomination of presiding officers (\u00a7 71), the appointment to majority and minority floor leadership positions (\u00a7 72), the nomination, approval, and election of \u201cchairs of legislative committees\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 73, 74), and the selection of committee members (\u00a7 75). Procedures are prescribed for final reporting of matters by committees (\u00a7 78), for the discharge of legislative matters by petition (\u00a7 79), for the approval and signing of favorable reports of a committee (\u00a7 80), for the recording of committee votes in certain circumstances (\u00a7 81), for notice of committee sessions (\u00a7 82), and for a public hearing on every bill (\u00a7 83). There are provisions concerning legislative procedures, such as daily calendars, the printing of bills, and roll calls (\u00a7\u00a7 84-87), and for a committee on legislative administration and budget (\u00a7\u00a7 90-91). The proposal contains other matters such as limitations of the salary differentials of legislative leaders (see \u00a7 4 of the proposed initiative measure). The proposal is to be effective, if adopted, \u201con the first Wednesday of January next following its passage.\u201d See \u00a7 6 of the proposed initiative measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">There are two issues before us: (1) Whether the Attorney General has authority under art. 48 to refuse to certify a proposed initiative as not in proper \u201cform\u201d because it does not propose a \u201claw,\u201d and (2) if the Attorney General has such authority, whether his ruling was correct that the petition here does not propose a law. The Attorney General, in concurring that our consideration is limited to these two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>issues, disclaims any general authority under art. 48 to pass on other aspects of the constitutional validity of a submitted initiative petition. In this disclaimer he is correct. Indeed, the courts are similarly limited: \u201cThe people acting by means of the initiative, like the General Court, can enact measures that violate the fundamental and supreme law of the Constitution and that consequently have no force or effect. But no court can interfere with the process of legislation, either by the General Court or by the people, before it is completed, to prevent the possible enactment of an unconstitutional measure. . . . The judiciary is barred from the legislative field just as it is from the executive.\u201d <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230, 246-247 (1946). <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>309 Mass. 571, 580-581 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We turn now to the two issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">1. <em>The Attorney General\u2019s Review of the Form of Petition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The plaintiffs assert that the Attorney General has no authority under art. 48 to refuse to certify an initiative petition on the ground that he is of opinion that it does not propose a law as required by art. 48.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Attorney General counters that he has such authority because his function includes a certification that the petition is \u201cin the proper form for submission to the people,\u201d and this requires him to determine whether the petition is within the scope permitted by art. 48. We agree with the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The Constitution imposes, as to the initiative process, several responsibilities upon the Attorney General which require the exercise of his discretion and legal judgment. For example, he prepares summaries and attests that amendments to the petitions are \u201cperfecting.\u201d Despite this grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of significant responsibilities, despite the fact that the Attorney General is the chief law officer of the Commonwealth, and despite the fact that no other State officer or official has been given explicit authority to rule upon the basic question related to the scope of art. 48, the plaintiffs would have us construe the word \u201cform\u201d in a narrow and technical sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">This court has quashed certification by the Attorney General of initiative petitions which did not propose a law and thus were beyond the scope of art. 48. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>357 Mass. 564, 578-579 (1970). See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>262 Mass. 603 (1928). It follows that the Attorney General has the prerogative, indeed the duty, pursuant to his review of the \u201cform\u201d of the initiative petition, to apply his legal judgment to the issue whether a law is proposed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Finally, in response to an argument of the plaintiffs that the Attorney General must not be permitted, in the certification process, to thwart the will of the people, we observe that, as in the instant case, the decision of the Attorney General as to certification is subject to judicial review. See <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230 (1946). This is a safeguard against errors of law or arbitrary action by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">2. <em>Does This Petition Propose a LawP</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">It is clear to us that the popular initiative is confined to laws and constitutional amendments. This conclusion derives from the plain meaning of the words of art. 48: \u201cLegislative power shall continue to be vested in the general court; but the people reserve to themselves the popular initiative, which is the power of a specified number of voters to submit constitutional amendments and laws to the people for approval or rejection.\u201d Art. 48, The Initiative, I. \u201cAn initiative petition shall set forth the full text of the constitutional amendment or law, hereinafter designated as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>measure, which is proposed by the petition.\u201d Art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 1. Since this case does not concern constitutional amendments, we must examine whether the proposed initiative relates to a law. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The first chapter of Part 2 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth establishes \u201cThe Legislative Power\u201d as including prerogatives other than law-making. The first section of that chapter provides that laws may be enacted by bicameral action of the two Houses and presentment to the Governor. However, in addition to these law-making powers, the respective branches of the General Court possess many unicameral powers, most of which are bestowed on them by Part II, c. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3. The Attorney General fairly summarizes some examples of these powers: \u201cThe House alone, for instance, may originate a money bill, Pt. II, c. 1, \u00a7 3, Art. 7, or make an impeachment, Pt. II, c. 1, \u00a7 3, Art. 6, while the Senate alone may hear and determine those impeachments, Pt. II, c. 1, \u00a7 2, Art. 8. The power to \u2018choose its own President, appoint its own officers, and determine its own rules of proceedings\u2019 is conferred exclusively on the Senate by Pt. II, c. 1, \u00a7 2, Art. 7, while the members of the House of Representatives possess the corollary power to \u2018choose their own Speaker, appoint their own officers, and settle the rules and orders of proceeding in their own House . . .\u2019by virtue of Pt. II, c. 1, \u00a7 3, Art. 10.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized the similar dual power of Congress in its bicameral lawmaking acts and its unicameral acts. <em>Immigration \u00e9r Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>Chadha, </em>462 U.S. 919, 954-955 (1983). Among the unicameral powers recognized by the Court is the power of each branch to act alone in determining its own rules and other internal matters. <em>Id. </em>at 955 n.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Thus not all legislative products are laws and we examine the proposed initiative to decide in which category of legislative power it resides, laws or rules. Since the proposal concededly relates to internal legislative procedures, which are within the constitutional unicameral powers of the respective Houses, it can logically be argued that the uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>camerai/bicameral distinction favors a conclusion that the proposed initiative does not concern a law. The Attorney General, however, submits what he believes are other critical distinctions between laws and rules. We consider them below, and we find them supportive of the conclusion that the proposed initiative does not relate to a law.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">First, laws govern conduct external to the legislative body, while rules govern internal procedures. <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>Chadha, supra </em>at 952. As we have seen, it is clear in this case that the initiative petition is aimed at the internal procedures of the branches of the Legislature, and this indicates that this petition establishes rules rather than laws because its principal purpose is to order the internal operations of the Senate and the House rather than to alter the legal duties of persons outside the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Second, a law is binding; a rule is not. See <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>126 Mass. 547, 550 (1781); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>66 N.H. 629, 632 (1891). Legislative rule-making authority is a continuous power absolute and beyond the challenge of any other tribunal. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ballin, </em>144 U.S. 1 (1892). Even if the proposed initiative were to be enacted, the continuing power of the individual branches to ignore its provisions and to determine their own procedures would render the proposal a nullity. This is in sharp contrast to the methods permitted by the Constitution for rescinding or amending laws. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that this power over procedures rests, not in the \u201cGeneral Court,\u201d but in the separate Houses of the Legislature. Part II, c. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, of the Massachusetts Constitution. See <em>Dinan </em>v. <em>Swig, </em>223 Mass. 516, 517 (1916). Thus each branch of each successive Legislature may proceed to make rules without seeking concurrence or approval of the other branch, or of the executive, and without being bound by action taken by an earlier Legislature. <em>Id. </em>at 517, 519. The plaintiffs argued before us that if their initiative were enacted, the Houses of the Legislature would not have unicameral power to nullify its content. In this they are mistaken, because such a result would effectively vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>constitutional authority of the Senate and House to order their own internal procedures. This cannot be brought about by an initiative petition unless that petition, unlike the one before us, seeks and accomplishes a constitutional amendment to that end. Thus the initiative proposed here should not be characterized as a law because it is not binding. If enacted, it would be no more than a nonbinding expression of opinion, and we have held that such a plebiscite or declaration is not a law and is not an appropriate subject for the popular initiative. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>357 Mass. 564, 578 (1970). See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>262 Mass. 603, 604-605 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">One of the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments derives from the undisputed fact that the Commonwealth has statutes which directly relate to the internal proceedings of the two Houses. See G. L. c. 3. As we view their argument, the plaintiffs construct a syllogism: the Legislature has enacted such statutes; the popular initiative is as broad as the Legislature\u2019s law-making power; the initiative therefore can encompass the internal proceedings of the Houses of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The flaw in the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is in their minor premise. We agree that the popular initiative is coextensive with the Legislature\u2019s law-making power under Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, but, as we have seen above, the power to determine their own rules of proceedings is exclusively granted to the Senate and the House respectively by virtue of Pt. II, c. 1, \u00a7 2, art. 7, and Pt. II, c. 1, \u00a7 3, art. 10. The enactment of statutes relating to internal proceedings was obviously accomplished by the voluntary participation of each of the two Houses. Thus each House was essentially engaged in its rule-making function. It does not follow, from this voluntary exercise by the Houses, that others, through the popular initiative, may introduce rules under the guise of laws. The analogy urged by the plaintiffs is nonexistent. Such procedural statutes are not binding upon the Houses; consequently they are not laws in the sense contemplated in art. 48. Either branch, under its exclusive rule-making constitutional prerogatives, is free to disregard or supersede such statutes by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>unicameral action. See <em>Dinan </em>v. <em>Swig, </em>223 Mass. 516, 517, 519 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The plaintiffs also fail in their final argument, in which they rely upon the language in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>375 Mass. 795, 817 (1978), as follows: \u201c[Ejxcept as to matters expressly excluded, the scope of the power of the people to enact laws directly is as extensive as that of the General Court. The matter of regulating legislative proceedings is not excluded from the initiative process. Art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2.\u201d The second of the two sentences, whether read alone or in context with the first sentence, does not assist the plaintiffs, because it merely states the indisputable fact that internal proceedings are not matters explicitly excluded in art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2, from the initiative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Further, the statement that \u201cthe scope of the power of the people to enact laws directly is as extensive as that of the General Court,\u201d is correct and is not inconsistent with the conclusions we have reached in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where internal proceedings are concerned, future legislative sessions cannot be bound by an action of the General Court. \u201cThis discretion to determine the method of procedure cannot under the Constitution [Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 2, art. 7, and Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 3, art. 10] be abrogated by action taken by an earlier Legislature.\u201d <em>Dinan </em>v. <em>Swig, supra </em>at 519. In sum, the rules of future sessions of the House or the Senate cannot under the Constitution be controlled by vote of the General Court or by vote of the people, or even by vote of the respective legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>lative branches. The people through the popular initiative do indeed, as we stated in the 1978 <em>Opinion, </em>have a power to enact legislation which is coextensive with the power of the General Court. However, the plaintiffs, in their initiative petition which seeks to establish rules for future legislative sessions, claim for the people a power greater than that of the General Court. In this the plaintiffs are clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Judgment shall enter vacating the preliminary injunction and declaring that the Attorney General was within his authority under art. 48 in declining to certify the proposed initiative, and further declaring that the petition here does not propose a law and consequently is not a proper subject for the popular initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\"> Pertinent parts of art. 48, as amended by art. 74 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">\u201cI. <em>Definition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">\u201cLegislative power shall continue to be vested in the general court;
