The appeal was brought directly to this court pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42. The plaintiff argues that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed because the division\u2019s denial of benefits was arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by substantial evidence. He also asserts that the division\u2019s decision to deny benefits was based upon an error of law. We disagree with all the plaintiff\u2019s contentions. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We summarize the relevant evidence presented at the hearing held before a hearing examiner of the division on May 8, 1981, and June 8, 1981.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff and Edward Tucker founded a company called The Casual Female, Inc., in July, 1979, for the purpose of selling women\u2019s apparel through a chain of already existing retail stores. By the fall of 1980, the corporation showed an operating loss of $700,000. At all times material to the present controversy, the plaintiff was a 50 per cent shareholder of The Casual Female, Inc., and was president and chief executive officer. Tucker was the treasurer and the other 50 per cent shareholder. At the time of incorporation, the plaintiff and Tucker entered into a subscription agreement whereby the plaintiff agreed to purchase approximately $18,000 of Class B nonvoting stock by December 15, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The plaintiff gave the following testimony. In the middle or at the end of November, 1980, he informed Tucker that he would be selling his shares of stock in the company back to the company as he was permitted to do by the terms of the agreement. He had decided to sell his shares of stock back to the company because of certain disputes he had had with Tucker. These disputes arose because the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>believed that Tucker had been improperly charging certain expenses to The Casual Female, Inc., which should have been charged instead to other related companies owned by Tucker. When he informed Tucker that he would be selling back his shares of stock, the plaintiff also mentioned that he \u201cprobably at some future date would be leaving\u201d the employment of the company. However, he never told Tucker that he was resigning nor did he tender a written resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The plaintiff also testified that he spoke with his attorney before actually tendering his shares of stock to the company. His attorney informed him that he could sell his stock in the company under the governing corporate agreements without having to resign his employment. As a consequence, he had a subsequent conversation with Tucker in which he said that \u201cany conversation that transpired between the two of us was in no way ... an indication that I was resigning.\u201d The plaintiff explained to Tucker that his decision to sell back his shares of stock was separate from his employment. The plaintiff further testified that at this time Tucker responded by saying, \u201cYou told me you were leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">On December 5, 1980, the plaintiff formally tendered his shares of stock to the company. On the same day, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney wrote to Tucker\u2019s attorney and informed him that the plaintiff intended to continue to work for the company and that his decision to sell back his shares of stock was not a resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The plaintiff testified that Tucker then attempted to force the plaintiff out of the company. At some point, Tucker told other employees of the company that the plaintiff was leaving the company. On December 10, 1980, Tucker sent the plaintiff an office form which indicated that the plaintiff had voluntarily resigned and that his last day of work would be December 12, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">On approximately December 8, 1980, Tucker\u2019s attorney inquired whether the plaintiff intended to purchase the shares of stock as provided in the subscription agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s attorney responded at that time, and by letter dated December 15, 1980, that the plaintiff\u2019s decision to sell back his shares of stock terminated any obligations he had under the subscription agreement. By letter dated December 16, 1980, Tucker informed the plaintiff that his failure to buy the shares of stock in accordance with the subscription agreement constituted a breach of the agreement. The letter further stated: \u201cAs a consequence of your breach you are no longer employed by The Casual Female, Inc., your salary is terminated as of the date hereof, and office space shall no longer be provided to you.\u201d When the plaintiff arrived at his office on December 17, 1980, he was treated as though he were no longer an employee and, during the course of the day, discovered that all of his belongings had been removed from his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In March, 1981, the plaintiff received a notice from The Casual Female, Inc., that it intended to hold a special meeting of the shareholders for the purpose of removing him without cause from office as a director of the corporation. The plaintiff received another letter from The Casual Female, Inc., indicating that he had been removed as a director and that, at a directors\u2019 meeting following the special stockholders\u2019 meeting, he had been removed as president of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Tucker remembered the encounter with the plaintiff in mid-November, 1980, differently than did the plaintiff. Tucker testified that in mid-November, the plaintiff went into Tucker\u2019s office and said, \u201cI promised you I would let you know first and I am leaving. . . [T]his company\u2019s going nowhere. We had a loss of about $700,000, I can\u2019t see where we\u2019re going to make it and I\u2019m going to resign.\u201d Tucker testified that the plaintiff said he would be gone within a month. Tucker also testified that during the conversation the plaintiff suggested that Tucker hire a replacement for him and offered some suggestions on how to obtain a replacement. Tucker also denied that the plaintiff spoke with him on a second occasion to clarify that he was not resigning.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>1. The plaintiff argues that the decision of the division denying him unemployment compensation benefits was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and unsupported by substantial evidence. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). The division denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for benefits on the basis of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e), </em>as appearing in St. 1975, c. 684, \u00a7 78, which provides that no benefits shall be paid to an individual who has left his work \u201cvoluntarily without good cause attributable to the employing unit or its agent.\u201d The hearing examiner specifically found \u201cthat the [plaintiff] initiated his own separation when in November, 1980 he advised his corporate partner that within 30 days he intended to leave the corporation due to dissatisfaction with business losses, that he then proceeded to exercise his option to sell his shares of stock back to the corporation, that he then refused to buy shares of common stock in accordance with a subscription agreement, and that he then sought new employment as an employee of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We review the division\u2019s decision by applying the substantial evidence standard of review. G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See <em>Trustees of Deerfield Academy </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>382 Mass. 26, 31 (1980). The plaintiff argues that certain evidence precludes a finding that he voluntarily resigned, including: (1) his testimony that he never explicitly told Tucker that he was resigning and that he later clarified to Tucker that he did not intend to resign, (2) his attorney\u2019s letters written to Tucker\u2019s attorney stating that the plaintiff did not intend to resign, (3) Tucker\u2019s purported firing of the plaintiff on the ground that he breached the subscription agreement, (4) Tucker\u2019s actions on December 17, 1980, in removing the plaintiff\u2019s belongings from his office and (5) Tucker\u2019s actions in 1981 in removing the plaintiff as a director and as president. We disagree. The evidence about the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s departure from his employment as president and chief executive officer of The Casual Female, Inc., consisted principally of conflicting oral testimony. Tucker testified that in mid-November the plaintiff unequivocally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>told him that he intended to terminate his employment in one month. Tucker further stated that the plaintiff never engaged in a second conversation where he allegedly \u201cclarified\u201d that he did not intend to resign. The hearing examiner was free to believe Tucker\u2019s testimony and to disbelieve that of the plaintiff. Furthermore, none of the subsequent events or communications, including the letters from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, vitiates the propriety of the hearing examiner\u2019s conclusion. The hearing examiner could find that Tucker accepted the plaintiff\u2019s notice of resignation and that the letters from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not render ineffective either the plaintiff\u2019s initial notice of resignation or Tucker\u2019s acceptance thereof. \u201cThe responsibility for determining the credibility and weight of . . . testimony rests with the hearing officer . . . .\u201d <em>Trustees of Deerfield Academy, supra </em>at 31. \u201cIf the findings are . . . supported [by evidence], it is not open to the District Court or to this court to substitute other views as to what should be the determination on the facts.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>347 Mass. 264, 268 (1964), quoting <em>Wagstaff </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>322 Mass. 664, 667 (1948). Viewing the entirety of the evidence, we conclude that the hearing examiner\u2019s findings are supported adequately in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">2. The plaintiff next asserts that the division\u2019s decision is based upon an error of law. He argues that under section 4 of Article Fourth of the company\u2019s by-law, the only way that he could resign as president was by submitting a written resignation to the board of directors. Section 4 of Article Fourth provides: \u201cAny officer may resign by delivering his written resignation to the corporation at its principal office or to the President or Clerk, and such resignation shall be effective upon receipt unless it is specified to be effective at some other time . . . .\u201d Thus, the plaintiff argues, even if he had told Tucker in mid-November, 1980, that he was resigning, such resignation would have been entirely without effect because it was not written and because he informed only the treasurer and not the board of directors. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>First, it is clear that the provision in the by-law that requires notice of resignation to be written is a requirement designed to protect the company and to ensure that it receives adequate notice. Resignation without compliance with this provision may have violated the plaintiff\u2019s contractual duty, but it nevertheless was a resignation which the company was free to accept. Cf. <em>Karras </em>v. <em>Trione, </em>135 Colo. 229, 235 (1957) (where employment agreement provided that notice of termination be in writing, failure to comply will not result in liability of employee where employer waives requirement by receiving oral notice and acting on it).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Second, the plaintiff\u2019s argument that any alleged resignation was ineffective because he gave it to the treasurer of the company and not to the board of directors is also without merit. The record discloses that only Tucker and the plaintiff were on the board of directors. Therefore, by tendering his resignation to Tucker, the plaintiff effectively tendered his resignation to the board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Thus, we conclude that the decision of the division is supported by substantial evidence and is not based on an error of law. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court affirming the division\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"> The board of review of the division denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for further review on July 15, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
