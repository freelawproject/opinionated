L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(b), </em>as appearing in St. 1980, c. 436, \u00a7 4, and was sentenced to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Walpole, for a term of eight to ten years. In January, 1983, the defendant filed a motion asking that he be resentenced pursuant to our decisions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. 567 (1982) <em>(Gagnon I), </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. 768 (1982) <em>(Gagnon II), </em>cert. denied, 461 U.S. 921, and 464 U.S. 815 (1983). The judge who heard the motion reported a question to the Appeals Court concerning the applicability of our rulings in <em>Gagnon I </em>and <em>Gagnon II </em>to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>defendant\u2019s motion. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979). In particular, the judge asked whether our holding that the sanctions imposed by G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(a), </em>were void for vagueness, <em>Gagnon I, supra </em>at 574, requires the defendant be resentenced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We hold that the sanctions enumerated in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(b), </em>are not unconstitutional and that the defendant is not entitled to re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The defendant does not challenge the substantive validity of his conviction. Because the prior offense charged in the indictment \u201cis not part of the crime charged [and] ... relates only to punishment,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>389 Mass. 316, 321 (1983), citing <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>173 Mass. 322, 326-327 (1899), aff\u2019d, 180 U.S. 311, 313 (1901), the defendant reasons that G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 (b), is merely an enhanced punishment dependent on the validity of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(a). </em>See <em>Gagnon I, supra. </em>The defendant also argues that the second offense statute cannot be applied because conviction thereunder is limited to a prior conviction under the unconstitutional first offense statute. We reject both of the defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The short answer to the defendant\u2019s first claim is that G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(b), </em>is not dependent on the portion of \u00a7 32 <em>(a) </em>held unconstitutional in <em>Gagnon 1. </em>The issue in <em>Gagnon I </em>was \u201cwhether the defendants had sufficient notice of the penalty which attached to their conduct to satisfy due process requirements.\u201d <em>Gagnon II, supra </em>at 770. Our consideration of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(a), </em>was limited to the constitutionality of its penalty provisions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, ante </em>326, 335 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The penalty provisions of \u00a7 32 <em>(b) </em>are clear and unambiguous. The statute provides for a term of \u201cnot less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>five years and not more than fifteen years\u201d on conviction of a second offense under \u00a7 32. The statute states that \u201c[a]ny person convicted of violating this subdivision shall be punished by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of five years in the state prison.\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(b). </em>A fine may be imposed, \u201cbut not in lieu of the mandatory term of imprisonment, as authorized herein.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">There is no ambiguity with respect to the Legislature\u2019s intent to make distribution of Class A controlled substances illegal. The elements of the crime are set forth in \u00a7 32 <em>(a) </em>and notify persons of \u201cordinary intelligence what conduct is proscribed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 111 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that he could not have been convicted of distribution of heroin under \u00a7 32 <em>(a), </em>and, therefore, he has not committed a prior offense under \u00a7 32 <em>(a). </em>The second offense provisions of \u00a7 <em>32(b) </em>are applicable \u201cafter one or more prior convictions of <em>this offense </em>or of any offense of any other jurisdiction, federal, state or territorial, which is the same as or necessarily includes the elements of said section ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). The defendant reads the statute as referring solely to St. 1980, c. 436, \u00a7 4. The statute, however, is not that limited. We read the words \u201cthis offense\u201d as referring to convictions under the 1980 statute or under the prior versions of the drug statute. The defendant does not contest the fact that he had <em>two </em>prior convictions, one for distribution of heroin and one for possession of heroin with intent to distribute, under the prior version of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(a). </em>See St. 1971, c. 1071, \u00a7 1. Thus, the defendant\u2019s conduct in distributing heroin after prior convictions for heroin offenses falls within the plain meaning of \u00a7 32 <em>(b), </em>and he is subject to sentencing under the enhanced penalties provisions of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">In conclusion, the answer to the question reported is that persons with prior heroin convictions may be convicted and sentenced for a second offense of distributing heroin pursuant to G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(b), </em>despite the unconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>vagueness of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(a). </em>This matter is remanded to the Superior Court for such proceedings as may be needed in light of our answer to the reported question.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-8\"> The judge stated in his report, \u201cI respectfully request [the] court to determine whether a defendant could be convicted and sentenced for a second offense of distributing heroin under the provisions of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 (b), despite the unconstitutional vagueness of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 (a), as those two sub-sections appeared in St. 1980, c. 436, \u00a7 4.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
