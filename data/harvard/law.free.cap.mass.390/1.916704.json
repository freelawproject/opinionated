Taplin, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. A judge in the Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Because the judge received affidavits in connection with that motion, the motion properly should have been treated as a motion for summary judgment. Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). See <em>White </em>v. <em>Peabody Constr. Co., </em>386 Mass. 121, 126-127 (1982). We conclude that the action was properly dismissed as to the individual defendants but not as to the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">The individual defendants were emergency medical technicians certified under G. L. c. 111C and were members of the Chatham rescue squ\u00e1d on duty on July 8, 1979. As part of their duties as town employees, they responded that night to an emergency call involving Richard Taplin. They took Taplin from the scene of his injury to a private home in Chatham. The complaint alleges that the individual defendants were negligent in not taking Taplin to a hospital and that, on the following day, Taplin was admitted to a hospital where he underwent emergency brain surgery and died on July 12, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">The uncontroverted affidavit of each individual defendant states that he was acting at all times in his capacity as an emergency medical technician for the town rescue squad. Under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act (G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, as appearing in St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 15), a public employee is not liable for \u201cpersonal injury or death caused by his negligent or wrongful act or omission while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d The public employer, however, is liable for such an injury or death as if it were a private individual, subject to certain limitations. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2. Consequently, judgment was properly entered dismissing the action against the municipal employee defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b19-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>The town argues that it, as employer, is entitled to the immunity from liability granted to emergency medical technicians by G. L.c. 111C, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 14 provides that an emergency medical technician certified under G. L. c. 111C, who in the performance of his duties and in good faith, renders emergency first aid or transportation to an injured person shall not be personally liable as a result of rendering aid or transporting such person to a safe place. We assume without deciding that, on the facts set forth in the affidavits of the individual defendants, they would be immune from liability under \u00a7 14 as well as under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. The question is whether \u00a7 14 not only provides immunity to these agents but also grants immunity to the principal, the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">We conclude that neither \u00a7 14 nor common law principles extend immunity from liability to the employer of an emergency medical technician who is immune from liability. The language of \u00a7 14 suggests this result by focusing on the employee who shall not \u201cbe personally in any way liable.\u201d The statutory language does not, however, clearly resolve the issue. Two circumstances strongly support our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">First, the rule in this Commonwealth and the rule more commonly adopted across the country is that an agent\u2019s immunity does not extend to a principal against whom liability is sought under the doctrine of respondeat superior. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Benson Coal Co., </em>301 Mass. 145, 147 (1938) (intrafamily immunity did not protect negligent family member\u2019s employer from liability); <em>Pittsley </em>v. <em>David, </em>298 Mass. 552, 553 (1937) (same); <em>Raynor </em>v. <em>Arcata, </em>11 Cal. 2d 113, 121 (1938) (statutory immunity of municipal employee did not free city from liability); <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>101 Wis. 2d 273, 283 (1981) (same); Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 217 (b) (1958). A statute which is silent on the subject of the principal\u2019s immunity but grants immunity to the agent would be expected to have no effect on the established common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">Second, the legislative history of \u00a7 14 shows that the Legislature did not intend to extend immunity to an employer whose employee had been granted \u00a7 14 immunity. On September 27, 1977, the Governor returned to the General Court with comments 1977 House Bill No. 6143, which contained a proposed \u00a7 14 for G. L. c. 111C. 1977 House Doc. No. 6602.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Governor stated that \u201cthe bill should clearly indicate that the exemption from liability applies only to the individual policeman, fireman, or technician, and not to his employer, so that injured persons will not be denied any recourse against any other party that would otherwise be available.\u201d The Governor recommended in this regard that the words \u201ccivilly or criminally\u201d in House No. 6143 be deleted and the words \u201cpersonally in any way\u201d be substituted. The House and Senate made the suggested changes and the bill was enacted as thus amended. 1977 House Journal 1957-1958; <em>id. </em>2011-2012; 1977 Senate Journal 1550, 1559-1560. See St. 1977, c. 649. It is appropriate in construing an ambiguous statute to look to its legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>history, including formal communications from the Governor to the General Court in returning bills submitted to him for action. See <em>Treasurerer &amp; Receiver Gen. </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>388 Mass. 410, 423 (1983); <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 373 </em>Mass. 819, 826 n.9 (1977). We regard the changes made by the Legislature after the Governor returned the bill as showing conclusively that the Legislature did not intend to extend immunity to the employer of a person granted immunity under G. L. c. 111C, \u00a7 14. Therefore, the common law rule that a principal does not obtain the benefit of an agent\u2019s immunity applies and, because the town is not immune from liability (G. L. c. 258) on any ground shown on the record, the action against the town should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The judgment dismissing the action against the individual defendants is affirmed. The judgment dismissing the action against the town of Chatham is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b18-7\"> General Laws c. 258, \u00a7 2, provides that the failure of an employee reasonably to cooperate in the defense of an action will cause him to be jointly liable with the public employer to the extent his noncooperation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>prejudiced the defense. We regard this language to be concerned with the relationship of the employer and the employee and not as a bar to dismissal of an action against an employee, subject, however, to the employer\u2019s rights against any employee wbo does not reasonably cooperate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b19-9\"> General Laws c. 111C, \u00a7 14, inserted by St. 1977, c. 649, states: \u201cNo emergency medical technician certified under the provisions of this chapter and no police officer or firefighter, who in the performance of his duties and in good faith renders emergency first aid or transportation to an injured person or to a person incapacitated by illness shall be personally in any way liable as a result of rendering such aid or as a result of. transporting such person to a hospital or other safe place, nor shall he be liable to a hospital for its expenses if, under emergency conditions, he causes the admission of such person to said hospital.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b20-6\">Section 14 as submitted to the Governor read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">\u201cNo emergency medical technician certified under the provisions of this chapter and no police officer or firefighter, who in good faith renders emergency first aid or transportation to an injured person or to a person incapacitated by illness shall be civilly or criminally liable as a result of rendering such aid or as a result of transporting such person to a hospital or other safe place, nor shall he be liable to a hospital for its expenses if, under emergency conditions, he causes the admission of such person to said hospital.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
