Edison proposed to recover, as a cost of service reflected in its rates, its investment in Pilgrim II, that is, its share of the net costs of the project, estimated (after salvage) to exceed $278,000,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to its authority under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, the department suspended the proposed rates until the earlier of May 1, 1982, or its further order. The department then undertook what it characterized in its decision of April 30, 1982, as \u201cprobably the lengthiest and most complex rate case to have come before the Department in recent years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">All the appeals are from the department\u2019s April 30, 1982, decision (G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5) and are before us on a reservation and report by a single justice. In large measure, these various appeals are challenges to the department\u2019s determination to permit Edison through its rates to amortize a portion of its investment in Pilgrim II. The department said in its decision that \u201cthe question presented by the demise of the Pilgrim II project is one of the most serious and the most controversial regulatory issues that the Department has ever confronted.\u201d There are collateral issues concerning (a) the department\u2019s treatment of tax benefits resulting from the abandonment of the project and (b) the department\u2019s approval of carrying charges on a por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tian of the amortized recovery. The city of Boston presents an entirely separate challenge to its street lighting rates. Before we discuss these substantive issues, we shall deal with procedural questions related to certain of the appeals. We shall then consider the principal issue presented in these appeals. We conclude that the department committed no error of law in its decision to permit Edison to recover as a cost of service a portion of its investment in Pilgrim II and to collect certain carrying charges. Finally, we shall discuss and reject the city of Boston\u2019s challenge to the street lighting rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Procedural Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The department and Edison argue that the appeal of Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, Inc. (MASSPIRG), was not seasonably filed and that it must be dismissed. We need not pass on this question to the extent the issues MASSPIRG raises are also raised by appellants whose appeals were timely. We could, in such a situation, simply treat MASSPIRG\u2019s brief as one filed by an amicus curiae.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is, however, one issue raised by MASSPIRG not advanced by any other party in these appeals and, because of that issue, we must consider the timeliness of MASSPIRG\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Following the department\u2019s April 30, 1982, decision, various motions for reconsideration were filed. On May 20, pursuant to its authority under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, the department granted an extension of time for the filing of any appeal from its April 30 decision until ten days after its final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>order on the motions for reconsideration. Among the motions filed was a motion of MASSPIRG that Commissioner Edward L. Belgrade (Commissioner Belgrade) recuse himself from further participation on the question of Edison\u2019s recovery of the cost of Pilgrim II. The department issued an order on July 20, 1982, concerning the various pending motions, including MASSPIRG\u2019s motion that Commissioner Belgrade recuse himself. Commissioner Belgrade declined to recuse himself from any portion of the proceeding, and the other two commissioners concurred in his decision. MASSPIRG states that the order was mailed on July 21, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">On August 13, 1982, MASSPIRG filed its petition for appeal with the secretary of the department. That petition was not filed within ten days of the department\u2019s final order concerning the motions filed following the April 30 decision. In the circumstances, the April 30 decision was probably the final order from which, under G. L. c. 25, an appeal had to be taken within twenty days but for the ten-day extension granted by the department. See <em>Plymouth County Nuclear Information Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>374 Mass. 236, 244-245 (1978). But we need not decide that point because the motion seeking Commissioner Belgrade's recusal was a new matter decided on July 20, 1982, and as to that matter MASSPIRG had twenty days from the date of service in which to appeal. G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">MASSPIRG\u2019s petition for appeal, however, was not filed with the department\u2019s secretary within twenty days of service (on July 21) of notice of the July 20 denial of its motion to recuse, but rather it was filed on August 13. MASSPIRG seeks to bridge the three day gap (from August 10 to August 13) by reliance on Mass. R. Civ. P. 6 (d), 365 Mass. 747 (1974), which adds three days to any prescribed period within which action must be taken when notice is served by mail. To apply the rule to this situation would contradict the provisions of G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, specifically governing the timing of appeals. Moreover, rules of court do not govern procedures in the Executive Department. They apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>proceedings in courts. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 1, as appearing in 385 Mass. 1213 (1982); Mass. R. A. P. 1, as amended, 378 Mass. 925 (1979). The late filing of MASSPIRG\u2019s notice of appeal with the department\u2019s secretary is an error of a type that calls for dismissal of MASSPIRG\u2019s appeal. <em>Schulte </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>369 Mass. 74, 79 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Although we conclude that MASSPIRG\u2019s appeal must be dismissed, we think it appropriate to comment on the underlying claim that Commissioner Belgrade should have disqualified himself in this proceeding because he appeared in the prior, related proceeding (D.P.U. 19494) on behalf of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy Resources (MEOER) of which he was the Director of Resource Development. Although his involvement was not extensive, he did participate in writing and in filing a brief in D.P.U. 19494 on behalf of MEOER in support of a determination that the Pilgrim II project was reasonable. The brief expressed unenthusiastic approval of the project.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Commissioner Belgrade was appointed a commissioner of the department on September 15, 1981, while D.P.U. 19494 was pending. He recused himself from that matter, which was decided by the other two commissioners one week later.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The earlier proceeding (D.P.U. 19494) was an investigation by the department of future demand for electricity in Edison\u2019s service territory, the appropriate level of Edison\u2019s reserve capacity, and alternatives to Edison\u2019s program for the construction of Pilgrim II. The hearings in D.P.U. 19494 concluded on September 28, 1979, after 121 days of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>hearings. Almost two years later the department concluded, on September 22, 1981, that oil as a source of electric generation was not an acceptable option and \u201cthat nuclear power, despite its recent problems [was] most likely to be the least expensive generation alternative available to the Company.\u201d The department concluded that Edison\u2019s generation construction program was reasonable. The decision in D.P.U. 19494 did not determine whether Edison could recover costs associated with Pilgrim II, whether Edison reasonably could finance the project, and, of course, whether Edison acted prudently in continuing with the project based on events occurring after the record closed in D.P.U. 19494.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">On March 16, 1982, responding to Commissioner Selgrade\u2019s request, the State Ethics Commission advised Commissioner Selgrade that, on the facts presented by him, he would not violate the conflict of interest law (G. L. c. 268A) by participating in deciding Edison\u2019s pending rate proceeding. The Ethics Commission declined to pass on whether Commissioner Belgrade\u2019s participation would warrant the conclusion that, on common law principles, he should disqualify himself for bias. The Ethics Commission noted that Commissioner Belgrade\u2019s \u201cprevious participation, although advocating a position favorable to the Company was, in fact, a part of [his] role as a state employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">MASSPIRG was a party to the earlier proceeding (D.P.U. 19494) and had notice, therefore, of Commissioner Belgrade\u2019s involvement in the earlier proceeding. One of MASSPIRG\u2019s current counsel filed an affidavit with the motion to recuse stating that he did not know of the commissioner\u2019s involvement in the earlier proceeding until May 28, 1982. We do not know when other representatives of MASSPIRG learned of the commissioner\u2019s participation in the earlier proceeding, but the inference is unavoidable that some representatives of MASSPIRG knew or should have known of that involvement at the time of Commissioner Belgrade\u2019s participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>We comment on this issue because it presents the question whether the proceeding was essentially unfair because of Commissioner Belgrade\u2019s involvement in it, a circumstance which, if proved, we might regard as appropriate for our consideration on our own motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the proceeding was not tainted with unfairness justifying the reversal of the department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">There are several reasons for our conclusion. MASSPIRG\u2019s motion that Commissioner Belgrade recuse himself sought recusal only as to his further participation in the proceeding on the question of Edison\u2019s recovery of the cost of Pilgrim II. All action after the recusal motion was filed was taken by all three commissioners, including the commissioner who dissented on the Pilgrim II issue. None of that subsequent action involved the Pilgrim II recovery issue directly. The motion was made after the proceeding had been substantially concluded following many days of hearings and the filing of a decision of over 250 pages. Other parties, including the Attorney General, have not argued this issue to us. Commissioner Belgrade participated in the earlier proceeding as a State employee advocating policies of the Executive Department which may or may not have been consistent with his own views. MASSPIRG was served a copy of the MEOER brief signed by Commissioner Belgrade and thus had notice of his involvement in that matter well before the present proceeding began. The State Ethics Commission considered the matter and ruled that Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>sio ner Belgrade\u2019s participation would not violate the conflict of interest law, including G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23 <em>(e), </em>as then amended, concerning the appearance of impropriety. The earlier proceeding, although related to this subsequent rate proceeding, focused on different issues, and the determination of the first matter in Edison\u2019s favor did not preordain Edison\u2019s recovery of all or part of the costs of Pilgrim II. That conclusion is shown dramatically by the decision of one of the commissioners who in the first proceeding decided in Edison\u2019s favor but in the second proceeding voted against Edison\u2019s recovery of any portion of the cost of Pilgrim II. Finally, if Commissioner Belgrade had not participated in the Pilgrim II decision, the department would have been deadlocked on that issue and no decision at all might have been possible, with the result that no final action would have been taken on Edison\u2019s rate filing (at least on this issue) within six months and the rates as filed would have become effective in full on May 1, 1982, when the statutory suspension of the rate filing expired. See G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18. If such a deadlock had occurred, Commissioner Belgrade\u2019s involvement might have been justified under the rule of necessity. See <em>Moran </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Littleton, </em>317 Mass. 591, 593-594 (1945); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Will, </em>449 U.S. 200, 213-216 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Stanley U. Robinson, Third, a residential ratepayer, filed two appeals from determinations of the department in the rate proceeding. The first appeal challenges the department\u2019s denial of his petition to intervene in the proceeding as a party. The other is an appeal from the department\u2019s final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The department denied Robinson\u2019s motion to intervene as a party but granted him \u201climited participant status,\u201d stating that he did not have status as a party but that he could conduct discovery and file memoranda or briefs. The Attorney General was designated as Robinson\u2019s \u201clead counsel.\u201d The issue of Robinson\u2019s participation as a party was within the broad discretion of the department under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 10, cl. (4), as appearing in St. 1978, c. 60, \u00a7 1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 1, 45-46, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 921 (1978). The department did not abuse its discretion. It did not have to hold a hearing on the motion to intervene, nor did it, in the circumstances, have to state its reasons. A judgment shall be entered affirming the department\u2019s order denying Robinson\u2019s motion to intervene.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Edison moved to dismiss Robinson\u2019s appeal from the department\u2019s final decision on the ground that under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, only an \u201caggrieved <em>party </em>in interest\u201d may appeal from a decision of the department (emphasis supplied). In <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>366 Mass. 667, 673 (1975), we defined those persons who could qualify as an \u201caggrieved party in interest.\u201d Robinson was not admitted as an intervener or party; he had no right to intervene as a matter of law; and, as a residential customer alleging no peculiar damage to himself, he had no constitutional or statutory right to participate fully in the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, Edison\u2019s motion to dismiss Robinson\u2019s appeal should be allowed. Judgment shall be entered dismissing Robinson\u2019s appeal from the final decision of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Abandonment of Pilgrim II</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The principal dispute in these appeals involves the propriety of the department\u2019s determination to permit Edison to recover, by amortization over thirteen years, a portion of its investment in Pilgrim II and to permit Edison to collect a carrying charge on a portion of the unamortized balance. We conclude that there is no legal impediment to the department\u2019s permitting Edison, or any other utility, to recover its prudent investment in a nuclear power plant reasonably abandoned before completion and to recover carrying charges on amounts amortized. We further con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>elude that the department\u2019s decision conforms to the requirements of the State Administrative Procedure Act (G. L. c. 30A), in terms both of the adequacy of the statement of reasons for the decision and of the sufficiency of substantial evidence to support the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The department\u2019s April 30, 1982, decision in this case devoted almost 100 pages to a discussion of \u201cPilgrim II Cost Recovery.\u201d The department began by considering the background of Pilgrim II, including its decision in D.P.U. 19494. The department concluded that it was not barred by any rule of law from allowing recovery of costs of Pilgrim II even though Pilgrim II never generated any electricity. It characterized the abandonment of Pilgrim II as an extraordinary loss, a loss of a magnitude never before considered by the department. This loss required \u201cseparate, independent and unique rules that properly reflect the just balance of the affected interests\u201d (ratepayers and investors). The department looked for guidance to decisions in other jurisdictions, including a decision of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and saw the results as overwhelmingly favoring recovery of some part of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Edison, the department said, had the burden of proving that Pilgrim II was a prudent investment from its inception to cancellation. D.P.U. 19494 was dispositive of the issue of the reasonableness of Edison\u2019s construction program, based on the record in that proceeding. However, D.P.U. 19494 did not consider events occurring after the record closed in that proceeding, and it did not determine Edison\u2019s ability to finance Pilgrim II. The department\u2019s decision then discussed the evidence on which the Attorney General and other parties relied in arguing that Edison\u2019s investment in Pilgrim II was imprudent, or at least became so, long before Edison determined to cancel the project on September 23, 1981. Next, the department considered Edison\u2019s contentions in support of its claim that Pilgrim II was a reasonable, prudent investment up to the date Edison cancelled the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The department stated certain general conclusions. The Pilgrim II loss was large compared to the size of Edison and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>in this respect, unprecedented elsewhere in the country. The loss approximated two-thirds of Edison\u2019s entire net worth, more than 25% of its permanently invested capital, and more than earnings retained and reinvested over its eighty-six year history. Pilgrim II was originally intended to meet a growth in customer demand. Although that demand never materialized, Edison needed to reduce its dependence on increasingly expensive and unreliable supplies of oil. Rate regulatory practices in the Commonwealth required Edison to exclude the costs of Pilgrim II from its rate structure during the construction process. By these practices, capitalized costs \u2014 costs of construction work in progress (CWIP) and the cost of financing the construction, allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) \u2014 are not recoverable from ratepayers until the project is completed. When it is completed, capitalized costs may be recovered through depreciation allowances reflected in the rates. As a final general principle, the department noted that the risk that Pilgrim II would not be completed was not reflected in the return allowed investors in Edison\u2019s previous rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The department then stated that, if Edison were to absorb the Pilgrim II loss, \u201cregulatory policies, and the returns they dictate, appear to us to be inadequate to compensate investors for the new level of risk. Investors who are inadequately compensated do not remain investors for long. . . . The disdain of the financial markets for this Company will be formidable . . The cost of new capital would increase and service would deteriorate unavoidably because of the scarcity of reasonably priced capital. The question \u201c[i]n a very real sense,\u201d as the department saw it, was not who should bear the costs of the abandonment of Pilgrim II but \u201crather, when should those costs be faced.\u201d Edison, it said, must have the ability to raise capital to invest in facilities to reduce its 65 % dependency on oil for generating electricity. The controlling consideration is that the company must be able to meet its service obligation. The department saw \u201cno realistic way\u201d to make capital available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>for oil displacement if the Pilgrim II loss were to be fully absorbed by Edison\u2019s shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The department then considered the question of the prudence of Edison\u2019s actions during the history of the project. It noted particular factors that affected the reasonableness of the project from time to time. The cost of oil was increasing, and Pilgrim I had saved Edison\u2019s customers millions of dollars. However, the cost of construction, regulatory delays in obtaining approval of the construction of Pilgrim II, and a decline in projected demand for electricity presented problems. The accident at Three Mile Island occurred in the spring of 1979. Through 1978 and 1979 the propriety of continuing with the project became less clear, but, in the department\u2019s view, not to the point where prudence required abandonment. In the first half of 1980, problems arose from the delay in obtaining a construction permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and from projections of increased costs of construction over an extended and uncertain construction schedule. At a June, 1980, meeting, Edison\u2019s directors voted to proceed with licensing efforts but to limit project expenditures. The department concluded that Edison should have cancelled the project in June, 1980, because \u201cproject uncertainty had become intolerably high by June, 1980.\u201d Cancellation was then, in the department\u2019s view, \u201cthe only prudent course of action.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The department then considered what amount of Edison\u2019s Pilgrim II loss should be reflected in the rates. Edison\u2019s share of the estimated costs of Pilgrim II was approximately $278,000,000. All expenditures after July 1, 1980, were to be eliminated from the amount to be recovered. The department further disallowed recovery of the equity rate of return portion of AFUDC, as it had in <em>Western Mass. Elec. Co., </em>D.P.U. 558, at 40 (July 31, 1981). The department then determined that the amount to be recovered, after deduction of tax benefits arising from abandonment of Pilgrim II, should be amortized over thirteen years, with an annual carrying cost rate of 14 % applied only to the non-AFUDC component of the amount to be recovered. The amount to be recovered was made uniform for each year by a levelizing factor formula. The annual recovery allowed to be reflected in Edison\u2019s rates was approximately $12,500,000, as shown (in approximations) by the following calculations:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Edison request $278,300,000</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Less disallowed expenses (Post-June,</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">1980, expenses of Pilgrim II [26.9% of all Pilgrim II expenses], and AFUDC attributable to common equity) 76,700,000</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">$201,600,000</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Less tax benefit attributable</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">to amount for which recovery is allowed</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">(73.1% of the total tax benefit) 84,800,000</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">Amount allowed to be recovered</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">amortized over thirteen years $116,800,000</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">Amount subject to carrying charges, determined by deducting pre-July, 1980, debt and preferred AFUDC from $116,800,000 $ 34,200,000</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">Amount subject to carrying charges of 14% per annum $ 82,600,000</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Annual amortization amount (excluding income taxes)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Annual amount with carrying charges $ 9,900,000</p>\n<p id=\"ABq\">Annual amount of AFUDC 2,600,000</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">$ 12,500,000</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">This court has not previously dealt with the question whether the department may lawfully permit a utility to recover prudently incurred costs of a construction project reasonably abandoned prior to its completion. The appellants point out that Pilgrim II never generated any electricity and argue that, until such an asset has \u201ccome on line,\u201d its costs may not be reflected in rates. They point to no statutory basis for this argument. We have considered the right of a utility to reflect in its rates the prudently incurred cost of plant reasonably abandoned before it was fully depreciated. We have deferred to the policy of the department concerning recovery of the cost of such abandoned facilities. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 1, 20-21 (1978) (experimental, abandoned pollution control device amortized over ten years; no error in excluding the unamortized retired plant from the rate base); <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>371 Mass. 881, 886-887 (1977) (same result as to reasonably abandoned production facilities). We have required that the department be consistent in its treatment of particular items of unamortized retired plant of a company, in the absence of an appropriate statement of reasons for any change in treatment. See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>367 Mass. 92, 104 (1975). Thus, a department determination to permit unamortized retired plant in the rate base could not be changed in a subsequent proceeding without some justification. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>368 Mass. 780, 802 (1975). In none of these opinions is there even a suggestion that the department might lack statutory authority to permit recovery of the undepreciated cost of prudently aban<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>doned plant and a carrying charge during any period of amortization.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Judicial decisions elsewhere concerning the recovery of the cost of nuclear plants abandoned before completion are rare and not particularly instructive for the purposes of this case. In <em>Central Me. Power Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utils. Comm'n, </em>433 A.2d 331, 344-345 (Me. 1981), the appeal was presented on the assumption that the cost of abandoned plant could be recovered. The utility argued unsuccessfully that the commission, in allowing an amortization of expenses (exclusive of associated AFUDC) over five years, had not engaged in a reasonable balancing of the interests of ratepayers and shareholders. The assumption that abandoned plant could be recovered also was made in <em>Wisconsin Pub. Serv. Corp. </em>v. <em>Madison Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>109 Wis. 2d 256, 265 (1982), where the utility was able to persuade the court that the procedure the commission designated for the recovery of costs in fact prevented recovery of the allowed costs and was arbitrary. In <em>Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Public Utils. Comm\u2019n, </em>67 Ohio St. 2d 153, 166 (1981), appeal dismissed sub nom. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel, </em>455 U.S. 914 (1982), a divided court, relying strictly on special provisions of an Ohio statute, reversed an agency decision that allowed amortization of the costs of abandoned nuclear facilities as beyond the agency\u2019s statutory authority.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Except for this Ohio case, which is of no guidance to us, we are aware of no appellate judicial opinion in which the authority of a State regulatory agency to allow recovery of the prudent costs of an abandoned nuclear plant was even raised, much less successfully challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>A substantial majority of the public utility regulatory agencies that have considered the question have permitted a utility to recover all or some portion of the prudently incurred costs of a nuclear power plant reasonably abandoned before completion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Public Utils. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 162 n. 6. Agency decisions that have denied recovery have relied on circumstances not present in the case before us.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Among the agency decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>allowing recovery of costs of abandoned plant, a variety of conclusions have been reached concerning the allowance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of a carrying charge or a return on those costs when they have been amortized.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Those agency decisions denying the recovery of costs or a return on amortized costs generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>have not rested on the ground that the agency lacked authority to allow recovery of these items. The question decided in almost all cases, allowing or disallowing costs and carrying charges, was treated, expressly or impliedly, as falling within the discretion and judgment of the agency.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The argument that in Massachusetts recovery of the prudently incurred costs of an abandoned nuclear plant is unlawful is apparently a recent one.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The department had the authority to permit the recovery of a company\u2019s prudent investment in plant reasonably abandoned before completion. The general statutory authority of the department permits the department to approve rates reflecting such an investment (G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The fact that Pilgrim II never produced any electricity, never became \u201cused or useful,\u201d does not prohibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>recognition of its prudent costs in ratemaking. The same conclusion is appropriate concerning the department\u2019s allowance of carrying charges on amounts amortized and charged to the cost of operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We do not substitute our judgment for that of an administrative agency where no constitutional question is presented. We decline to prescribe a common law of utility rate-making. Ratemaking is a legislative, not a judicial, function. Our involvement, beyond constitutional questions, has been to assure that the agency has adhered to statutory requirements. Where agency action is irrational, we will find an error of law. See <em>Southbridge Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>368 Mass. 300, 308-309 (1975). But, as we have said and ruled in a variety of contexts, questions of policy are for an administrative agency. See, e.g., <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>388 Mass. 557, 573 (1983); <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Watertown, </em>387 Mass. 298, 302 (1982); <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>376 Mass. 294, 302 (1978); <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>372 Mass. 678, 684 (1977); <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>367 Mass. 92, 98 (1975). We come then to the appellants\u2019 challenges to the reasoning of the department in its decision and to their claim that the department\u2019s decision to allow recovery of a portion of Edison\u2019s investment in Pilgrim II and a carrying charge on a portion of the amortized balance was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We conclude that the department\u2019s decision was reasonable in its analysis and thus not arbitrary or capricious and that there was substantial evidence to support its findings. Many of the appellants\u2019 arguments present logical reasons, with supporting evidence, for arriving at conclusions contrary to the department\u2019s conclusions on particular issues, such as the prudence of Edison\u2019s investment decisions and the financeability of the project at various times. Qur task under the State Administrative Procedure Act (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 [7]) is not to decide the issues anew but to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>determine whether there was any error of law. We forbear from reciting the substantial evidence in support of the department\u2019s conclusions, and certainly we will not burden this opinion with the contrary evidence on which the appellants rely. There were some moments when the feasibility and prudence of Edison\u2019s investment in Pilgrim II looked better than they did at other moments. However, the department was warranted in concluding that the investment was a prudent one up to June 30, 1980. The date that represented the dividing line between prudence and imprudence required a judgment call which, on all the evidence, the department was not required to place any earlier than June 30, 1980. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 1, 12 (1978). On the issue of prudence, the department had no authority to substitute its judgment for the reasonably exercised prerogatives of Edison\u2019s business managers. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>360 Mass. 443, 484 (1971). See <em>Mystic Valley Gas. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>359 Mass. 420, 431-432 (1971). The fact that neither the department nor the ratepayers had a direct voice in Edison\u2019s business decisions is not relevant to the issues in this case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">We accept as within the department\u2019s discretion the conclusion to allow some direct recovery of the costs of Pilgrim II, and carrying charges on a portion of that recovery. The department\u2019s judgment as to the consequences of its allowance or disallowance of such recoveries was logically expressed. Investor confidence is not an insignificant element in utility regulation. A judgment that the adverse consequences of disallowing any recovery would be a serious threat to the company\u2019s financial integrity, and indirectly to its customers, was warranted. Obviously, many future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>events cannot be determined with certainty and must be forecast based on reasonable judgment. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the department\u2019s conclusions concerning the consequences of the disallowance of any recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We comment briefly on certain challenges made to the department\u2019s decision. The department correctly placed the burden on Edison to demonstrate the prudence of its decision to commence and to continue with the Pilgrim II project. We do not see a fatal shift in this burden in the department\u2019s comments on the inadequacy of certain arguments made by the interveners or in the department\u2019s statement at one point that on the basis of particular facts it could not find \u201cimprudence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Once in its decision the department suggests that the project was financeable in part because of \u201cthe state regulatory commitment to maintain [Edison\u2019s] financial integrity in the face of the need for that particular facility.\u201d It is no doubt true that a rate regulatory agency\u2019s determination of the feasibility of a project will tend to establish both investor confidence and the financeability of the project through future rates approved by that same agency. However, the department made no explicit statement on the reasonableness of Edison\u2019s investment in Pilgrim II until September 22, 1981, the day before Edison cancelled the project. On the other hand, the record in D.P.U. 19494 closed in February, 1980, and the expectation of departmental approval was reasonable considering the substantial savings to consumers shown on that record if Pilgrim II were completed. The department\u2019s decision that the project was financeable at various times was not based solely on the conclusion in D.P.U. 19494 that the project was reasonable. The prospects of <em>financing.Pilgrim </em>II at various <em>times </em>were enhanced by the reasonable expectation that the department\u2019s decision in D.P.U. 19494 would be favorable.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The appellants argue that, if Edison could finance billions of dollars for Pilgrim II, it was plainly wrong for the department to conclude that Edison could not absorb the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>relatively small losses from the abandonment of the project. The financing of the project depended on reflecting the investment in Pilgrim II in Edison\u2019s rates. Thus the appellants\u2019 comparison is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The Attorney General has argued separately that the department\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious in its allowance of carrying charges and in its treatment of the income tax benefits resulting from the abandonment of the project. The city of Boston also argues against the allowance of carrying charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We have discussed carrying charges in our general consideration of the department\u2019s authority and discretion. We see no error in the department\u2019s allowance of carrying charges on the non-AFUDC portion of the amount being amortized. The amount of the carrying charge is subject to adjustment in future rate proceedings.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The circumstances of this case are sufficiently different from the <em>Western Mass. Elec. Co. </em>case, D.P.U. 558 (July 31, 1981), so that the disallowance of a carrying charge there (where the recovery of an investment of approximately $2,700,000 in two abandoned nuclear plants in Montague was allowed over four years) and the allowance of a carrying charge here do not demonstrate arbitrary or capricious action. The department\u2019s judgment that Edison would need the funds to finance future plans is not unreasonable on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The Attorney General argues that the department acted arbitrarily in its treatment of the Federal tax benefits derived from the abandonment of the project. The department allocated Edison\u2019s loss after taxes between ratepayers and shareholders, with June 30, 1980, marking the dividing line.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This allocation was within the department\u2019s discretion. In the absence of any contest on this issue raised be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>fore the department, we conclude that the department\u2019s determination, without extended discussion, to permit the tax benefits to be distributed in proportion to the allocation of costs is not arbitrary. In fact, the city of Boston agrees with the department\u2019s method of allocation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We, therefore, conclude that the department had the authority to allow Edison\u2019s rates to reflect the amortization of a portion of the after-tax cost of Pilgrim II and carrying charges on a portion of those amortized costs. We further conclude that the department\u2019s decision complied with the requirements of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Street Lighting Rates</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The city of Boston challenges the increase in the street lighting rates as \u201cunduly or irrationally discriminatory, \u201d citing <em>American Hoechest Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>379 Mass. 408, 411 (1980). Edison proposed, and the department agreed, that the revenue to be generated by the rate increase would be allocated among the various classes of customers so that those classes currently providing higher than average rates of return would receive lower than average percentage increases.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In the test year used in this case, the street lighting class generated a rate of return to Edison above the average. The average rate of return for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>all classes was 8.27%. Edison\u2019s study of the cost of service by class showed the street lighting rate of return to be 13.4% , or more than 60% above the average. The company proposed an increase for the street lighting class of 18.9% and an increase for all classes averaging 23.88%. The department noted that the allocations proposed by Edison would reduce the differentials but would not eliminate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Because the department has now acted on an Edison rate filing <em>(Boston Edison Co., </em>D.P.U. 1350 [May 31, 1983]) subsequent to the one under consideration here, the issue of-the street lighting rates contained in this proceeding may well be moot because retroactive adjustments are not permissible. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 1, 38 (1978). We nevertheless comment on the propriety of the department\u2019s action because the issue of allocation of revenue needs among classes of customers will be a recurring one.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">A choice between alternative methods of allocation of revenue needs made by Edison and approved by the department is appropriate as long as it does not have a confiscatory effect and is not otherwise illegal. See <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>376 Mass. 294, 302 (1978). The issue is the propriety of the department\u2019s decision on Edison\u2019s filing and not the merits of any alternative proposal advanced by an intervener in the proceeding. See <em>Trustees of Clark Univ. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>372 Mass. 331, 335 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">We conclude that the department acted within its discretion in approving Edison\u2019s proposal even though the proposal only narrowed the differences in class rates of return. Cost of service need not be the sole criterion used in establishing rate classifications. <em>American Hoechest Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>379 Mass. 408, 411-412 (1980). The department was warranted in its discretion in concluding that a \u201ccorrection\u201d of differentials in one step would be more disruptive than a series of a gradual adjustments over time. A class generating a disproportionately large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>rate of return, greater than the street lighting class, was exempted from any increase, but it was not unlawful to make that distinction. Edison, with the department\u2019s approval, could reasonably draw the line where it did. We add, however, that unless there is a reasonable justification for significant differentials in the rates of return of classes, perhaps based on differences in usage or on public policy considerations (see <em>American Hoechest Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 412-413), continuing substantial differences in the rates of return of classes may result in \u201cunduly or irrationally discriminatory\u201d rate classifications. <em>Id. </em>at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In the appeals of .the Attorney General and of the city of Boston, judgments shall be entered affirming the decision of the department. The appeals of MASSPIRG and SMOG shall be dismissed for the separate reasons stated in this opinion.

SMOG has only argued issues advanced by at least one party properly before us, and, in deciding those issues, we have considered the arguments advanced by SMOG. We simply conclude that, in the circumstances, there is no need to pass on Edison\u2019s motion to dismiss SMOC\u2019s appeal. We dismiss SMOC\u2019s appeal because the issues raised by it are resolved in the appeals that are before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\"> That brief stated in conclusion:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\u201cThe Office cannot be enthusiastic about a decision supporting the expenditure of $2.0 billion.

Commissioner George R. Sprague disagreed with his two colleagues. He believed that Edison\u2019s shareholders should bear all the expenses of Pilgrim II. He said in his dissent \u201cthat it is not proper for a utility to charge its customers, by whatever means, for investments which have not become used and useful.\u201d He further concluded that Edison should not be entitled to any recovery of Pilgrim II <em>costs </em>because it made the decision to proceed with the project on its own and resisted attempts at public, regulatory involvement in the question of the prudence of Pilgrim II. We see no basis for disallowing prudently incurred costs on the ground that the utility alone made the investment decision. He also believed that Edison had failed to meet its burden to show its ability to finance Pilgrim II and that Edison could absorb the loss without significant adverse consequences. On these points, Commissioner Sprague\u2019s conclusions may or may not be supported on the record.

The Attorney General, a party in that proceeding, did not argue that the recovery of such costs was unlawful. At least, the department\u2019s discussion of the problem proceeds on the assumption that all parties agreed that a Massachusetts utility could lawfully recover at least some portion of the prudent costs of an abandoned nuclear plant. In <em>Commonwealth Elec. Co., </em>D.P.U. 956, decided on May 28, 1982, after the department\u2019s decision in this case, the Attorney General apparently did not argue that recovery of some portion of the utility\u2019s prudent costs of abandoned nuclear plants (including Pilgrim II) could not lawfully be allowed. In the <em>Commonwealth Elec. Co. </em>case, the company did not request carrying costs at least on its investment in Pilgrim II, and the department, considering the company\u2019s particular circumstances, allowed the write-off of the costs over two years for Pilgrim II and over three years for nuclear units abandoned in Montague. <em>Id. </em>at 7-9, 15-16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\">We find nothing in G.

If, however, that portion of deferred tax benefits had been left in the rate base calculation, the after-tax loss to be allocated between ratepayers and shareholders in the calculation of the amount to be amortized would have had to have been correspondingly adjusted.

The impact of the court\u2019s decision in this case is to make the ratepayers of Boston Edison Company the guarantors of business decisions in which neither they nor the Department of Public Utilities (department) had a voice. The court upholds a split decision of the three commissioners of the department and, thus, requires ratepayers to pay, over a period of years as part of their cost of service, for a project from which they have received no benefit or service whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Many years ago, this court recognized the reason for public regulation of utility rates, saying \u201cwe have adopted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>in this State, legislative regulation and control as our reliance against the evil effects of monopoly.\u201d <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Gas &amp; Elec. Light Comm\u2019r, </em>197 Mass. 556, 558 (1908). General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 76, enacted by St. 1885, c. 314, \u00a7 8, and amended by St. 1982, c. 120, \u00a7 6, states: \u201cThe department shall have the general supervision of all gas and electric companies and shall make all necessary examination and inquiries and keep itself informed as to the condition of the respective properties owned by such corporations and the manner in which they are conducted <em>with reference to the safety and convenience of the public\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The requirements of G. L. c. 164,, \u00a7 94, as amended through St. 1973, c. 816, \u00a7 3, that gas and electric companies file proposed rate schedules with the department, and giving the department the power to \u201cinvestigate the propriety of any proposed rate, price or charge\u201d is part of a complicated statutory and regulatory scheme designed to ensure to the public the availability of service at reasonable cost from private industry protected from the risk of competition. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Edison Elec. Illuminating Co., </em>242 Mass. 305, 309 (1922). The decision of the department, affirmed by the court today, turns these basic principles on their head. Under this decision, it is not the public who are protected; rather, the consuming public is required to rescue the utility from the effect of its mistakes, even though the consumers bear no responsibility for the company\u2019s mistakes and derive no benefit from its acts. I cannot join in such a decision. I would hold that the department, in the circumstances of this case, committed an error in law in permitting Edison to recover its investment in Pilgrim II. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). Accordingly, I dissent. I state a few additional reasons to support my position.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">1. <em>Commissioner Selgrade\u2019s participation. </em>One can agree with the court that the propriety of Commissioner Selgrade\u2019s participation in the proceedings below was not raised in a timely fashion, and yet conclude that this circumstance should be considered in reviewing the department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>As the body charged with reviewing the decisions of the department, we are not bound by the particular terms of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23 (3), as appearing in St. 1982, c. 612, \u00a7 14, in considering the propriety of a Commissioner\u2019s participation in a proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Selectmen of Barnstable </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, 373 </em>Mass. 708, 710-714 (1977). It is well established that rules considering the disqualification of judges are equally applicable to administrative agencies. See <em>Anstey </em>v. <em>Iowa State Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>292 N.W.2d 380, 390 (Iowa 1980); <em>Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, &amp; Pac. R.R. </em>v. <em>Washington State Human Rights Comm\u2019n, </em>87 Wash. 2d 802, 807 (1976), and cases cited. An appropriate source of guidance for us is Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, S.J.C. Rule 3:09, as appearing in 382 Mass. 808 (1981). See <em>Anstey </em>v. <em>Iowa State Commerce Comm\u2019n, supra. </em>This canon provides, in relevant part: \u201c(C) Disqualification. (1) A judge should disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where: ...(b) he served as a lawyer in the matter of controversy. ...\u201d Plainly, Commissioner Belgrade is a lawyer who served in the matter in controversy. Signing a brief on behalf of an executive department as an employee of that department is sufficient involvement in the controversy to warrant disqualification. See <em>Laird </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>409 U.S. 824, 828-829 (1972) (memorandum of Rehnquist, J.); <em>TWA </em>v. <em>CAB, </em>254 F.2d 90, 91 (D.C. Cir. 1958). Further, the language of the rule is broad and denotes an intention to expand its application beyond the formal confines of a \u201ccase\u201d in a court of law. Realistically, this proceeding (D.P.U. 908) and the earlier proceeding (D.P.U. 19494), constitute a single matter of controversy. The subject matter of the controversy is Pilgrim II and who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>should pay for it. The department recognized as much in the earlier proceeding, when it placed the burden of proof on the company to demonstrate the prudence of Pilgrim II because \u201cthe Company will ultimately seek to pass on the costs of Pilgrim II to its customers in a future rate case.\u201d Nothing could make the point clearer than the degree to which the order entered in D.P.U. 19494 settled issues which otherwise would have been, or were,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> open in this proceeding (D.P.U. 906). Thus, Commissioner Belgrade could properly have participated in these proceedings only under a rule of necessity. See <em>ante </em>at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Given this circumstance, I believe that we have a duty to subject the department\u2019s decision to special scrutiny, since Commissioner Selgrade cast the deciding vote in favor of permitting recovery. We are essentially in the position of a court reviewing an administrative decision made by an officer who, while admittedly biased, decided the matter under the rule of necessity. In such a case, \u201cthe reviewing court . . . may and probably should review with special intensity.\u201d 3 K.C. Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 19.9, at 405 (1980).

Cf. <em>Hornsby </em>v. <em>Dobard, </em>291 F.2d 483 (5th Cir. 1961). Such scrutiny is especially appropriate where the matter, as here, implicates a broad public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">2. <em>Abandonment of Pilgrim II. </em>Under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94, the primary responsibility for reviewing rate schedules filed by a public utility lies with the department. Yet our review is not limited to determining whether the department committed constitutional error. We must also review the department\u2019s decisions for each of the errors enumerated in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>376 Mass. 294, 302-303 (1978); <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 1, 9, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 921 (1978); <em>Southbridge Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>368 Mass. 300, 308 (1975); <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>360 Mass. 443, 449 (1971). Thus, wholly apart from our duty to review a decision of the department for constitutional error and for the other errors enumerated in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we must also determine if the decision is based on an error of law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(c).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">While it may be said that we will not find an error of law lightly, we have not embraced a stance which permits the department to commit errors as long as they do not violate the Constitution or a separate, specific statutory provision other than G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (c). <em>Southbridge Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 305-309. See <em>Mystic Valley Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>359 Mass. 420, 432-434 (1971). Such is the clear import of our holding in the <em>Southbridge Water Supply Co. </em>case. There, the company, because of the effect of attrition on its rate base, challenged the department\u2019s refusal to apply a year-end rather than a year-average rate base. We assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>that the department\u2019s refusal did not result in confiscation, see <em>Southbridge Water Supply Co., supra </em>at 305, and conceded \u201cthat the use of a year-end rate base is not the exclusive antidote for the effect of attrition,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 308. We also noted that the department had consistently used a year-average rate base, <em>id. </em>at 307, and that the department\u2019s practice had been approved by this court, <em>id. </em>at 307-308.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We held, however, that the department\u2019s refusal to use the year-end rate base, in the circumstances presented, constituted an error of law, <em>id. </em>at 305, and ordered the department to modify its decision, <em>id. </em>at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><em>Southbridge Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra, </em>stands for the proposition that we are under a duty to review a decision of the department to determine if an error of law has occurred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It also stands for the proposition that the mere fact that the department possessed general authority to take an action does not end our inquiry, and that the application of even a previously accepted rule may constitute an error of law. We have applied these propositions to reach results favorable to utilities; evenhandedness would suggest that we are bound to apply them in cases where the department\u2019s decision is challenged by other parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>I turn now to consider whether the department committed an error of law by permitting Edison to recover the cost of Pilgrim II.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Edison wishes essentially to turn a past loss, caused by the decisions of its own business managers, into a cost of service. See <em>Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Public Utils. Comm\u2019n, </em>67 Ohio St. 2d 153, 166 (1981), appeal dismissed sub nom. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel, </em>455 U.S. 914 (1982). Its claim runs into two primary objections. First, and most significant, Pilgrim II never rendered any service, and, as it stands on this record, never will. It is established law that property must be currently used and useful to the ratepayers if it is .to be included in the rate base. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 1, 21 (1978). Thus, land held for future use, <em>id., </em>and the cost of physical plants under construction, <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 454-458, are excluded from the rate base. Similarly, as a general matter, ratepayers are not to be charged for losses arising out of activities from which they did not benefit. 1 A.J.G. Priest, Public Utility Regulation 65 (1969). Cf. <em>Pacific Power &amp; Light Co., </em>Util. L. Rep. (CCH) par. 23,924, at 56,071 (Mont. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n 1983). Second, permitting recovery can be attacked as a form of retroactive ratemaking, cf. <em>Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Public Utils. Comm\u2019n, </em>67 Ohio St. 2d 153 (1981), which the department lacks general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>authorization to impose. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 6. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>367 Mass. 667, 679-680 (1975). The department appeared to recognize these objections, but states that this case requires \u201cunique rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The circumstances surrounding Pilgrim II, however, do not suggest that a unique rule, imposing the loss on the consumers, should be adopted. Of primary importance is the fact that the decision to allocate the funds of Boston Edison\u2019s investors in Pilgrim II was made, without encouragement from the department, by Edison\u2019s business managers. Edison waged a long and successful battle to retain control over Pilgrim II. The sole expression of regulatory support for the project, the department\u2019s decision in D.P.U. 19494, came two days before Edison cancelled the project. Our decision in <em>Plymouth County Nuclear Information Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>374 Mass. 236 (1978), had the effect of leaving to Edison the decisions whether to add physical plants, and how to do so. Had the decisions of Edison\u2019s managers proved sound, Edison would have been entitled to receive a fair return on its investment. This opportunity to earn a fair return on a sound investment is all that a utility is entitled to receive. \u201c[Pjublic utilities are not. \u2018guaranteed\u2019 either a fair rate of return, or any return whatever, on their investment\u201d (emphasis in original). 2 A.J.G. Priest, Public Utility Regulation 788 (1969). See <em>FPC </em>v. <em>Sierra Pac. Power Co., </em>350 U.S. 348, 354-355 (1956); <em>Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Commn, </em>262 U.S. 276, 290-291 (1923) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The finding that management\u2019s decision was not imprudent should not, in and of itself, shift the risk of loss to the ratepayers. This follows because the standard of prudence is devoid of content. Since the department is not permitted to substitute its judgment for the judgment of Edison\u2019s business managers, see <em>ante </em>at 229, it is only in the extreme instance of mismanagement that the department has authority to find imprudence. In contrast, investors are entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>to subject management\u2019s decisions to whatever degree of scrutiny they please. Since it is the shareholders, through the management'they have selected for Edison, who determine which projects should be pursued, they should be required to bear the loss resulting from Pilgrim II\u2019s cancellation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The department\u2019s reasons for permitting recovery are neither adequate nor internally consistent. On one hand, recovery is said to be necessary to compensate investors for a \u201cnew\u201d level of risk caused by the cancellation of Pilgrim II. On the other hand, recovery is said to be necessary because rates in the past did not reflect the risk of cancellation. Neither argument is sound. It is doubtful that Edison has not been compensated for the risk of cancellation. It was entitled to a return which compensated it for the risks, including the risk of a plant cancellation, inherent in the nature of the enterprise. See <em>FPC </em>v. <em>Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 603 (1944); <em>Bluefield Water Works &amp; Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>262 U.S. 679, 692-693 (1923). Rather, the risk <em>then </em>being small, the amount of compensation was not great. Now that Pilgrim II has been cancelled, the \u201crisk\u201d is not new; all that is new is the extent of the loss.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The department also argued that recovery should be allowed because Edison is not entitled to receive speculative returns on its investments. But a public utility is not supposed to make speculative investments that would justify speculative returns. The department\u2019s finding concerning prudence and the financeability of Pilgrim II, turns in large measure on subsidiary findings that the project did not pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>sent speculative risks. Its argument is therefore irrelevant in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">For the reasons stated above, I would hold that the department committed an error of law in permitting Edison to recover its investment in Pilgrim II. I need not consider whether I would reach the same conclusion if the decision below were untainted, or if the department or some other governmental body had taken a greater role, see G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69H-69R, in the process which led to the decision to proceed with Pilgrim II.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">I believe it is appropriate to comment briefly on the magnitude of the loss and the financeability of Pilgrim II. The court notes, as did the department, that the loss would equal \u201capproximately] two-thirds of Edison\u2019s entire net worth, more than 25 % of its permanently invested capital, and more than earnings retained and reinvested over its eighty-six year history.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 219. If this statement accurately reflects the magnitude of the loss, it becomes difficult to accept the department\u2019s conclusion that the project was financeable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such was the dissenting view of Commissioner Sprague. Commissioner Sprague also noted that the amount of the net loss to Edison will be significantly reduced by the amount of tax benefits it will receive (from $278.3 million to $162.3 million). He then noted that Edison had retained earnings of $152 million as of December 31, 1981, and that it paid out $39.5 million in dividends to its common shareholders. He then calculated that the loss could be eliminated immediately by using retained earnings and by omitting one quarterly dividend. He also noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>that, if the loss were amortized over a period of years, Edison would not have to miss any dividends or use all of its retained earnings. In such circumstances, I fail to see how the court can justify the department\u2019s extraordinary rescue of a regulated company from the consequences of its own mistakes. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-5\"> The State Ethics Commission\u2019s ruling considered only whether Commissioner Belgrade's participation would violate G. L. c. 268A, and specifically disclaimed an intention to pass on the issue of bias. We should therefore not place too much weight on the Commission\u2019s ruling, especially since we need not resolve any issue under G. L. c. 268A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\"> The logic of the department\u2019s order also illustrates the point. With the question of the economic reasonableness of Pilgrim II settled in D.P.U. 19494, the primary factual issue before the department in this proceeding was whether Pilgrim II was financeable. We find out, however, that the project was financeable because the company, in the court\u2019s words, had a \u201creasonable expectation that the department\u2019s decision in D.P.U. 19494 would be favorable.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 230. Whether or not the result in D.P.U. 19494 preordained Edison\u2019s recovery of the costs of Pilgrim II, it is very clear that D.P.U. 19494 made recovery a much more likely result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\"> Those errors each provide a separate basis of review of the department\u2019s decision. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>376 Mass. 294, 302-308 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\"> Under the view adopted by the majority in this case, we would have been bound, in <em>Southbridge Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>368 Mass. 300, 308 (1975), to accept the department\u2019s choice as to the method used to calculate the rate base, regardless of what we thought common sense dictated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\"> In <em>Mystic Valley Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>359 Mass. 420 (1971), we also imposed a rule of law upon the department. While the companies claimed that the department\u2019s decision constituted confiscation, see <em>id. </em>at 424, the court made no such determination, but simply announced that the company was entitled to have the rate calculated in a certain manner, <em>id. </em>at 432-434. We have not interpreted <em>Mystic Valley Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra, </em>as imposing a constitutional rule; rather we have reviewed a claim under the case as presenting an error of law. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>376 Mass. 294, 303 (1978). And see <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 571, 584-585 (1978), where we reversed an aspect of the department\u2019s decision based arguably on an error of law. The department\u2019s authority is not unlimited. See <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>367 Mass. 667, 679-680 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b256-5\"> The question whether a public utility can recover the cost of a generating plant cancelled before completion is an open one. The only State court to squarely address the issue has held that recovery is not permitted. <em>Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Public Utils. Comm\u2019n, </em>67 Ohio St. 2d 153, 166 (1981), appeal dismissed sub nom. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel, </em>455 U.S. 914 (1982). A majority of the agencies regulating public utilities have permitted recovery, see <em>supra </em>at 224-227, but a substantial minority have denied recovery. E.g., <em>Pacific Power &amp; Light Co., </em>Util. L. Rep. (CCH) par. 23,974 (Mont. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n 1983) (noting patent unfairness of allocating loss to ratepayers). Several decisions permitting recovery have been accompanied by strong dissents. See, e.g., <em>Rochester Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>No. 82-1, Case No. 27794 (N.Y. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n January 13, 1982) (Mead, Comm\u2019r, dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\"> Since the ratepayers never received any service from Pilgrim II, there is no room for the practical compromise we approved of in <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>371 Mass. 881, 883 (1975), concerning prematurely abandoned property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\"> It cannot be denied that there is a strong public interest in maintaining the financial integrity of a public utility. But that interest does not suggest that the department should provide Edison with a guaranty against loss. Such an approach will do little to encourage prudent management and shareholder oversight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\"> The theory of regulatory support adopted by the department and the court is patently erroneous. Edison did not have a reasonable expectation of regulatory support until the department issued its decision in D.P.U. 19494. Further, even if it can be said that it did, that expectation could not have arisen prior to the closing of the record in D.P.U. 19494 in February, 1980. Since Edison\u2019s actions were found to be prudent only until June 30,1980, any expectation Edison possessed is relevant only to determining whether Pilgrim II was financeable in the period between February and June, 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
