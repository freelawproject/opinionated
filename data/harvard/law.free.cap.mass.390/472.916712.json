L. c. 266, \u00a7 37, at a bench trial in the Wareham District Court. The defendant exercised his right to a de nova trial and on March 19, 1982, a jury of six found him guilty as charged. The defendant appealed to the Appeals Court and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">The defendant appeals his conviction on four grounds: (1) the denial of his motion for a required finding of not guilty under Mass. R. Crim. P. 25, 378 Mass. 896 (1979); (2) the allowance of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to amend its complaint, (3) the denial of his motion for a new trial based on jury misconduct; and (4) the asserted violation of the defendant\u2019s right to protection against double jeopardy. We see no merit in the defendant\u2019s contentions and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Since the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, we shall review the facts introduced by the Commonwealth in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. On October 4, 1980, the defendant, an employee of Dunnington Marine, Inc. (Dunnington Marine), represented himself as president of Dunnington Marine and placed an order with North American Fiberglass Corporation of Greenville, North Carolina (North American), for the purchase of five boats. The five boats were delivered to Dunnington Marine on November 17,1980. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>On that day the defendant requested that his secretary draw a check for payment in the amount of $19,508.25. The account at this time was overdrawn by $58.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The check was presented for payment at the drawee bank on November 26, 1980, and returned for insufficient funds. On November 28, 1980, Edwin Parsons, the New England sales representative for North American, informed the defendant by telephone, that the \u201ccheck didn\u2019t work.\u201d The defendant promised he would deposit sufficient money to cover the check by the end of the following week.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">At a scheduled meeting on December 1, 1980, Parsons again informed the defendant that the \u201ccheck didn\u2019t work.\u201d The defendant again promised Parsons that he would cover the check by the end of the week. During this meeting a telephone call was made to the president of North American who told Parsons, \u201cWell, under the circumstances, I guess we\u2019ll just have to wait until the end of the week until he puts the money in the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Subsequently, North American retained Attorney George Decas to represent it in this matter. During December, 1980, Mr. Decas mailed two letters to the defendant informing him of the check\u2019s dishonor. The first he sent by certified mail and the second he sent through regular mail. The certified letter was returned uncollected and unclaimed, while the other was never returned. On January 7, 1981, Mr. Decas mailed a certified letter to the defendant which George Dunnington, the defendant\u2019s father, signed for and received. Again on February 4, 1981, Mr. Decas presented the defendant\u2019s attorney with notice of dishonor at the show cause hearing concerning the present action. The check has never been honored.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">1. <em>Motion for required finding of not guilty. </em>The defendant argues that the Commonwealth failed to prove each element of the offense of larceny by check under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37. In particular he asserts that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence failed to establish the requisite intent to defraud. The defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>again after the jury returned its verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We affirm the denial of these motions. On this issue we consider only the evidence introduced up to the time the Commonwealth rested its case and the defendant first filed his motion for a required finding of not guilty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>370 Mass. 147, 150 (1976). The question raised by these motions is whether \u201cthere was sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt to warrant the submission of the [case] to a jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Altenhaus, </em>317 Mass. 270, 271 (1944). In answering this question, this court must consider whether \u201cthere was enough evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact of each . . . element beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). We conclude that the Commonwealth introduced sufficient evidence of the elements of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">General Laws c. 266, \u00a7 37, provides that \u201c[a]s against the . . . drawer\u201d of a dishonored check, the prosecution can establish a prima facie case of intent to defraud and knowledge of insufficient funds by showing that the drawer failed to pay the holder within two days after notice of dishonor. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established such a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The jury could infer notice of dishonor from numerous occurrences. First, Parsons testified that on November 28 and December 1, 1980, he informed the defendant that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\u201ccheck didn\u2019t work.\u201d Since the statute does not require written notice, this evidence was sufficient for purposes of the prima facie case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ohanian, </em>373 Mass. 839, 842 (1977) (oral notice sufficient). Moreover, the evidence of Mr. Decas\u2019 repeated mailings was sufficient to permit the jury to infer that the defendant received notice through the ordinary course of mail or through oral communication with his father who received the certified letter mailed on January 7, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The defendant argues that the prima facie rule cannot be applied in the present case because he was not the actual drawer of the check. We do not agree. The defendant ordered his secretary to make out the check. This act was sufficient to render him the \u201cdrawer\u201d for purposes of prima facie evidence. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ohanian, supra </em>(defendant\u2019s signing of codefendant\u2019s name rendered him the \u201cdrawer\u201d for purpose of the statutory rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In addition to the statutory prima facie case, the evidence revealed that on November 17, 1980, when the check was issued, the corporate bank account was overdrawn by $58.75. Since the defendant represented himself as president of the corporation and engaged actively in the purchase of inventory, the jury could infer that he had knowledge of this fact. Furthermore, the jury could draw an inference of intent to defraud from the defendant\u2019s unfulfilled and repeated promises to deposit funds in the corporate account by the end of the first week in December, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">2. <em>Motion to amend complaint. </em>Prior to commencement of the trial de nova, the Commonwealth moved to amend the date of the offense charged on the complaint from November 7, 1980, to November 17, 1980, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 4 (d), 378 Mass. 849 (1979). The trial judge allowed this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The question is whether the change of the date of the offense was a material change in the elements of the crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ohanian, supra </em>at 843. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jervis, </em>368 Mass. 638, 643-644 (1975). Time is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>not an essential element of the crime of larceny and therefore the amendment \u201coffered was thus not one of substance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jervis, supra </em>at 644. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glassman, </em>253 Mass. 65, 71 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">This case differs from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ohanian, supra, </em>where the essential elements of the crime were not correctly stated. <em>Id. </em>at 843. The indictments in <em>Ohanian </em>alleged that the defendants knew that the drawer had insufficient funds to pay the checks at a bank other than the drawee bank. The indictments, in effect, failed to state an offense under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37, which deals with knowledge of insufficient funds at the drawee bank. Therefore, the court reversed the denial of the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the indictments and for directed verdicts on the ground of variance between the allegations and proof, because the misnomer was material. G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 35. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In the present case, the Commonwealth\u2019s amendment of the date merely changed the form of the complaint. All the elements of the crime remained in place. Moreover, the defendant failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood that he was prejudiced in his defense. Mass. R. Crim. P. 4 (d). The record reveals that at all times the defendant was fully aware that the complaint concerned the issuance of a check on November 17, 1980. Clearly, if the defendant were convicted of larceny by check on November 7, 1980, in regard to the same circumstances, the Commonwealth would be barred from prosecuting the defendant for the same offense committed on November 17, 1980. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>269 Mass. 598, 609-610 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">3. <em>Motion for anew trial. </em>After the verdict was entered, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial alleging that the jurors considered evidence not admitted at the trial. The defendant filed with this motion a court officer\u2019s affidavit that he engaged in a postverdict conversation with a juror. Allegedly the juror made three statements indicating possible extraneous influences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial judge asked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>juror whether the jury discussed any of these statements during deliberations. The juror recalled discussing only that statement concerning the prior overdrafts. The judge denied the motion for a new trial, making no express findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In Massachusetts, juror testimony is admissible at a hearing to impeach a jury verdict, but only to establish the existence of improper extraneous influences on the jury. This testimony is not admissible to demonstrate the effect that the extraneous matter had upon the juror\u2019s thought process. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. 192, 196 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The defendant at such a hearing bears the burden of demonstrating that the jurors were in fact exposed to extraneous matter. Once the judge finds that extraneous matter was introduced, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not prejudiced by the improper influence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, supra </em>at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">We would have been materially aided if the judge had complied with the requirement of Mass. R. Crim. P. 30(b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979), which provides that \u201cthe trial judge shall make such findings of fact as are necessary to resolve the defendant\u2019s allegations of error of law.\u201d However, implicit in the judge\u2019s summary denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, was a finding that the defendant failed to demonstrate that the jury was exposed to extraneous matter. The judge is best able to evaluate the weight and credibility of the evidence. There was no error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 156 (1982). Since the evidence of overdrafts was properly before the jury<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (see <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Solari, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 993 [1981]), and the juror emphatically asserted that the other two statements were not discussed during deliberations, the judge\u2019s denial of the motion does not leave us \u201cwith a firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, supra. New England Canteen Serv., Inc., </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 675 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">4. <em>Claim of double jeopardy. </em>The defendant was initially tried in the District Court at a bench trial and convicted. He exercised his right to a de nova trial and was again convicted. He now asserts that the original conviction should be reversed on the ground of legally insufficient evidence. Assuming the validity of this claim, he also argues that his trial de nova placed him in double jeopardy under the holding of <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 18 (1978). The Court in <em>Burks </em>held that the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution precludes retrial of a defendant whose conviction has been reversed by an appellate court solely for insufficient evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">While we are aware of the pendency of a case which highlights this issue in the United States Supreme Court, <em>Lydon </em>v. <em>Boston Mun. Court, </em>698 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1982), cert. granted 463 U.S. 1206 (1983), we are not obliged to address the problem in the instant case because the defendant has produced a bench trial record that \u201cis so deficient that we are in no position to rule on the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>388 Mass. 603, 604 (1983). Moreover, the defendant did not preserve his right to raise this issue on appeal. He neglected to file the proper motion to dismiss prior to the commencement of the trial de nova. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 13 (c) (2), 378 Mass. 873 (1979). \u201cIf there is a valid double jeopardy claim, it should be dealt with before, rather than after, the second trial.\u201c <em>Lydon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 356, 367, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1065 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-8\"> The Commonwealth points out that the defendant did not renew his motion for a required finding of not guilty at the close of all the evidence. However, in order to raise the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s actions, the defendant is not required to renew his motion at the conclusion of his case. Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (a), 378 Mass. 896 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\"> The Commonwealth\u2019s position as to proof did not deteriorate between the time the Commonwealth rested and the close of all the evidence so as to necessitate review of all the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, supra </em>at 150 n.1. In fact the defendant\u2019s evidence aids the Commonwealth\u2019s case, because the defendant admitted both knowledge of insufficient funds and notice of dishonor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\"> These statements were as follows: (1) \u201cHis father owns five drug stores and could have paid his way out of this if he wanted to\u201d; (2) \u201cHe had bounced four checks in the same month, \u2014 how do we know if there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>were more banks involved?\u201d; and (3) \u201cThe only reason this is in court is that there is a bad feeling between them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b494-10\"> Evidence of prior overdrafts was submitted to the jury in a bank statement introduced by the Commonwealth. The defendant did not object to the document\u2019s introduction in evidence, and, therefore, he will not be heard to complain on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baptiste, </em>372 Mass. 700, 706 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The defendant bears the burden of producing a satisfactory record. See Mass. R. A. P. 18 (a), as amended, 378 Mass. 940 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
