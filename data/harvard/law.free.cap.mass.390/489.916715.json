If a patient is adjudicated incompetent, a judge, using a substituted-judgment standard, shall decide whether the patient would have consented to the administration of antipsychotic drugs. <em>Guardianship of </em>Roe, 383 Mass. 415, 443-448 (1981). <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State School </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 750-755 (1977). No State interest justifies the use of antipsychotic drugs in a nonemergency situation without the patient\u2019s consent. Antipsychotic drugs, which are used to prevent violence to third persons, to prevent suicide, or to preserve security, are being used as chemical restraints and must follow the strictures of G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 21, and the regulations promulgated pursuant to the statute. A patient may be treated with antipsychotic drugs against his will and without prior court approval to prevent the \u201cimmediate, substantial, and irreversible deterioration of a serious mental illness.\u201d If a patient is medicated in order to avoid \u201cimmediate, substantial, and irreversible deterioration of a serious mental illness,\u201d and the doctors expect to continue to treat the patient with antipsychotic medication over the patient\u2019s objection, the doctors<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> must seek adjudication of incompetency, and, if the patient is adjudicated incompetent, the court must formulate a substituted-judgment treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We summarize the facts and procedural background of the case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On April 27, 1975, a class action was commenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the defendant Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health (department) and numerous doctors and administrative staff members of the May and Austin Units of Boston State Hospital (hospital), pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1970). The seven named plaintiffs, all of whom had been committed to the hospital prior to commencement of the action, challenged the defendants\u2019 practices of secluding and medicating patients against their will. Alleging that these practices infringed their rights under the United States Constitution and violated acceptable medical standards, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief for the class and an award of damages for themselves in the Federal District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Three days after the complaint was filed, a Federal District Court judge issued a temporary restraining order, prohibiting the seclusion and antipsychotic medication of hospital patients in nonemergency situations without the consent of the patient or a guardian. After trial, the judge denied damages because the defendants\u2019 medication and seclusion practices were in accordance with acceptable medical standards. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Okin, </em>478 F. Supp. 1342, 1380-1389 (D. Mass. 1979) (hereinafter cited as <em>Rogers I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">However, the judge determined that mental patients not adjudicated incompetent have a constitutional right to refuse treatment in nonemergency situations, and that the same right extends to incompetent patients, for whom the treatment decision should be made by a guardian using a substituted judgment standard. <em>Id. </em>at 1361-1368. The judge therefore enjoined the defendants from forcibly medicating patients except in an \u201cemergency,\u201d which the judge defined as \u201ccircumstances in which a failure to [medicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>forcibly] would bring about a substantial likelihood of physical harm to the patient or others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1371.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The defendants appealed the decision enjoining forcible medication of patients absent an emergency. The plaintiffs cross appealed from the denial of their claims for damages. The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of the damage claims, but vacated and remanded the issue of injunctive relief in light of its opinion. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Okin, </em>634 F.2d 650 (1st Cir. 1980) (hereinafter cited as <em>Rogers II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In its opinion, the court concluded that the mentally ill have a constitutionally protected right to decide whether to be treated with antipsychotic drugs, <em>id. </em>at 653, and that involuntarily committed patients are presumed to be competent to assert that right in their own behalf, <em>id. </em>at 658-659. However, that court modified the trial judge\u2019s decision in two respects. First, it determined that the \u201csubstantial likelihood of physical harm\u201d standard, application of which the judge required prior to forcible administration of antipsychotic medication, is too narrow, and that the hospital physicians could use their discretion in deciding to administer drugs forcibly, after balancing the interests of the patients against the State\u2019s police power interest in preventing violence within the institution. The court remanded for the District Court to design procedures to ensure that patient interests would be adequately protected. <em>Id. </em>at 656-657. Second, the Court of Appeals concluded that the judge\u2019s definition of an \u201cemergency\u201d in which a patient could be treated against his will was too limited. The Court of Appeals expanded the meaning of emergencies to include those situations in which an incompetent patient\u2019s health would significantly deteriorate without medication. <em>Id. </em>at 659-660. The case was remanded on this issue for the judge\u2019s consideration of expeditious methods for determining incompetence when delay would be harmful. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the court held that the Commonwealth need not seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>individualized guardian approval for decisions to treat patients with antipsychotic drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The United States Supreme Court granted the defendants\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari, in which they sought review of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision on the issue of forcible medication of involuntarily committed patients. In mid-1982, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for a determination of the extent to which the patients\u2019 substantive and procedural rights are protected under Massachusetts law, thus declining to reach the constitutional issues unnecessarily. <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>457 U.S. 291, 305 (1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On remand, the Court of Appeals certified nine questions to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\"><em>Questions 1, 2, and 3. Competence of involuntarily committed patients to make treatment decisions; judicial determination of incompetence.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cNo person shall be deemed to be incompetent to manage his affairs, to contract, to hold professional or occupational or vehicle operators licenses or to make a will solely by reason of his admission or commitment in any capacity to the treatment or care of the [Mental Health] department or to any public or private facility.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 25, inserted by St. 1970, c. 888, \u00a7 4. See 104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.10 (2) (6) (1978). A judge may order the civil commitment of a person after a hearing only if he finds that the person is mentally ill and that the person\u2019s failure to be committed would create a likelihood of serious harm. G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8. The Legislature defined \u201c[ljikelihood of serious harm\u201d as \u201c(1) a substantial risk of physical harm to the person himself as manifested by evidence of threats of, or attempts at, suicide or serious bodily harm; (2) a substantial risk of physical harm to other persons as manifested by evidence of homicidal or other violent behavior or evidence that others are placed in reasonable fear of violent behavior and serious physical harm to them; or (3) a very substantial risk of physical impairment or injury to the person himself as manifested by evidence that such person\u2019s judgment is so affected that he is unable to protect himself in the community and that reasonable provision for his protection is not available in the community.\u201d G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1980, c. 571, \u00a7 1. There is no requirement that a person be incompetent in order to be committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The first two definitions of likelihood of serious harm \u201cprovide no adjudication of judgmental capacity; commitment is based on a determination of risk of physical harm to the individual or to others.\u201d <em>Rogers II, supra </em>at 658. Put simply, such a commitment is for public safety purposes and does not reflect lack of judgmental capacity. The third definition, although more relevant to the person\u2019s judgmental abilities, says nothing concerning his competence to make treatment decisions. A person may be competent to make some decisions, but not others. <em>Matter of Moe, </em>385 Mass. 555, 567-568 (1982). See Developments in the Law \u2014 Civil Commitment of the Mentally Ill, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 1190, 1214 (1974). Furthermore, as the Court of Appeals noted, there is no way to pinpoint those patients committed under the third definition. Thus, \u201cunder the statutory scheme any given individual might have been committed despite the fact that he competently believed that treatment was not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>his best interests.\u201d <em>Rogers II, supra. </em>In addition, the Federal District Court judge found that most patients \u201care able to appreciate the benefits, risks, and discomfort that may reasonably be expected from receiving psychotropic medication.\u201d <em>Rogers I, supra </em>at 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">A determination of incompetence, on the other hand, is made by a judge who appoints a guardian only after he finds the person \u201cincapable of taking care of himself by reason of mental illness.\u201d G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6, as amended through St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 94. Thus, the statutes, as worded, comprehend the competence of an involuntarily committed mental patient to make treatment decisions. The fact that G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 23, expressly authorizes patients to refuse psychosurgery and electroconvulsive treatment does not, as the defendants assert, exclude by implication the patients\u2019 rights to make treatment decisions as to antipsychotic drugs. The right of an individual \u201cto manage his own person\u201d necessarily encompasses the right to make basic decisions with respect to \u201ctaking care of himself,\u201d <em>Fazio </em>v. <em>Fazio, </em>375 Mass. 394, 403 (1978), including decisions relating to the maintenance of physical and mental health. We think it clear that the right to make treatment decisions is an essential element of the patient\u2019s general right \u201cto manage his affairs.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 25. \u201c[A] finding [of incompetence], apart from evidence as to mental illness, should consist of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>facts showing a proposed ward\u2019s inability to think or act for himself as to matters concerning his personal health, safety, and general welfare . . . .\u201d <em>Fazio </em>v. <em>Fazio, supra </em>at 403. Absent such a finding, a person is competent to \u201cact for himself as to matters concerning his personal health,\u201d including acceptance or refusal of medication. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, a person diagnosed as mentally ill and committed to a mental institution is still considered to be competent to manage his personal affairs. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>370 Mass. 541, 546 (1976); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>312 Mass. 165, 168 (1942); <em>Leggate </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>111 Mass. 308, 309-310 (1873).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We conclude that a mental patient has the right to make treatment decisions and does not lose that right until the patient is adjudicated incompetent by a judge through incompetence proceedings. See G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6. No other procedure is available for determining that a patient lacks the capacity to make treatment decisions. See <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 431; <em>Fazio </em>v. <em>Fazio, supra </em>at 399; <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State School </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 755 (1977). Pursuant to G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6, a judge may appoint a guardian for a person only if he finds after a hearing that the person \u201cis incapable of taking care of himself by reason of mental illness. \u201d The statute provides for the appointment of temporary guardians, as well as for permanent guardians. See G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The defendants argue that they, as doctors, should be responsible for making treatment decisions for involuntarily committed patients, whether competent or not. We do not agree. \u201cEvery competent adult has a right \u2018to forego treatment, or even cure, if it entails what for him are intolerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>consequences or risks however unwise his sense of values may be in the eyes of the medical profession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center, </em>387 Mass. 152, 154 (1982), quoting <em>Wilkinson v. Vesey, </em>110 R.I. 606, 624 (1972).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This right has constitutional and common law origins, <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 433 n.9, which protect each person\u2019s \u201cstrong interest in being free from nonconsensual invasion of his bodily integrity.\u201d <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State School </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 738-739. See <em>Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 673 (1977); <em>Breithaupt v. Abram, </em>352 U.S. 432, 439 (1957); <em>Davis v. Hubbard, </em>506 F. Supp. 915, 930-931 (N.D. Ohio 1980). Since by statute and by common law, involuntarily committed patients are competent until adjudicated incompetent, see <em>supra, </em>and because we have held that competent individuals have a right to refuse treatment, see <em>Harnish v. Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center, supra </em>at 154, the defendants\u2019 argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We conclude that a distinct adjudication of incapacity to make treatment decisions (incompetence) must precede any determination to override patients\u2019 rights to make their own treatment decisions. See <em>Matter of Moe, </em>385 Mass. 555, 567-568 (1982). Other courts have drawn similar conclusions. See, e.g., <em>Rennie v. Klein, </em>653 F.2d 836, 846 (3d Cir. 1981), vacated and remanded, 458 U.S. 1119 (1982); <em>Winters </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>446 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 985 (1971); <em>New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp. v. Stein, </em>70 Misc. 2d 944, 945 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1972); <em>In re K.K.B., </em>609 P.2d 747, 749 (Okla. 1980); <em>In re Yetter, </em>62 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 619, 623 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Competency and substituted-judgment determinations may take place in the Probate Courts, see G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6; in the Superior Court, see G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1 (general equity jurisdiction of the Superior Court); G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6 (concurrent jurisdiction of the Probate and Superior Courts as to \u201call matters relative to guardianship and conservatorship\u201d); <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>375 Mass. 733, 743-744 (1978); or in the Juvenile Courts or juvenile sessions of the District Courts, see G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24; <em>Custody of a Minor, supra </em>at 742-743. Whatever the forum, the patient must be found incompetent before a judge may make a substituted-judgment decision. We note that, whenever possible, proceedings should be consolidated. See, e.g., <em>Glick </em>v. <em>Greenleaf, 383 </em>Mass. 290, 294-295 &amp; n.7 (1981); G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9, inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 110 (power of Chief Administrative Justice to transfer judges and cases \u201cas he deems will best promote the speedy dispatch of judicial business\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><em>Questions 4 and 5. The decision to treat incompetent mental patients with antipsychotic drugs.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In Massachusetts there is \u201ca general right in all persons to refuse medical treatment in appropriate circumstances. The recognition of that right must extend to the case of an incompetent, as well as a competent, patient because the value of human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>dignity extends to both. ... To protect the incompetent person within its power, the State must recognize the dignity and worth of such a person and afford to that person the same panoply of rights and choices it recognizes in competent persons.\u201d <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State School </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 745-746 (1977). See Gaughan &amp; LaRue, The Right of a Mental Patient to Refuse Antipsychotic Drugs in an Institution, 4 Law &amp; Psychology Rev. 43, 74 (1978). Further, \u201cif an incompetent individual refuses antipsychotic drugs, those charged with his protection must seek a judicial determination of substituted judgment.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 434-435.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>385 Mass. 697, 710 n.10 (1982). See also <em>Matter of Moe, </em>385 Mass. 555, 565 (1982); <em>Matter of Spring, </em>380 Mass. 629, 640 (1980); <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>375 Mass. 733, 752-753 (1978); <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State School </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 745-751.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">A substituted-judgment decision is distinct from a decision by doctors as to what is medically in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the patient. <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 435. \u201c[T]he goal is to determine with as much accuracy as possible the wants and needs of the individual involved.\u201d <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State School </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 750. The decision \u201cshould be that which would be made by the incompetent person, if that person were competent, but taking into account the present and future incompetency of the individual as one of the factors which would necessarily enter into the decision-making process of the competent person,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 752-753, and giving \u201cthe fullest possible expression to the character and circumstances of that individual,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 747. Use of the substituted judgment standard is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>unique to Massachusetts. See, e.g., <em>In re Boyd, </em>403 A.2d 744, 750-751 (D.C. 1979). The decision is not simply a question whether treatment is to be rendered, but also may entail a choice between alternative treatments. The doctor must offer treatment to the involuntarily committed patient, but, since it is the patient who bears the risks as well as the benefits of treatment by antipsychotic drugs, and must suffer the consequences of any treatment decision, the patient has the right to make that decision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In short, treatment decisions are the patient\u2019s prerogative solely.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u201c[Ojur prior cases have established that prior judicial approval is required before a guardian may consent to administering or withholding of proposed extraordinary medical treatment.\u201d <em>Matter of Moe, </em>385 Mass. 555, 559 (1982). Since we have decided that treatment with antipsychotic drugs is such an extraordinary treatment,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we necessarily conclude that court approval is mandatory before forcible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>medication of an incompetent patient with those drugs in a nonemergency situation can take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The amici American Psychiatric Association and Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, arguing on behalf of the psychiatric profession, urge us not to require a substituted judgment by a judge for institutionalized incompetent mentally ill patients. They assert that if a substituted judgment is required before there can be forcible medication of involuntarily confined, incompetent patients, the decision as to substituted judgment should be made by a qualified physician and not a judge. This procedure, the so called medical model, would, the doctors claim, protect the incompetent patient\u2019s civil rights to refuse treatment,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> while providing the hospital with a qualified person who can make the substituted judgment decision at the hospital. See, e.g., A. Stone, Mental Health and Law: A System in Transition 65-66 (1975). The medical model is also advantageous, the doctors claim, because it provides flexibility and avoids the adversary quality of judicial proceedings. The doctors thus conclude that if a substituted-judgment is required, the medical model is the appropriate procedure for this court to follow. We do not agree. \u201cNo medical expertise is required [for making the substituted judgment decision], although medical advice and opinion is to be used for the same purposes and sought to the same extent that the incompetent individual would, if he were competent.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 435. See <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>385 Mass. 697, 713-714 (1982); <em>Matter of Moe, </em>385 Mass. 555, 559 (1982); <em>Matter of Spring, </em>380 Mass. 629, 636 (1980); <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State School </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The only relevant fact which differs between <em>Guardianship of Roe </em>and this case is that the incompetent patient in <em>Guardianship of Roe </em>was not institutionalized. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>fendants argue that the mere fact of institutionalization and the needs of the hospital<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> should be sufficient to transfer the treatment decision authority from the judge to the doctors. \u201c[I]f the doctrines of informed consent and right of privacy [that underlie the substituted judgment determination] have as their foundations the right to bodily integrity, see <em>Union Pac. Ry. </em>v. <em>Botsford, </em>141 U.S. 250 (1891), and control of one\u2019s own fate, then those rights are superior to the institutional considerations.\u201d <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State School </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 744. See <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>379 Mass. 255, 265-266 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In <em>Guardianship of Roe, </em>383 Mass. 415, 435-436 (1981), and in <em>Matter of Spring, </em>380 Mass. 629, 637 (1980), we outlined the various factors to be considered in determining whether a judicial substituted-judgment decision is required. Five of these discussed in <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra, </em>were \u201c(1) the intrusiveness of the proposed treatment, (2) the possibility of adverse side effects, (3) the absence of an emergency, (4) the nature and extent of prior judicial involvement, and (5) the likelihood of conflicting interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The fact that a patient has been institutionalized and declared incompetent brings into play the factor of the likelihood of conflicting interests. See <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 435-436. The doctors who are attempting to treat as well as to maintain order in the hospital have interests in conflict with those of their patients who may wish to avoid medication.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On the other hand, unlike the situation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>Guardianship of Roe, </em>if an incompetent has a guardian, that guardian presumably is in a neutral position, since the guardian is not living with the patient at the time the guardian makes the treatment decisions. In <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 443, we noted the difficulty in making a \u201csubstituted judgment determination . . . when the ward ... is living at home with other children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We conclude that, if a patient is declared incompetent, a court must make the original substituted-judgment treatment decision and should approve a substituted judgment treatment plan. See 104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.08 (3) (1978). After adjudication of an involuntarily committed patient as incompetent, the judge may conduct a hearing on the appropriate treatment to be administered. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>506 F. Supp. 915, 938-939 (N.D. Ohio 1980). The parties \u201cmust be given adequate notice of the proceedings, an opportunity to be heard in the trial court, and to pursue an appeal.\u201d <em>Matter of Moe, </em>385 Mass. 555, 566 (1982). To this end, a guardian ad litem should be appointed, and the opinions of experts gathered so that all views are available to the judge. <em>Id. </em>at 567. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 756-758. The judge may delegate to a guardian the power to monitor the treatment process to ensure that the substituted-judgment treatment plan is followed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>At least six factors must be considered by the judge in arriving at the substituted judgment decision. \u201cIn this search, procedural intricacies and technical niceties must yield to the need to know the actual values and preferences of the ward.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 444. These six factors are detailed in <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra, </em>and we briefly restate them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">First, the judge must examine the patient\u2019s \u201cexpressed preferences regarding treatment.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 444. If made while competent, such a preference \u201cis entitled to great weight\u201d unless the judge finds that the patient would have changed his opinion after reflection or in altered circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 445. Even if he lacked the capacity to make his treatment decisions at the time, his expressed preference \u201cmust be treated as a critical factor in the determination of his \u2018best interests,\u2019\u201d <em>id., </em>quoting <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>377 Mass. 272, 277-279 (1979), since it is the patient\u2019s true desire that the court must ascertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Second, the judge must evaluate the strength of the incompetent patient\u2019s religious convictions, to the extent that they may contribute to his refusal of treatment. See <em>Winters </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>446 F.2d 65 (2d Cir. 1971); <em>In re Boyd, </em>403 A.2d 744 (D.C. 1979). \u201c[T]he question to be addressed is whether certain tenets or practices of the incompetent\u2019s faith would cause him individually to reject the specific course of treatment proposed for him in his present circumstances. . . . While in some cases an individual\u2019s beliefs may be so absolute and unequivocal as to be conclusive in the substituted judgment determination, in other cases religious practices may be only a relatively small part of the aggregated considerations.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 445-446.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Third, the impact of the decision on the ward\u2019s family must be considered. In <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 446, we indicated that this factor is primarily relevant when the patient is part of a closely knit family. The consideration of impact on the family includes the cost in money and time that the family must bear, together with any desire of the patient to minimize that burden. In addition, a patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>may be faced with \u201ctwo treatments, one of which will allow him to live at home with his family and the other of which will require the relative isolation of an institution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The judge may then consider what affection and assistance the family may offer. However, the judge must be careful to ignore the desires of institutions and persons other than the incompetent \u201cexcept in so far as they would affect his choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Fourth, the probability of adverse side effects must be considered. This includes an analysis of \u201cthe severity of these side effects, the probability that they would occur, and the circumstances in which they would be endured.\u201d <em>Id </em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Fifth, the prognosis without treatment is relevant to the substituted judgment decision. It is probable that most patients would wish to avoid a steadily worsening condition. However, the judge must again reach an individualized, subjective conclusion regarding this factor, after examining it from the \u201cunique perspective,\u201d <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 747, of the incompetent, <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Sixth, the prognosis with treatment must be examined. The likelihood of improvement or cure enhances the likelihood that an incompetent patient would accept treatment, but it is not conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Finally, the judge may review any other factors which appear relevant. <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 448. See, e.g., note 15, <em>supra, </em>and note 26, <em>infra. </em>After weighing the factors, the judge must reach a substituted-judgment treatment decision. If the judge decides to order treatment with antipsychotic drugs for a committed incompetent patient, the judge should \u201cauthorize a treatment program which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>utilizes various specifically identified medications administered over a prolonged period of time. In such a case, the order should provide for periodic review to determine if the ward\u2019s condition and circumstances have substantially changed.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 448 n.19. Once the decisions of incompetency and substituted judgment have been made,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the burden shifts to the incompetent patient\u2019s guardian to seek modification of the order, should such modification be needed before the time for periodic review.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\"><em>Questions 6 and 7. \u201cPolice power\u201d and the use of anti-psychotic drugs </em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendants assert that if they are unable to medicate, hospital administration becomes more difficult, lengths of stay increase, fewer patients can be treated, staff turnover increases and new personnel become more difficult to attract. The defendants also argue that the illness of one patient on a ward may be provocative, exacerbating the illness of other patients, and adversely affecting the doctors\u2019 ability to treat. See <em>Rennie </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>462 F. Supp. 1131, 1152 n.1 (D. N.J. 1978), remanded, 653 F.2d 836 (3d Cir. 1981), vacated and remanded, 458 U.S. 1119 (1982). In addition, they claim it is more difficult to conduct group therapy in an environment in which they cannot medicate with antipsychotic drugs. However, governmental interest \u201cin permitting hospitals to care for those in their custody [is] not controlling, since a patient\u2019s right of self-determination [is] normally . . . superior to such institutional considerations.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>379 Mass. 255, 266 (1979). See <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>In <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 437 n.11, we noted that \u201c[c]ommentators and courts have identified abuses of anti-psychotic medication by those claiming to act in an incompetent\u2019s best interests.\u201d In <em>Rogers I, supra </em>at 1375-1376, 1378 &amp; n.49, the judge found that patients were involuntarily medicated with antipsychotic drugs over their objection in nonemergency situations. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 1377 n.45. In <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>506 F. Supp. 915, 926 (N.D. Ohio 1980), the judge found that seventy-three per cent of the patients of Lima (Ohio) State Hospital received psychotropic drugs, and that the high prescription rate \u201ccan be justified only for reasons other than treatment \u2014 namely, for the convenience of the staff and for punishment.\u201d See <em>Rennie </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>476 F.

N.J. 1979), modified and remanded, 653 F.2d 836 (3d Cir. 1981), vacated and remanded, 458 U.S. 1119 (1982) (\u201c[T]he medical director of Marlboro [New Jersey State Hospital] states in an office memorandum that the hospital \u2018uses medication as a form of control and as a substitute for treatment\u2019 \u201d); <em>Halderman </em>v. <em>Pennhurst State School </em>&amp; <em>Hosp., </em>446 F.

L. Rev. 1720, 1721 n.9 (1982) (describing cases in which antipsychotic drugs were found to be used \u201cfor the convenience of the staff and for punishment of patients\u201d). See also Brooks, The Constitutional Right to Refuse Antipsychotic Medications, 8 Bull. Am.

See <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Myers, supra. </em>However, when public safety and security are a consideration in the decision to administer antipsychotic drugs over a patient\u2019s objection, the \u201cantipsychotic drugs function as chemical restraints forcibly imposed upon an unwilling individual who, if competent, would refuse such treatment.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 451. In such circumstances, the antipsychotic drug treatment is administered for the benefit of others, and the statutory and regulatory conditions for the use of chemical restraints must be followed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">General Laws c. 123, \u00a7 21, as amended by St. 1978, c. 367, \u00a7 71F, requires that State mental health patients may be restrained \u201conly in cases of emergency such as the occurrence of, or serious threat of, extreme violence, personal injury, or attempted suicide.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In no case may chemical means of restraint be used without \u201cwritten authorization ... in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>advance by the superintendent or director of the I.C.U. or by a physician designated by him for this purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Consistent with G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 21, the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health has adopted regulations on the use of seclusion and restraint. In 104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.12 (2) (1978), those regulations state: \u201cRestraint or seclusion of patients may be used only in emergency situations where there is the occurrence or serious threat of extreme violence, personal injury, or attempted suicide.\u201d \u201cRestraint\u201d is defined in 104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.12 (3) (1978) to include mechanical, chemical, and therapeutic restraints. Authorization for the use of seclusion or restraint must be made in advance and in writing by the head of the hospital or a designated physician, and the person authorizing the restraint must also sign the treatment form, pursuant to 104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.12 (5) (1978). If the head of the hospital or his designee is not available, only nonchemical restraints may be used. Record keeping and other requirements are detailed elsewhere in 104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.12 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The use of chemicals to restrain State mental patients is limited to emergencies in which the patient harms, or threatens to harm, himself or others. See note 25, <em>supra. </em>We know of no reason why these rules regarding restraint should not be followed. The defendants suggest none. The statutes and regulations are clearly intended to set forth the exclusive means for use of chemical restraints, which include antipsychotic drugs. Use of the word \u201conly\u201d in G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 21, means \u201cfor no other purpose.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1703 (2d ed. 1959). The statutory language permits the use of antipsychotic drugs as restraints only in specific, limited circumstances and does not allow expansion by doctors or courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">We conclude that only if a patient poses an imminent threat of harm to himself or others, and only if there is no less intrusive alternative to antipsychotic drugs, may the Commonwealth invoke its police powers without prior court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>approval to treat the patient<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> by forcible injection of anti-psychotic drugs over the patient\u2019s objection. No other State interest is sufficiently compelling to warrant the extremely intrusive measures necessary for forcible medication with antipsychotic drugs. Any other result also would negate the Legislature\u2019s decision to regulate strictly the use of mind altering drugs as restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><em>Questions 8 and 9. Forcible antipsychotic medication essential to prevent \u201cimmediate, substantial, and irreversible deterioration of a serious mental </em>illness.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We have rejected the broad, traditional parens patriae power invoked by a State to do what is best for its citizens despite their own wishes, see <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 449 (State \u201cinterest in seeing that its residents function at the maximum level of their capacity . . . does not outweigh the fundamental individual rights here asserted\u201d), and instead have adopted the substituted judgment-standard as the norm, see <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 751-752.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">However, the State may, in rare circumstances, override a patient\u2019s refusal of medication under its so called \u201cparens patriae\u201d powers, even though no threat of violence exists. A patient may be' treated against his will to prevent the \u201cimmediate, substantial, and irreversible deterioration of a serious mental illness,\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 441, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>cases in which \u201ceven the smallest of avoidable delays would be intolerable,\u201d <em>id </em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In such a situation, interim treatment may be given to an incompetent patient, or to one whom doctors, in the exercise of their professional judgment, believe to be incompetent. If a patient is medicated in order to avoid the \u201cimmediate, substantial, and irreversible deterioration of a serious mental illness,\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 441, and the doctors determine that the antipsychotic medication should continue and the patient objects, the doctors must seek an adjudication of incompetence<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and if, after hearing, the patient is found to be incompetent, the judge should make a substituted judgment treatment plan determination.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Our answers to the certified questions are:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">1. The involuntary commitment of a mental patient is not a determination that he is incompetent to make treatment decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">2. Incompetence must be determined by a judge in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">3. Competency and substituted-j udgment determinations may be made in a Probate Court, the Superior Court, a Juvenile Court, or a juvenile session of a District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">4. A substituted judgment treatment decision must be made for an involuntarily committed patient who has been adjudicated to be incompetent before the patient can be forcibly medicated with antipsychotic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">5. A judge must make the substituted-j udgment decision and should approve a treatment plan after notice and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>hearing. The guardian should monitor the treatment plan. In making the substituted-]'udgment decision, the judge should consider the six factors detailed in <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 444, as well as any other relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">6. In a nonemergency situation, no State interest is sufficiently compelling to overcome a patient\u2019s decision to refuse treatment with antipsychotic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">7. The Commonwealth\u2019s police power permits forcible medication as a chemical restraint over a patient\u2019s objection in an emergency. Such use must comply with G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 21, and 104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.12 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">8. Forcible treatment with antipsychotic drugs may be given to a patient to prevent the \u201cimmediate, substantial, and irreversible deterioration of a serious mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">9. If the doctors determine that administration of the antipsychotic drugs, prescribed to prevent the \u201cimmediate, substantial, and irreversible deterioration of a serious mental illness,\u201d should continue, they must seek an adjudication of incompetency, and if the patient is adjudicated incompetent, a substituted-judgment treatment plan.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-15\"> \u201cAntipsychotic\u201d drugs are \u201cmedications such as Thorazine, Mellaril, Prolixin, and Haldol that are used in treating psychoses, particularly schizophrenia.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Okin, </em>634 F.2d 650, 653 n.1 (1st Cir. 1980), vacated and remanded sub nom. <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>457 U.S. 291 (1982).

If a proper determination of incompetency to make treatment decisions has been made, and in the absence of an emergency justifying exercise of the state\u2019s police power or an imminent threat to a patient\u2019s condition justifying exercise of the state\u2019s <em>parens patriae </em>power, under state law must there be a substituted judgment decision, or other decision by a person aside from the incompetent, prior to the administration of psychotropic drugs?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">\u201c5. If so, who may make such a decision, what procedures must be followed, and what factors must be considered?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\"> We focus on patients who refuse treatment, because we anticipate that it is in this context that the issues will generally arise. Because a person is competent until adjudicated incompetent, see G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6; <em>supra </em>at 490-491, a patient\u2019s acceptance of antipsychotic drugs ordinarily does not require judicial proceedings. We add, however, that, because incompetent persons cannot meaningfully consent to medical treatment, a substituted judgment by a judge should be undertaken for the incompetent patient even if the patient accepts the medical treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b517-6\"> Even if the patient\u2019s choice will not achieve the restoration of the patient\u2019s health, or will result in longer hospitalization, that choice must be respected. The patient has the right to be wrong in the choice of treatment. We have rejected the State interest in helping citizens to \u201cfunction at the maximum level of their capacity.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 449. Although the State may occasionally \u201chave a generalized parens patriae interest in removing obstacles to individual development, this general interest does not outweigh the fundamental individual rights here asserted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Improvement of the individual\u2019s health and prevention of crises in a patient\u2019s disease may be considered if there is to be a substituted judgment decision, but those considerations in and of themselves are not sufficient to override the patient\u2019s right of self-determination. <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 447.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\"> In <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra, </em>we decided that (1) there are \u201cfew legitimate medical procedures which are more intrusive than the forcible injection of antipsychotic medication,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 436; (2) the side effects of antipsychotic drugs \u201care frequently devastating and often irreversible,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 438; (3) the situation at issue there, as here, was not one \u201cwhich could accurately be described as an emergency,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 440; and (4) judicial appointment of the guardian and the judge\u2019s determination of incompetency is \u201csignificant and inescapable prior judicial involvement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 442. These circumstances do not differ materially when the incompetent person is institutionalized. See generally Comment, Medication and Adjudication: Extending <em>In re Richard Roe III </em>to Institutionalized Psychiatric Patients, 17 New Eng. L. Rev. 1029 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Dr. Stone, however, also observes that \u201c[i]f the decisionmaker is not a judge, ... it will be difficult to insure the patient\u2019s civil liberties.\u201d A. Stone, Mental Health and Law: A System in Transition 104 (1975). Implicit in Dr. Stone\u2019s assessment is the recognition that the goal of restoration of a patient\u2019s health and the patient\u2019s civil rights may conflict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\"> The facts as found in <em>Rogers I </em>do not support the defendants\u2019 position. The judge found that \u201cthe great majority of patients [did] not [decline] their psychotropic medication during the pendency of the [Federal District Court\u2019s] temporary restraining order. Most of those who did changed their minds within a few days.\u201d <em>Rogers I, supra </em>at 1370. The doctors\u2019 ability to establish a therapeutic environment in treating the patients was not substantially reduced, which \u201cspeaks well for the confidence in a doctor\u2019s judgment. . . [when the doctor makes] the effort to establish a strong therapeutic alliance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\"> Economic considerations may also create conflicts between doctors and patients. Because medication with antipsychotic drugs \u201csaves time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>money, and people,\u201d Zander, Prolixin Decanoate: Big Brother by Injection? 5 J. Psychiatry &amp; L. 55, 56 (1977), the temptation to engage in blanket prescription of such drugs to maintain order and compensate for personnel shortages may be irresistible. See <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at n.11 (citation to literature documenting \u201cabuses of antipsychotic medication by those claiming to act in an incompetent\u2019s best interests\u201d); <em>Rogers I, supra </em>at 1377 n.45 (decision to seclude for a period longer than necessary caused by \u201cenvironmental\u201d factors such as staff shortages and patient load).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\"> The guardian must be readily available, or the court must take on the monitoring role. If no neutral guardian is available, the court may act in the place of a guardian under the broad, flexible equitable powers granted by G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6 (Probate Court), or G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1 (Superior Court), or the special equitable power granted to the Juvenile Courts or juvenile sessions of District Courts by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b522-9\"> Dangerous side effects can occur even if the drugs are \u201cresponsibly and competently administered, with great care and consideration for the patient.\u201d Brooks, The Constitutional Right to Refuse Antipsychotic Medications, 8 Bull.

We adhere to that definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b527-7\"> The defendants suggest that certain patients, as a symptom of their illness, will periodically threaten violence. Predictable crises are not within the definition of emergency. See note 25, <em>supra. </em>Therefore, in those cases, the consent of the patient for medication with antipsychotic drugs must be obtained in advance, while the patient is competent and calm. If the patient has been declared incompetent, the periodic episodes of violence should be considered in formulating the substituted-judgment treatment pl\u00e1n.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\"> Questions 8 and 9 (\u201cEmergency Situations\u201d) are:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">\u201c8.
