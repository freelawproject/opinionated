The point now made is that the recorder had no jurisdiction. The procedure is that pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>scribed by the Board of Health act. <em>Board of Health </em>v. <em>New York, &amp;c., Railroad </em>Co., 48 <em>Vroom </em>15. By that act jurisdiction is conferred upon district courts, police justices and recorders in cities, and justices of the peace. No authority is conferred upon recorders in boroughs. It is suggested that the recorder of Vineland was also a justice of the peace. It is enough to say that he did not assume to act in that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The conviction must be set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
