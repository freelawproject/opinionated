Eldridge.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b543-6\">Trenchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ7\">The plaintiff below sued to recover the sum of $308.15 for extra work done on a building of the defendant which plaintiff had a contract to build for $7,766. The jury awarded plaintiff a verdict for $101.95, and from the consequent, judgment the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Of the several objections specified as reasons for reversal, the only one referred in the brief presented on behalf of the appellant is that the court refused to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant, and that objection alone need be considered. <em>Aschenburg </em>v. <em>Mundy, </em>47 <em>Vroom </em>353.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">In his brief the appellant states his position as follows: \u201cThe precise question for this court to determine is, if there is a written contract to perform certain work for $7,766, and a claim by the plaintiff for extra work amounting, as claimed by him, to $308.15, and he admits and concedes that he received $8,800 from the defendant on the job in question, is he still entitled under any circumstances to recover anything for the alleged extra work?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">We think there may be circumstances under which a plaintiff in that situation may recover, and we agree with the trial judge that the evidence in this case required the submission of the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">A part of plaintiff\u2019s claim for extra work was for labor and materials supplied in the erection of a counter in the defendant\u2019s store building, and fox this only he recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">This counter was not included in the written contract to erect the store building for $7,766. It was open to the jury to find that other extra work was done, and, in fact, that seems to be conceded. The plaintiff received in all, \u201con the job,\u201d $8,800, the last installment of which was a payment of $3,000. It was also open to the jury to find from the conflicting evidence that the last payment of $3,000, on account of the original contract price and extra work, did not include payment for the counter. The claim made by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>that the plaintiff agreed to \u201cmake him a present\u201d of the counter was denied by the plaintiff. And so a typical jury question was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
