The appellant, Eddie L. Jones, argues that one of his prior state offenses could not be used as a predicate offense under United States Sentencing Guidelines Section 4B1.1 because adjudication was withheld, he was placed on probation in that case, and the district court therefore incorrectly sentenced him as a career offender. While this Court has not previously addressed the specific sentence guideline issue presented in this case, we have on several previous occasions addressed a similar issue in a non-guidelines context. This Court has previously held that a state case in which adjudication was withheld after a <em>nolo </em>plea qualified as a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of a federal prosecution under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922 <em>et seq. </em>for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bruscantini, </em>761 F.2d 640, 641 (11th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>727 F.2d 1028, 1029 (11th Cir.1984); <em>see also United States v. Grinkiewicz, </em>873 F.2d 253, 255 (11th Cir.1989) (adjudication withheld after guilty plea). The reasoning applied in these cases is applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">Therefore, we hold that Jones\u2019s prior offense was a conviction for the purposes of Section 4B1.1 and AFFIRM his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
