(\u201cLumar\u201d), appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of a Motion for Summary Judgment in favor of Insurance Company of North America (\u201cINA\u201d), dismissing Lumar\u2019s complaint. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-20\">This is a diversity case originally filed by Lumar against INA in state court in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, and from there timely removed by INA to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The parties and the district court unanimously concluded that the substantive law of Louisiana applied in this case. On the basis of stipulated facts INA filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of Lumar\u2019s complaint. INA urged that its policy of excess insurance did not \u201cdrop down\u201d to provide primary insurance coverage to Lumar when Lumar\u2019s primary carrier became insolvent. Lumar filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on the same issue, contending that INA\u2019s excess coverage did drop down under those circumstances. When the District Court granted INA\u2019s motion and entered judgment dismissing Lumar\u2019s complaint, Lumar appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-22\">This case was filed after Lumar was cast in judgment in <em>Simeon v. T. Smith &amp; Son, Inc., </em>No. 84-4705 (E.D.La.1984), <em>aff'd, Simeon v. T. Smith &amp; Son, Inc., </em>852 F.2d 1421 (5th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied sub nom, Lumar Marine, Inc. v. Simeon, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 3156, 104 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1989). Simeon\u2019s recovery resulted from an accident that occurred on September 27, 1981, on the M/V Tako Bandit,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one of several vessels owned by Lumar and primarily insured by Glacier General Assurance Company (\u201cGlacier\u201d) up to $500,-000.00. The final judgment in favor of Simeon exceeded that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-25\">At the time of Simeon\u2019s accident, a policy of excess insurance issued by INA covered Lumar\u2019s vessels, including the M/V Tako Bandit. That policy covered the type of risk upon which Simeon\u2019s judgment was based. Glacier became insolvent after Si-meon\u2019s accident but before his litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>was completed. Glacier was not a member carrier of the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association (\u201cLIGA\u201d), so Lumar had no claim for relief from that organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-4\">At issue in this case is whether INA\u2019s policy, issued to cover Lumar\u2019s liability in excess of its coverage under the Glacier policy or any other insurance, must \u201cdrop down\u201d to provide coverage to Lumar from \u201cdollar one\u201d because of Glacier\u2019s insolvency and LIGA\u2019s absence of coverage. The answer to that question lies in the wording of the INA policy, interpreted according to the law of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">An examination of the INA policy reveals the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-7\">The upper right-hand corner of the first page of the policy contains a multiple choice check list for the type of coverage provided. A typed \u201cx\u201d appears to the left of the first of those choices, <em>\u201cExcess </em>Protection &amp; Indemnity.\u201d (emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-9\">The words \u201cas per schedule\u201d are typed into the blank that follows the dollar sign in \u201cLimits of Liability: $_.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-11\">The following paragraph appears in the center of the first page:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1351-12\">INSURING CONDITIONS: This insurance shall, subject to the terms and conditions herein, indemnify the Assured [Lumar] for all sums which the Assured shall become obliged to pay for liability described in and insured against in underlying primary insurances listed hereon, but this insurance is warranted free from claims in respect of any one loss, accident or occurrence unless the aggregate of such claims exceed [sic] the <em>amounts insured </em>in the primary underlying insurances in which event this Company shall be liable only for the amount by which such aggregate exceeds the limit of liability in the primary underlying insurance not to exceed, however, the Limit of Liability as shown on Line 9 of this policy [\u201c$ as per schedule\u201d] for any one accident or occurrence arising out of the same event:\u201d (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1351-14\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-15\">Three column headings appear under the heading PRIMARY UNDERLYING INSURANCES.

Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ. P. 56(c). A dispute about a material fact is genuine \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liber </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number><em>ty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \u201cMaterial facts\u201d are \u201cfacts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-4\">Our review of the entire IN A policy, the stipulated facts, the briefs of appellant and appellee, and the opinion of the district court, convinces us that the district court reached the correct conclusion for the correct reasons under the Louisiana jurisprudence then extant. We are constrained, however, in our de novo review of this case, to consider it in light of late-breaking developments in Louisiana\u2019s jurisprudence on drop down coverage in excess insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">In its original brief to this court, Lumar advised that two cases were then pending before the Supreme Court of Louisiana, <em>Robichaux v. Randolph, </em>555 So.2d 581 (La.App.1989), <em>cert granted, </em>556 So.2d 1288 (La.1990), and <em>Kelly v. Weil, writ granted, </em>556 So.2d 1288 (La.1990). Lumar\u2019s brief also noted that \u201cit appears that the Louisiana Supreme Court is preparing to write a comprehensive decision on the drop down issue.... Even if it is not directly on point, the Supreme Court of Louisiana\u2019s decision would certainly be instructive on the present issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">That prophetic observation proved to be both accurate and unfortunate for Lumar. The Louisiana Supreme Court handed down opinions in <em>Kelly, </em>563 So.2d 221, and <em>Robichaux, </em>563 So.2d 226, on June 4, 1990. That court selected <em>Kelly </em>as the case in which to espouse the method Louisiana courts (and federal courts in diversity cases) shall henceforth employ to analyze excess insurance policies when determining whether excess coverage \u201cdrops down\u201d to provide primary coverage upon the insolvency of the carrier which had provided primary coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">As he had done in his original brief, able counsel for Lumar made a valiant and scholarly effort to make the best of a bad situation. Filing a reply brief with this court, counsel for Lumar toiled mightily to alchemize the base metal of the <em>Kelly </em>opinion into gold for his client. But, alas, the philosopher\u2019s stone remains mythical; <em>Kelly </em>seals Lumar\u2019s fate in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">Writing for a unanimous court in <em>Kelly, </em>Chief Justice Calogero observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-10\">A review of the state and federal jurisprudence in this country reveals that the controlling consideration on this \u201cdrop down\u201d issue is the agreement between the insurer and the insured, namely, the insurance policy itself. Basically three types of excess policies are to be found in the cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1353-11\">The <em>Kelly </em>court determined that the first such category consists of those policies under which drop down occurs because they contain clear and unambiguous language that ties excess coverage to the amount of primary insurance proceeds and other insurance proceeds that are <em>collectible. </em>The second category consists of those policies under which drop down does not occur because they define their limits by reference to the policy limits of scheduled primary insurance. The third category consists of those policies which contain potentially ambiguous definitions of their limits of liability by employing formulae based on the sum of the limits of primary coverage, \u201cand\u201d or \u201cplus\u201d any other <em>collectible </em>insurance. The <em>Kelly </em>court\u2019s review of the jurisprudence determined that drop down was held to occur in some cases in the third category but not in the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-12\">The court placed the <em>Kelly </em>policy in the third category, the one in which \u201cthe insured\u2019s \u2018retained limit\u2019 is defined as the greater of the \u2018applicable limits of the scheduled underlying policies, and [or plus] the applicable limits of any other insurance collectible by the insured.\u2019 \u201d The <em>Kelly court </em>noted that such phraseology \u201cat least arguably raises the question of whether the excess insurance kicks in if <em>the underlying insurance </em>is not \u2018collectible by the insured.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original)</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-13\">The Louisiana Supreme Court found that a minority of the courts, including Louisiana\u2019s Fourth Circuit in <em>Poirrier v. Cajun Insulation, Inc., </em>501 So.2d 800 (La.App.1986), find first that such language is ambiguous, then that \u201ccollectible\u201d modifies both \u201cother insurance\u201d and the scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>\u201cunderlying policies,\u201d and finally that the excess insurance drops down because the \u201cretained limit\u201d excludes the scheduled underlying policy limits to the extent they are not collectible. The Supreme Court, however, rejected that minority position, expressly overruling <em>Poirrier </em>(the most important case Lumar cited in support of its argument) in the process. The <em>Kelly </em>court embraced the majority jurisprudence of this country in finding, first, that there was no ambiguity and, second, that there was no requirement that to avoid drop down the proceeds of the underlying policy be <em>collectible. </em>In support of that position, the <em>Kelly </em>court cited two cases from this court, <em>Transco Explor. Co. v. Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>869 F.2d 862 (5th Cir.1989), and <em>Continental Marble &amp; Granite v. Canal Ins. Co., </em>785 F.2d 1258 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">Moreover, as Lumar itself observed, the language in the INA policy is not identical to the language in the policies in <em>Kelly and Robichaux. </em>For purposes of the point under consideration, the principal difference is that, unlike the language of the policies in <em>Kelly\u2019s </em>third category, the pertinent language of the INA policy (quoted <em>in extenso </em>as item 3. above) does <em>not </em>define the insured\u2019s retained limits in terms of \u201cthe greater of the applicable limits of the scheduled underlying policy <em>and </em>[or <em>plus </em>] the applicable limits of any other insurance collectible by the insured.\u201d (emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">Thus, the INA policy does not fall within <em>Kelly\u2019s </em>third category. It falls instead within the <em>Kelly </em>opinion\u2019s second category.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">Our reading of the above quoted provisions from the INA policy, particularly the INSURING CONDITIONS and ENDORSEMENT # 1, places that policy squarely in the second category of excess policies under <em>Kelly. </em>The Louisiana Supreme Court defined the policies in its second category as those which \u201cdescribe the excess coverage as the excess of the limits of the policies \u2018covered\u2019 in schedules attached to the policy.... The retained limit in this instance is simply the limits of the policies \u2018covered\u2019 in the attached schedules. Excess coverage is not made dependent on recoverability or collectibility of the amount.\u201d Other than the OTHER INSURANCE provision (upon which Lumar relies in its effort to place the policy in <em>Kelly\u2019s </em>third category), none of the quoted provisions even mention the \u201crecoverability\u201d or \u201ccollectibility\u201d of the underlying primary insurance proceeds. They do, however, refer repeatedly and consistently to the primary insurer\u2019s <em>\u201climit of liability.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-8\">Furthermore, as to Lumar\u2019s contention that the phrases <em>\u201camounts insured \u201d </em>and <em>\u201climit of liability\u201d </em>which appear in the INSURING CONDITIONS provision are ambiguous, a fair reading of the phrase \u201cunderlying amounts of insurance\u201d in the PRIMARY AND UNDERLYING POLICIES provision demonstrates that the former phrases are synonymous. In the context of the latter provision, the term can only mean the limit of liability. As to that provision, INA established that if the insured and the primary insurer agreed without INA\u2019s approval to reduce the latter\u2019s limit of liability, only so much of the liability as might exceed the original limit of liability for the primary insurer would trigger liability for INA, the excess insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-9\">Even if, however, the INA policy had placed this case within <em>Kelly\u2019s </em>third category, drop down still would not occur under the <em>Kelly </em>test for that category. Lumar would argue that the conjoining of the INA\u2019s policy\u2019s INSURING CONDITIONS provisions and its OTHER INSURANCE provisions might more properly place the policy within the third <em>Kelly </em>category. But those two INA provisions are far more disjunctive than were the phrases which only a comma and the conjunction \u201cand\u201d separated within the single provision in the <em>Kelly </em>policy. In the INA policy they are separate sentences, appearing in separate provisions that themselves appear on separate pages. They are as separate functionally as they are spatially.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-11\">The issue of whether the excess insurance policy in this case must drop down to cover the $500,000.00 primary coverage that the Glacier policy would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>provided had Glacier not become insolvent really asks which of two innocent parties, Lumar or INA, bore the risk of Glacier\u2019s insolvency. Like most other jurisdictions, Louisiana adheres to the following maxims when interpreting contracts: (1) the contract is the law between the parties; (2) ambiguous contractual provisions are construed against the drafter; and (3) the printed language of an insurance policy is construed strictly against the insurer and in favor of the insured. In this case the district court found no ambiguity and, despite its application of that third maxim, determined it was Lumar, not INA, which must bear the burden of Glacier\u2019s insolvency. The district court found so on the basis of its sound analysis of the <em>pre-Kelly </em>Louisiana jurisprudence, including <em>Poirrier, </em>and we concur in that analysis. Now that the Louisiana Supreme Court in <em>Kelly </em>has spoken directly and comprehensively on the drop down issue, any possible doubt about the propriety of the district court\u2019s holding in this case has been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1350-17\">. In the district court opinion the vessel's name appears as \u201cTACO BANDIT,\u201d but the policy endorsement and other materials reflect \u201cTako\" as the first name of that and each other Lumar vessel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
