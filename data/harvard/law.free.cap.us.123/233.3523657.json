Complainant annexes hereto a list of said last named lahds; to wit, of said 47,9\u00bbacres, marked Exhibit <em>\u2018C.\u2019 </em>Complainant is informed and believes that said lands are worth about $3.00 per acre, or about $150,000 ; that said lands are known as the <em>\u2018 </em>wagon-road lands,\u2019 and wgre acquired from the State of Michigan by one Francis W. Anthony, and were conveyed to said bankrupt company mortgagee. Exhibit \u2018 O \u2019 is a coj&gt;y of the list on file in the office of the Secretary of State of Michigan, being certificate of purchase No. 1 of military road land under act No. 20 of the laws of 1864, approved February 4th. That March 4th, 1873, Ilenry S. Wells, a bondholder secured by complainant\u2019s said mortgage, filed his bill in this court, impleading, among others, said Francis W. Anthony, said assignees, and this complainant, and sought, by said bill to subject the said \u2018 wagon-road lands,\u2019 other than said 47,9587%5\u00b6 acres, to the lien of complainant\u2019s mortgage, \u00bfand to prevent their conveyance by the State to third parties, and afterwards such proceedings were had that the relief sought was denied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>That in article ten of a cross-bill, fil\u00e9d by said assignees in this court September 13th, 1873, said assignees state that certain stockholders of said bankrupt had contracted to buy lands to the amount of 200,000 acres, parcel of a larger amount granted by the State of Michigan for the construction of a military wagon-road, and, assuming to be owners, had conveyed the same to the said bankrupt; that said grantors had acquired title to. only about 49,000 acres, and only about that amount became vested in said bankrupt, and that the residue had been patented by the State of Michigan to other parties and lost to said corporation, and that said assignees made the same statement substantially in their answer to a bill by this complainant to foreclose said mortgage in' the said district court, which bill was discontinued.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">The prayer, so far as it related to the road lands, -was, \u201c that said 47,958-3^ acres of land known as \u2018 wagon-road lands \u2019 may also be sold; and that all the estate, right, title, and interest of the defendants in the rest and residue of said 200,000 acres of wagon-road lands may be sold,\u201d and the proceeds applied to the payment of the outstanding bonds. The decree, which was entered March 13, 1877, established the lien of the Union Trust Company mortgage on the 47,958T8T5T acres of wagon-road lands to which the canal company had title, and, as to the rest, found as follows : \u201c That the title to the remainder of said wagon-road lands passed from the State of Michigan to third parties, so that, as to the same, the said Union Trust mortgage covers only a possible equity, which equity in the residue of said 200,000 acres of wagon-road lands, is also a security for said 1300 bonds.\u201d It was then ordered, among other things, that \u201c the equity of redemption or other right or interest of said mortgagor corporation in the residue of said wagon-road lands \u201d be sold with the other mortgaged property, including the 47,958-3-8^ acres, to pay the bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">Under this decree the mortgaged property was sold in June or July of 1877 to Albon P.

Ayer, then in life, but since deceased, the right to or equity of redemption in all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>200,000 acres of wagon lands which had not been actually conveyed to Anthony, and by him 'to the purchasers from him, and by them to the canal company. ' '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\">The present bill-.was filed on the 12th of July, 1882, by Morris Richter,,as \u201cthe holder, as purchaser in good faith,\u201d of two hundred and thirty of .the thirteen hundred bonds secured by-the Union Trust Company mortgage, against the Union Trust Company, the assignees in bankruptcy of the canal company, and the widow, heirs, devisees, and trustees tinder the will of Ayer, then deceased. Richter had received on each of his bonds from the master the sum of nine dollars as his share of the proceeds of the Union Trust Company foreclosure. ' No other payment of principal or interest had ever been ma(]e. The bill charged in substance that Theodore M. Davis, receiver of the Ocean National Blink, being the holder of 910 of the various issues of the bonds of the canal company as security for a debt of the company to the bank of about fifty per cent of the-face-of the .bonds, J. Boorman Johnston <em>&amp; Co. </em>holding 200 of one of the issues of bonds as security for a debt of the company of about eighty per cent of the amount of the bonds, and James C. Ayer <em>&amp; Co., </em>of which James C. Ayer was the principal proprietor, holding 780 of the various issues of bonds as security for a debt of the company of about fifty per cent of the amount of the bonds, formed a syndicate at the instance of Davis, and \u201c agreed to pool their bonds and debts aforesaid for the common interest of said syndicate, and. to run down the value of -said bonds upon the market, and to wreck the enterprise aforesaid.\u201d By the fraud and connivance of the members of this syndicate, as is alleged, \u201c the legal title to the whole of said pledged bonds was. procured,\u201d before May 27, 1872, \u201cat a- mere fraction of their.face value.\u201d This being done, the syndicate,- on the 27th of May, 1S72, caused proceedings to be commenced for the foreclosure of the first of the land-grant mortgages, and on the 3d of July, 1872, similar proceedings for the foreclosure of the second of that class of mortgages, and on the 5th of the same month for the third. The bill then alleged that before these suits were begun the directors of the canal company had proceeded \u2022 so far with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>negotiations for raising money for their enterprise that \u201ca successful conclusion was assured on a basis of satisfactory title of said 600,000 acres of land being found in said . . . canal company, and on the value of said property being verified as represented by report of agents for that purpose, who had been delegated by foreign capitalists to investigate to that end, of which promised success, the said syndicate having been advised, they, the said members of said syndicate, set themselves about thwarting the success of said negotiations, and accomplished their purpose\u201d by buying over Anthony from his allegiance to the canal company under his contract with the Averys, \"Wild, and Conant, furnishing the money necessary to complete the wagon-road contract, and getting the title to the unpatented lands in Ayer. This scheme was accomplished, and lands amounting in the aggregate to something more than 173,000 acres were conveyed to Ayer^153,000 acres in 1873, and the remainder in 1875. To induce Anthony to come into the scheme he was paid a bonus of $20,000 by Ayer,, and furnished the money necessary to complete his contract for building the road. The date of this transaction does not appear, except, generally, that it was in 1872. This, as was alleged, prevented the canal company from raising money, and the syndicate, with the intent to secure to Ayer the title to the \u201c residue of said wagon-road lands,\u201d enlisted the said Union Trust Company of New York in their designs, and procured the said Union Trust Company . . . to allow . . . Alfred Bussell, the solicitor of the said syndicate, upon the retainer of said, syndicate, to foreclose the said Union Trust mortgage in the interest' of said syndicate, but with the understanding that such foreclosure should be conducted . . . for the protection of the aforesaid legal title to the said residue of said wagon-road lands in the said James C. Ayer, as far as practicable and possible under the decree to be obtained therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-9\">The bill then alleged in substance that the suit for foreclosure was begun and carried on for this purpose among others, and that Ayer got the mortgage title to the residue of the lands under the decree in that way and pursuant to that under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>standing. And finally it was alleged that the decree rendered in the cases under which the title was got \u201c was not, in fact, an adjudication of the said court upon consideration of the pleadings and proofs in the said several causes which, as appears by said decree, were heard and decided together, but was, in fact, a decree drawn by the said Alfred Bussell, solicitor of the syndicate aforesaid, and submitted to by compulsion by those representing collateral interests therein, and assented to by the Union Trust Company of New York aforesaid in collusion with the syndicate aforesaid through their solicitor aforesaid, and by the said George Jerome and Fernando 0. Beaman, assignees in bankruptcy of said ship-canal company aforesaid, through ignorance of the rights and equities of the said last-mentioned corporation against the legal title of the said James 0. Ayer to the said residue of the said wagon-road lands beyond the 47,000 and odd acres which were actually sold under said decree; and said Jerome and Beaman were actually misled as to the lien of the said Union Trust mortgage upon said residue of said wagon-road lands by the collusion, neglect, and failure of the said Union Trust Company, in its foreclosure bill aforesaid, to' make said James C. Ayer a party defendant, charging the legal title to said lands in his hands with a trust for the payment of said mortgage, and by the collusive concession in said foreclosure bill that the title to said residue of said wagon-road lands had been lost- to the said ship canal company and taken out from under tlio lien of said mortgage by reason of a grant thereof to third parties by the State of Michigan, whereby the lien of said mortgage had been lost, and hence the said Jerome and Beaman, seeing no interest which they could conserve by opposing said decree as drawn, and insisted on by said Russell, consented to said decree as proposed by said Bussell, and said decree was entered accordingly by consent as aforesaid, and so it was represented to tho judge who allowed the same to be entered without opposition or argument or consideration, and it was signed accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">The prayer of the bill was \u201c that your orator may be allowed by this comb to have the benefit of said decree heroin set forth as \u2018 Schedule 1),\u2019 hereto, in behalf of your orator, and any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>holders of said 1300 bonds secured by the said mortgage to the said Union Trust Company of New York, who are <em>Iona fide </em>holders of said bonds in said decree mentioned, and that in behalf of your orator and said bondholders the said residue of 200,000 acres of wagon-road lands so deeded to said James C.

The bill was not filed to set aside the decree in the suit'brought by the Union Trust Company to foreclose its mortgage. On the contrary, the complainant asks in express terms to have the benefit of that decree, so that, as we suppose, he may keep the money he has got as his share of the proceeds of the sale under it. Neither is it sought to hold the Onion Trust Company accountable for its alleged misconduct and breach of faith in' the proceedings for the fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>closure of the mortgage. Nor is the suit brought to obtain a specific performance of the contract between Anthony and the Averys, Wild, and Conant, nor to-recover back the money paid by the canal company on that contract over and above what was necessary to pay for the lands which had been patented to Anthony,' and which were actually sold under the Union Trust Company decree for the benefit of the complainant and the other bondholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">But it is, if we understand it correctly, a suit to charge the wagon-road lands, now in the hands of the legal representatives of Ayer, with a trust in favor of bondholders as security for the amount due them respectively, subject only to a lien for the moneys actually advanced to enable Anthony to complete his contract for building the road and thus become entitled to patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">There can be no doubt but the mortgage by the canal company conveyed to the Union Trust Company, as trustee for the bondholders, all the interest in the lands which was conveyed to the canal company by the warranty deed of Perez J. Avery, Wild, and Conant; but that was no more than the interests which those grantors acquired by the contract with Anthony. As their deed was with covenants of warranty, any title which they afterwards acquired under the Anthony contract would enure to the benefit of the bondholders through the Trust Company as their trustee holding for their benefit, and as their representative. All the rights the bondholders have or ever had in the mortgage, legal or equitable, they got through the Trust Company, to which the conveyance was made for their security. As bondholders claiming under the mortgage, they can have no interest in the security except that which the trustee holds and represents. If the trustee acts in good faith, whatever binds it in any legal proceedings it begins and carries on to enforce the trust, to which they are not actual parties, binds them. <em>Kerrison </em>v. Stewart, 93 U.S. 155, 160; Corcoran <em>v. Chesapeake, &amp;c., Canal Co., </em>94 U.S. 741, 745; <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>100 U.S. 605, 611. Whatever forecloses the trustee, in the absence of fraud or bad faith, forecloses them. This is the undoubted rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>' Here the Trust Company began its suit for the foreclosure of its mortgage, and has sold under the decree in that suit all the interests, legal and equitable, which it held in the land as trustee for the bondholders, and distributed the proceeds, the' complainant receiving his share without complaint and .without objection. All the rights which the Trust Company, as trustee, had in the lands at the time of the mortgage passed to the purchaser at the sale. That sale, 'it is conceded, binds the Trust Company as trustee and therefore it binds the complainant as a bondholder. If the decree or the sale under it was in fraud of the rights of the bondholders, their remedy is by a direct proceeding to set aside the sale or the decree, and to proceed anew with another foreclosure of the mortgage, and not to undertake to reforeclose what had been fully foreclosed before under a decree which remains in forc\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">But it is said that the original foreclosure was of no effect, because neither Anthony nor Ayer was a party to the suit, and the rights of the Trust Company and its beneficiaries under the mortgage were neither set forth with certainty in the bill nor found in the decree. No relief was sought either against Anthony or Ayer. The sole purpose of the bill was to sell the interest of the mortgagee in the lands, whatever that interest might be. To a suit for that purpose neither Anthony nor Ayer was a necessary party,- because it was not important to them who held the fights that were to be sold, and such a sale would not affect them. The canal company, or its assignees in bankruptcy, were parties to the suit, and instead of objecting, as they might, to a sale of the property without a more specific adjudication as to what was to be sold, consented to it. The bondholders were represented in the suit by their trustee, and are bound by the decree so long as it stands unreversed, and is not set aside or vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The argument of counsel for the appellants seems to proceed on the ground that there are two equities growing out of the mortgage to the Trust Company, which may be dealt with in two separate suits as they are separate and distinct in their character. One he calls the mortgagor\u2019s equity, consisting of the rights of the canal company in the lands growing out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>the contract by Anthony for their sale to the Averys, Wild, and Conant.' This equity, if we understand counsel correctly, it is conceded was sold under the proceeding's for foreclosure, and now belongs to the purchaser. The other he denominates the <em>\u201c </em>bondholders\u2019 equity,\u201d and it arises out of the purchase by Ayer from Anthony of his rights under the contract with the State of Michigan for building the wagon road when he (Ayer) had knowledge of the former contract under which the canal company could have perfected its title to the unpatented lands included in the mortgage if he had not interfered. Under this equity counsel say they now seek to recover for the bondholders \u201c only the profits which Ayer made by stepping into Anthony\u2019s shoes in the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AMK\">We are unable to see how these two equities, if thex'e ax\u2019e two, can be separated in the way contemplated. They both grow out of the canal company\u2019s rights under the contract between Aixthony, axid the Averys, Wild, and Conant. If the canal company could not recover froxn. Ayer, neither the bondholders nor their trustee in the mortgage can.. The title upon which their right of recovery rests, if such a right ever existed at all, was in the Trust Company, as the \u2019 trustee of their security, at the time the original foreclosure was had, and it was part of the mortgagor\u2019s equity which was sold. It was then what this bill seeks to make it now, part of the security of the bondholders under the Trust Company mortgage, and being such it passed with the rest to the purchaser at that sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Something is also said in the argument about the equitable claims of the bondholders upon Ayer as the successor of Anthony, growing out of the false representations made to them as to the title of the lands covered by the mortgage when they paid the money and took their bonds; but all such claims come from the' mortgage, as to which, in all proceedings for foreclosure, they are represented by their trustee when its interests are not in conflict with theirs. All the equities now asserted were proper subjects for adjudication in the former suit if they existed. They formed pax\u2019t and parcel of the security which was then enforced, and, not being excepted from the sale, passed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>This makes it unnecessary to consider whether there was such fraud on the part of Anthony as to charge the lands in the hands of Ayer, even if the Trust Company were now proceeding against him under the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The decree is</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
