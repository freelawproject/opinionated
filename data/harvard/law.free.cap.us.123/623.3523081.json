These rights are guaranteed by the Federal and State Constitutions in the provisions of those instruments which protect \u201c life, liberty, and property.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-7\">The doctrines of the Commune give to the State the right to control the tastes, appetites, and habits of the citizen: his dress, food, drink, domestic relations are controlled and regulated by the State. \u201cThe State is everything, the individual nothing.\u201d In order to make him a useful citizen and tax-payer, the State exercises a surveillance over all that he is and has.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-8\">On the other hand, our system of government, based upon the individuality and intelligence of the people, does not claim to control the citizen, except as to his conduct to others, leaving him the sole judge as to all that only affects himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-9\">The right to manufacture for his own use either food or drink is certainly an absolute or natural right, reserved to every citizen \u2014 one gu\u00e1rante by the Fourteenth Amendment, and when, under the laws of Kansas ho is .punished for manufacturing* beer, it \u201c abridges his privileges as a citizen of the United States,\u201d it \u201c de^ rives him of liberty and property without due process of law,\u201d and it denies him \u201c the equal protection of the laws.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-10\">Civil liberty is defined by Blackstone to be \u201c that of a member of society, and is no other than <em>nafwal Uberiy </em>so far re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>strained by human laws (and no further) as is necessary and expedient for the general advantage of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJq\">If the constitution and prohibitory statute of .Kansas leave any residuum of <em>natural liberty </em>remaining anywhere, it will require microscopical inquiry to find it. If a State convention or legislature can punish a citizen for manufacturing beer, or wine, or bread, not to be sold or 'bartered or even given away, but for his own use, then instead of civil liberty, we are living under the most unlimited and brutal despotism known in history.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-6\">If a convention or legislature can enter into every man\u2019s house, and prescribe what he shall or shall not manufacture, ignoring entirely the question of whether he proposes to dis.pose of the article manufactured to others, or whether its manufacture is dangerous in the process of manufacturing to the lives or property of others, then it follows logically that the same power can prescribe the tastes, habits, and expenditure of every citizen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-7\">In the <em>Slaughter-House </em>Cases, 16 Wall. 36, Mr. Justice Miller, in delivering the majority opinion, quotes approvingly Chancellor Kent\u2019s definition of the police power of the States.

Whatever may be the injurious results'from the intemperate use of beer, or whatever the difference of opinion as to its sanitary qualities, it cannot be contended that there is anything in the process of manufacturing it which endangers the lives or property of others. <em>Corfield </em>v. <em>Coryell, </em>1 Wash. C. C. 371. The constitution and statute of Kansas can only be defended on the ground that the State can take possession of the persons and property of its citizens absolutely, and so regulate and reform thein as to produce the ideal father, husband, and tax-payer of the Commune.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Without entering into the questions so fully discussed in the Slaughter-House Cases as to the proper construction of the first clause of the Fourteenth Article of Amendment, the plaintiff in error confidently submits his case upon the contention that the prohibition statute of Kansas deprives him of \u201c liberty and property without due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-5\">If we are right in the assumption that the citizen stands before the law in a dual character, both as an individual and a member of society; that in the former status he has certain natural rights not surrendered to society, but reserved to himself and necessary to his pursuit of happiness, and which the law cannot take away; that his right to manufacture any article of food or drink or apparel, provided the process of manufacturing does not endanger the lives or property of others, is one of these reserved or natural rights, then the statute of Kansas now in question is not \u201c due process of law.\u201d .

In this case the State of Kansas, by a legislative enactment, deprives the citizen of a right existing in all free governments, and only denied in unlimited despotisms. This cannot be \u201c due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-7\">If it be said that the citizen is indicted,.arrested, and tried by jury, before conviction, and that this constitutes \u201cdue process of law,\u201d our reply is that this is the mere machinery to enforce an unconstitutional statute. The mandate of the legislature is imperative, and robs the citizen of a privilege which, in a free government, cannot be denied. No discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>is given the courts, but the constitution of Kansas, and the statute made, to furnish the means for enforcing it are absolute and mandatory.

If all that is charged in the indictment be granted, what offence has been committed under the laws of any free people ? For all that appears in the case the plaintiff in error manufactured the beer for his own use, or to be exported, or for storage.

It is the question of the centuries, over and about which men have fought and suffered and died, until out of the dark and dreary struggle the great truth has been established that \u201cthe only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others, or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, mental, or spiritual.

The courts are not asked to invade the legitimate province of the legislative department in its exercise of the police power. No claim of visionary and speculative natural rights outside of the written constitution is set up. Our contention is simply that no legislature has, under our form of government, the power to prohibit the citizen from manufacturing beer, unless that manufacture bo for sale or barter to others, and when the citizen is deprived of such right by a mere legislative enactment it is not \u201c due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-5\">II. The prohibition statute of Kansas deprives the plaintiff in error, directly and absolutely, of his property, without \u201cdue process of law.\u201d His brewery was built in 1877, for the purpose of manufacturing beer to be used as a beverage, a legitimate industry, then under the protection of law. By the statutory enactment of 1881 this property, worth \u00a710,000 for the purpose to which it was adapted, is reduced to $2500 in value, not indirectly, or consequentially, but by direct prohibition of the real and primary use of the property. This question has never been directly adjudicated by this court. In <em>Bartemeyer </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>18 Wall. 129, an attempt was made to secure a ruling, but the court declined to consider the question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-6\">Prior to the constitutional amendment, and pilor to May, 1881, when the prohibition law took effect, Mugler had the right to manufacture beer without restriction as to the purpose for which it -was to be sold or used. After that date the manufacture was forbidden, except for specified purposes, and the manufacturer was required to obtain a permit. It is admitted that he had no such permit, when he made beer after May 1, 1881. ILul the legislature the constitutional power to take from him without compensation the use of his property, except for certain limited and specified purposes ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-7\">The majority of the Supreme Court of Kansas seem to have been impressed with the idea that so long as he was permitted to use his brewery for any purpose, no matter how restricted, he was not deprived of his property. This is a singular position. Every fair and candid mind will- admit that the ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>nary, usual, and principal use of beer is as a beverage, and that its use for medical, scientific, or mechanical purposes is exceptional and rare. See <em>Wynhamer </em>v. People, above cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-5\">As well might it be claimed, that a hotel-keeper, who has constructed a valuable building for the entertainment of the public, is not deprived of his- property, or its use, when forbidden by the legislature to entertain any guest unless an invalid. Such cavils are unworthy the importance of the question. Every intelligent observer knows that the statute of Kansas was enacted simply and solely to destroy the use of beer as a beverage, and for its supporters to take refuge behind the pretext that there was any other purpose, is an unfair and unworthy subterfuge. There is no pretence or claim that the legislature has not the right to prohibit the sale of beer, or its manufacture for sale or barter in the future, but that is very different from the question here presented, as to the power of the legislature to destroy the value of vested rights by- legislative enactment without compensation, and without \u201cdue process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-6\">Not satisfied with legislating for the future, the Kansas legislature has attempted to destroy property rights already vested, and created under laws enacted by. the same authority. \u201c That government can scarcely be deemed to be free where the rights of property are left wholly dependent upon- the'will of a .legislative body without any restraint. The fundamental maxims of a free government seem to require that the rights of personal liberty and private property should be held sacred.\u201d <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Leland, </em>2 Pet. 827. See also Mr. Justice Field\u2019s opinion in <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U. S. 118; Mr. Justice Bradley\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Bartemeyer </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>above cited ; <em>Beer Company </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>97 U. S. 25.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-7\">That private property cannot be taken for public purposes, without just compensation to the owner, needs no argument or array of authorities. It is a fundamental maxim of all free governments, and essentially so of ours, that whenever the necessities of the public require that the property of a citizen shall be taken or destroyed, compensation must be made for the loss. The very nature of a government based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>idea that its citizens are equal participants in all 'its benefits and burdens implies this great truth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-5\">The question was effectually disposed of by this court in <em>Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., </em>13 Wall. 166.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-6\">The Supreme Court of Kansas, or a majority of the court, came to the conclusion that the damages to plaintiff in error were so consequential, and remote that the case came within the class of cases described by Justice Strong in <em>Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>99 U. S. 635.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-7\">In the Avork of Judge Cooley the result of all the authority, <em>pro </em>and <em>con, </em>is stated by him, as follows: \u201c Any proper exercise of the powers of government which does not directly encroach upon the property of an individual, or disturb him in its possession or enjoyment, will not entitle him to compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-8\">There is no disposition to controvert this rule, and it is evident that it does not affect the case now before the court. The property of plaintiff was neither taken under a proper exercise of governmental power, or indirectly. The right of plaintiff to manufacture beer as a beverage, vested in him by existing law, is taken away directly and absolutely by legislative enactment. Whilst he is left in possession of his brewery he is forbidden to use it for the principal, and in fact the only, purpose for which it was erected. By a simple act of the legislature, without judicial proceedings, he is deprived of three-fourths the value of his property, and is told by the State which invited him, with the pretext of equal and just Iuavs, that the industry in which he has invested the savings of a life is illegal and immoral. There is no question here of consequential and remote damages. Nothing in the shape of legislation can be more direct or even brutal than the law of Kansas. It gives no time for preparation \u2014 no day in court \u2014 but sweeps away his right to manufacture by one single enactment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-9\">It is deemed unnecessary to discuss further the meaning of the term \u201c due process of law.\u201d That has been done in the first part of this argument, and nothing can be added to what is so forcibly expressed by Judge Brewer. That the questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>presented are of the gravest nature, and that great difference of opinion has arisen in regard to them admit of no doubt. Even so eminent and experienced a jurist as Judge Cooley, says: \u201cPerhaps there is no instance in which the power of the legislature to make such regulations as may destroy the value of property, without compensation to the owner, appears in a more striking light than in the case of these statutes. The trade in alcoholic drinks being lawful, and the capital employed in it being fully protected by law, the legislature then steps in and by an enactment based on general principles of public utility annihilates the traffic, destroys altogether the employment, and reduces to a nominal value, the property on hand. Even the keeping of that for the purpose of sale becomes a criminal offence, and without any change whatever in his own conduct or employment the merchant of yesterday becomes the criminal of to-day, and the very building in which he lives and conducts the business, which to that moment was lawful, becomes the subject of legal proceedings, if the statute shall so declare, and liable to be proceeded against for a forfeiture. A statute which can do this must be justified upon the highest reasons of public benefit, but whether satisfactory or not they address themselves exclusively to the legislative wisdom.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-6\">The high character of the writer of the above as a jurist and commentator forbids the suspicion that he meant to declare that the legislature could so exercise the police power as to destroy vested rights of property 'without compensation, and that the citizen is-left without redress in the courts. It is true that the legislature may, in its discretion, enact such laws as it may deem proper, but its power is limited by constitutional provisions, and there are personal and property rights beyond and above its control.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-7\">It is not claimed that the plaintiff in error, in the language of the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the Supremo. Court of Kansas, \u201ccould go on with or without legislation, and with or without a license, manufacturing beer forever,\" or that, \u201c he founds his right to continue to manufacture beer solely and exclusively upon his supposed vested right to oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ate his brewery in undisturbed tranquillity forever.\u201d No such claim has ever existed, except in the judicial imagination. But the plaintiff does claim, most earnestly and confidently, that his right to operate his brewery as vested in him by the laws of Kansas, cannot be taken away by the State without just compensation.

The entire scheme of the thirteenth section which attempts by mere legislative enactment to convert the building- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>and machinery of the appellees into a common nuisance, and to compass their destruction, and also attempts to execute the criminal law against the persons of the appellees, by equitable proceedings instead of a common law trial, is an attempt to deprive these persons of their property and their liberty without \u201c due process of law,\u201d and is therefore absolutely void; and the Circuit Judge was right in refusing to exercise the equity powers vested in the Circuit Court for either of such purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-5\">A careful examination of the thirteenth section, in connection with the rest of the act, discloses that it is a distinct legislative scheme, additional to the ordinary methods of trial, conviction and punishment, provided by the other sections of the act, and strikes by novel methods at the property of those engaged ih the manufacture, thus presenting a question which, so/far as we can find, has never been considered by this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-6\">By this section the legislature, finding a brewery within the State in actual operation, \u2014which up to the time of the passage of the act was a lawful and protected industry, \u2014 instantly, without notice, trial or hearing, by the mere exercise of its arbitrary caprice, declares it to be a common nuisance, and then prescribes the consequences which are to follow inevitably by judicial mandate commanded by the statute, and involving and permitting the exercise of no judicial discretion or judgment. The brewery being found in operation, the court is not to <em>determine </em>whether it is a common nuisance, but under the strict behest of the statute is to <em>find it </em>to be one. It is not the liquor made or the making of it which is thus enacted to be a common nuisance, but the place itself, including all the property used in keeping and maintaining the common nuisance \u2014 embracing the building, machinery, instruments and material without distinction. The judge having thus signed without inquiry \u2014 and it may be against the fact and against his own judgment \u2014 the edict of the legislature, the court is commanded, by its officers, to take possession of the place and shut it up ; and, lest the possession of the court and the closing of the establishment should not be sufficient security against the continuance of the business, the abatement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>nuisance is to be completed by the destruction, by the marshal, of all the property ; and he has no discretion but to destroy the Avhole. Ho cannot stop short at the liquor, or the glasses, or the kegs, but must demolish all property used in keeping and maintaining- the nuisance. Nor is all this destruction of property, by legislative edict, to be made as a forfeiture consequent upon conviction of any offence, but without the intervention of any real judicial action, and merely because the legislature so commands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-5\">So much of the scheme of the section is- directed against the property of the brevers, but what follows, directed against their personal liberty, is equally extraordinary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-6\">By the 7th, 8th and 9th sections of the act, complete provision is made for the punishment <em>after conviction </em>of all avIio shall either manufacture or sell Avithout a permit, or, having a permit, shall sell for any but the excepted purposes. But the thirteenth section provides that in an <em>equitable </em>action, commenced for the abatement of the nuisance, which may be instituted by the Attorney General, county attorney, or any citizen of the county AArlicre the nuisance exists, an <em>injunction </em>shall issue at the commencement of the action, which of course can only be an injunction against the <em>crimes </em>of manufacturing and selling; and as all liquors that are manufactured or sold must be manufactured or sold in some \u00a1dace, it may apply to any offenders. And for a Adulation of the injunction, that is, for the <em>crime </em>of manufacturing or selling, punishment as for <em>con</em>tempt, by the process of a court of equity, is to follow, which <em>may be a much more severe penalty than 'is prescribed as the-\u00a1penalty upon trial and conviction </em>for keeping or maintaining, the nuisance, for the latter may be a fine of five hundred dollars and imprisonment in the county jail, not more than <em>ninety </em>days, Avliile the former may be an <em>equal fine </em>and'imprisonment for <em>six months.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-7\">The act does not make the trial and conviction for keeping and maintaining the. nuisance a condition precedent to its abatement, or to the suit in equity in which these penalties may be inflicted ; but, as in the case of these appellees, <em>equity invoked at the </em>outset, to register the edict of the legislature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>that the place is a common nuisance, to take possession of the property and destroy it, and <em>.to punish the criminals </em>by fine and imprisonment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Am\">As to the proceedings <em>in rem </em>for the condemnation, forfeiture, and destruction of the property as a punishment for the <em>crime </em>of using it for the manufacture of beer, if the legislature really, intended to accomplish that purpose, as the present case assumes, without any conviction first had, or any trial in a .form known to the law, by the intervention of a- <em>court of equity, </em>in a bill filed again\u00e1t the owners, we submit that it is a clear case of depriving the owners of their property without due proc\u00e9ss of law; and this, assuming that it is within the proper province of the legislature to prohibit within the State 'all traffic in intoxicating liquors, and to declare the manufacture and sale of them to be nuisances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-7\">In connection with \u00a7 13, \u00e1nd as regulating the proceedings^ which are provided by it, to culminate, in the confiscation and destruction of the property, it is to be especially noted' that \u00a7 14, amending original \u00a7 21, expressly provides for all cases .that \u201cit shall not be necessary in the first instance for the State to prove that the party charged did not have a permit to sell intoxicating liquors for the excepted purposes; \u201d <em>i.e., </em>that the State shall not- be required to prove the '.one fact which constitutes, the offence intended to be punished by the act by loss of liberty and of property; and the presumption' of innocence is thus taken away from the party charged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-8\">In <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>McGirr, </em>1, Gray, 1, <em>S.

As well might the State assume to treat and punish any other crime in the same fashion; and what would be thought of an act of the state legislature authorizing a court of equity to issue an injunction against theft or burglary and to punish the offence, when committed as a contempt, by fine and imprisonment, the amount and term of which was measured\u2019 out by the statute ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-6\">As applicable both to proceedings against the property and to those against the person, under thife thirteenth section, it may be stated as a general proposition, requiring little argm ment for its support, that the criminal law cannot' be administered by or through courts of equity. The jurisdiction of a court of equity in cases of public nuisance, properly so called,. is exceptional, and extremely- limited in its. application. Even in cases where the jurisdiction can be invoked \u201c the question of <em>nuisance or not </em>must, in cases of doubt, be <em>tried by a jury; </em>and the injunction will be granted or not <em>as that fact is de</em>cided,.\u201d 2 Story\u2019s Eq.

In practice, this jurisdiction is applied almost exclusively to nuisances in the nature of <em>purprestures </em>upon public rights and property, as, for instance, encroachments upon highways, public fivers, streets, squares, bridges, docks and other public accommodations, and is exercised chiefly through an information at the suit of the Attorney General. 2 Story\u2019s Eq.

As a law of criminal procedure applied to the punishment of offenders against its provisions, it would be held to be a fatal departure frorp <em>\u201c </em>due process of law,\u201d and therefore void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b667-6\">And,. upon the one point, that the provision of the fourt\u00e9enth section, which \u201cin all cases\u201d dispenses with proof-in the first instance on the part of the State, that the party charged did not have a permit, which is \u201c the one indispensable fact\u201d constituting crime under the act, thereby tailing away the presumption of innocence, which is the fundamental\u2019 right of every person charged with crime, not only is the thirte\u00e9nth section unconstitutional and void, but all other parts of the act are equally so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b667-7\"><em>H. </em>Within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment this act deprived the appellees of their liberty and property without due process of law, and -abridged the privileges and. immunities of the appellees as citizens of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b667-8\">We claim also as part of this proposition, and in support of it, that'at the time of the passage of the act, it was one of the fundamental rights of the appellees as citizens to pursue their calling of manufacturing beer and to use their brewery for that purpose, and that the State could only restrain the exercise of this right by virtue of the police power; that that power could only be exercised to the,extent reasonable and necessary for the promotion of the object for which it \"was exercised,, viz., the preservation and promotion of the morals and the. health of the people of Kansas; that this act goes far beyond .what is so necessary and reasonable, and that in such excess it invades the rights of the appellees and deprives them of their property; that it destroys their property for the public use other than for police purposes; that it does this without compensation,; that such destruction, not demanded by any- legitimate exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the police power,' is depriving them of their property without due process of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-4\">At the outset, it should be borne in mind that-\u201c constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed.\u201d It is the duty of the courts to be watchful of constitutional rights, and \u201c against any stealthy encroachments thereon.\u201d <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States, </em>116 U.

On the contrary, the legislature of Massachusetts in June, 1789, passed <em>\u201c An act to encourage the manufacture and consumption of strong leer, ale, and oilier malt liquors.\u201d .</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b670-7\">There can be no doubt- that the absolute prohibition by statute of the use of the appellee\u2019s brewery, which was owned by-them before the enactment, does in the sense of the law actually deprive them of their property as completely as if the fee in nine-tenths of it were destroyed and blotted out of existence by the same enactment. The proofs show this, and it ,is.practically conceded by the brief on the part of\" the State. It destroys fifty-five thousand dollars out of their sixty thousand .of property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b670-8\">This can hardly be an open question in this court sipce its decision in the case of <em>Pumpelly </em>v. <em>Green Bay </em>Company, 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Wall. 166, 177, where the question of what amounts to.'\u201cdepriving a person of property \u201d was plumply decided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN-\">In that case, it was held that the flooding, of the plaintiff\u2019s lands by a dam erected by the/ defendant company, was in effect and in law, a <em>takvng </em>of his property. And though there may be a great difference between. \u201c taking property \u201d without; compensation, and \u201c depriving a person of his property without due process of law,\u201d in many points of view there .can be no doubt that \u201c taking a man\u2019s property \u201d is \u201c depriving him of it,\u201d and that the same language must have been used by the court and the same result reached if it had been applying the constitutional provision,against the latter wrong as it did use in applying that provision, against the former. See also <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U. S. 113, 141; <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Buffalo, </em>56 N. Y. 268; <em>Chenango Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>83 N.

The courts cannot be left to determine in each case whether \u2018the' implicated brewer or brewery is within the intent of the act, or make guilt or innocence depend upon an intent on which . the act does not itself make it dependent, viz., the intent to sell the beer within or without the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-8\">The case is not one where the part of the statute as to manufacture which is constitutional can operate independently' of that part which is unconstitutional. But a vital part of the prohibition of the act being unconstitutional, and 'the act itself affording no means of discriminating them from the rest,- the whole must fall together. See <em>Wynehamer </em>v. <em>People, </em>13 N. Y. (3 Kern.) 378.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-9\">III. But if the power and authority of the state legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>to prohibit the manufacture of beer, whether for sale outside of the State, or within it, shall be held' to be absolute' and -unlimited, then we submit, upon the doctrines maintained by the Court of Appeals of New York in the case of <em>Wynehamer </em>v. <em>People, supra, </em>and by the Circuit Judge below, that in its application to the appellees\u2019 brewery, owned, possessed and used by them when the act took effect, the statute of. Kansas violates the Fourteenth Amendment, because it deprives them of their property \u201c without due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b672-4\">Assuming the act to be an absolute prohibition of brewing, and upholding it as such at the moment of its passage, it did deprive the appellees of their property by destroying the only use for which it was designed, and of which it was capable, which was as complete a deprivation as if the fee itself had been forfeited to the State.' By the,, immediate operation of the statute, without any act committed by the appellees in violation of its provisions, the legal existence which the law and the Constitution designate as property is destroyed, and the private injury is as completely effected as if the thing itself were physically taken away.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b672-5\">When this law was passed, the brewery, and its use for the only purpose of which it was susceptible, was property in the most absolute and unqualified sense of the term, and as such as much entitled to the protection of the Constitution as lands, houses, or chattels of any description. The Constitution makes no discrimination between different kinds of property, and if protected by the Constitution from such legislation as we are now considering, it is protected because it is property innocently acquired under existing laws, and not upon any theory of its comparative utility.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuY\">If the good of the community requires the owner to be deprived of it for any purpose of public benefit, no matter what, common justice requires that compensation should be made for it, and any statute which does directly take it away from the owner for the uses of the public without compensation, deprives him of it without due process of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b672-7\">What Sir William Blackstone wrote a century ago is certainly as applicable now to property which exists under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>protection of this constitutional provision as it was then to property in England, which had no such, shield against legislative encroachment: \u201cSo great is the regard of the law for private property that it will not authorize the -least violation of it; no, <em>not 'even for the general good, of the whole community. </em>In vain may it be urged that the good of the individual ought to yield to that of the community, for it would be dangerous to allow any private man or even any public tribunal to be the Judge of this common good and to' decide whether it be expedient or not. Besides,'the public good is in nothing more essentially interested than in the pro; tection of every individual\u2019s private rights as modelled by the municipal law. The legislature alone can and frequently does interfere and compel the individual to acquiesce. But how does it interpose and compel ? <em>Not by absolutely stripping the . subject of his property in cm arbitrary manner, but by </em>giving. <em>him a full indemnity and eguimalent for the injury thereby sustcuvnedP </em>(1 Bl.

The defendant, having been found guilty, was fined, in each case, one hundred dollars, and ordered to be committed to the county jail until the fine was paid.

States.</p>\n<p id=\"A8QR\">Upon the petition and bond of the defendants the cause was removed into the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Kansas upon the ground that the suit was one arising under the Constitution of the United States. A motion to remand it to the state court was denied. The pleadings were recast so as to conform to the equity practice in the courts of the United States; and, the .cause having'been heard upon bill and answer,' the suit was dismissed. - From that decree the State prosecutes an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Ry. a statute of Kansas, approved March 3, 1868, it was made a misdemeanor, punishable by fine and\u2019imprisonment, for any one, directly or indirectly, to sell spirituous, vinous, fermented, or other intoxicating liquors, without having a dram-shop, tavern, or grocery license. It was also enacted, among other things, that every place where intoxicating liquors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>were sold in violation of the statute should be taken, held, and deemed to be a common nuisance'; and it was required that all rooms, taverns, eating-houses, bazaars, restaurants,, groceries, coffee-houses, cellars, or other places of public resort where intoxicating liquors were sold, in violation of law, should be abated as public nuisances. Gen.. Stat. Kansas, 1868, c. 35, \u00a76.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">But, in 1880, the people of Kansas adopted a more stringent policy. On the 2d of November of that year, they ratified an amendment to the state constitution, which declared that the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors should be forever prohibited in that State, except for medical, scientific, and mechanical purposes. .</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In order to give effect to that amendment, the legislature repealed the act of 1868, and passed an act, approved February 19, 1881, to take effect May 1, 1881, entitled \"An act to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, except for medical, scientific, and mechanical purposes, and to regulate the manufacture and sale thereof for such excepted purposes.\" Its first section provides \"that any person or persons who shall manufacture, sell, or barter any spirituous, malt, vinous, fermented, or other intoxicating liquors shall be guilty of a misdemeanor: <em>Provided, however, </em>That such liquors may be sold for medical, scientific, and mechanical purposes, as provided in this act.\" The second section makes it unlawful for any person to sell or barter for either of such excepted purposes any malt, vinous, spirituous, fermented, or other intoxicating liquors without having procured a druggist's permit therefor, and prescribes the conditions upon which such permit may be granted. The third section relates to the giving by physicians of prescriptions for intoxicating liquors to be used by their patients, and the fourth, to the sale of such liquors by druggists. The fifth section forbids any person from manufacturing or assisting in the manufacture of intoxicating liquors in the State, except for medical, scientific, and mechanical purposes, and makes provision for the granting of licenses to engage in the business of manufacturing liquors for such excepted purposes. The seventh section declares it to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>misdemeanor for any person, not having the required permit, to sell or barter, directly or indirectly, spirituous, malt, vinous, fermented, or other intoxicating liquors; the punishment prescribed being, for the first offence, a fine not less than one hundred nor more than five hundred dollars, or imprisonment in the county jail not less than twenty nor more than ninety days; for the second offence, a fine of not less than two hundred nor more than five hundred dollars, or imprisonment in the county jail not less than sixty days nor more than six months; and for every subsequent offence, a fine not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars, or imprisonment in the county jail not less than three months nor more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court. The eighth section provides for similar fines and punishments against persons who manufacture, or aid, assist, or abet the manufacture of any intoxicating liquors without having the required permit. The thirteenth section declares, among other things, all places where intoxicating liquors are manufactured, sold, bartered, or given away, or are kept for sale, barter, or use, in violation of the act, to be common nuisances; and provides that upon the judgment of any court having jurisdiction finding such place to be a nuisance, the proper officer shall be directed to shut up and abate the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Under that statute, the prosecutions against Mugler were instituted. It contains other- sections in addition to those above referred' to; but as they embody merely the details of the general scheme adopted by the State for the prohibition of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, except for the purposes specified, it is unnecessary to set them out.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">On the 7th of March, 1885, the legislature passed an act amendatory and supplementary to that of 1881. The thirteenth section of the former: act, being the one upon which' the suit against Ziebold &amp; Hagelin is\" founded, will. be -given in full in- a subsequent part of -this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The 'facts necessary to a clear understanding of the questions, common to these cases, are the following: Mugler and Ziebold &amp; Hagelin were engaged in manufacturing beer at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>their respective establishments, (constructed specially for that purpose,) for several years prior to the adoption of the constitutional amendment of 1880. They continued in such business in defiance of the statute of 1881, and without having the required permit. Nor did Mugler have a license or permit to sell beer. The single sale of which he was found guilty occurred in the State, and after May 1, 1881, that is, after the act of February 19, 1881, took effect, and was of beer manufactured before'lt's passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The buildings and machinery constituting these breweries are of little value if not used for the purpose of manufacturing beer; that is to say, if the statutes are enforced against the defendants the value of their property will be very materially diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The general question in each case is, whether the foregoing statutes of Kansas are in conflict with that clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that \u201c no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">That legislation by a State prohibiting the manufacture within her limits of intoxicating liquors, to be there sold or bartered for general use as a beverage, does not necessarily infringe any right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States, is made clear by the decisions of this court, rendered before and since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment; to some of which, in view of questions to be presently considered, it will be well to refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">In the <em>License Cases, </em>5 How. 504, the question was, whether certain statutes of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, relating to the sale of spirituous liquors were repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. In determining that question, it became necessary to inquire whether there was any conflict between the exercise by Congress of its power to regulate commerce with foreign countries, or among the several States, and the exercise by a State of what are called police powers. Although the members of the court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>not fully agree as to the grounds upon which the decision should be placed, they were unanimous in holding that the statutes then under examination were not inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States, or with any act of Congress. Chief Justice Taney said: \u201cIf any State deems the retail and internal traffic in ardent spirits injurious to its citizens, and calculated to produce idleness, vice, or debauchery, I see nothing in the Constitution of the United States to prevent it from regulating and restraining the traffic, or from prohibiting it altogether, if dt thinks proper.\u201d (p. 577.) Mr. Justice McLean, among other things, said: \u201cA State regulates its domestic commerce, contracts, the transmission of estates, real and personal, and acts upon all internal matters which relate to its moral and political welfare. Over these subjects the Federal government has no power. . . . The acknowledged police power of a State extends often to the destruction of property. A nuisance may be abated. Everything prejudicial to the health or morals of a city may be removed.\u201d (pp. 588, 589.) Mr. Justice Woodbury observed: \u201c How can they [the States] be sovereign within their respective spheres, without power to regulate all their internal commerce, as well as police, and direct how, when, and where it shall be conducted in articles intimately connected either with public morals, or public safety, or the public prosperity?\u201d (p. 628.) Mr. Justice Grier, in still more emphatic language, said: \u201c The true question presented by these cases, and one which I am not disposed to evade, is whether the States have a right to prohibit the' sale and consumption of an article of commerce which they believe to be pernicious in its effects, and the cause of disease, pauperism, and crime. . . . Without attempting to define what are the peculiar subjects or limits of this power, it may safely be affirmed, that every law for the restraint and punishment of crime, for the preservatidn of the public peace, health, and morals must come within this category. . . . It is not necessary, for the sake of justifying the state legislation now under consideration, to array the appalling statistics of misery, pauperism, and crime, which have their origin in the use or abuse of ardent spirits. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>police power, which is exclusively in the States, is alone competent to the correction of these great evils, and all measures of restraint or prohibition necessary to effect the purpose are within the'scope of that authority.\u201d (pp. 631, 632.)</p>\n<p id=\"A--\">In <em>Bartemeyer </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>18 Wall. 129, it was said that prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, state enactments, regulating or prohibiting the traffic in intoxicating liquors, raised no question under the Constitution of the United States; and that such legislation was left to the discretion of the respective States, subject to no other limitations than those imposed by their own constitutions, or by the general principles supposed to limit all legislative power. Referring to the contention that the right to sell intoxicating liquors was secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, the court said that \"so far as such a right exists, it is not one of the rights growing out of citizenship of the United States.\" In <em>Beer Co. </em>v. Massachusetts, 97 U.S. 25, 33, it was said, that, \"as a measure of police regulation, looking to the preservation of public morals, a state law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors is not repugnant to any clause of the Constitution of the United States.\" Finally, in <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>112 U.S. 201, 206, the court said that the question as to the constitutional power of a State to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors was no longer an open one in this court. These cases rest upon the acknowledged right of the States of the Union to control their purely internal affairs, and, in so doing, to protect the health, morals, and safety of their people by regulations that do not interfere with the execution of the powers of the general government, or violate rights secured by the Constitution of the United States. The power to establish such regulations, as was said in <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>9 Wheat. 1, 203, reaches everything within the territory of a State not surrendered to the national government.</p>\n<p id=\"AGz\">It is, however, contended, that, although the State may prohibit the manufacture of intoxicating liquors for sale or barter within her limits, for general use as a beverage, \u201c no convention or legislature has the right, under our form of govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>ment, to prohibit any citizen from manufacturing for his own use, or for export, or storage, any article of food or drink not endangering or affecting the rights of others.\u201d The argument made in support of the first branch of this proposition, briefly stated, is, that in the implied compact between the State and the citizen certain rights are reserved by the latter, which are guaranteed by the constitutional provision protecting persons against being deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, and with which the State cannot interfere ; that among those rights is that of manufacturing for one\u2019s use either food or drink; and that while, according to the doctrines of the Commune, the State may control the tastes, appetites, habits, dress, food, and drink of the people, our system of government, based upon the individuality and intelligence of the citizen, does not claim to control him, except as to his conduct to others, leaving him the sole judge as to all that only affects himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">It will be observed that the proposition, and the argument made in support of it, equally concede that the right to manufacture drink for one\u2019s personal use is subject to the condition that such manufacture does not endanger or affect the rights of others. If such manufacture does prejudicially affect the rights and interests of the community, it follows, from the very premises stated, that society has the power to protect itself, by legislation, against the injurious consequences of that business. As was said in <em>Munn </em>v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 124, while power does not exist with the whole people to control rights that are purely and exclusively private, government may require \u201c each citizen to so conduct himself, and so use his oaa\u00fci property, as not unnecessarily to injure another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">But by whom, or by what authority, is it to be determined whether the manufacture of particular articles of drink, either for general use or for the personal use of the maker, will injuriously affect the public? Power to determine such questions, so as to bind all, must exist somewhere; else society will be at the mercy of the few, who, regarding only their own appetites or passions, may be willing to imperil the peace and security of the many, provided only they are permitted to do as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>please. Under our system that power is lodged with the legislative branch of the government. It belongs to that department to exert what are known as the police powers of the State, and to determine, primarily, what measures are appropriate or needful for the protection of the public morals, the public health, or the public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">It does not at all follow that every statute enacted ostensibly for the promotion of these ends, is to be accepted as a legitimate exertion of the police powers of the State. There are, of necessity, limits beyond which legislation cannot rightfully go. While every possible presumption is to be indulged in favor of the validity of a statute, <em>Sinking Fund </em>Cases, 99 U.S. 700, 718, the courts must obey the Constitution rather than the law-making department of government, and must, upon their own responsibility, determine whether, in any particular case, these limits have been passed. <em>\"</em>To what purpose,\" it was said in <em>Marbury v. </em>Madison, 1 Cranch, 137, 176, \"are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing, if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained<em>? </em>The distinction between a government with limited and unlimited powers is abolished, if those limits do not confine the persons on whom they are imposed, and if acts prohibited and acts allowed are of equal obligation.\" The courts are not bound by mere forms, nor are they to be misled by mere pretences. They are at liberty \u2014 indeed, are under a solemn duty \u2014 to look at the substance of things, whenever they enter upon the inquiry whether the legislature has transcended the limits of its authority. If, therefore, a statute purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health, the public morals, or the public safety, has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is a palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law, it is the duty of the courts to so adjudge, and thereby give effect to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Keeping in view these principles, as governing the relations of the judicial and' legislative departments of government with each other, it is difficult to perceive any ground for the judiciary to declare that the prohibition by Kansas of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>manufacture or sale, within her limits, of intoxicating liquors for. general use there as a beverage, is not fairly adapted to the end of protecting the community against the evils which confessedly result from the excessive use of ardent spirits. There is no justification for holding that the State, under the guise merely of police regulations, is here aiming, to deprive the citizen of his constitutional rights; for we cannot shut out of view the fact, within the knowledge of all, that the public health, the public mor\u00e1is, and the public safety, may be endangered by the general use of intoxicating drinks; nor the fact, established by statistics accessible to every one, that the idleness, disorder, pauperism, and crime existing in the country are, in some degree at least, traceable to this evil. If, therefore, a state deems the absolute prohibition of the manufacture and sale, within, her limits, of intoxicating liquors for other than. medical, scientific, and manufacturing purposes, to be necessary to the peace and security of ^society, the courts cannot, without usurping legislative functions, override the will of the people as thus expressed by their chosen representatives. They have nothing to do with the mere policy of legislation. Indeed, it is a fundamental principle in our institutions, indispensable to the preservation of public liberty, that one of the separate departments of government shall not usurp powers committed by the Constitution to another department. And so, if, in the judgment of the legislature, the manufacture of intoxicating liquors for the maker\u2019s own u\u00e1e, as a beverage, would tend to cripple, if it did not defeat, the effort to guard the community against the evils attending the excessive use of such liquors, it is not for the courts, upon their views as to what is best and safest for the community, to disregard the legislative determination of that question. So far from such a regulation having no relation to the general end sought to be accomplished, the entire scheme of prohibition, as embodied in the constitution and laws of Kansas, might fail, if the right of each citizen to manufacture intoxicating liquors for his own use as a beverage were recognized. Such a right .does not inhere in citizenship. Nor^ can it be said that government interferes with or impairs-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>any one\u2019s constitutional rights. of liberty or of property, when it determines that the manufacture and sale of intoxicating drinks, for general or individual use, as a beverage, are, or may become, hurtful to society, and constitute, therefore, a business in which-no one may lawfully engage. Those rights are best secured, in our government, by the observance, upon the part of all, of such regulations as are established by competent authority to promote the common good. No one may rightfully do that which the law-making ppwer, upon reasonable grounds, declares to be prejudicial to the general welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">This conclusion is unavoidable, unless the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution takes from the States of the Union those powers of- police that were reserved at the time the original Constitution was adopted. But this court has declared, upon full consideration, in <em>Barbier </em>v. Connolly, 113 U. S. 27, 31, that the Fourteenth Amendment had no such effect. After -observing, among other things, that that Amendment forbade the arbitrary deprivation of life or liberty, and the arbitrary spoliation of property, and secured equal protection to all under like -circumstances, in respect as well to their personal and civil rights as to their acquisition and enjoyment of property, the court said: \u201c But neither the Amendment \u2014 broad and comprehensive as it is \u2014 nor any other amendment, was designed to interfere with the power of the State, sometimes termed its police power, to prescribe regulations to promote the health, peace, morals, education, and good order of the people, and to legislate so as to increase the industries of the State, develop its resources, and add to its wealth and prosperity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Undoubtedly the State, when providing, by legislation, for the protection of the public health, the public morals, or the public safety, is subject to the paramount authority of the Constitution of the United States, and may not violate rights secured or guaranteed by that instrument, or interfere with the execution of the powers confided to the general government. <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Mayor of New </em>York, 92 U.S. 259; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. Husen, 95 U.S. 465; <em>New Orleans Gas Co. v. Louisiana Light </em>Co., 115 U.S. 650; <em>Walling </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>116 U.S. 446; <em>Yick Wo </em>v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356; <em>Morgan's Steamship Co. </em>v. <em>Louisiana Board of Health, </em>118 U.S. 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Upon this ground \u2014 if we do not misapprehend the position of defendants \u2014 it is contended that, as the primary and principal use of beer is as a beverage; as their respective breweries were erected when it was lawful to engage in the manufacture of beer for every purpose; as such establishments will become of no value as property, or, at least, will be materially diminished in value, if not employed in the manufacture of beer for every purpose ; the prohibition upon their being so employed is, in effect, a taking of property for public use without compensation, and depriving the citizen of his property without due process of law. In other words, although the State, in the exercise of her police powers, may lawfully prohibit the manufacture and sale, within her limits, of intoxicating liquors to be used as a beverage, legislation having that object in view cannot be enforced against those who, at the time, happen to own property, the chief value of which consists in its fitness for such manufacturing purposes, unless compensation is first made for the diminution in the value of their property, resulting from such prohibitory enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">This interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment is inadmissible. It cannot be supposed that the States intended, by adopting that Amendment, to impose restraints upon the exercise of their powers for the protection of the safety, health, or morals of the community. In respect to contracts, the obligations of which are protected against hostile state legislation, this court in <em>Butchers' Union Co. </em>v. <em>Crescent City Co., </em>111 U.S. 746, 751, said that the State could not, by any contract, limit the exercise of her power to the prejudice of the public health and the public morals. So, in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>101 U.S. 814, 816, where the Constitution was invoked against the repeal by the State of a charter, granted to a private corporation, to conduct a lottery, and for which that corporation paid to the State a valuable consideration in money, the court said: \"No legislature can bargain away the public health or the public morals. The people themselves cannot do it, much less their servants... . Government is organized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>with a view to their preservation, and cannot divest itself of the power to provide for them.\" Again, in <em>New Orleans Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Louisiana Light Co., </em>115 U.S. 650, 672: \"The constitutional prohibition upon state laws impairing the obligation or contracts does not restrict the power of the State to protect the public health, the public morals, or the public safety, as the one or the other may be involved in the execution of such contracts. Rights and privileges arising from contracts with a State are subject to regulations for the protection of the public health, the public morals, and the public safety, in the same sense, and to the same extent, as are all contracts and all property, whether owned by natural persons or corporations.\"</p>\n<p id=\"AIqu\">The principle, that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, was embodied, in substance, in the constitutions of nearly all, if not all, of the States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment; and it has never been regarded as incompatible with the principle, equally vital, because essential to the peace and safety of society, that all property in this country is held under the implied obligation that the owner's use of it shall not be injurious to the community. <em>Beer Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>97 U.S. 25, 32; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alger, </em>7 Cush. 53. An illustration of this doctrine is afforded by <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>97 U.S. 501. The question there was as to the validity of a statute of Kentucky, enacted in 1874, imposing a penalty upon any one selling or offering for sale oils and fluids, the product of coal, petroleum, or other bituminous substances, which would burn or ignite at a temperature below 130\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Patterson having sold, within that commonwealth, a certain oil, for which letters-patent were issued in 1867, but which did not come up to the standard required by said statute, and having been indicted therefor, disputed the State's authority to prevent or obstruct the exercise of that right. This court upheld the legislation of Kentucky, upon the ground, that while the State could not impair the exclusive right of the patentee, or of his assignee, in the discovery described in the letters-patent, the tangible property, the fruit of the discovery, was not beyond control in the exercise of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>police powers. It was said: \"By the settled doctrines of this court the police power extends, at least, to the protection of the lives, the health, and the property of the community against the injurious exercise by any citizen of his own rights. State legislation, strictly and legitimately for police purposes, does not, in the sense of the Constitution, necessarily intrench upon any authority which has been confided, expressly or by implication, to the national government. The Kentucky statute under examination manifestly belongs to that class of legislation. It is, in the best sense, a mere police regulation, deemed essential to the protection of the lives and property of citizens.\" p. 504. Referring to the numerous decisions of this court guarding the power of Congress to regulate commerce against encroachment, under the guise of state regulations, established for the purpose and with the effect of destroying or impairing rights secured by the Constitution, it was further said: \"It has, nevertheless, with marked distinctness and uniformity, recognized the necessity, growing out of the fundamental conditions of civil society, of upholding state police regulations which were enacted in good faith, and had appropriate and direct connection with that protection to life, health, and property which each State owes to her citizens.\" See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dewitt, </em>9 Wall. 41; <em>License Tax Cases, </em>5 Wall. 462; <em>Pervear </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Wall. 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Another decision, very much in point upon this branch of the case, is <em>Fertilizing Co. </em>v. <em>Hyde Park, </em>97 U.S. 659, 667, also decided after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court there sustained the validity of an ordinance of the village of Hyde Park, in Cook County, Illinois, passed under legislative authority, forbidding any person from transporting through that village offal or other offensive or unwholesome matter, or from maintaining or carrying on an offensive or unwholesome business or establishment within its limits. The Fertilizing Company had, at large expense, and under authority expressly conferred by its charter, located its works at a particular point in the county. Besides, the charter of the village, at that time, provided that it should not interfere with parties engaged in transporting animal matter from Chicago, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>or from manufacturing it into a fertilizer or other chemical product. The enforcement of the ordinance in question operated to destroy the business of the company, and seriously to impair the value of its property. As, however, its business had become a nuisance to the community in which it was conducted, producing discomfort, and often sickness, among large masses of people, the court maintained the authority of the village, acting under legislative sanction, to protect the public health against such nuisance. It said: \"We cannot doubt that the police power of the State was applicable and adequate to give an effectual remedy. That power belonged to the States when the Federal Constitution was adopted. They did not surrender it, and they all have it now. It extends to the entire property and business within their local jurisdiction. Both are subject to it in all proper cases. It rests upon the fundamental principle that every one shall so use his own as not to wrong and injure another. To regulate and abate nuisances is one of its ordinary functions.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">It is supposed by the defendants that the doctrine for which they contend is sustained by <em>Pumpelly </em>v. <em>Green Bay Co., </em>13 Wall. 166. But in that view we do not concur. That was an action for the recovery of damages for the overflowing of the plaintiff's land by water, resulting from the construction of a dam across a river. The defence was that the dam constituted a part of the system adopted by the State for improving the navigation of Fox and Wisconsin rivers; and it was contended that as the damages of which the plaintiff complained were only the result of the improvement, under legislative sanction, of a navigable stream, he was not entitled to compensation from the State or its agents. The case, therefore, involved the question whether the overflowing of the plaintiff's land, to such an extent that it became practically unfit to be used, was a taking of property, within the meaning of the constitution of Wisconsin, providing that \"the property of no person shall be taken for public use without just compensation therefor.\" This court said it would be a very curious and unsatisfactory result, were it held that, \"if the government refrains from the absolute conversion of real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>property to the uses of the public, it can destroy its value entirely, can inflict irreparable and permanent injury to any extent, can, in effect, subject it to total destruction, without making any compensation, because, in the narrowest sense of that word, it is not <em>taken </em>for the public use. Such a construction would pervert the constitutional provision into a restriction upon the rights of the citizen, as those rights stood at the common law, instead of the government, and make it an authority for the invasion of private right under the pretext of the public good, which had no warrant in the laws or practices of our ancestors.\u201d pp. 177, 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">These principles have no application to the case under consideration. The question in <em>Pumpelly </em>v. <em>Green Bay Company </em>arose under the State's power of eminent domain; while the question now before us arises under what are, strictly, the police powers of the State, exerted for the protection of the health, morals, and safety of the people. That case, as this court said in <em>Transportation Co. </em>v. Chicago, 99 U.S. 635, 642, was an extreme qualification of the doctrine, universally held, that \"acts done in the proper exercise of governmental powers, and not directly encroaching upon private property, though these consequences may impair its use,\" do not constitute a taking within the meaning of the constitutional provision, or entitle the owner of such property to compensation from the State or its agents, or give him any right of action. It was a case in which there was a \"permanent flooding of private property,\" a \"physical invasion of the real estate of the private owner, and a practical ouster of his possession.\" His property was, in effect, required to be devoted to the use of the public, and, consequently, he was entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">As already stated, the .present case must be governed by principles that do not involve the power of eminent domain, in the exercise of which property may not be taken for public use without compensation. A prohibition simply upon the use of property for purposes that are declared, by valid legislation, to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety of the community, cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a taking, dr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>an appropriation of property for the public benefit. Such legislation does not disturb the owner in the control or use of his property for lawful purposes, nor restrict his right to dispose of it, but is only a declaration by the State that its use by any one, for certain forbidden purposes,- is prejudicial to the public interests. Nor can legislation \u2018of that character come within the Fourteenth Amendment, in any case, unless it is apparent that its real object is not to protect the community, or to, promote the general well-being, but, under the guise of police regulation, to deprive the owner of his liberty and property, without due process of law. The power which the States have of prohibiting such use by individuals of their property as will be prejudicial to the health, the morals, or the safety of th\u00e9 public, is not \u2014 -and, consistently with the existence and safety of organized society, cannot be \u2014 burdened with the condition that the State must compensate such individual' owners for pecuniary losses they may sustain, by reason of their not being permitted, by a noxious use of their property, to inflict injury upon the community. The exercise of the police power by the destruction of property which is itself a public nuisance, or the prohibition of its use in a particular way, Avhereby its value becomes depreciated, is very different from taking property for public use, or from depriving a person of his property without due process of law. In the one case, a nuisance only is abated; in the other, unoffending property is taken away from an innocent Owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">It is true, that, when the defendants in these cases purchased or erected their breweries, the laws of the State did not forbid the manufacture of intoxicating liquors. But the State did not thereby give any assurance, or come under an obligation, that its legislation upon that subject would remain unchanged. Indeed, as was said in <em>Stone </em>v. Mississippi, above cited, the supervision of the public health and the public morals is a governmental power, \"continuing in its nature,\" and \"to be dealt with as the special exigencies of the moment may re quire;\" and that, \"for this purpose, the largest legislative discretion is allowed, and the discretion cannot be parted with any more than the power itself.\" So in <em>Beer Co. </em>v. <em>Massachu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>setts, 97 U.S. 32: \"If the public safety or the public morals require the discontinuance of any manufacture or traffic, the hand of the legislature cannot be stayed from providing for its discontinuance by any incidental inconvenience which individuals or corporations may suffer.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">It now remains to consider certain questions relating particularly to the thirteenth section of the act of 1885. That section \u2014 which takes the place of \u00a7 13 of the act of 1881 \u2014 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">\"SEC. 13. All places where intoxicating liquors are manufactured, sold, bartered, or given away in violation of any of the provisions of this act, or where intoxicating liquors are kept for sale, barter, or delivery in violation of this act, are hereby declared to be common nuisances; and upon the judgment of any court having jurisdiction finding such place to be a nuisance under this section, the sheriff, his deputy, or under sheriff, or any constable of the proper county, or marshal of any city where the same is located, shall be directed to shut up and abate such place by taking possession thereof and destroying all intoxicating liquors found therein, together with all signs, screens, bars, bottles, glasses, and other property used in keeping and maintaining said nuisance; and the owner or keeper thereof shall, upon conviction, be adjudged guilty of maintaining a common nuisance, and shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, and by imprisonment in the county jail not less than thirty days nor more than ninety days. The attorney general, county attorney, or any citizen of the county where such nuisance exists, or is kept, or is maintained, may maintain an action in the name of the State to abate and perpetually enjoin the same. The injunction shall be granted at the commencement of the action, and no bond shall be required. Any person violating the terms of any injunction granted in such proceeding, shall be punished as for contempt, by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail not less than thirty days nor more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>It is contended by counsel in the case of <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Ziebold &amp; </em>Hagelin, that the entire scheme of this section is an attempt to deprive persons who come within its provisions of their property and of their liberty without due process of law; especially, when taken in connection with that clause of \u00a7 14 (amendatory of \u00a7 21 of the act of 1881) which provides that \"in prosecutions under this act, by indictment or otherwise, ... it shall not be necessary in the first instance for the State to prove that the party charged did not have a permit to sell intoxicating liquors for the excepted purposes.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">\"We are unable to perceive anything in these regulations inconsistent with the constitutional guarantees of liberty and property. The State having authority to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors for other than medical, scientific, and mechanical purposes, we do not doubt her power to declare that any place, kept and maintained for the illegal manufacture and sale of such liquors, shall be deemed a common nuisance, and be abated, and, at the same time, to provide for thte indictment and trial of the offender. One is a proceeding against the property used for forbidden purposes, while the other is for the punishment of the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">It is said that by the thirteenth section of the act of 1885, the legislature, finding a brewery within the State in actual operation, without notice, trial, or hearing, by the mere exercise of its arbitrary caprice, declares it to be a common nuisance, and then prescribes the consequences which are to follow inevitably by judicial mandate required by the statute, and involving and permitting the exercise of no judicial discretion or judgment ; that the brewery being found in operation, the court is not to <em>determine </em>whether it is a common nuisance, but, Under the command of the statute, is to <em>find it </em>to be one; that it is not the liquor made, or the making of it, which is thus enacted to be a common nuisance, but the place itself, including all the property used in keeping and maintaining the common nuisance; that the judge having thus signed without inquiry \u2014 and, it may be, contrary to the fact and against his own judgment \u2014 the edict of the legislature, the court is commanded to take possession by its officers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>place and shut it up; nor is all this destruction of property, by legislative edict, to be made as a forfeiture consequent upon conviction of any offence, but merely because the legislature so commands; and it is done by a <em>court of equity, </em>.without any previous conviction first had, or any trial known to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">This, certainly, is a formidable arraignment of the legislation of Kansas, and if it were founded upon a just interpretation of her statutes, the court would have no difficulty in declaring that they could not be enforced without infringing the constitutional rights of the citizen. But those statutes have no such scope and are attended with no such results as the defendants suppose. The court is not required to give. effect to a legislative <em>\u201c </em>decree \u201d or \u201c edict,\u201d unless every enactment by the law-making power of a State is to be so characterized. It is not declared that every establishment is to be deemed a common nuisance because it may have been maintained prior to the passage of the statute as a place for manufacturing intoxicating liquors. The statute is prospective in its operation, that is, it does not put the brand of a common nuisance upon any place, unless, after its passage, that place is kept and maintained for purposes declared by the legislature to be injurious to the community. Nor is the court required to adjudge any place to be a common nuisance simply because it is charged by the. State to be such. It must first find it to be of that character; that is, must ascertain, in some legal mode, whether since the statute was passed the place in question has been, or is being, so used, as to make it a common nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Equally untenable is the proposition that proceedings in equity for the purposes indicated in the thirteenth section of the statute are inconsistent with due process of law. \"In regard to public nuisances,\" Mr. Justice Story says, \"the jurisdiction of courts of equity seems to be of a very ancient date, and has been distinctly traced back to the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The jurisdiction is applicable not only to public nuisances, strictly so called, but also to purprestures upon public rights and property... . In case of public nuisances, properly so called, an indictment lies to abate them, and to punish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>offenders. But an information, also, lies in equity to redress the grievance by way of injunction.\" 2 Story's Eq. \u00a7\u00a7 921, 922. The ground of this jurisdiction in cases of purpresture, as well as of public nuisances, is the ability of courts of equity to give a more speedy, effectual, and permanent remedy, than can be had at law. They can not only prevent nuisances that are threatened, and before irreparable mischief ensues, but arrest or abate those in progress, and, by perpetual injunction, protect the public against them in the future; whereas courts of law can only reach existing nuisances, leaving future acts to be the subject of new prosecutions or proceedings. This is a salutary jurisdiction, especially where a nuisance affects the health, morals, or safety of the community. Though not frequently exercised, the power undoubtedly exists in courts of equity thus to protect the public against injury. <em>District Attorney </em>v. <em>Lynn and Boston Railroad Co., </em>16 Gray, 242, 245; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>New Jersey Railroad, </em>2 Green, Ch. 139; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Tudor Ice Co., </em>104 Mass. 239, 244; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>5 Porter (Ala.), 279, 294; <em>Hoole </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>22 Ala. 190, 194; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>1 Dev. Eq. 12; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>2 Myl. &amp; Cr. 123, 129, 133; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Great Northern Railway Co., </em>1 Drew. &amp; Sm. 154, 161; Eden on Injunctions, 259; Kerr on Injunctions (2d ed.), 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">As to the objection that the statute makes no provision for a jury trial in cases like this one, it is sufficient to say that such a mode of trial is not required in suits in equity brought to abate a public nuisance. The statutory direction that an injunction issue at the commencement of the action is not to be construed as dispensing with such preliminary proof as is necessary to authorize an injunction pending the suit. The court is not to issue an injunction simply because one is asked, or because-the charge is m\u00e1de that a common nuisance is maintained in violation of law. The statute leaves 'the court at liberty to give effect to the principle that an injunction will not be granted to restrain a nuisance, except upon clear and satisfactory evidence th\u00e1t one exists. Here the fact to be ascertained was, not whether a place, kept and maintained for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>purposes forbidden by the statute, was, <em>per se, </em>a nuisance\u2014 that fact being conclusively determined by the statute itself \u2014 but whether the\u2019place in question was so kept and maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">If the proof upon that point is not full or sufficient, the court can refuse an injunction, or postpone action until the State first obtains the verdict of a jury in her favor. In this case, it cannot be denied that the defendants kept and maintained a place that is within the statutory definition of a common nuisance. Their petition for the removal of the cause from the state court, and their answer to the bill, admitted every fact necessary to maintain this suit, if the statute, under which it was brought, was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Touching the provision that in prosecutions, by indictment or otherwise, the State need not, in the first instance, prove that the defendant has not the permit required by the statute, Ave may remark that, if it has any application to a proceeding like this, it does not deprive him of the presumption that he is innocent of any violation of laAV. . It is only a declaration that when the State has proven that the place described is kept and maintained for the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors \u2014 such manufacture or sale being unlaAvful except for specified purposes, and then only under a permit \u2014 the prosecution need not prove \u00e1 negative, namely, that the defendant has not th\u00e9 required license or permit. If the defendant has such license or permit, he can easily produce it, and thus overthroAv <em>the pruna facie </em>case established by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">A portion of the argument in behalf of .the defendants is to the effect that the statutes of Kansas forbid the manufacture of intoxicating liquors to be exported, or to be carried to other States, and, upon that ground, are repugnant to the clause of the Constitution of the United States, giving Congress power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States. We need only say, upon this point, that there is no intimation in the record that the beer which the resjrective defendants manufactured was intended to be carried out of the State or to foreign countries. And, without expressing an opinion as to whether such facts would have constituted a good defence, we observe that it will be time enough to decide a case of that character when it shall come before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number><em>For the reasons stated, we </em>are <em>of opinion that the judgments of the Supreme Court of Kansas have not denied to Mugler, the plaintiff in error, any right, privilege, or immunity secured to him by the Constitution of the United States, and its judgment, in each case, is, accordingly, affirmed. We are, also, of opinion that the Circuit Court of the United States erred in dismissing the bill of the State against Ziebold &amp; Hagelin. The decree in that case is reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to enter a decree granting to the State such relief as the act of March 7, 1885, authorizes.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b697-5\">Mr. Justice Field</author>\n<p id=\"AVID\">delivered the following separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">I dissent from the judgment in the last case, the one coming from the Circuit Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">I agree to so much of the opinion as asserts that there is nothing in the Constitution or laws of the United States affecting the validity of any act of Kansas prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors manufactured in the State, except under proper regulations for the protection of the health and morals of the people. But I am not prepared to say that the State can prohibit the manufacture of such liquors within its limits if they are intended for exportation, or forbid their sale within its limits, under like regulations, if Congress has authorized their importation, though the act of Kansas is broad enough to include both such manufacture and sale. The right to import an article of merchandise, recognized as such by the commercial world \u2014 whether the right be given by act of Congress or by treaty with a foreign country \u2014 would seem necessarily to carry the right to sell the article when imported. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>12 Wheat. <em>4A7, </em>Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the opinion of this court, said as follows: \u201cSale is the object of importation, and is an essential ingredient of that intercourse of which importation constitutes a part. It is as essential an ingredient, as indispensable to the existence of the entire thing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>then, as importation itself. It must be considered as a component part of the power to regulate commerce. Congress has a right, not only to authorize importation, but to authorize the importer <em>to sell.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">If one State can forbid the sale within its limits of an imported article, so may all the States, each selecting a different article. There would then be little uniformity of regulations with respect to articles of foreign commerce imported into different States, and the same may be also said of regulations with respect to articles of interstate commerce. And we know it was one of the objects of the formation of the Federal Constitution to secure uniformity of commercial regulations against discriminating state legislation. The construction of the commercial clause of the Constitution, upon which the License cases in the 7th of Howard were decided, appears to me to have been substantially abandoned in later decisions. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>De Cuir, </em>95 U.S. 485; <em>Welton </em>v. <em>State of </em>Missouri, 91 U.S. 275; <em>County of Mobile </em>v. Kimball, 102 U.S. 691; <em>Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Parkersburgh, </em>107 U.S. 691; <em>Gloucester Ferry Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>114 U.S. 196; <em>Wabash, St. Louis &amp; Pacific Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>118 U.S. 557. I make this reservation that I may not hereafter be deemed concluded by a general concurrence in the opinion of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">I do not agree to what is said with reference to the case from the United States Circuit Court. That was a suit in equity brought for the abatement of the brewery owned by the defendants. It is based upon clauses in the thirteenth section of the act of Kansas, which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">\u201cAll places where intoxicating liquors are manufactured, sold, bartered, or given away in violation of any of the provisions of this act, or where intoxicating liquors are kept for sale, barter, or delivery in violation of this act, <em>are hereby declared to be common nuisances; </em>and upon the judgment of any court having jurisdiction finding such place to be a nuisance under this section, the sheriff, his deputy, or' under sheriff; or any constable of the proper county, or marshal of. any city where the same is located, shall be directed to shut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>up and abate such, place by talcing possession thereof and destroying all intoxicating liquors found therein, together with all signs, screens, bars, bottles, glasses, and other property used in keeping and maintaining said nuisance; and the. owner or keeper thereof shall, upon conviction, be adjudged guilty of maintaining a common nuisance, and shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, and by imprisonment in the county jail not less than thirty days nor more than ninety days. The Attorney General, county attorney, or any citizen of the county where such nuisance exists, or is kept, or is maintained, may maintain an action- in the name of the State to abate and perpetually enjoin the same. The injunction shall be granted at the commencement of the action, and no bond shall be required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">By a previous section all malt, vinous, and fermented liquors \u00e1re classed as intoxicating liquors, and their manufacture, barter, and sale are equally prohibited. By the thirteenth section, as is well said by counsel, the legislature, without notice to the owner or hearing of any kind, declares every place where such liquors are sold, bartered, or given away, or kept for sale, barter, or delivery \u2014 in this case a brewery, where beer was manufactured and sold, which, up to, the passage of the act, was a lawful industry \u2014 to be a common nuisance; and then prescribes what shall follow, upon a court having jurisdiction finding one of such places to be what the legislature has already pronounced it. The court is not to determine whether the place is a common nuisance in fact, but is to find it to be so if it comes within the definition of the statute, and, having thus found it, the executive officers of the court are to be directed to shut up and abate the place by taking possession of it; and, \u00e1s though this were not sufficient security against the continuance of the business, they are to be required to destroy all the liquor found therein, and all other property used in keeping and maintaining the nuisance. It matters not whether they are of such a character as could be used in any other business, or be of value for any other purposes. No discretion is left in the judge or in the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>These clauses appear to me to deprive one who owns a brewery and manufactures beer for sale, like the defendants, of property without due process of law. The destruction to be ordered is not as a forfeiture upon conviction of any offence, but merely because the legislature has so commanded. Assuming, which is not conceded, that the legislature, in the exercise of that undefined power of the State, called its police power, may, without compensation to the owner, deprive him of the use of his brewery for the purposes for which it was constructed under the sanction of the law, and for which alone it is valuable, I cannot see upon what principle, after closing the brewery, and thus putting an end to its use in the future for manufacturing spirits, it can order the destruction of the liquor already manufactured, which it admits by its legislation may be valuable for some purposes, and allows to be sold for those purposes. Nor can I see how the protection of the health and morals of the people of the State can require the destruction of property like bottles, glasses, and other utensils, which may be used for many lawful purposes. It has heretofore been supposed to be an established principle, that where there is a power to abate a nuisance, the abatement must be limited by its necessity, and no wanton or unnecessary injury can be committed to the property or rights of individuals. Thus, if the nuisance consists in the use to which a building is put, the remedy is to stop such use, not to tear down or to demolish the building itself, or to destroy property found within it. <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>City of Buffalo, </em>56 N.Y. 268; <em>Chenango Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>83 N.Y. 178, 189. The decision of the court, as it seems to me, reverses this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">It is plain that great wrong will often be done to manufacturers of liquors, if legislation like that embodied in this thirteenth section can be upheld. The Supreme Court of Kansas admits that the legislature of the State, in destroying the values of such kinds of property, may have gone to the utmost verge of constitutional authority. In my opinion it has passed beyond that verge, and crossed the line which separates regulation from confiscation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
