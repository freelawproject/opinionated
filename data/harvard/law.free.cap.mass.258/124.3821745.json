L. c. 107, \u00a7 23, cl. 2, that an instrument to be negotiable \u201cMust contain an unconditional promise or order to pay a sum certain in money.\u201d In this particular the negotiable instruments act, first enacted in this Commonwealth by St. 1898, c. 533, did not change the requirement of the common law as here prevailing before its passage. Theretofore, it had been held that a promissory note meant \u201can unconditional promise to pay a definite sum.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>167 Mass. 74, 76. <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>6 Cush. 6. <em>Commonwealth Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Met. 21, 23. <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Rooke, </em>151 Mass. 115. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>15 Gray, 267. <em>Eastern Railroad </em>v. <em>Benedict, </em>15 Gray, 289, 292. <em>Knowlton </em>v. <em>Cooley, </em>102 Mass. 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The instrument in the case at bar is in substance and effect a conditional sale of \u201ccertain apparatus\u201d to which reference is made and title to which is to remain in the Campbell Electric Company until paid for in full. There is the further statement that \u201cThis note, [is] one of a series\u201d given to the Campbell Electric Company, \u201cas per contract for certain apparatus.\u201d These words in conjunction with the rest of the instrument import a reference to the contract and render the promise contingent upon its fulfilment. <em>American Exchange Bank </em>v. <em>Blanchard, 7 </em>Allen, 333. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>109 Mass. 36. The case at bar is distinguishable from <em>National Bank of Newbury </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>218 Mass. 30, and <em>Goodfellow </em>v. <em>Farnham, </em>236 Mass. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">While the common law prevailed, the question arose whether an instrument was a promissory note when phrased in these words: \u201cReceived of T. S. Sloan, this day, roan horse known as A. M. Brown horse for which I promise to pay T. S. Sloan or order eighty-five dollars one month from date, at the Leicester-, said horse to be and remain the entire and absolute property of the said Sloan until paid for in full by me.\u201d It was held that it was not a promissory-note. <em>Sloan </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>134 Mass. 245. We are unable to perceive any difference in legal substance between the instrument then before the court and the one here presented. Since the definition of a promissory note was the same when that decision was rendered as that of a negotiable instrument now established by statute, so far as these facts are concerned, it is impossible to make any sound distinction between that case and the one now at bar. We are not prepared to overrule the earlier decision, and regard it as binding. The negotiable instrument law affords no ground for reaching any different conclusion from that reached before it was enacted. See <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>McGinty, </em>212 Mass. 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">This conclusion is supported by <em>Worden Grocer Co. </em>v. <em>Blanding, </em>161 Mich. 254, 257, <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Vint, </em>73 Ore. 528, <em>South Bend Iron Works </em>v. <em>Paddock, </em>37 Kans. 510, <em>Fleming </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>Sherwood, </em>24 N. D. 144, 148,149, <em>Polk County State Bank </em>v. <em>Walters, </em>145 Minn. 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">In accordance with the terms of the report, the entry may be</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>Plaintiff has leave to amend its declaration.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
