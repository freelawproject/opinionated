The question of the intestate\u2019s due care was submitted under instructions to which no exceptions were taken; but on the issue of the defendant\u2019s negligence, the plaintiff asked for the following instructions: that the defendant \u201cwas bound to anticipate that pedestrians would approach from the sidewalk, and . . . was bound to keep a lookout toward the side as well as the front\u201d; that on all the evidence, \u201cin failing to observe or look to the sides of the road,\u201d the defendant was negligent; that it \u201c was the defendant\u2019s duty to keep a reasonably careful lookout for other travellers on the highway so that he might be able to avoid the collision,\u201d and that the intestate \u201cwas not bound to anticipate an automobile or other vehicle would run him down unless he should exercise special care, and he had a right to assume the due care toward him of other travellers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">The jury having returned a verdict for the defendant, it is contended that the refusal of these requests was error. But the judge was not required to rule in the terms requested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>and the instructions fully and accurately covered the requests in so far as applicable. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Cooley, </em>118 Mass. 524. <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>189 Mass. 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
