Hence the requests for rulings were inapplicable to the evidence. The portions of the charge to which exceptions were taken were adapted to the evidence. . Moreover this case was tried together with one arising out of the same facts against the driver of the truck, and a verdict was returned for the defendant in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\"><em>jExceptions </em>overruled,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
