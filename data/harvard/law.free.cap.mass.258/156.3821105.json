The terms of the invitation, the speed of the turn, the cause of the fall, were in controversy. Manifestly, the determination of the plaintiff\u2019s care and of the defendant\u2019s gross negligence were for the jury. The judge was right in refusing to direct a verdict for the defendant. The case is covered by the principles laid down in <em>Massaletti </em>v. <em>Fitzroy, </em>228 Mass. 487. It is distinguishable from decisions like <em>Marcienowski </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>252 Mass. 65, and <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>246 Mass. 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
