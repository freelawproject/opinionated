The insurer however contends that the finding was unwarranted because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>injury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. The question was one of fact and if there was any evidence to sustain the finding it must stand. <em>O\u2019Connor\u2019s Case, </em>244 Mass. 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">It could be found that on October <em>7, </em>the employee consulted Dr. Greenberg at the hospital \u201cabout his side.\u201d Dr. Greenberg, after an examination on October 8, advised an operation for hernia on the right side, and, the employee having been admitted as a patient, it was performed October 22. The medical evidence introduced by the insurer describing congenital hernia and physical conditions which may produce, or result in, hernia, was to be considered and weighed with the claimant\u2019s own testimony, the report of Dr. Briggs to the Industrial Accident Board, that \u201cAlthough there is no evidence that the hernia appeared as the result of a direct strain, it is consistent with the history of the case that the work which the man was doing was contributory to the hernia,\u201d and the evidence of Dr. Novack, an expert called by the claimant, that \u201calthough he can\u2019t point to any particular act at any particular time which caused the hernia, that in view of the fact that he was doing heavy work over a period of several months, that possibly at some time he did something which may have caused the hernia.\u201d It cannot therefore be held as matter of law, as the insurer urges, that no causal connection was shown between the claimant\u2019s work and the alleged injury. <em>Gaglione\u2019s Case, </em>241 Mass. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We are asked by the claimant to award costs under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14. But the facts in the record are not substantially different from other cases where costs have not been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
