The plaintiff offered in evidence certain slips of paper purporting to show the total amount of business done at the store during the period he was in the defendant\u2019s employ, the total expenses incurred, the total profit and the net profit of all business done. These papers, he testified, were copied by him from the original books of entry of the defendant, which he kept. The slips were excluded by the trial judge, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception. If they were not otherwise inadmissible, as they did not show the amount of business procured by the plaintiff they were rightly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The allegation of the declaration that the amount of business procured by the plaintiff resulted in a net profit of $1,492.58 was material, and had to be proved to entitle him to recover. The slips related only to the entire business and were therefore immaterial to the issue involved. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>allegation that the defendant promised to pay the plaintiff twenty-five per cent of the net profit of the business \u201csecured\u201d by him, cannot rightly be construed as a promise to pay him twenty-five per cent of the net profit of the entire business. If such had been the intention of the parties, they naturally would have so stipulated. The word \u201csecure\u201d is defined as meaning: to obtain; to give or to produce; to get possession or hold of; gain. The business \u201csecured\u201d by the plaintiff, as distinguished from the entire business of the defendant, means in this connection business procured or obtained by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s personal efforts and which resulted from services rendered by him as the efficient cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\">The plaintiff offered no evidence of the amount of business secured or procured by him, as distinguished from the entire business. If the circumstances were such as to enable the plaintiff to recover under proper proceedings, he cannot recover upon this declaration, which is upon a contract different from that shown by the evidence. It is manifest that there was a fatal variance between the allegations and the proof. As there was no evidence to support the material allegations of the declaration, the trial judge rightly allowed the motion for a directed verdict. <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Totman, </em>204 Mass. 8. <em>Pope &amp; Cottle Co. </em>v. <em>Wheelwright, </em>240 Mass. 221. <em>Mabee </em>v. <em>Hersum, </em>248 Mass. 188. The exception to the exclusion of evidence to show the entire business done at the store and the net profit thereof during the time or any part of the time the plaintiff was employed cannot rightly be sustained. The question as to the amount due the plaintiff at the end of his employment was inadmissible as it was based upon the theory that he was entitled to receive twenty-five per cent of the net profit of the-entire business.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
