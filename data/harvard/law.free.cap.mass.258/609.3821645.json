L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, as amended by St. 1925, c. 297, \u00a7 1. There was no evidence to support that part of the complaint which charged a second offence. The judge instructed the jury to disregard that part of the complaint and to consider the case as a charge of a first offence. The motion by the defendant.for a directed verdict in his favor was denied rightly. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>10 Gray, 11. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salah, </em>253 Mass. 549. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>254 Mass. 390, 392. G. L. c. 277, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 35. The instruction of the judge to disregard the part of the complaint charging a second offence must be presumed to have been followed by the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cody, </em>165 Mass. 133, 138. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>212 Mass. 191, 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">There was no error of law in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The main ground alleged was one which might have been raised at the trial on the merits. Moreover, the disposition of such a motion rests in sound judicial discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 24, 32, 33, and cases there collected.</p>\n<p id=\"AMb\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
