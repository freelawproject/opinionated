At the trial in the Fourth District Court of Berkshire there was evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s care and the negligence of Halterman. The defendant\u2019s business at the time of the accident, was that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u201cselling Studebaker automobiles and conducting a service station for Studebaker automobiles\u201d at North Adams, called the \u201cShaw Motor Sales Company.\u201d Halterman was the manager of this station. Frank Kelly desired to sell or exchange his Ford truck. He had visited the service station, \u201clooking over used cars there,\u201d and intended to buy a car of the Shaw Motor Sales Company if Halterman sold his (Kelly\u2019s) truck. \u201cI told him [Halterman] I would buy one if he would unload my Ford truck.\u201d Halterman \u201cwas doing it to show larger sales for his business.\u201d On Saturday, when the plaintiff\u2019s car was run into, Halterman came, during business hours, to Kelly\u2019s residence in Adams. Accompanying Halterman was a prospective purchaser of the Ford truck. The truck was examined, the price discussed, but no bargain was made. Shortly after Halterman and the prospective buyer left the Kelly house, the collision occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The defendant testified that Halterman had no authority to go to Adams to sell Kelly\u2019s truck, that the defendant was not in the business of selling used cars for other persons. \u201cIt was understood between Halterman and me that Halterman should not take in any used cars without my first fixing the allowance therefor\u201d; that he had not given authority to borrow Roberts\u2019s car for any purpose. There was evidence that on the day of the accident there were three or four cars of the defendant that Halterman could have used. At the time of the trial Halterman was not in the defendant\u2019s employment and he was not a witness. The trial judge found for the plaintiff. The Appellate Division of the Western District reversed the ruling of the trial judge and ordered judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Halterman was endeavoring to sell Kelly\u2019s truck in order that he might sell one of the defendant\u2019s automobiles to Kelly. The collision took place a short distance from the defendant\u2019s place of business. On this evidence and the inference which might reasonably be drawn from it, it could have been found that Halterman was at the time acting within the scope of his employment. He was to receive no commission for selling Kelly\u2019s truck; he was not at the time engaged in his own business. He was the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>manager at the service station. He was endeavoring to make a sale of the car for the purpose of selling one of the defendant\u2019s trucks to Kelly, and evidently was returning from the interview with Kelly to the defendant\u2019s place of business, during business hours, when he ran into the plaintiff\u2019s automobile. Halterman was engaged in the course of the defendant\u2019s business and was seeking to accomplish it. The trial judge could disregard such portions of the testimony as he refused to believe and could find that Halterman was at the time, acting within the field of his agency. <em>Conant </em>v. <em>Constantin, </em>247 Mass. 76, 79, 80. <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Dedham Water Co. </em>241 Mass. 217, 218. <em>D\u2019Addio </em>v. <em>Hinckley Rendering Co. </em>213 Mass. 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Halterman was driving Roberts\u2019s automobile, but this fact was not controlling. The means made use of by Halterman, though not intended or contemplated by the defendant, while he was acting for the defendant and within the range of his employment, did not prevent the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>224 Mass. 319, 321. <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Cross, 120 </em>Mass. 545. <em>Ramsden </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>104 Mass. 117. See <em>Zerngis </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons Co. </em>255 Mass. 603. <em>Wilton </em>v. <em>Middlesex Railroad, </em>107 Mass. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">In the opinion of a majority of the court there was evidence before the trial court that Halterman was acting as the defendant\u2019s agent within the authority given him. The Appellate Division was wrong in entering the order \u201cRulings reversed.\u201d An order should be entered dismissing the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
