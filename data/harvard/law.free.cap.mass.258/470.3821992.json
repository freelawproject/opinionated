L. c. 146, \u00a7 49, to have a license as a stationary engineer from this Commonwealth, but was not required by the laws of the United States to have a marine engineer\u2019s license. The evidence shows that the dredge was without motive power and could not move itself. It had been towed to its place, was afloat, and was either anchored or secured to the wharf by a line while the dock was being dredged. The employee was engaged on the engine by which the steam shovel for digging out the dock was operated. The employer had voluntarily accepted the provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation act by insuring under it and becoming a subscriber. It has been found that \u201cthere is full insurance coverage under the provisions of the statute.\u201d The employee has given no notice to retain his common law rights. The employer and employee have both elected, so far as permissible under the law as to exclusive admiralty jurisdiction, to be bound by the workmen\u2019s compensation act. G.. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 21, 22, 24, 26. That act is not compulsory but elective, both with respect to employers and employees. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The single question for decision is whether in these circumstances the case comes within the workmen\u2019s compensation act, or whether it is exclusively within admiralty jurisdiction. The principles by which this court must be guided were stated in <em>Gillard\u2019s Case, </em>244 Mass. 47, 51, 52, in these words: \u201cThe words of the workmen\u2019s compensation act, now G. L. c. 152, formerly St. 1911, c. 751, are broad enough in their scope to include maritime torts except and so far as jurisdiction of the General Court of Massachusetts in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>particular is excluded by the grant of power to the United States in \u2018all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.\u2019 U. S. Const., art. 3, \u00a7 2 ; art. 1, \u00a7 8. In several instances jurisdiction under the workmen\u2019s compensation act over an injury which might have been argued to be maritime in its nature was taken without the point being raised, discussed or thought of. <em>Gillen\u2019s Case, 215 </em>Mass. 96. <em>Brightman\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 17. <em>McManaman\u2019s Case, </em>224 Mass. 554. The only significant point in this connection is that by a verbal interpretation of our workmen\u2019s compensation act, apart from constitutional considerations, maritime torts are included. <em>Dorman\u2019s Case, </em>236 Mass. 583, 584. Although these words are broad enough, as mere matter of grammatical construction, to include strictly maritime torts exclusively within admiralty jurisdiction, yet it is familiar law (to quote the words of Chief Justice Knowlton) that \u2018a statute which would be unconstitutional as applied to a certain class of cases, and is constitutional as applied to another class, may be held to have been intended to apply only to the latter class, if this seems in harmony with the general purpose of the Legislature.\u2019 <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Electric Storage Battery Co. </em>188 Mass. 239, 241. <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Popkin, </em>237 Mass. 434, 440. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Standard Brewery, Inc. </em>251 U. S. 210, 220. The workmen\u2019s compensation act, therefore, must be and is interpreted as intended only to operate upon the classes of employment and injury within the jurisdiction of the General Court. On the other hand the words of the act and its chief aim render the conclusion irresistible that the General Court intended to make the act applicable to all classes of injuries therein described which are within its jurisdiction. \u2018The statute is as broad as the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth.\u2019 <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver General, </em>207 Mass. 368, 369. In none of the cases which have come before us since the decision of <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>244 U. S. 205, have we undertaken to delimit the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth under the workmen\u2019s compensation act further than to apply to specific cases the principles of that decision as we understood them. <em>Duart </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>231 Mass. 313; S. C. 236 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>225. <em>Sterling\u2019s Case, </em>233 Mass. 485. <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>235 Mass. 538, 544, 545. <em>Sterling </em>v. <em>Frederick Leyland &amp; Co. Ltd. </em>242 Mass. 8. The language of that act, in view of its beneficent purpose, ought not to be narrowed any further than jurisdictional bounds demand. So far as our own decisions are concerned, we are quite at liberty to extend the workmen\u2019s compensation act to any case to which it is applicable under adjudications of the Supreme Court of the United States, and it is our duty so to extend it in order to effectuate the intention of the Legislature.\u201d These principles have been followed in our subsequent cases. <em>Ahern\u2019s Case, </em>247 Mass. 512. <em>O\u2019Hara\u2019s Case, </em>248 Mass. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\">The only inquiry in these circumstances is whether under the controlling decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States the workmen\u2019s compensation act may govern, or whether it is excluded because of the supremacy and exclusiveness of admiralty jurisdiction. The most recent pronouncement of that court pertinent to these facts is <em>Millers\u2019 Indemnity Underwriters </em>v. <em>Braud, </em>270 U. S. 59. In that case one employed as a diver was injured while he had \u2018 \u2018 submerged himself from a floating barge anchored in the navigable Sabine River thirty-five feet from the bank, for the purpose of sawing off the timbers of an abandoned set of ways, once used for launching ships, which had become an obstruction to navigation.\u201d It was said: \u201cThis subject was much considered in <em>Grant Smith-Porter Co. </em>v. <em>Rohde, </em>257 U. S. 469, 477 \u2014 here on certificate \u2014 which arose out of injuries suffered by a carpenter while at work upon an uncompleted vessel lying in navigable waters within the State of Oregon. The words of the local statute applied to the employment and prescribed an exclusive remedy. We said the cause was controlled by the principle that, as to certain local matters regulation of which would work no material prejudice to the general maritime law, the rules of the latter may be modified or supplemented by state statutes. And we held that under the circumstances disclosed \u2018regulation of the rights, obligations and consequent liabilities of the parties, as between themselves, by a local rule would not necessarily work material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>maritime law, or interfere with the proper harmony or uniformity of that law in its international or interstate relations.\u2019 Stressing the point that the parties were clearly and consciously within the terms of the statute and did not in fact suppose they were contracting with reference to the general system of maritime law, we alluded to the circumstance, not otherwise of special importance, that each of them had contributed to the industrial accident fund. And answering the certified questions we affirmed that 'the general admiralty jurisdiction extends to a proceeding to recover damages resulting from a tort committed on a vessel in process of construction when lying on navigable waters within a State.\u2019 Also, that 'in the circumstances stated the exclusive features of the Oregon Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act would apply and abrogate the right to recover damages in an admiralty court which otherwise would exist.\u2019 In the cause now under consideration the record discloses facts sufficient to show a maritime tort to which the general admiralty jurisdiction would extend save for the provisions of the state Compensation Act; but the matter is of mere local concern and its regulation by the State will work no material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general maritime law. The Act prescribes the only remedy; its exclusive features abrogate the right to resort to the admiralty court which otherwise would exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\">We are unable to distinguish that decision from the case at bar. Following that decision and in accordance with the principles already declared in the <em>Gillard </em>case and the <em>O\u2019Hara </em>case, we are of opinion that the workmen\u2019s compensation act governs the case at bar. It is distinguishable from <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. </em>266 U. S. 171, and <em>Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. </em>v. <em>Dahl, </em>266 U. S. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
