Descents\u2014personal property distributed pursuant to the law of the domicile of the owner. Section 1 of chapter 39, relating to descents, so far as it attempts to change the common law rule whereby personal property follows the person of its owner, and is distributed pursuant to the law of his domicile, applies only to property \u201cin this State.\u201d Debts have no fixed situs, and hence are still governed by the common law. They must still accompany and remain with the owner. The possession of evidence of indebtedness of a non-resident for the purpose of safe keeping, at the time of his death, does not pass the title, and they are governed by the law of the owner\u2019s domicile on his death.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b25-11\" pgmap=\"25\">2. Same\u2014rule as to debts. At common law, for the purposes of administration, a simple contract debt is assets where the debtor resides. But after the payment of debts all personal property is distributed, according to the law of the country of the domicile of the intestate.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b25-12\" pgmap=\"25(37) 26(31)\">3. Same\u2014choses in action deposited with an agent. Where a nonresident dies owning choses in action in the form of notes and bonds, which are deposited with an agent in this State for safe keeping, and letters of administration are taken out in this State, after the payment of debts and costs the residue will be distributed according to the law of the domicile of such decedent.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-5\" pgmap=\"26\">4. Residence\u2014evidence to show residence and domicile. Where a resident of the State of Ohio married in this State, and shortly afterward moved to St. Louis, Mo., with his wife, rented property, boarded, and went into business for several years in aiding in the publication of a newspaper in which he had an interest, this will be sufficient to show a residence and domicile of both husband and wife, in the absence of evidence that such residence and employment were with a present intention of returning to a former residence after the lapse of some definite period of time.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-6\" pgmap=\"26\">5.

Samb^\u2014domicile of wife follows residence and domicile of husband. Where a woman having a residence and home in this State marries a man who had a domicile in another State, to which she moves, her residence, by the act of marriage, will be changed to that of her husband.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-8\" pgmap=\"26\">7.

There must be the fact and the intention. . (Story on Conflict of Laws, sec. 44.) From the fact's, as shown by the evidence, the first might be inferred, but, we think, not the latter. Those who assert the affirmative must prove it, and. therefore the burden is on those who claim that Dr. and Mrs. Cooper had their domicile in Missouri, to prove not only the residence, but also that such residence was had with the intention of making it their \u201ctrue, fixed, permanent home.\u201d Bell v.

Bunnells &amp; Burry, for the appellee Dunning.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b31-4\" pgmap=\"31\">Mr. Justice Scholfield</author> <p id=\"AO\" pgmap=\"31\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b31-5\" pgmap=\"31\">The Appellate Court held that the residence of Cordelia T. Cooper, which had theretofore been Bloomington, in this State, when she intermarried with Edward T. Cooper, was by that act changed to his residence, which was Cincinnati, Ohio, and that thenceforth his residence was, in legal contemplation, her residence; and that court found that Cordelia T. Cooper, and her husband, Edward T. Cooper, after their marriage, acquired and retained for several years, a residence in St. Louis, Missouri, which they afterwards abandoned, intending to ultimately become residents of either Bloomington or Salem, in this State, but that before they had determined which plaee, or had adopted any home at either, she died intestate, and that her domicile, at the time of her death, for the purpose of distribution of her estate, was therefore Missouri, and not Illinois ; and the court also further held, that, the property here in controversy, being choses in action, in the form of notes and bonds, and having been, shortly before the death of Mrs. Cooper, put in the hands of Capen, at Bloomington, in this State, temporarily, for safe keeping, where they remained at the time of her death, was not, in a legal sense, \u201cproperty in this State,\u201d\u2014that the property in such notes and bonds followed the person of Mrs. Cooper, and so her domicile, at the time of her death being in Missouri, it, in legal contemplation, was her \u201cproperty in Missouri.\u201d We concur in the correctness of these rulings.</p> <p id=\"b31-6\" pgmap=\"31(76) 32(158)\">The contention of counsel for appellant that when Mrs. Cooper abandoned Missouri with the intention of making Illinois,\u2014that being the domicile of her origin,\u2014her future home, Illinois instantly became the country of her domicile, can have no application, because, in the first place, the proof fails to show with certainty a fixed and unalterable intention to make Illinois presently her home. .The proof in that respect, even when construed most favorably for appellant, shows that the locality in Illinois was never fixed, and so long as that was left uncertain it is manifest the intention must be conjectural rather than certain and. positive. No time was ever fixed when residence should begin, and no act intended as an act of removal or in aid of removal to Illinois is proved. But waiving this, in the second place, after the marriage of Mrs. Cooper, and so long as-the relations between herself and her husband were not adverse, his domicile was her domicile, and changed with his throughout their married life. Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, (4th ed.) sec. 46, and note 1, on p. 58; Davis v. Davis, 30 Ill. 180; Kennedy v. Kennedy, 87 id. 250; Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 868. There is no pretense in argument, and no evidence in the record tending in any degree to prove that Mrs. Cooper\u2019s husband was ever domiciled in Illinois.</p> <p id=\"b32-5\" pgmap=\"32(210) 33(18)\">The further contention of counsel for appellant that the proof fails to show a domicile in St. Louis is clearly untenable, for it is proved that there was residence and permanent business employment there for several years, and this is not rebutted by evidence that such residence and employment was with a present intention of returning to a former residence, after the lapse of some definite period of time. The domicile in Missouri remained the domicile of the Coopers, not only until it was abandoned, but also until a new domicile was acquired by actual residence within another jurisdiction, coupled with the intention of making the last acquired residence a permanent home. (Hayes v. Hayes, 74 Ill. 316.) At common law, for the purposes of administration, a simple contract debt is assets where the debtor resides. Williams on Executors, (3d Am. ed.) 261, 262, *263; Tryman v. Halstead, 109 U. S. 654, and cases cited on p. 656. But, after the payment of debts, all personal property is distributed according to the law of the country of the domicile of the intestate. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. (8th ed.) 542, *431; 2 Williams on Executors, (3d Am. ed.) 1299, *1301; Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, sec. 380; Bonnell v. Holt, 89, Ill. 71; Russell v. Madden, 95 id. 485; Young v. Wittenmyre, 123 id. 303.</p> <p id=\"b33-5\" pgmap=\"33\">The still further contention of counsel for appellant that our statute changes the common law rule whereby personal estate follows the person of its owner, and is distributed pursuant to the law of his domicile at the time of his death, is sufficiently answered by the fact that the statute has, by its own terms, reference only to \u201cproperty in this State,\u201d (Rev. Stat. 1874, sec. 1, chap. 39,) and since the only property right which there can be in a debt is the mere right to receive payment of it, it is impossible that there can be anything of a tangible nature connected with such right which can occupy locality, and so the property right must accompany and remain with the person of the owner of the debt, and therefore it can not be in this State when the domicile of the owner is in another State. And it is accordingly said by Kent (vol. 2, 8th ed.) in his Commentaries, (p. 537, *429): \u201cDebts and personal contracts have no locality, debita sequunturpersonam debitoris.\u201d And Story in his Conflict of Laws, (4th ed. sec. 362,) also says: \u201cContracts respecting personal property and debts are now universally treated as having no situs or locality, and they follow the person of the owner in point of right, mobilia inherent ossibus domini,) although the remedy in them must be according to the law of the place where they are sought to be enforced.\u201d See, also, to like effect, Lawrence v. Kitteridge, 21 Conn. 581; Atwood v. Insurance Co. 14 id. 562; Speed v. Kelley, 59. Miss. 47; Moore v. Jordan, 36 Kan. 271. And so we ruled, on the question of the situs of debts for the purpose of taxation, in Goldgart v. The People, 106 Ill. 25, and The People v. Davis, 112 id. 272.</p> <p id=\"b33-7\" pgmap=\"33\">The possession of the evidences of the indebtedness in Bloomington by Capen invested him with no title, and so, of necessity, the title remained with Mrs. Cooper at her domicile at the time of her death'.</p> <p id=\"b33-8\" pgmap=\"33\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"Al\" pgmap=\"33\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
