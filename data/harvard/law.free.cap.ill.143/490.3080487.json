Contract\u2014performance, when dependent upon some prior act. It is a good defense to an action on a contract that the performance of the act required was dependent upon some other thing which the other party was to do and has failed to do; and if, before the one party has done anything, it is ascertained that the other party will not be able to do that which he has undertaken to do, this will be a sufficient reason why the first party shall do nothing.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b490-10\" pgmap=\"490\">2. Same\u2014mutual and concurrent undertakings. Where an agreement requires the acts of both parties to be done at the same time, one is not obliged to perform his part before the other; and the word \u201ctender,\u201d as applied to cases of mutual and concurrent promises, means readiness and willingness to perform provided the other party is ready and willing to perform.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b490-11\" pgmap=\"490(303) 491(23)\">3. Same\u2014construed. A written agreement was entered into between a bank, party of the first part, two lumber companies, parties of the second part, and W. &amp; B., parties of the third part, by which the party of the first part assigned its claim of $39,000 on an insolvent corporation, then in the hands of a receiver, to one of the parties of the second part for $11,700 paid down, upon the consideration and express conditions that the parties of the second and third parts, should proceed without delay, to purchase the property and assests of the insolvent corporation, and to form a new corporation with a paid-up capital not exceeding the actual cost, and to transfer to it the title to such property and assets, or cause the same to be done, and by which agreement the bank should be entitled to receive on the organization of such new company, upon tender to either the second or third parties of the said sum of $11,700 cash \u201con or before the first day of May, 1889,\u201d the fully paid capital stock of said company, to the extent and in the ratio that that sum should bear to the aggregate cost of such property and assets. It was provided in such agreement that should the parties of the second and third parts fail to acquire said property and assets, they were to pay to the first party the share of the dividends to which the claim assigned should be entitled : Held, that the words \u201con or before the first day of May, 1889,\u201d qualified the verb \u201creceive\u201d as well as the noun \u201ctender,\u201d so that the bank was not only to tender the money on or before that day, but was also to receive the stock on or before that day,\u2014in other words, it was intended that the tender of the money and the receipt of the stock should be concurrent acts.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b491-5\" pgmap=\"491\">4. In such case, where the parties of the second and third parts were, on May 1,1889, unable to deliver the stock, and had not taken any steps to organize the new corporation, the failure of the bank to tender the $11,700 on or before that day did not release the other parties from their liability under the contract.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b491-6\" pgmap=\"491\">5. Same\u2014failure of consideration. It also appeared in the case that the sale of the property and assets of the insolvent corporation could not take place before June 28, 1889, and that the bank was willing to waive the failure of the other parties to organize the new corporation as early as May 1, 1889, and to pay the $11,700 in exchange for stock, as late as June 28,1889; and it further appeared by a letter written July 1, 1889, that such other parties, on the assumption that the failure of the bank to make a formal tender before May 1, 1889, released them from their agreement to transfer stock, refused to deliver the same at any time : Held, that when such parties denied their liability to deliver the stock at any time, the consideration on which the assignment was made failed, and it was without consideration, and an action then arose in favor of the bank to recover the dividends upon its claim, which such other parties had collected from the receiver, as so much money had and received to its use.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b491-7\" pgmap=\"491\">6. But, independently of this liability under the common counts, such second and third parties receiving dividends on such claim became, by their express undertaking, liable to pay over to the bank such dividends, less the $11,700 in their hands. The words \u201cfail to acquire such property and assets,\u201d should be construed in connection with all the other phraseology of the agreement, and when so construed evidently mean a failure to acquire as the property of the proposed corporation, whose stock was to be delivered to the bank.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b491-8\" pgmap=\"491\">7. Practice\u2014judgment by Appellate Court, on reversal. Where a trial is had, by agreement, before the court without a jury, resulting in a judgment for the defendant, the Appellate Court may not only reverse, but may also render judgment for the plaintiff, if the law, as applied to the facts found by that court, necessitates such a judgment, and it can be ascertained from the facts so found what judgment ought to have been rendered by the court below.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-9\" pgmap=\"491\">.Appeal from the Appellate Court for the First District;\u2014 heard in that court on appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon.

B. Blacker. The declaration as originally filed consisted of the common counts only, including the counts for money lent and advanc\u00e9d by the plaintiff to the defendants, and for money paid, laid out and expended by the plaintiff for defendants, and for money had and received by the defendants to and for the use of the plaintiff, to which defendants pleaded the general issue. Afterwards, by leave of court, plaintiff filed two additional counts, in the first of which it is averred, that, on March 1, 1889, the Manistee Salt and Lumber Company, a Michigan corporation, owed plaintiff $39,000.00; that said corporation was insolvent on said day, and its property and effects had been placed in the hands of receivers, who were to wind up its affairs, and convert its assets into money for distribution among its creditors; that, on that day, the plaintiff and defendants entered into the written agreement hereinafter set forth; that plaintiff assigned its claim against said corporation to the defendant, the Manistee Lumber Co., as provided in said agreement; that defendants did not organize a corporation, or procure said assets to be conveyed to it, whereby plaintiff lost the opportunity of acquiring the stock therein, and the consideration of the transfer of its claim to the defendants failed, and it was entitled to receive the dividends due upon its said claim out of said assets; that the defendants, although said dividends amounting to the sum of, towit: $20,000,00, were paid to them by said receivers, did not pay the same or any part thereof to plaintiff. The second count alleges further, that defendants did not acquire all the assets of said corporation, but that a part thereof were sold to other parties, etc., and that defendants became liable to pay said dividends to plaintiff, etc. The plea of non-assumpsit was filed to the additional counts.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-4\" pgmap=\"493\">By agreement of parties a jury was waived, and the cause was submitted to the court for trial without a jury. The plaintiff submitted to the court four written propositions to be held as law, three of which were refused. The first of the propositions so refused is as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-5\" pgmap=\"493\">\u201cThe court holds as a proposition of law applicable to this case, that the purchase of the property and assets of the Manistee Salt and Lumber Company by the defendants, the formation by them of a new corporation capitalized at an amount not exceeding the cost of said property and assets, and the transfer to such new corporation of the title to said property and assets, were conditions precedent to any obligation on the part of the plaintiff to tender to either of the parties of the second or third parts the sum of $11,700 for the preservation of any of its rights under said contract. \u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-6\" pgmap=\"493\">The trial court decided the case against the plaintiff and rendered judgment in favor of the defendants.

The proper construction of the language of the contract is, that the Bank was to receive the stock at the same time, at which it should make its tender of $11,700.00. The words, \u201con or before the first day of May, 1889,\u201d qualify the verb, \u201creceive,\u201d as well as the noun, \u201ctender.\u201d The Bank was not only to tender the money .on or before the first day of May, 1889, but was also to receive the stock on or before that day. It was contemplated, that the tender of the money and the receipt of the stock should be concurrent acts. If the Bank was obliged to tender the money on or before May 1, 1889, whether the proposed corporation was then organized or not, an acceptance of the tender by the defendants would have placed the bank at their mercy, because they may not have chosen to organize the corporation, or to deliver the'stock, for an indefinite time in the future. Indeed, it is conceded 'that the corporation was not organized until after the beginning of this suit. It is not denied by appellants, that they were unable to deliver the stock on or before May 1, 1889, or at any time before February, 1890.</p> <p id=\"b502-5\" pgmap=\"502\">As the appellee knew that the appellants had not organized the corporation and could not deliver the stock on May 1, 1889, it was not obliged to make the tender on that day. \u201cIt is a good defence to an action on the contract, that the obligation to perform the act required, was dependent upon some other thing which the other party was to do, and has failed to do. And if before the one party has done anything, it is ascertained that the other party will not be able to do that which he has undertaken to do, this will be a sufficient reason why the first party should do nothing.\u201d (2 Pars, on Cont. 675). Where the agreement requires the acts of both parties to be done at the same time, one is not obliged to perform his part before the other. (Smith v. Lewis, 26 Conn. 109). The word, \u201ctender,\u201d as applied to the case of mutual and concurrent promises, means readiness and willingness to perform, provided the other party is ready and willing to perform. (Clark v. Weis, 87 Ill. 438.)</p> <p id=\"b502-6\" pgmap=\"502(19) 503(108)\">The correspondence shows, that the appellee was willing to waive the failure of the appellants to organize the corporation as early as May 1, 1889, and to pay the $11,700.00 in exchange for stock as late as June 28, 1889. But the letter written by the appellants on July 1, 1889, amounted to an absolute refusal to deliver the stock at any time. That letter takes the ground, that appellants were released from all liability because appellee did not tender the money on or before May 1, 1889, although appellants do not claim that they were then able to deliver stock, or had taken any steps to organize a corporation. We are unable to concur in the construction placed upon the contract by the appellants.</p> <p id=\"b503-5\" pgmap=\"503(258) 504(134)\">Appellee assigned its claim to the appellants, upon the express condition, that it was to have stock to the amount of $11,700.00 in the proposed corporation. When, therefore, appellants denied their liability to deliver the stock at any time, the condition failed and the assignment was without ^consideration. A right of action then arose in favor of appellee to recover the dividends upon its claim, which appellants had collected from the receivers, as so much money had and received to its use, less the $11,700.00 already paid. But independently of this right of action upon the common counts, the last clause of the contract provided, that appellants should pay over the dividends, if they should \u201cfail to acquire said property and assets.\u201d The words, \u201cfail to acquire said property and assets,\u201d construed in connection with all the other phraseology of the agreement, evidently mean a failure to \u2022acquire said property and assets as the property of the proposed corporation, whose stock was to be delivered to appellee. It cannot be said, that appellants would not be bound to pay \u2022over the dividends to appellee, if they had acquired the property and assets of the insolvent corporation for themselves and without transferring such property and assets to the proposed new corporation. The payment of the dividends is imposed as a penalty for the failure to do what would be of benefit to appellee, but the acquirement of the property and assets by the appellants could have been of no benefit to appellee, unless said property and assets were transferred to the new corporation as a basis for issuing the stock in question. We therefore think, that a right of action for the amount of the dividends accrued to the appellee under the contract because appellants failed to acquire said property and assets in the manner and for the purposes contemplated by the contract, namely, for the purpose of transferring such property and assets to the proposed corporation, and for the further purpose of issuing stock in such corporation to appellee. It appears from the facts found, that appellants did not acquire all the property of the insolvent corporation, and that they sold a part of the property, which they did acquire, for $190,-000.00 and failed to put it into the new corporation.</p> <p id=\"b504-5\" pgmap=\"504\">We do not wish to be understood as deciding upon the-validity or invalidity of the arrangement for a syndicate entered into by a national bank, and other corporations and individuals, as referred to in the agreement. As this question-is not discussed by counsel on either side, we have not con-sidered it.</p> <p id=\"b504-6\" pgmap=\"504\">The only question, which remains, is as to the power of the Appellate Court to enter a judgment for the plaintiff after reversing the judgment entered by the trial court for the defendants.</p> <p id=\"b504-7\" pgmap=\"504\">Where the trial has been by agreement before the court, without a jury, resulting in a judgment for the defendant, the Appellate court may not only reverse, but may also render judgment for the plaintiff, if the law, as applied to the facts found by that court necessitates such a judgment, and if it can-be ascertained from the facts so found what judgment ought, to have been rendered by the court below. (Prince v. Lamb, Breese, 378; Wilmans v. Bank of Illinois, 1 Gilm. 667; Commercial Ins. Co. v. Scammon, 123 Ill. 601; Commercial Union-Assurance Co. v. Scammon, 126 id. 355).</p> <p id=\"b504-8\" pgmap=\"504(24) 505(251)\">In the case at bar, the trial was before the court without a jury by agreement. The Appellate Court has made a full reci-; tation in its judgment of the facts found by it. Among the facts so found are the following: 1. that the appellee did not make a tender of the money on or before May 1, 1889 ; 2. that the appellants had not acquired the property and assets of the insolvent corporation, nor had they organized the proposed new corporation, nor were they prepared to deliver the stock, on or before May 1, 1889; 3. that, on duly 1, 1889, appellants wrote a letter to appellee declining to have any further business with it, or, in other words, to deliver the stock to it, upon the sole ground that it had not made a tender of the money on or before May 1, 1889; 4. that neither on July 1, 1889, nor at any time before the beginning of this suit, had appellants organized the proposed corporation. An application of the law to the facts thus found, leads to the conclusion, that the appellee was entitled to rescind the assignment of its claim, and to recover the dividends thereon, theretofore collected by the appellants. From the facts found, a judgment for the plaintiff follows as a necessary consequence, in view of the construction already given to the contract. The result could not have been different, if the cause had been remanded to the trial court. The amount of the judgment could be readily ascertained by deducting the sum paid from the amount of the dividends already received.</p> <p id=\"b505-5\" pgmap=\"505\">The present ease manifestly belongs to that class of cases, where the Appellate Court is authorized not only to reverse the trial court, but also itself to render judgment. (Ins Co. v. Scammon, supra).</p> <p id=\"b505-6\" pgmap=\"505\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b505-7\" pgmap=\"505\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
