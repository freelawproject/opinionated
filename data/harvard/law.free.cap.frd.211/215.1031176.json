Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b266-20\">On June 18, 2002, Christopher Earl Strunk appearing <em>pro se </em>submitted a \u201cNotice of Motion as Intervenor\u201d in <em>Rodriguez v. Pataki, </em>02 Civ. 618, and <em>Allen v. Pataki, </em>02 Civ. 3843.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 25, 2002, the Attorney General of the State of New York opposed Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Strunk\u2019s intervention on the grounds, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was not \u201caccompanied by a pleading\u201d as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(c). At a hearing on June 28, 2002, the Court advised Mr. Strunk to submit a short and plain statement of a claim showing that he was entitled to relief. Transcript of Hearing, June 28, 2002 at 6 (\u201cSo all we are saying is, give us, instead of volumes, a short and plain statement of the claim showing that you are entitled to relief.\u201d) On July 2, 2002, Mr. Strunk submitted a \u201cVerified Supplement to the Complaint,\u201d which the Court has deemed an amended Motion to Intervene (\u201cAmended Motion\u201d). <em>See Rodriguez v. Pataki </em>02 Civ. 618 (S.D.N.Y. July 26, 2002) (Order). <em>See also </em>Transcript of Hearing, July 25, 2002 at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Mr. Strunk\u2019s Amended Motion is opposed by, among other parties, the Attorney General who argues that the proposed claims \u201chave nothing to do with the constitutional and Voting Right Act challenges to [the] 2002 Congressional and legislative redistricting raised in this action.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Attorney General\u2019s Memorandum of Law, dated August 5, 2002 (\u201cAG Mem.\u201d) at 2. The Attorney General also argues that Mr. Strunk\u2019s proposed complaint \u201cfails to state a federal constitutional claim.\u201d AG Mem. at 8. On August 12, 2002, Mr. Strunk filed an \u201cAffidavit in Reply\u201d to the Attorney General\u2019s opposition. (\u201cStrunk Aff.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Because Mr. Strunk is appearing <em>pro se, </em>the Court will \u201cread his supporting papers liberally, and will interpret them to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.\u201d <em>Burgos v. Hopkins, </em>14 F.3d 787, 790 (2d Cir.1994). \u201cStill, this standard is not without limits, and all normal rules of pleading are not absolutely suspended.\u201d <em>Stinson v. Sheriffs Dep\u2019t of Sullivan Cty., </em>499 F.Supp. 259, 262 (S.D.N.Y.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">In considering a motion for intervention, the Court must balance two competing objectives: \u201cefficiently administering legal disputes by resolving all related issues in one lawsuit, on the one hand, and keeping a single lawsuit from becoming unnecessarily complex, unwieldy or prolonged, on the other hand.\u201d <em>United States v. Pitney Bowes, Inc., </em>25 F.3d 66, 69 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">The <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Allen </em>cases, which were consolidated on May 20, 2002, involve challenges to the Congressional and State Senate redistricting plans adopted by the New York State Legislature in 2002. <em>See, e.g., </em>Amended Complaint, filed Apr. 25, 2002 <em>(Rodriguez). </em>Mr. Strunk\u2019s claims are different.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They appear premised upon: \u201c(1) the idea that censused non-citizens are unconstitutionally included in the population base for Congressional and legislative redistricting; and (2) a claim that registered independents, i.e. voters not enrolled in any of New York\u2019s established political parties, are unconstitutionally discriminated against respecting in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>dependent party-building and ballot access.\u201d AG Mem. at 1-2. In short, this is not what the <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Allen </em>cases are about.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">A. Intervention as of Right</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u201cIn order to intervene as of right under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2), an applicant must (1) timely file an application, (2) show an interest in the action, (3) demonstrate that the interest may be impaired by the disposition of the action, and (4) show that the interest is not protected adequately by the parties to the action.\u201d <em>New York News, Inc. v. Kheel, </em>972 F.2d 482, 485 (2d Cir.1992).\u201cThe intervention application will be denied unless all four requirements are met.\u201d <em>Pitney Bowes, </em>25 F.3d at 70. The Attorney General\u2019s opposition focuses on factors 2 and 3, arguing that the pending actions fail to \u201cimplicate any interest identified by Mr. Strunk such that the \u2018disposition ... may as a practical matter impair or impede\u2019 his \u2018ability to protect that interest.\u2019 Fed.R.Civ. P. 24(a).\u201d AG Mem. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In order to claim \u201ca judicially cognizable \u2018injury in fact\u2019 an intervenor must have a direct stake in the outcome of a litigation rather than a mere interest in the problem.\u201d <em>Schulz v. Williams, </em>44 F.3d 48, 52 (2d Cir.1994) (quotes and citations omitted); <em>see also Brennan v. New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>260 F.3d 123, 128 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201c[F]or an interest to be cognizable under Rule 24(a)(2), it must be \u2018direct, substantial, and legally protectable.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted). The <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Allen </em>plaintiffs have challenged New York Congressional and State Senate redistricting based upon the 2000 census. Mr. Strunk does not have a \u201cstake\u201d in these claims. Mr. Strunk\u2019s challenge arises from an entirely different (even if difficult to discern) legal theory which embraces alleged violations of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 and the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Mr. Strunk may have a global interest in election issues, he has alleged little or no interest in the Constitutional and Voting Rights Act claims raised in this case. <em>See, e.g., </em>Strunk Aff. at 19 (\u201cI have General Election problems with the redistricting burdens <em>unlike </em>many of the Plaintiffs.\u201d) (emphasis added). Mr. Strunk acknowledges that the plaintiffs in <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Allen </em>do not raise the same issues he does. Indeed, he asserts that they have been \u201cmis-advised by their counsel\u201d and that if he \u201cwere any of the other Plaintiffs or Intervenors I would request that the Court mandate the Defendants to remedy the failure caused by using only registered voters regardless of being a citizen or non-citizens [sic].\u201d Strunk Aff. at 19. <em>See also United States v. City of New York, </em>198 F.3d 360, 365 (2d Cir.1999) (\u201cAppellants\u2019 interests ... are only collaterally related to the subject matter of this enforcement action.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Mr. Strunk also fails to identify any interest of his that might be impaired by the disposition of this action. Since the issues do not coincide, whatever the outcome of this litigation, Mr. Strunk is free to bring an independent action. As noted, Mr. Strunk is already party to a number of other election cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See New York, </em>198 F.3d at 366 (\u201c[A]ppellants may still bring an independent action .... In fact, appellants recently have filed such a lawsuit.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">B. Permissive Intervention</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[u]pon timely application, anyone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>may be permitted to intervene in an action ... when an applicant\u2019s claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.\u201d \u201cThe principal consideration set forth in the Rule is whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\u201d <em>Sackmcm v. Liggett Grp., Inc., </em>167 F.R.D. 6, 20 (E.D.N.Y.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Mr. Strunk has presented a unique set of claims that are unrelated to the claims and relief sought by the plaintiffs in <em>Allen </em>and <em>Rodriguez. </em>Mr. Strunk\u2019s claims do not have \u201ca question of law or fact\u201d in common with the underlying claims presented here. <em>See, e.g., Frederick Music Co. v. Sickler, </em>124 F.R.D. 553, 555 (S.D.N.Y.1989) (\u201cReading petitioner\u2019s papers as broadly as possible, the Court cannot find any questions of law or fact that petitioner might have in common with the parties.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">It is also clear that intervention would cause undue distraction, delay and prejudice to the parties and to the Court in the adjudication of the <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Allen </em>cases. <em>See, e.g., Washington Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., </em>922 F.2d 92, 98 (2d Cir.1990) (upholding denial of permissive intervention where \u201cthe district court found that permissive intervention would unduly complicate and further delay the litigation.\u201d) For example, by letter dated October 11, 2002, Mr. Strunk has sought individualized injunctive relief in the form of \u201cpermission to collect signatures outside of the legal window allowed by New York State election law or at the discretion of the Court be placed on the ballot\u201d presumably because the \u201cessential person\u201d helping him collect signatures had fallen ill. In the same application, Mr. Strunk has asked the Court to consider claims he is pursuing in a state court action because he \u201chold[s] no expectation of a fair judicial decision there before the General Election.\u201d We agree with the Attorney General that Mr. Strunk, \u201cshould not be permitted to burden this complex litigation----\u201d AG Mem. at 2. Mr. Strunk\u2019s intervention would only serve to \u201cunduly delay the expedient disposition of this case.\u201d <em>Frederick, </em>124 F.R.D. at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Strunk\u2019s \u25a0motion for intervention is denied. Because the Court is dismissing the motion to intervene, Mr. Strunk\u2019s letter request for injunc-tive relief is denied, without prejudice, as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-13\">. Mr. Strunk's filing is one of several proceedings he has initiated which address election related issues. <em>See Strunk v. U.S. House of Reps., </em>99 Civ. 2168(NG), Slip Op. (E.D.N.Y. June 10, 2002) (dismissed); <em>Van Allen v. Democratic State Cmtee of New York, </em>Index No. 5888-02 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.) (pending); <em>Fitzgerald v. Berman, </em>N.D.N.Y. 02 Civ. 0926(NAM) (pending).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\">. The Senate Majority Leader, Joseph L. Bruno joins the Attorney General in this opposition. <em>See </em>AG Mem. at 2 n.l. In addition, the Speaker of the New York State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, and the <em>Rodriguez </em>Plaintiffs opposed Mr. Strunk\u2019s intervention. <em>See </em>Affidavit of C. Daniel Chill, dated June 25, 2002 (With regard to the motion to intervene of Christopher Earl Strunk, Speaker Silver opposes that intervention and joins in the opposition of the Attorney General. .Declaration of Richard D. Emery, dated June 25, 2002 (\u201cI agree with defendants who have urged that Mr. Strunk be denied the right to intervene because the arguments he wishes to malte have nothing to do with this lawsuit and will only distract the Court\u2019s attention from the issues raised in this case.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b267-9\">.
