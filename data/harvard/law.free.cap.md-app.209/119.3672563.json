On October 18, 2010, the Board held a hearing on the application. Dakrish, LLC t/a Vineyards Elite (\u201cVineyards Elite\u201d), appellant, appeared at the hearing through one of its licensees in opposition to Mr. Raich\u2019s petition. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">On November 16, 2010, Mr. Raich petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Following a hearing, the circuit court reversed the Board\u2019s decision, finding that \u201cthe Board\u2019s decision was flawed because it failed to balance appropriate factors to be considered by the Board pursuant to Maryland Code (2011 RepLVol.) Art. 2B, \u00a7 10-202(a)(2)(i), and gave undue weight to the potential for impact on existing licensees.\u201d The court remanded the case to the Board with instructions to issue a liquor license to Mr. Raich.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">On appeal to this Court, Vineyards Elite presents the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-13\">1. Was the Board\u2019s decision to deny the Application supported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>2. Did the Board commit an error of law by considering evidence of the potential impact of the Application on other licensees\u2019 businesses in the area?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand to that court with instructions to affirm the Board\u2019s decision denying Mr. Raich\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">STATUTORY AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">For purposes of context, before setting forth the testimony and evidence adduced at the hearing before the Board, we quote the relevant statutory provision relating to the issuance of a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\u00a7 10-202.

Mr. Raich testified that, in February 2010, he had been approved, with respect to a different license application, \u201cas to his fitness and character,\u201d but the license ultimately was denied. The Board acknowledged that Mr. Raich had been qualified before, that there was not \u201cany question\u201d that Mr. Raich was a \u201cfit and proper person,\u201d and that the \u201conly real issue here is whether the public need and accommodation aspects of the requirements for a new license will be met.\u201d The Board noted that, \u201cby population count, a license is available, so the only question is the public need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">Mr. Raich had worked as the manager at DiWine &amp; Spirits (\u201cDiWine\u201d) for three and a half years. He had reviewed stores in the area and decided to draft a business plan to open an organic and local wine store. He stated that none of the organic and local regional wine products that he would sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>would be in competition with any other wine or liquor store in the area. According to Mr. Raich, Vineyards Elite\u2019s store carries approximately 750 wines, with approximately fifteen local wines. Mr. Raich opined that none of the product that he wanted to carry would affect Vineyards Elite\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">During the time that Mr. Raich worked at DiWine, sales had been \u201cpretty steady.\u201d Business was good and sales had gone up in the last year, which was one of the reasons he decided to open another shop. Mr. Raich testified that Di-Wine focuses on high-end wine and \u201cgenerates a lot of business outside the Pikesville area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Mr. Raich\u2019s concept for his store, to carry organic and local wines, fit with the concept of Trader Joe\u2019s, a nearby store that carries \u201ca lot of organic product, inexpensive, and that\u2019s the target for the people that come in.\u201d Trader Joe\u2019s \u201corganic model\u201d was the same model that he would use for his store.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The size of his proposed store would be approximately 2,400 feet, and the hours of operation would be 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. The store would have approximately six employees. There had been a previous liquor license at the same location, inside a grocery store.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Mr. Raich testified that his concept had garnered a lot of support. He stated: \u201cPeople love the idea for organic and local regional wine. They [are] really supporting me.\u201d He had collected more than 1,300 signatures from people who shop in the location of the proposed store, and most of the people were happy that another store was going to come to the area, and \u201cthey liked the idea of local wine and organic.\u201d At the hearing, approximately 60-70 people were in attendance to support Mr. Raich\u2019s proposal. The Board observed that \u201cthere are more people here as proponents than opponents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">On cross-examination, Mr. Raich testified that the license for which he had applied, and was denied, in February of 2010, was for a location approximately three miles from the Reisterstown Road location. He agreed that, after that license was denied, he applied for a transfer of the DiWine license to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the Reisterstown Road location. He then applied again for a new license in June of 2010 for the Reisterstown Road location, prior to the application at issue here. Thus, the application for the Reisterstown Road location before the Board was the fourth license for which Mr. Raich had applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Upon questioning by the Board, Mr. Raich agreed that, if his application for the Reisterstown Road location was granted, there would be two \u201cClass A\u201d license-holders \u201cwithin a baseball throw\u201d of each other. He stated, however, that his proposal was for a \u201c[cjompletely different concept\u201d than that of DiWine.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The Board asked Mr. Raich whether he had a business plan \u201cshowing the opportunity of being at this location in this economic environment.\u201d Mr. Raich responded that he had talked to two experts who thought there was \u201ca huge gap for demand in this area for wine, and definitely for organic wine.\u201d After Mr. Raich stated that he anticipated doing approximately two million dollars in business at the Reisterstown Road location, the Board asked whether he had suggested to the owner of DiWine that they establish a line of organic wines. Mr. Raich responded that DiWine was \u201cdoing very well on what they are doing,\u201d and DiWine was not \u201cgoing to change the concept of the store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Dr. Gerald Patnode testified on Mr. Raich\u2019s behalf as an expert in estimating the need and public accommodation offered by a new Class A license at the Reisterstown Road location. He testified that the proposed Reisterstown Road location \u201cis a very, very strong market,\u201d stating that, \u201clooking at the expenditures for beer, wine and liquor in this market area, within a one-mile radius ... there\u2019s excess demand over supply.\u201d Dr. Patnode opined that there was a \u201cmarket gap of 1.685 million dollars,\u201d and that the residents in the area were being served by only two immediate licenses. There had been another license in the area, Sutton Place Gourmet, \u201cfor years ... and the people in that area were used to having that license available, and now it\u2019s been gone for awhile,\u201d with Trader Joe\u2019s occupying that space. In Dr. Patnode\u2019s opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the \u201cmarket [is] underserved due to lack of licenses in the area.\u201d He believed that there is \u201ca need and accommodation in this district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Dr. Patnode acknowledged that, in February 2010, with regard to Mr. Raich\u2019s previous application, he had testified before the Board that there was no need for another license \u201cthree miles north\u201d of the proposed Reisterstown Road location. He stated, however, that, at that time, his concern was that \u201cthe market had not had an opportunity to absorb the impact of\u2019 new licenses in the area, and therefore, he \u201ccould not justify that there was, in fact, a public need and accommodation.\u201d He agreed that the population in the area had not changed since February 2010, but he stated that his change of position regarding a new license was not based on population, but rather, on \u201cexpenditures and absorption.\u201d He reiterated that the area was \u201cshowing an abundance of market demand,\u201d maintaining that, if \u201canybody was concerned about economic impact, it would be DiWine, and he\u2019s not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The Board expressed some concern regarding Dr. Patnode\u2019s position in February 2010, and his position at this hearing, stating: \u201cSo you\u2019re suggesting that, in the fullness of time, which in this case is to say six, seven months, you now feel diametrically opposed to the opinions you expressed back in February of 2010\u201d? Dr. Patnode responded: \u201cIf we were talking about the same location, I\u2019m not sure I would be diametrically opposed. This is a significant change of location in terms of where you\u2019re putting this.\u201d The Board responded that, nevertheless, the Reisterstown Road location is \u201cless than three miles south,\u201d from the location implicated in the previous application, \u201c[w]hich the Board saw fit to rule against.\u201d Dr. Patnode agreed that was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">According to Dr. Patnode\u2019s findings, there is \u201cat least eight million dollars worth of unfulfilled demand\u201d in the area, and Mr. Raich\u2019s estimation of \u201cmarket potential for himself of approximately two million dollars is not unrealistic.\u201d He opined that, if Mr. Raich \u201ccaptures that marketplace, he\u2019ll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>have a niche market that is built around the profile of those people that come to Trader Joe\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Brian Greene, a representative of the Festival at Woodholme Center, testified that the shopping center \u201cis sort of revamping the merchandising\u201d to \u201cbring a little bit of energy and excitement into the center.\u201d He believed Mr. Raich\u2019s concept was \u201ca good fit, he\u2019s offering something different and current, which kind of fits with the direction that we\u2019re heading in the center.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Krishna Patel, manager of Vineyards Elite, testified that Vineyards Elite is approximately one mile away from Mr. Raich\u2019s proposed Reisterstown Road location. When Vineyards Elite submitted an application for a liquor license, DiWine and DiWine\u2019s owner, Arian Jakob, opposed the application. Mr. Jakob\u2019s e-mail correspondence opposing that application was made part of the record. Ms. Patel testified that Vineyards Elite protested the addition of another liquor license because \u201cwe are struggling at this point, after two and a half years,\u201d and if another new store opened in the immediate area, Vineyards Elite\u2019s business might suffer. She stated that Vineyards Elite has thirty racks of wine, and although she has \u201cgood wine knowledge\u201d and loves organic and local wines, \u201cfrom all the local wines, only the sweet wines sell.\u201d Ms. Patel testified that all of the area liquor stores include local and organic wines in their inventory, but \u201cwe don\u2019t do that much business.\u201d If Vineyards Elite could make \u201ctwo million dollars from ... organic wines,\u201d it would do so. Ms. Patel testified that Mr. Raich\u2019s \u201cnumbers ... are not realistic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">On cross-examination, Ms. Patel agreed that Vineyards Elite is only about one hundred yards away from Dugan\u2019s, and Dugan\u2019s did not go out of business after Vineyards Elite opened. When asked how Mr. Raich\u2019s proposed specialization in organic and local wines would impact Vineyards Elite\u2019s bottom line, Ms. Patel responded: \u201cCan ... he ... guarantee hundred percent that volume of his business is eighty percent organic and local? Can he write it down? If he\u2019s so confident, what is his back-up plan? Suppose it doesn\u2019t work? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>What is his back-up plan? Can anybody stop him once he gets his license?\u201d Vineyards Elite had modified its business based on customer requests, and if more customers asked for organic wine, Vineyards Elite would carry more organic wine. The Board asked Ms. Patel whether the opening of Valley Village had affected Vineyards Elite\u2019s sales, to which she responded: \u201c[W]hen the new license came up, our growth has not been that much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Ken Bernstein testified in his capacity as representative of David S. Brown Enterprises, the managing agent for two nearby shopping centers, Valley Village and Woodholme Square. Mr. Bernstein opposed the issuance of a new license, stating that DiWine \u201cdoes a very good job and is an asset to our center,\u201d and if a new license was granted, his tenant, DiWine, may end up closing its business. The Board then asked Mr. Bernstein whether he was \u201caware of the fact that Mr. Jakob wrote a letter in favor of the granting of this license,\u201d to which Mr. Bernstein responded that he was. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">My discussions with Mr. Ja[k]ob ... when that liquor license was to be transferred across the street, we discussed as to why he was doing that, and he told me that his sales were down significantly, they were doing roughly twenty percent less business than they had done before, and that he didn\u2019t believe\u2014honestly, Mr. Ja[k]ob is an absentee owner and he\u2019s not there, and Mr. Raich runs the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">And he felt as though he\u2014the transfer of the license and doing it in the way he did it, he thought it was okay to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Dr. Ajoirban Basu was called as an expert witness and submitted a written report analyzing the need and desirability of a new liquor license based on the criteria the Board was required to consider under the statute. Dr. Basu opined that \u201cthere is no economic rationale for another liquor license to be granted at 1809 Reisterstown Road.\u201d Dr. Basu\u2019s testimony regarding his report was, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>[T]here does not seem to be any deficiency in consumption of alcohol, whether a one-mile radius, three-mile radius, or five-mile radius.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">In other words, the public already seems to be fully accommodated in terms of their alcohol purchases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">[I]f you look at total household expenditures ... 1.2 percent of household expenditures is for alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">[S]o we found no public need for the license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">There\u2019s some evidence that there might be some desire, and there\u2019s signatures both ways, but we did not find any evidence of need.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">With respect to the second criterion, there are already a lot of stores along Reisterstown Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">One of the criteria where it\u2019s a little bit more complicated, the third criterion is the potential commonality or uniqueness of the services and products offered by the applicant\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">... I won\u2019t get much into it, but, of course, it\u2019s a debatable point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">Criterion four .... [y]ou\u2019ve probably seen the literature ... that indicates even small increases in the presence of alcohol can have deleterious impact on the quality of the life in the community.... And, finally ... there is opportunity cost here. In other words, if you put another liquor store in the area, again, there are plenty along Reisterstown Road, and there\u2019s one just a throw\u2019s distance away that means that space will not be available for something else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">It should be noted ... that the population around the Festival ... is ... older, and there are a sea of services and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>products that could be made available to that class of people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">[T]he data say ... younger households consume more alcohol than older ones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Dr. Basu opined regarding \u201chow the addition of another package goods store would impact those in the immediate vicinity of the proposed applicant\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">All things being equal, I don\u2019t buy a shortage of supply. And ... that market share has to come from somewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">And if you have a finite sense of dollars, it has to come from somewhere. It\u2019s true, it could come from other items in the economy____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">But at the close of the day____it is more likely than not, to the success of this store gaining market share, they would gain market share at the expense of other stores.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">On cross-examination, Dr. Basu agreed that some of his demographic data was approximately eighteen years old. The Board noted that Dr. Basu\u2019s report indicated that \u201cthe license is not necessary for the accommodation of the public,\u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">[additional reasons for the license denial include^] No. 2. There is no evidence of deficient spending upon alcohol among the households living immediately proximate to the proposed additional license. Three. Any additional product differentiation can be accomplished at existing locations. Four. There are social risks associated with reaching a social tipping point in alcohol availability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">Dr. Basu agreed that he did not have any conclusive data to prove that \u201cif this stor[e] opens, any other store will close.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">In addition to the foregoing testimony, the Board had before it exhibits, documents, letters, and e-mails constituting the \u201crecord of proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board issued its opinion on the record. It stated, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>This is a very troubling case. There are a number of issues here that make one figuratively scratch one\u2019s head, and then ultimately play a part leading to the conclusion that the Board is going to come to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">One of the concerns the Board has ... is this substantial statement by Mr. Ja[k]ob.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">I don\u2019t think I have ever seen as overwhelming an endorsement for someone who\u2019s endorsing his employee to move literally across the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">[T]hat brings up the concern that if this man, Mr. Ja[k]ob, who certainly is a very good businessman, after all, his place is doing well financially, if he would submit such a letter, and yet not be here to answer what I think he would have had to assume would be questions the Board would have, or inquiries from counsel, it\u2019s a troubling situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">It\u2019s not dispositive. We can\u2019t take anymore from him than what\u2019s in the record....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">This is a situation in which the Board ... has to take and inculcate and understand and masticate all the facts in coming to a conclusion that we are charged with the responsibility to make.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The Board then discussed the testimony of Dr. Patnode, \u201cwho was here nine months ago ... arguing against the issuance of another license, and today, having changed his mind.\u201d In assessing his testimony, the Board stated that it could not \u201cdiscern any real substantive and compelling reasons why he changed his mind, other than the obvious one, which is to say that he becomes an advocate in this case for the proponents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">With respect to the testimony of Dr. Basu, the Board stated that he \u201cis obviously a man of great renown within the business community and one who\u2019s constantly being quoted on his opinions sought by various sundry governmental, quasi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>governmental, and non-governmental agencies.\u201d It discussed Dr. Basu\u2019s testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">He tells us, the first thing he tells us, is that the chart he gives us, I must say, is undercut by the virtue of the fact it\u2019s almost twenty years old, which reasons he utilizes in the report. However, he then goes to his Exhibit 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">I would refer to page one of his exhibit where he talks about select consumer expenditure surrounding 1809 Reisterstown Road, in which he concludes ... from page five ...

This is so, he argues, because \u201cthe only harm it claimed it might suffer as a result of the issuance of a license to [Mr. Raich] was a possible competitive injury,\u201d and \u201csuch a competitive injury does not make it an \u2018aggrieved\u2019 party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">In support of this argument, Mr. Raich directs us to Art. 2B, \u00a7 16-101, which is entitled, \u201cAppeals to courts.\u201d Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>cally, Mr. Raich relies on the following portion of the statute in support of the argument that Vineyards Elite must be an \u201caggrieved\u201d party to appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014The decision of a local licensing board, in approving, suspending, revoking and restricting, or refusing to approve, suspend, revoke or restrict a license, or a licensee, shall be subject to appeal in the manner provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMg\">(b) <em>Who may </em>appeal.\u2014(1) Subject to paragraph ] ...

We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">It is well-settled in Maryland that, in interpreting statutory provisions, \u201c[o]ur goal is to \u2018ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Md.

Hayward, </em>426 Md. 638, 650, 45 A.3d 224 (2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">On the other hand, if the language of the statute is ambiguous, the \u201c \u2018courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of [the] enactment [under consideration].\u2019\u201d <em>Stoddard v.

In that event, an appellate court will resolve the ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose, avoiding a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>struction of the statute that is \u201c \u2018unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stoddard, </em>395 Md. at 662-63, 911 A.2d 1245 (quoting <em>Blake v.

Clearly, Mr. Raich was \u201caggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s decision denying his license under \u00a7 16-101(b)(3), and no issue of standing was raised in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Section 16\u2014101(f), however, is the pertinent statutory provision addressing appeals to this Court. Pursuant to the predecessor to \u00a7 16-101(f),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeals from a liquor board\u2019s decision were \u201cseverely limited.\u201d <em>Bd. of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs for Baltimore City v. Hollywood Prod., Inc., </em>344 Md. 2, 7, 684 A.2d 837 (1996). In 1992, however, the legislature amended the law to provide that \u201cany party of record to an appeal of a decision of a local licensing board to the circuit court may appeal the decision\u201d to this Court. <em>Id. </em>The language of \u00a7 16-101(f) does not include, as does \u00a7 16-101(b), a requirement that the person appealing be \u201caggrieved.\u201d Rather, the current version of the statute \u201cbroadly confers the right of appeal to any \u2018party of record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. Accord Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County v. Global Express Money Orders, Inc., </em>168 Md.App. 339, 342 n. 1, 896 A.2d 432 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>At oral argument, counsel for Mr. Raich argued that, notwithstanding that the word aggrieved does not appear in the language of \u00a7 16\u2014101(f), the purpose of the 1992 amendment to the statute was to \u201cmake the appeals process in local liquor board cases consistent with other administrative appeals,\u201d citing <em>Baltimore County Licensed Beverage Ass\u2019n Inc. v. Kwon, </em>135 Md.App. 178, 186 n. 4, 761 A.2d 1027 (2000). Counsel asserted that, because there is a requirement in administrative appeals generally that a party be aggrieved, it follows that a party seeking to appeal to this Court in a case involving a liquor board decision similarly must be aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">It is true that, in an appeal pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), a party must be aggrieved. Section 10-223(b), which governs appeals to this Court under the APA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">(b) Right of appeal\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">(1) A party who is aggrieved by a final judgment of a circuit court under this subtitle may appeal to the Court of Special Appeals in the manner that law provides for appeal of civil cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Md.Code (2009 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 10-223 of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The liquor board, however, is not an agency subject to the requirements of the APA. <em>Valentine v. Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs of Anne Arundel County, </em>291 Md. 523, 435 A.2d 459 (1981) (judicial review provisions do not apply to liquor boards). <em>See also Pridgeon v.

In the case of an appeal to this Court in a liquor license case, \u00a7 16\u2014101(f) does not include a requirement that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>party be aggrieved. Rather, it provides that \u201cany party of record to an appeal of a decision of a local licensing board to the circuit court may appeal the decision of the circuit court\u201d to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In construing a statute, we will neither \u201cadd nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Taylor v. NationsBank, N.A., </em>365 Md. 166, 181, 776 A.2d 645 (2001). The General Assembly did not include the word aggrieved in \u00a7 16\u2014101(f); we cannot add that requirement. If the General Assembly had so intended, it would have included that language, as it did in SG \u00a7 10-223 and Art. 2B, \u00a7 16\u2014101(b). <em>See Forster, </em>426 Md. at 599, 45 A.3d 180 (\u201c[WJhere Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another ... it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d) (quoting <em>Gardner v. State, </em>420 Md. 1, 11, 20 A.3d 801 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Moreover, nothing in the legislative history for \u00a7 16\u2014101(f) indicates an intent by the General Assembly that a party appealing to this Court be aggrieved. The floor report for House Bill 26 explained the state of the law prior to the enactment of \u00a7 16\u2014101(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">The decision of the circuit court is final and effective at once and no further appeal shall lie. An appeal may be taken to the Court of Special Appeals only if the circuit court decides a point of law at variance with any decision previously rendered by any other judge of the State on the same question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The report then explained the purpose of the change in the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">[Sjince circuit court opinions are not reported, it is virtually impossible to find a contrary circuit court opinion to provide a basis for appeal [to this Court] under current law. Testimony ... indicated that this requirement is unique and that the bill [to enact \u00a7 16\u2014101(f) ] would make the appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>process in local liquor board cases consistent with other administrative appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">This legislative history indicates that the purpose of enacting \u00a7 16-101 (f) was to allow for appeals from liquor board decisions beyond the circuit court, where none were allowed before, in the same way appeals are allowed in other administrative cases. We did not find anywhere in the bill file, or in the language of any of the drafts of the proposed statute, any reference to a requirement that a party to an appeal be aggrieved.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, the right to appeal was given to \u201cany party of record to an appeal of a decision of a local licensing board to the circuit court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Mr. Raich does not dispute that Vineyards Elite was a party of record to the circuit court appeal. Indeed, in Mr. Raich\u2019s certificate of service, he certified that he sent Vineyards Elite a copy of his Petition for Judicial Review. Vineyards Elite appeared before the Board as a Protestant and filed a Response to Petition for Judicial Review in the circuit court. Vineyards Elite participated in the proceedings before the circuit court and is identified as a party in the circuit court docket entries. Following entry of the circuit court\u2019s order, Vineyards Elite filed a motion to reconsider, and Mr. Raich filed an opposition thereto. Accordingly, pursuant to \u00a7 16-101(f), as a party of record to the circuit court proceeding, Vineyards Elite has standing to appeal to this Court. Dismissal of the appeal is not warranted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Substantial Basis for the Board\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Vineyards Elite argues that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Raich\u2019s application, and the Board did not commit an error of law by considering evidence of the potential for impact on existing licensees. It asks us to reverse the judgment of the circuit court requiring assignment of a liquor license to Mr. Raich.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Mr. Raich argues that the circuit court properly reversed the Board\u2019s decision denying his request for a liquor license, asserting that, pursuant to the mandatory language in \u00a7 10-202(a)(2)(i), the Board was required to consider all of the enumerated factors. Mr. Raich argues, however, that the Board considered only \u00a7 10\u2014202(a)(2)(i)(2), the \u201cnumber and location of existing licensees and the potential effect on existing licensees of the license applied for,\u201d and it \u201cden[ied] the License on the sole ground that a new license would result in an \u2018inevitable diminution\u2019 and \u2018overall dilution of product dollars\u2019 in the area where Mr. Raich indicated his business would be located.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Section 16\u2014101(e)(i), sets forth the statutory standard to be applied in judicial review actions from liquor board decisions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Upon the hearing of such appeal, the action of the local licensing board shall be presumed by the court to be proper and to best serve the public interest. The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner to show that the decision complained of was against the public interest and that the local licensing board\u2019s discretion in rendering its decision was not honestly and fairly exercised, or that such decision was arbitrary, or procured by fraud, or unsupported by any substantial evidence, or was unreasonable, or that such decision was beyond the powers of the local licensing board, and was illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Judicial review of a decision by a liquor board \u201cis similar to review of decisions by most other administrative agencies.\u201d <em>Blackburn v. Bd. of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs for Baltimore City, </em>130 Md.App. 614, 623, 747 A.2d 725 (2000).

Thus, the Court held that the Commissioner\u2019s final decision, which did not \u201cinform us (or Bethlehem) of the act or omission which he found to have constituted the violation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 667, 472 A.2d 62, was \u201cinadequate for judicial review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680, 472 A.2d 62. In reaching that conclusion, the Court observed that the Commissioner was required to issue an order, based upon findings of fact, pursuant to the APA, which provided: \u201cA final decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated. Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 472 A.2d 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The Court noted that, in \u201cjudicial review of an agency action the court may not uphold the agency order unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency\u201d in its order. <em>Id. </em>at 679, 472 A.2d 62. In that regard, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Judicial review of an administrative action differs from appellate review of a trial court judgment. In the latter context the appellate court will search the record for evidence to support the judgment and will sustain the judgment for a reason plainly appearing on the record whether or not the reason was expressly relied upon by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Mr. Raich contends that, similar to the Commissioner in <em>Bethlehem, Steel, </em>the Board here did not make adequate findings on the record with respect to each of the applicable factors to support its denial of his license application. He asserts that the \u201conly reason given by the Board\u201d in its decision was \u201c[safeguarding the market share of existing licensees,\u201d and because the Board did not make more explicit findings as to the other applicable factors in its decision, we cannot uphold it under <em>Bethlehem, Steel. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">As indicated, the liquor board, unlike the Commissioner of Labor &amp; Industry, is not an agency subject to the requirements of the APA. Indeed, in the liquor licensing statute, \u201c[tjhere is no express requirement that the Board set forth specific findings of fact and conclusions of law,\u201d <em>Blackburn, </em>130 Md.App. at 624, 747 A.2d 725, as agencies subject to the APA are required to do. Nor has either party cited any other provision of law that requires the Board to address seriatim the factors that it must consider under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">This Court has recognized, however, that \u201c[i]n order for any meaningful review to be conducted ... the Board must [address the various factors], at least informally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Black-bum, </em>we concluded that, because \u201cneither the transcript of the hearing before the Board nor the Board\u2019s letter to the licensees\u2019 counsel\u201d set forth the basis for its decision or suggested a finding as to any particular violation, the circuit court erred in affirming the Board. <em>Id. </em>That, however, is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">As stated previously, our role is limited to determining whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>to support the Board\u2019s conclusion. We conclude that there is, based on the testimony in the transcript, the exhibits, and the Board\u2019s comments on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">As set forth in detail, <em>supra, </em>during the hearing, the Board had before it evidence regarding (1) the public need and desire for the license, including Dr. Basu\u2019s report and testimony, as well as Dr. Patnode\u2019s testimony; (2) the number and location of existing licensees and the potential effect on existing licensees, including the testimony of both Dr. Basu and Dr. Pat-node, as well as Ms. Patel; (3) the potential commonality or uniqueness of the services and products to be offered by Mr. Raich\u2019s proposed business, including Mr. Raich\u2019s own testimony; (4) the impact on the general health, safety, and welfare of the community, including issues relating to crime, traffic conditions, parking, or convenience, including Dr. Basu\u2019s literature on the quality of life in the community; and (5) other factors, including that this was Mr. Raich\u2019s fourth attempt to obtain a liquor license in the area. The Board specifically stated that it had to consider \u201call the facts\u201d in making its decision, and that, in \u201ctaking the totality of the testimony,\u201d the Board would deny the application for a license. Thus, the record does not support a finding that the Board considered only one factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The record as a whole in this case is sufficient to allow for meaningful review. We hold that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED.

Article 2B, \u00a7 16-101 does not \u2019define the term \"aggrieved.\u201d The Court of Appeals has explained, however, that to be \"aggrieved\u201d for purposes of judicial review of administrative decisions, \"a person ordinarily must have an interest 'such that he is personally and specifically affected in a way different from ... the public generally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sugarloaf Citizens' Ass\u2019n v.

Maryland Code (1990 Repl.Vol.) Art. 2B, \u00a7 175(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b159-10\">. Indeed, the case that Mr. Raich cites for the proposition that a person seeking judicial review of an administrative proceeding \u201c 'must both be a \"parly\" to the administrative proceedings and be \"aggrieved,\u201d \u2019 \" <em>Sugarloaf Citizens\u2019 Association, </em>344 Md. at 287, 686 A.2d 605 (quoting <em>Medical Waste </em>Assoc., 327 Md. at 611, 612 A.2d 241), was an appeal discussing the requirement for judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\">. Of course, even absent a requirement that a party be aggrieved, a party may appeal only from an adverse judgment. <em>Wright v. Baker, </em>197 Md. 315, 318, 79 A.2d 159 (1951) (appellant cannot object to a judgment in his favor).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\">. Vineyards Elite also argues that, even if there is a requirement that it be aggrieved, it meets that requirement because \u201cits business will be deleteriously affected different [from] the public at large.\u201d Although our holding in this case does not require us to address this issue, we are inclined to agree. As indicated, to be aggrieved for purposes of judicial review, one must have an interest \" \u2018such that he is personally and specifically affected in a way different from ... the public generally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sugarloaf, </em>344 Md. at 288, 686 A.2d 605 (quoting <em>Med. Waste, </em>327 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>at 611, 612 A.2d 241). Here, if an additional liquor license was granted in the immediate geographical area. Vineyards Elite, a nearby licensee, risked a direct effect to its business, increased competition, and a possible decrease in its sales. <em>See Jordan Towing, Inc. v. Hebbville Auto Repair, Inc., </em>369 Md. 439, 442, 800 A.2d 768 (2002) (issuance of an additional towing license in the same vicinity where the protestants alone held licenses was sufficient standing to challenge the additional license as aggrieved parties because the protestants\u2019 businesses were directly affected and suffered special damages different in kind from that suffered by the general public).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b162-9\">. Mr. Raich concedes that the Board properly considered the potential effect on existing licensees as one of the statutory criteria, but he argues that the circuit court properly found that the Board erred in considering this as \"the sole factor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
