Appellant, Kris Golden (\u201cGolden\u201d), who sought intervention in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, is the maternal cousin of Malichi W. (\u201cMalichi\u201d), who is now eight-years old. The parental rights of Malichi\u2019s biological parents were terminated on August 10, 2010. Yolanda W. (\u201cMs. W.\u201d) filed a petition to adopt Malichi on March 24, 2011, which was granted on June 1, 2011. Golden filed two motions, one on April 8 and one on May 31, both entitled \u201cMotion to Intervene and Appeal,\u201d in the adoption proceedings. The circuit court, sitting as a juvenile court, denied both motions. Because we find that no law or rule authorizes Golden to intervene in an adoption proceeding after termination of parental rights, we affirm the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Malichi was born on May 3, 2004 in Baltimore City. The juvenile court terminated the parental rights of Malichi\u2019s biological parents on August 10, 2010. Malichi\u2019s biological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>mother consented to the termination on the condition that Malichi be adopted by Ms. W., who was Malichi\u2019s pre-adoptive foster mother, and who had custody of the child since June 6, 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Malichi\u2019s biological father did not object, and thus he consented by operation of law. On March 9, 2011, the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d), the child\u2019s appointed guardian, consented to Malichi\u2019s adoption by Ms. W. Ms. W. then petitioned the court to adopt Malichi on March 24, 2011. The following day, the court appointed an attorney to represent Malichi.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">On April 8, Golden filed a motion in Malichi\u2019s adoption proceedings captioned \u201cMotion to Intervene and Appeal.\u201d She wanted to be considered as an adoptive parent for Mali-chi. The juvenile court denied the motion on April 12, in a one-line order, stating that it lacked good cause. Golden did not appeal this decision. On May 31, 2011, Golden filed a second motion with the same caption as her first.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 1, 2011, the juvenile court granted Ms. W\u2019s petition for adoption of Malichi. The court then denied Golden\u2019s motion on June 10, 2011 in a brief order, finding that there was a lack of good cause and that the issue was moot because \u201cthe child was adopted on 6/1/11.\u201d Golden filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">QUESTION PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">We review the following question:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Did the court legally err in denying Golden\u2019s second motion to <em>intervene?</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">For the following reasons, we find no error and affirm the circuit court\u2019s denial of Golden\u2019s motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">In this ease, the key issue is whether a non-parental, non-custodial relative of a child is authorized to intervene in an adoption proceeding after termination of parental rights. Because this is a purely legal issue involving interpretation of the Maryland Code and the Maryland Rules of Procedure, we review the juvenile court\u2019s decision under a <em>de novo </em>standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Golden argues that the juvenile court erred in denying her motion to intervene and appeal because she was Malichi\u2019s maternal cousin, and she had an interest in adopting him. She contends that the court should have considered her as a potential adoptive parent because she is a biological family member. The Department responds that the juvenile court properly denied Golden\u2019s motion because no statute or rule affords a person in Golden\u2019s situation either a right or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>opportunity to intervene in an adoption proceeding after parental rights have been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We agree with the Department. In reaching this conclusion, we review the Maryland Code provisions and Maryland Rules of Procedure that could potentially relate to this case: Title 5, Subtitle 3 of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d) of the Md.Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.); Title 9 of the Maryland Rules; Md. Rule 2-214; and Title 11 of the Maryland Rules, particularly with respect to its interaction with Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) of the Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">I. Family Law Article, Title 5, Subtitle 3</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Title 5, Subtitle 3 of the FL Article which governs adoptions, and more specifically Part IV, which applies to adoptions after termination of parental rights, makes no mention of a right to intervene in an adoption proceeding. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7\u00a7 5-301 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Under FL \u00a7 5-345(a), \u201c[a]ny adult\u201d may petition a juvenile court for an adoption of the child post-TPR. However, the petitioner must include in his or her filing all written consents required by FL \u00a7 5-350(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Ms. W. filed the consent of Malichi\u2019s guardian, the Department, Golden could not. This fact poses an insurmountable barrier to the relief she seeks\u2014consideration as an adoptive parent. However, even if we were to assume that Golden\u2019s goal was to overturn Ms. W.\u2019s adoption of Malichi, no mechanism exists for her intervention in a post-TPR adoption.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>II. Title 9 of the Maryland Rules</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The Maryland Rules that concern adoption and guardianship cases, <em>viz., </em>those in Title 9, do not give Golden the right to intervene in this adoption. Under Md. Rule 9-107(a), \u201c[a]ny person having a right to participate in a proceeding for adoption or guardianship may file a notice of objection to the adoption or guardianship.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section (b)(1) restricts when a person can file this objection, stating that the objector must file within 30 days after \u201cthe show cause order is served.\u201d Md. Rule 9\u2014107(b)(1). A show cause order must include a \u201cpre-eaptioned notice of objection form.\u201d Md. Rule 9-105(c)(3). Because a person must file his or her objection within 30 days after the court sends a show cause order, it would seem that the only persons permitted to object are those who receive a show cause order.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">However, unlike other types of adoptions, in a post-TPR adoption proceeding, there is no requirement for issuance of a show cause order. Md. Rule 9-105(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rather, the clerk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>court sends notice to the local department of social services and the child\u2019s last attorney of record in the guardianship case. FL \u00a7 5-346. Nevertheless, Rule 9-105 contains blank Notice of Objection forms which apply to five different types of adoptions, including \u201ca Public Agency Adoption after TPR.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, we shall assume that Rule 9-107(a) applies in a post-TPR adoption case. Regardless, the rule still requires that the objectors have \u201ca right to participate\u201d in the adoption proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Under FL \u00a7 5-350, for a minor, the guardian must consent to the adoption and if the child is at least 10 years of age, he or she must also consent. These are the persons entitled to notice under FL \u00a7 5-346. They are the participants and potential objectors. Golden does not qualify as an intervenor under Rule 9-107(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The persons who have a \u201cright to participate\u201d in the proceeding under this rule and a right to object to the proposed adoption are very limited. <em>See </em>2 Am. Jur.2d <em>Adoptions </em>(2004) at \u00a7 121 (\u201cThe parties to adoption cases are strictly limited to those with legal rights at stake.\u201d) Because Golden is not within this class of persons with a right to participate in the adoption proceeding, she cannot rely on the Title 9 rules as a basis for intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">III. Maryland Rule 2-214</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Md. Rule 2-214 governs intervention in certain civil cases but does not apply to adoption proceedings. Md. Rule l-101(b) states that Title 2 \u201capplies to civil matters in the circuit courts, except for Juvenile Causes under Title 11 of these Rules and except as otherwise specifically provided or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>necessarily implied.\u201d It is necessarily implied that intervention under Title 2 is inapplicable to adoption proceedings because Title 9 has its own rules for \u201cintervening\u201d in adoption proceedings. Specifically, as discussed above, Md. Rule 9-107 allows for a person to object to an adoption in limited circumstances. Providing for an \u201cobjection\u201d to the adoption proceeding necessarily implies that it is the exclusive way that one can intervene in such a proceeding. Thus, Md. R. 2-214 does not apply to adoption proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">IV. Title 11 of the Maryland Rules</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Finally, Md. Rule ll-122(b),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a rule concerning non-parental intervention, does not apply to post-TPR adoption proceedings. Rule 11\u2014122(b) allows non-parental intervention at the discretion of the juvenile court, but for \u201cdispositional\u201d purposes only. The Rule does not specifically state what \u201cdispositional purposes\u201d means. However, it is apparent that the provisions of the Maryland Code concerning \u201cjuvenile causes\u201d are in <em>pan materia </em>with the Title 11 Rules;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the statutory provisions shed light on the meaning of \u201cdispositional purposes.\u201d In CJP \u00a7\u00a7 3-801 <em>et seq., </em>which governs CINA proceedings, the term \u201c[djispositional hearing\u201d means a hearing to determine:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">(1) Whether a child is in need of assistance; and</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>(2) If so, the nature of the court\u2019s intervention to protect the child\u2019s health, safety and well being.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">CJP \u00a7 3-801(m).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Section 3\u2014819(b)(1) of the CJP Article describes the possible judicial \u201cinterventions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">In making a disposition on a CINA petition under this subtitle, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">(i) Find that the child is not in need of assistance and, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, dismiss the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">(ii) Hold in abeyance a finding on whether a child with a developmental disability or a mental illness is a child in need of assistance and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">1.

After the hearing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-14\">A.

Subject to \u00a7 3-819.2 of this subtitle, a relative, or other individual; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">C. A local department, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, or both, including designation of the type of facility where the child is to be placed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">Paragraph (b)(3) states: \u201cUnless good cause is shown, a court shall give priority to the child\u2019s relatives over nonrelatives when committing the child to the custody of an individual rather than a parent.\u201d Subsection (c) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">In addition to any action under subsection (b)(l)(iii) of this section, the court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">(1) (i) Place a child under the protective supervision of the local department on terms the court considers appropriate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-15\">(ii) Grant limited guardianship to the department or an individual or both for specific purposes including medical and educational purposes or for other appropriate services if a parent is unavailable, unwilling, or unable to consent to services that are in the best interest of the child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-16\">(iii) Order the child and the child\u2019s parent, guardian, or custodian to participate in rehabilitative services that are in the best interest of the child and family; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-17\">(2) Determine custody, visitation, support, or paternity of a child in accordance with \u00a7 3-803(b) of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-18\">Finally, CJP \u00a7 3-819.2(b) states that \u201cthe court may grant custody and guardianship to a relative or nonrelative under this subtitle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-19\">This statute makes it clear that the term \u201cdispositional purposes\u201d in Rule ll-122(b) applies to proceedings that pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>cede an adoption that follows a termination of parental rights. Moreover, the specificity and exclusivity of Rule ll-122(b) create the negative implication that no right of intervention exists beyond the dispositional stage\u2014here, an adoption following termination of parental rights.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The rationale for such a construction is readily apparent. In <em>Palmisano v. Baltimore County, </em>249 Md. 94, 103, 238 A.2d 251 (1968), the Court of Appeals noted the \u201cneed to surround\u201d the final adoption decree \u201cwith a high degree of certainty\u201d and that \u201canything which would undermine public confidence in adoption proceedings must be read by the courts in the gravest light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">With a review of the potentially applicable law, we find no statute or rule allows intervention in an adoption after termination of parental rights. Thus, Golden had no right to intervene in the adoption. She was not a parent or guardian. Ms. W. had already filed her adoption petition. Malichi\u2019s biological mother had consented to the termination of her parental rights on the condition that Malichi be adopted by Ms. W., not Golden. The Department of Social Services, as guardian, had already consented to Ms. W.\u2019s adoption petition. After these steps were taken, the only parties to the adoption proceeding were Ms. W. and Malichi. We find no legal error from the juvenile court\u2019s decision, and affirm the denial of Golden\u2019s motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY, SITTING AS A JUVENILE COURT, AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\">. Malichi had previously been determined to be a child in need of assistance (CINA) although the record is unclear regarding the date of the court's order. Malichi\u2019s status as a CINA was terminated when adoption was ordered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\">. Golden was not entitled to a hearing on her motions under Md. R. 2-311 because she did not request one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\">. We have formulated this question from a review of Golden's brief. Under \"Issues Presented,\u201d Golden states, in part, \"Kris Golden was not afforded proper consideration in her attempt to adopt Malichi W. so that he could remain with his biological family.\u201d Because Golden was not a proper party to the adoption proceeding, she can only appeal the denial of her motion to intervene. The denial of a motion to intervene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>is an appealable final order. <em>Hiyab, Inc. v. Ocean Petroleum, LLC, </em>183 Md.App. 1, 9, 959 A.2d 808 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b111-10\">. Golden did not appeal the denial of her first motion and ordinarily, she would not be permitted to file the same motion more than 30 days after the denial of her first motion. Md. Rule 2-535. However, appellee Department has not raised an objection. In addition, the juvenile court entertained the second motion by finding lack of good cause. Thus, we will address whether Golden had a right to intervene. Because we affirm the circuit court's decision that she could not intervene, we need not decide the issue of mootness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b111-11\">. This review is different than our consideration of a circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion to intervene under Md. Rule 2-214. There, we employ an abuse of discretion standard when the circuit court denies the motion as untimely or when permissive intervention is rejected. <em>See Md.-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Town of Washington Grove, Md., </em>408 Md. 37, 65 n. 20, 968 A.2d 552 (2009).

Golden has not filed a petition to invalidate the adoption.

In light of our conclusion that Golden could not intervene in the adoption proceeding, we need not consider the impact of \u00a7 5-353 on her contentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">. The history of Rule 9-107(a) and its forbearers make it clear that if \"intervention\u201d exists in an adoption/guardianship proceeding, it is within the confines of this Rule. When this provision was embodied in former Rule 1176, it provided that if a person had \"a right to contest a proceeding for adoption, or guardianship\u201d he or she could file \"a petition to intervene as a defendant in the proceeding.\u201d This \u201cintervention\u201d requirement was retained in former Rule D76. In the 1980s, this rule was amended to substitute \u201ca notice of objection\u201d for \u201ca petition to intervene\u201d and the \u201cright to notice of a proceeding\u201d was substituted for a \"right to contest a proceeding.\u201d Finally, this latter provision became a \u201cright to participate in a proceeding.\u201d Regardless of its verbage, the Rule has keyed intervention/objection to a pre-existing right to be part of the proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b113-9\">.

With great force, Golden argues that she should be considered for adoption because she is a relative of Malichi. This argument would carry greater weight if Golden had sought custody before adoption, where State law accords a preference to relatives over non-relatives for custodial purposes. <em>See e.g., </em>CJP \u00a7\u00a7 3-815(c)(5), 3-819(b)(3), 3-823(e)(l)(i)(2), and FL \u00a7 5\u2014525(f)(2). No such priority appears in the post-TPR adoption provisions. It would appear that Golden may not have been able to seek custody at that time because she was a minor. However, this is no reason to depart from the statutory provisions and rules to grant a right to participate in post-TPR adoption proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
