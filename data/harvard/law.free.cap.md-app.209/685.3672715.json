Thompkins and his wife, Antoinette S. Thompkins (the \u201cThompkinses\u201d), appeal from a decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City granting summary judgment in favor of appellee Mountaineer Investments, LLC (\u201cMountaineer\u201d). In their complaint, the Thompkinses contended that Mountaineer was liable for certain alleged viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>tions of the Maryland Secondary Mortgage Loan Law (the \u201cSMLL\u201d), found at Md.Code Ann., Com. Law (\u201cCL\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 12-401 <em>et seq. </em>(1975, 2005 RepLVol., 2010 Supp.). In granting summary judgment, the circuit court determined that Mountaineer was an assignee and not a lender under the SMLL, and that there was no statutory or common law basis to hold Mountaineer derivatively liable for any of the lender\u2019s alleged violations. The Thompkinses subsequently filed this appeal, presenting two questions for our review, which we have reworded and consolidated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">Is an assignee of a second mortgage loan liable for the lender\u2019s violations of the SMLL?[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">We conclude that an assignee of a second mortgage is not liable for the lender\u2019s violations of the SMLL when the loan has been paid in full unless the assignee (i) expressly assumed such liability or (ii) itself violated the SMLL.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the Thompkinses paid their loan prior to filing suit and no facts have been pled suggesting that Mountaineer either expressly assumed any liability for the lender\u2019s alleged violations or violated the SMLL itself, we will affirm the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Mountaineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">\n<em>The Undisputed Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">On March 4, 1998, the Thompkinses obtained a second mortgage loan in the principal amount of $60,075 from Mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>gage Lenders Network USA, Inc. (\u201cMLN\u201d). There is no dispute that this loan is subject to the provisions of the SMLL and that MLN was a \u201clender\u201d as the term is defined in the SMLL.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">At closing, the Thompkinses paid certain additional fees, including a $250 document preparation fee, a $225 settlement or closing fee, a $151.25 title insurance premium, and a $1,000 mortgage broker\u2019s or finder\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">On the day of closing, MLN transferred the loan to Master Financial, Inc. (\u201cMaster Financial\u201d). In early December of 2005, Master Financial transferred the loan to Mountaineer as part of a larger pool of small loans. There is no dispute that Mountaineer is an assignee of the Thompkinses\u2019 loan. It is additionally undisputed that Mountaineer has never been in the business of making loans and has never been licensed in Maryland to do so. Thus, Mountaineer is not a \u201clender\u201d as defined by CL \u00a7 12-401(b). As noted by the circuit court, it is additionally undisputed that Mountaineer \u201cdid not receive or charge any consideration, fees or commissions in connection with the Plaintiffs\u2019 second mortgage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">On June 26, 2006, approximately seven months after the note was assigned to Mountaineer, the Thompkinses paid the loan in full. Mountaineer released the Deed of Trust shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">\n<em>The Complaint &amp; Amended Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AiB\">The Thompkinses originally filed their complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on July 7, 2009, naming MLN and Mountaineer as defendants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On August 11, 2009, Mountaineer removed the action to the United States District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>for the District of Maryland. Subsequently, on April 2, 2010, the District Court for the District of Maryland remanded the matter back to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City without addressing the merits of the Thompkinses\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The Thompkinses alleged in their complaint and amended complaint<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that MLN violated the statutory requirements of the SMLL in three distinct ways. First, referencing the closing fees identified above, the Thompkinses asserted, in essence, that MLN charged fees in addition to a loan origination fee, and that the charging of such additional fees was in violation of the SMLL. <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 12-411 (\u201cA lender may not directly or indirectly, contract for, charge, or receive, any interest, discount, fee, fine, commission, brokerage, charge, or other consideration in excess of that permitted by this subtitle.\u201d); CL \u00a7 12-405(a)(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, the Thompkinses alleged that MLN failed to provide the proper disclosure form as required by the SMLL. <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 12-407.1 (\u201cThe Commissioner shall develop and prepare a form that each lender shall furnish to an applicant for a secondary mortgage loan. The form shall state the following: (1) The purpose for which the loan is to be used; (2) A disclosure that, if the loan is for a commercial purpose, the borrower shall forfeit certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>rights.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Third, the Thompkinses claimed that they were improperly charged a broker\u2019s or finder\u2019s fee (without having first entered into a separate and distinct written agreement with the mortgage broker) in violation of the SMLL. <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 12-805(d)(l) (\u201cA finder\u2019s fee may not be charged unless it is pursuant to a written agreement between the mortgage broker and the borrower which is separate and distinct from any other document.\u201d); CL \u00a7 12-406(b) (\u201cAn agreement to pay a commission, finder\u2019s fee, or point may not be enforced unless it is in writing and signed by the lender.\u201d); CL \u00a7 12-405(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The amended complaint did not allege that Mountaineer acted as a secondary mortgage lender but rather that Mountaineer \u201chad a duty to make sure that the second mortgage loans it purchased complied with the SMLLn\u201d and that Mountaineer \u201cbreached this duty and routinely purchased Maryland second mortgage loans that violated the SMLL, thus perpetrating the market for such illegal secondary mortgage loans.\u201d Therefore, the amended complaint asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">As purchaser and/or assignee and holder of the note and the second mortgage of the Plaintiffs, Mountaineer ... is liable to the Plaintiffs because it is subject to all claims and defenses which the Plaintiffs ... could asserted against [MLN],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Additionally, the amended complaint alleged that Mountaineer \u201cknowingly violated the provisions of the Maryland SMLL because it had actual knowledge ... of the requirements of the SMLL and that thousands of Maryland second mortgage loans were made in violation of the statute\u201d and, further, that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding this knowledge, [Mountaineer] continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>collect interest on the Plaintiffs\u2019 second mortgage loan that they were not legally entitled to collect.\u201d The Thompkinses prayed for statutory damages totaling $264,415.54, plus fees, costs, and prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\n<em>The Circuit Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Prior to the completion of discovery, the Thompkinses moved for summary judgment on all violations alleged in the complaint, and argued that Mountaineer, as assignee, was liable for MLN\u2019s violations. The Thompkinses contended that CL \u00a7 3-306 provided a statutory basis for imposing liability upon Mountaineer. Specifically, the Thompkinses interpreted CL \u00a7 3-306 to impose derivative liability when an assignee could not establish a holder-in-due-course defense. The Thompkinses also argued that Mountaineer was liable for the alleged violations under Maryland common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In response, and in a companion motion to dismiss, Mountaineer argued that the SMLL applied only to lenders, not assignees, that neither CL \u00a7 3-306 nor the common law provided a basis to impose derivative liability upon an assignee, and that Mountaineer, as assignee, had not assumed liability for any of MLN\u2019s alleged violations. Mountaineer also maintained that it was a holder-in-due course, and additionally argued that MLN had not violated any requirements of the SMLL.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">After the completion of discovery, Mountaineer moved for summary judgment on all claims contained in the Thompkinses\u2019 amended complaint, maintaining that there were no genuine disputes as to any material facts, and arguing, once again, in relevant part, that there was no basis in Maryland law for imposing derivative liability on Mountaineer for any of MLN\u2019s alleged violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>In response, the Thompkinses asserted that MLN had violated the SMLL, and that Mountaineer could be derivatively liable for these violations under the common law and pursuant to CL \u00a7 3-806 (if it was not a holder-in-due-course). The Thompkinses also contended that there remained outstanding material factual disputes, including a dispute as to whether Mountaineer was, in fact, a holder-in-due-course.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">After a hearing, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Mountaineer, concluding that Mountaineer was an assignee of the Thompkinses\u2019 loan and that there was no statutory or common law basis to impose derivative liability on Mountaineer for any of the alleged violations, irrespective of whether Mountaineer was a holder-in-due-course. Specifically, in its memorandum opinion, the circuit court stated, in relevant part, as follows (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">No provisions of the SMLL define, address or account for claims against assignees of second mortgage loans. The SMLL does not apply to Mountaineer as an assignee of Plaintiffs\u2019 loan in 2005. The SMLL does not apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Mountaineer as a \u201clender\u201d or assignee. Nor did Mountaineer expressly or impliedly assume any liability as an assignee of Plaintiffs\u2019 loan in 2005. Accordingly, for reasons stated, this Court shall enter judgment in favor of Mountaineer because the Defendant\u2019s motion and Plaintiffs\u2019 response show that there is no genu- \u2022 ine dispute as to any material fact and Mountaineer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">An appellate court reviews a circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Harford County v. Saks Fifth Ave. Distrib. Co., </em>399 Md. 73, 82, 923 A.2d 1 (2007). The court must determine whether there exists a dispute as to any material fact and whether the circuit court was legally correct. <em>Lombardi v. Montgomery County, </em>108 Md.App. 695, 710, 673 A.2d 762 (1996). In making this determination, the court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>consider the facts in the record \u201c \u2018in the light most favorable to the non-moving part[y].\u2019 \u201d <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Benjamin, </em>394 Md. 59, 74, 904 A.2d 511 (2006) (quoting <em>Sadler v. Dimensions Healthcare Corp., </em>378 Md. 509, 533-34, 836 A.2d 655 (2003)). \u201cEven if it appears that the relevant facts are undisputed, if those facts are susceptible to inferences supporting the position of the party opposing summary judgment, then a grant of summary judgment is improper.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Both the Thompkinses and Mountaineer start with the same assumption, namely, that the SMLL itself does not address whether an assignee of a second mortgage note can be held liable for a lender\u2019s violations of the law. We agree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The parties also agree that Title 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, codified at Md.Code Ann., Com. Law (\u201cCL\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 3-301 <em>et seq. </em>(1975, 2002 RepLVol., 2010 Supp.), applies to the facts of our case. They disagree, however, as to which provisions of Title 3 control. The relevant sections are CL \u00a7 3-305, which sets out defenses and claims in recoupment that can be asserted by an obligor against a person attempting to enforce a negotiable instrument, and CL \u00a7 3-306, which provides that a non-holder-in-due-course takes an instrument subject to claims of third parties to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Mountaineer takes the position that, while CL \u00a7 3-305 may provide a remedy to a borrower in a secondary mortgage loan under some circumstances, the Thompkinses\u2019 claims fail on the facts at hand. The Thompkinses maintain that \u00a7 3-306 authorizes the imposition of derivative liability upon an assignee of a second mortgage loan note that cannot establish a holder-in-due-course defense. Additionally, the Thompkinses allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>that Maryland common law provides a separate basis for the imposition of derivative liability on Mountaineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">In order to determine whether Mountaineer is liable for MLN\u2019s alleged violations of the SMLL, we will first consider whether CL \u00a7 3-306 provides a basis to impose liability on an assignee unable to establish a holder-in-due-course defense. On this point, we conclude that CL \u00a7 3-306 does not apply to the facts of this case, and that, therefore, the statute does not provide a basis for the imposition of derivative liability on Mountaineer for any of MLN\u2019s alleged violations. We will then turn to whether CL \u00a7 3-305 is applicable h\u00e9re. We conclude that \u00a7 3-305 is also inapposite. Finally, we will decide whether Maryland case law otherwise provides a basis for the imposition of liability on an assignee for a lender\u2019s alleged violations. Because we conclude that case law provides no such basis, we will affirm the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Mountaineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In weighing the parties\u2019 contentions, we remain cognizant of the legislative purposes of the SMLL. As noted by this Court in <em>Duckworth v. Bernstein, </em>55 Md.App. 710, 724, 466 A.2d 517 (1983), the SMLL \u201cis a law intended to guard the foolish or unsophisticated borrower, who may be under severe financial pressure, from his own improvidence. The law achieves this beneficent purpose by penalizing even the unwitting violator, to the extent of limiting him to recovery of the principal amount of the loan. This is consistent with the strong Maryland policy against usury ... [and] also consistent with the legislative approach to consumer protection____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 724, 466 A.2d 517 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">I. Commercial Law Article \u00a7 3-306</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">The Thompkinses contend that CL \u00a7 3-306 provides for derivative liability in the event that an assignee is not a holder-in-due-course. This presents an issue of statutory interpretation\u2014specifically, we must determine whether the statute is intended to address claims of the sort asserted by the Thompkinses. In so doing, we must apply \u201cthe same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>principles of statutory construction that we would apply in determining the meaning of any other legislative enactment.\u201d <em>Messing v. Bank of America, </em>373 Md. 672, 684, 821 A.2d 22 (2003). To do this, we start with an examination of the text of the statute. As Judge Zarnoch recently explained for this Court, questions of statutory interpretation are often:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">resolvable on the basis of judicial consideration of three general factors: 1) text; 2) purpose; and 3) consequences. Text is the plain language of the relevant provision, typically given its ordinary meaning, <em>Breslin v. Powell, </em>421 Md. 266, 286 [26 A.3d 878] (2011), viewed in context, <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514 [525 A.2d 628] (1987), considered in light of the whole statute, <em>In re Stephen K, </em>289 Md. 294, 298 [424 A.2d 153] (1981), and generally evaluated for ambiguity. <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 513 [525 A.2d 628]. Legislative purpose, either apparent from the text or gathered from external sources, often informs, if not controls, our reading of the statute. <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 515 [525 A.2d 628]. An examination of interpretive consequences, either as a comparison of the results of each proffered construction, <em>Christian v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 296, 303 [489 A.2d 64] (1985), or as a principle of avoidance of an absurd or unreasonable reading, <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 513, 516 [525 A.2d 628], grounds the court\u2019s interpretation in reality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\"><em>Town of Oxford v. Koste, </em>204 Md.App. 578, 585-86, 42 A.3d 637 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">We have a particularly helpful and accessible guide in our search for legislative intent. \u201cUnlike most state statutory enactments, the U.C.C. is accompanied by a useful aid for determining the purpose of its provisions\u2014the official comments of the Code\u2019s draftsmen. While these comments are not controlling authority and may not be used to vary the plain language of the statute, they are an excellent place to begin a search for the legislature\u2019s intent when it adopted the Code.\u201d <em>Messing, </em>373 Md. at 685, 821 A.2d 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Thus, we start our examination with the text of CL \u00a7 3-306. That section states, in its entirety (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">A person taking an instrument, other than a person having rights of a holder in due course, <em>is subject to a claim of a property or possessory right in the instrument or its proceeds, including a claim to rescind a negotiation and to recover the instrument or its proceeds. </em>A person having rights of a holder in due course takes free of the claim to the instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The Official Comment to CL \u00a7 3-306 reads in its entirety as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">This section expands on the reference to \u201cclaims to\u201d the instrument mentioned in former Sections 3-305 and 3-306. <em>Claims covered by the section include not only claims to ownership but also any other claim of a property or possessory right. </em>It includes the claim to a lien or the claim of a person in rightful possession of an instrument who was wrongfully deprived of possession. Also included is a claim based on Section 3-202(b) for rescission of a negotiation of the instrument by the claimant. <em>Claims to an instrument under 3-306 are different from claims in recoupment referred to in Section 3-305(a)(3).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Applying the above recited rules of statutory construction, it is clear to this Court that the text of \u00a7 3-306, on its face, applies to circumstances where someone makes a claim on the loan instrument or its proceeds against a person other than a holder in due course. The two examples provided in CL \u00a7 3-306\u2019s Official Comment\u2014a claim to rescind a negotiation and a claim to recover the instrument or its proceeds\u2014clearly fit within this interpretation. Additionally, the Official Comment relates that lien claims and wrongful deprivation claims also fall within the scope of the statute. All of these examples are clearly claims of a property or possessory right in the loan instrument or its proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">In this regard, the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis in <em>Master Financial v. Crowder, </em>409 Md. 51, 64, 972 A.2d 864 (2009), is instructive. The issue before the Court in <em>Crowder </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>whether an action to recover for violations of the SMLL was subject to the three year statute of limitations set out in Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Prog. (\u201cCJP\u201d) \u00a7 5-101 (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.) or the 12 year limitation period for \u201cspecialities\u201d specified in CJP \u00a7 5-102. As the Court explained, among the actions subject to the latter statute are those on a \u201c \u2018promissory note or other instrument under seal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63 n. 3, 972 A.2d 864 (quoting CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(l)). In concluding that CJP \u00a7 5~102(a)(l) did not apply to an action for damages for a breach of the SMLL, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">The governing fact here, as both lower courts observed, is that these actions are not on the notes or deeds of trust. The plaintiffs are not seeking to enforce those instruments, or to invalidate or reform them based on any alleged imperfection in the instruments themselves. The sole bases of their complaint under the SMLL are that (1) the lender was not properly licensed, (2) they were charged excessive origination fees, and (3) they were not given a disclosure form supposedly required by the statute, and the only remedies sought were those provided by CL \u00a7 12-413.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Those alleged facts and the consequences of them are entirely extraneous to the notes and deeds of trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Like the plaintiffs in <em>Crowder, </em>the Thompkinses have not made a claim on the loan instrument or its proceeds. Instead, they seek statutory damages as a result of alleged violations of the SMLL. The basis for their claim is CL \u00a7 12-413. Their claims do not involve questions of who has the right to possess a note or to receive the note\u2019s proceeds, which is the purview of \u00a7 3-306. CL \u00a7 3-306 is, therefore, inapplicable to the specific facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>II. Commercial Law Article \u00a7 3-305</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Mountaineer contends that the Thompkinses\u2019 claims are claims in recoupment and that CL \u00a7 3-305 is the statute that applies here. Section 3-305 states, in relevant part (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">(a) Except as stated in subsection (b), <em>the right to enforce the obligation of a party to pay an instrument </em>is subject to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">(3) A claim in recoupment of the obligor against the original payee of the instrument if the claim arose from the transaction that gave rise to the instrument; but the claim of the obligor may be asserted against a transferee of the instrument only to reduce the amount owing on the instrument at the time the action is brought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">(b) The right of a holder in due course to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument is ... not subject to claims in recoupment stated in subsection (a)(3) against a person other than the holder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">By its plain meaning, CL \u00a7 3-305(a) applies only to actions to enforce the obligation of a party to pay an instrument. The Official Comment to CL \u00a7 3-305 supports this conclusion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the instant case, the loan had been paid in full three years before suit was filed. Mountaineer is not seeking to enforce the instrument, and it would make no sense to bring an action to collect a debt that had been paid in full. Such an action has not been brought, and it thus follows that, like CL 3-306, CL \u00a7 3-305 is inapplicable to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>III. Maryland Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">The Thompkinses also contend that several decisions by the Court of Appeals provide a separate basis for holding an assignee derivatively liable for the lender\u2019s violations of SMLL. In support of this position, the Thompkinses cite to a series of Maryland cases involving assignments: <em>James v. Goldberg, </em>256 Md. 520, 527, 261 A.2d 758 (1970); <em>Farmers\u2019 &amp; Merchants\u2019 Nat'l, Bank of Bel Air v. Anderson, </em>152 Md. 641, 645, 137 A. 367 (1927); <em>Whistler v. Hanna, </em>152 Md. 597, 601-02, 137 A. 276 (1927); <em>Riley v. Woodall, </em>145 Md. 125, 127, 125 A. 503 (1924); <em>Hunter v. Chase, </em>144 Md. 13, 16-17, 123 A. 393 (1923); <em>Ressmeyer v.

Parish, </em>42 Md. 598, 614 (1875).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">These cases are not on point factually, nor are they helpful to our determination of whether an assignee can be held liable for violations of the SMLL by the original lender. Although the cases differ factually and the Court\u2019s analysis varied to some extent in each,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> these decisions (with the exception of Goldberg) all address an assignee\u2019s right to enforce a mortgage instrument where there were allegations that the instrument was obtained through fraudulent, deceitful, or other improper means. Here, in contrast, we are not concerned with Mountaineer\u2019s rights under the Note nor is fraud in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>inducement an element of the Thompkinses\u2019 claim. <em>Goldberg </em>and the <em>Cumberland Coal </em>line of cases do not convince us that the remedy sought by the Thompkinses exists under the common law of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">In support of their position, the Thompkinses also cite <em>Miller v. Pac. Shore Funding, </em>224 F.Supp.2d 977 (D.Md.2002). We do not find <em>Miller </em>persuasive in this regard. <em>Miller </em>involved claims based on asserted violations of the SMLL by lenders. In addition, as in this case, the plaintiffs in <em>Miller </em>asserted claims against the assignees of the notes signed by the plaintiffs in those transactions. In concluding that the allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint survived a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">MBNA and Household are alleged assignees of Mr. GilbertIheme\u2019s loan; Residential is an alleged assignee of the Millers\u2019 loan. As assignees, these defendants stand in the shoes of their assignor, Pacific; they are subject to the same claims or defenses as Pacific, unless they can raise a holder-in-due-course defense. <em>See Jones v. Hyatt, </em>356 Md. 639, 653 n. 8, 741 A.2d 1099 (1999). Thus, whatever claims Mr. Gilbert-Iheme may assert against Pacific, he may assert against MBNA and Household. Likewise, whatever claims the Millers may assert against Pacific, they may assert against Residential.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">224 F.Supp.2d at 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">We do not read <em>Jones v. Hyatt </em>as broadly as did the District Court. In that case, Jones was injured in an automobile accident. The negligent driver was operating a vehicle leased by K &amp; D Auto, Inc. K &amp; D had arranged for insurance on the vehicle through Hyatt, an insurance agency, but, allegedly through negligence attributable to Hyatt, no policy was obtained. Thus the vehicle was not insured, a fact of which K &amp; D was unaware until three weeks after the accident. 356 Md. at 642-43, 741 A.2d 1099. Jones then sued the driver and K &amp; D for negligence and, eventually, obtained a judgment against K &amp; D. On that same day, K &amp; D assigned to Jones its cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>of action against Hyatt for the agency\u2019s failure to obtain the policy. Shortly thereafter, but more than four years after the accident occurred, Jones and his spouse filed suit against Hyatt in which they eventually asserted claims that Jones was a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between K <em>&amp; </em>D and Hyatt to obtain insurance and that Hyatt was liable to Jones in negligence for its failure to provide a policy. <em>Id </em>at 644, 741 A.2d 1099. The Joneses prevailed in the circuit court but this Court reversed the judgment on the basis that the statute of limitations on the Joneses\u2019 third-party beneficiary claim expired before the action was brought. <em>Id. </em>at 646, 741 A.2d 1099. The Joneses filed a petition for certiorari and Hyatt a cross-petition. The Court granted both. Of the various issues presented to it, the Court addressed only two: first, it held that the statute of limitations for breach of a contract to supply insurance begins to run when the plaintiff learns that no insurance has been secured, <em>id. </em>at 651, 741 A.2d 1099, and second, that Hyatt owed no tort duty directly to the Joneses. <em>Id. </em>at 653, 741 A.2d 1099. We now turn to the portion of the opinion relied upon by the <em>Miller v. Pac. Shore Funding </em>Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">In a footnote\u2014which was cited by the District Court as its authority for the proposition that the assignee of a note was liable for the assignor\u2019s violations of the SMLL\u2014the Court of Appeals discussed, <em>in dicta, </em>the Joneses\u2019 claim against Hyatt based on Jones\u2019 status as an assignee of Hyatt\u2019s negligence action against the agency. <em>Id. </em>at 653 n. 8, 741 A.2d 1099. We set out the footnote in full (emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">In their certiorari petition, the Joneses did not raise the issue of when the statute of limitations began to run on their cause of action as <em>assignees </em>of K &amp; D. As the trial court correctly held, however, any negligence action, which K &amp; D might have had, accrued when K &amp; D first sustained harm as a result of Hyatt\u2019s alleged breach of tort duty, i.e., when K &amp; D learned that, because it had no insurance coverage, it had to pay for the property damage to its own vehicle, reimburse Allstate for the damage to Mr. Jones\u2019s car, and defend itself against the Joneses\u2019 personal injury causes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>action. As assignees, the Joneses were bound to the same limitations period as their assignor, K &amp; D. <em>See, e.g., James v. Goldberg, </em>256 Md. 520, 527 [261 A.2d 753] (1970) (an assignment \u201cdoes not confer upon the assignee any greater right than the right possessed by the assignor\u201d); <em>Webb v. Balto. Commercial Bank, </em>181 Md. 572, 580 [31 A.2d 174] (1943) (an assignee is \u201csubject to all defenses against [the assignor\u2019s] claim, for obviously, the rights of the assignee are no greater than those of his assignor * * * the statute of limitations ... applied\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The Court\u2019s analysis in this passage is limited to whether an assignee is bound by defenses that could be asserted against the assignor when the assignee attempts to enforce or collect upon the chose in action that was assigned. The Court answered the question affirmatively. Consistent with this principle, when the chose assigned is a promissory note, CL \u00a7 3-306 makes it clear that an assignee is also subject to an action for rescission. However, as the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 64, 972 A.2d 864, an action seeking damages for violations of the SMLL is not an attempt to enforce or rescind a note. <em>Hyatt </em>does not support the notion that an assignee is liable for violations of the SMLL committed by the lender and, as we explained <em>supra, </em>the law in Maryland is clearly to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In granting summary judgment, the circuit court also relied upon <em>P/T Ltd. v. Friendly Mobile Manor, </em>79 Md.App. 227, 556 A.2d 694 (1989). In <em>P/T Ltd., </em>the assignee accepted assignment of a contract involving the purchase and sale of a mobile home park and certain mobile home units. 79 Md.App. at 229, 556 A.2d 694. In so doing, the assignee made it clear that he would assume no liability for certain outstanding debts owed by the assignor, and, in fact, refused to accept the bill of sale with such a provision included. <em>Id. </em>at 231-32, 556 A.2d 694. After surveying relevant Maryland law and scholarly authority, this Court explained that \u201can assignee must expressly assume any correlative duties with the rights assigned in order to be liable for such duties under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>contract.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 234, 556 A.2d 694. <em>See Pumphrey v. Kehoe, </em>261 Md. 496, 506, 276 A.2d 194 (1971) (stating that \u201cour predecessors have held that it is required that the assignee must <em>expressly assume </em>these duties, there being no implication of assumption by the mere assignment\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>East Vedado Corp. v. E.S. Adkins &amp; Co., </em>157 Md. 416, 418-19, 146 A. 385 (1929) (\u201cThe authorities hold, \u2018that liability of this kind can result only from some express or implied contract of the assignee, and that it will not be implied from the mere assignment of the original contract even though followed by possession of the land.\u2019 \u2019\u2019(citations omitted)). Applying the above standard, this Court determined that the assignee did not assume the assignor\u2019s obligations under the contract merely by reason of the contract\u2019s assignment, especially in light of the assignee\u2019s express refusal to accept said obligations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The Thompkinses assert that the facts in <em>P/T Ltd. </em>are distinguishable from the facts in the present case. They are correct but the factual distinctions are immaterial to our analysis. In reaching our decision in <em>P/T Ltd., </em>we articulated the following generally applicable principle of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">Under the common law, by the great weight of authority, the assignee of rights, benefits, or privileges under a contract did not become responsible for the assignor\u2019s duties unless he expressly assumed performance of those duties. In other words, in the absence of an express manifestation of intention to accept the assignor\u2019s duties along with his rights and benefits, the assignee is presumed not to assume those duties, and they remain the obligation of the assignor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>79 Md.App. at 238, 556 A.2d 694. <em>See also Homa v. Friendly Mobile Manor, </em>93 Md.App. 337, 353, 612 A.2d 322 (1992) (\u201cTo be liable for duties under contract, the assignee must have assumed liability expressly.\u201d). <em>P/T Ltd. </em>remains a correct statement of the law. To be sure, the common law rules articulated in <em>P/T Ltd. </em>have been modified by the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code but, as we have explained, the UCC provides no assistance to the Thompkinses in their action against Mountaineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Applying these principles to the facts at hand, the relevant question becomes whether the assignee expressly assumed the liabilities of the assignor. Here, the Thompkinses have pled no facts indicating that Mountaineer expressly assumed liability for any of the alleged violations; and, with no other authority in either the statutory or case law to support their contention that the assignee is derivatively liable for the lender\u2019s alleged SMLL violations, the Thompkinses\u2019 attempt to place liability on Mountaineer must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Accordingly, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Mountaineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY IS AFFIRMED. APPELLANTS TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-11\">. The Thompkinses frame the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-12\">1.
