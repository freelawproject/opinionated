During trial, appellant informed the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of his purported waiver of jury unanimity when the jury indicated that it failed to reach a unanimous decision. Appellant was convicted of first degree murder by an eleven-to-one vote and unanimously convicted of carrying a dangerous weapon openly with the intent to injure. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, Repl.Vol.2012), \u00a7 2-201(a) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d) (first degree murder);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> C.L. \u00a7 4-101(e)(2) (carrying a dangerous weapon openly with the intent to injure).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>the sentencing hearing, the court imposed sentences of life imprisonment, suspending all but twenty-five years for first degree murder and three concurrent years for carrying a dangerous weapon openly with the intent to injure. Appellant noted an appeal, and presents three questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">1. Was Mr. Clayborne\u2019s waiver of his right to a unanimous verdict knowing and voluntary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it permitted testimony that one of the State\u2019s key witnesses had expressed concerns about her safety?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">3. Under the law of the case doctrine, was the evidence insufficient to sustain Mr. Clayborne\u2019s conviction for openly carrying a dangerous weapon?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">For the reasons that follow, we (1) answer the first question in the affirmative; (2) answer the second question in the negative; and (3) decline to rule on the third question. We affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">The underlying material facts of this case are not in dispute. The State provided critical circumstantial evidence to support its theory that Mr. Clayborne committed first degree murder. Mr. Clayborne raises no challenge to the sufficiency of the murder conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the focus of this review is the waiver of appellant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>abuse of discretion issue, we present an overview of the trial\u2019s history for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">On April 3, 2009, at approximately 2:13 a.m., a police officer responded to 433 Watty Court in Baltimore, Maryland for a report of a fatal stabbing. The officer discovered Mr. Thompson lying on his back in the doorway of his home, suffering from an apparent stab wound to his back.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following a police investigation, appellant was indicted on charges of first degree murder and two related weapons offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">A trial occurred between January 11 through January 19, 2011, where the State called several witnesses to establish its <em>prima facie </em>case. Valerie Leak (\u201cMs.Leak\u201d), a resident of the McCulloh Homes neighborhood, which was approximately one block from 433 Watty Court, testified that at approximately 2:00 a.m. or 2:30 a.m. on April 3, 2009, appellant<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Mr. Thompson were arguing on her lawn, when she told them to \u201cget the hell away from in front of my door with all that noise.\u201d Mr. Thompson removed a switchblade from his possession and swung it in appellant\u2019s direction. After this commotion, Mr. Thompson placed the blade into his pocket and walked towards his home. Ms. Leak further stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>appellant entered her home, grabbed a knife from her kitchen drawer, and proceeded outdoors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Appellant returned to Ms. Leak\u2019s home about six or seven minutes later, displayed the knife, which was covered in blood, and stated, \u201c[t]his is what I do if somebody messes with me.\u201d Appellant retrieved his jacket from Ms. Leak\u2019s home, and never returned her knife. The police arrived and transported her to the Baltimore City Homicide Unit, where she was interviewed and identified appellant\u2019s picture from a photo array of possible suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Angela Gibbs (\u201cMs.Gibbs\u201d) testified that she was good friends with Mr. Thompson, and had known him and Ms. Leak for approximately one to two years. She was also friends with appellant, but had only known him for two months. However, she noted that he occasionally visited her home. Ms. Gibbs was in the neighborhood on the night in question, seeking to partake in a drug transaction. As she neared Ms. Leak\u2019s house, she observed Ms. Leak engaged in a dispute with a man. She noticed Ella Gregg (\u201cMs.Gregg\u201d), Mr. Thompson\u2019s girlfriend, \u201cbanging on [Ms. Leak\u2019s] door asking [Ms. Leak], what\u2019s going on? Who was that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Ms. Gibbs admitted that she had previously indicated to the police that she witnessed the murder of Mr. Thompson, but stated in court that she had not \u201cwitness[ed] that exactly,\u201d and was under the influence of drugs at the time. She explained that subsequent to Mr. Thompson\u2019s murder, she had been arrested and that the police indicated to her that if she possessed information \u201cabout a murder or anything\u201d that she could be released from jail. She was then interviewed by Detectives Aaron Pittman (\u201cDet.Pittman\u201d) and Art Brummer (\u201cDet.Brummer\u201d) on May 14, 2009, and she stated the following:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>[DET. PITTMAN]: Ok it was brought to our attention that you had information regarding the uh incident that took place on Walley [sic][C]ourt[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">[MS. GIBBS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">[DET. PITTMAN]: Ok, ok ma\u2019am can you explain for if anything that you saw or witnessed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">[MS. GIBBS]: We was all sitting at the table getting highf.] Zack came in threw two pills on the table, Bishop picked them up and Zack said \u201cman put, put my shit down,\u201d he put it down. Bishop said \u201cman you don\u2019t have to come at me like that.\u201d Zack said \u201cif you want to purchase something you just tell me and I\u2019ll go back and get it, but put those down[.]\u201d [U]h, they got to arguing, and as they got to arguing!,] uh[,] Zack turned around and go [sic] out the door and Zack went out the door[.] Peachesr[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] gave Bishop the knife, Bishop stabbed Zack in the back, [and] he stabbed Zack, uh, Bishop was stumbling towards his house. A[sic] he was stumbling towards his house[,] he fell again and Bishop had hit him again in his back, he was banging on the door front. Manny, Manny never respond [sic], but his girl did and she told Bishop \u201cyou had killed my man,\u201d but by then we don\u2019t [sic] know if, if Zack was dead or not. We don\u2019t [sic] think he was. Came [sic] the paramedics came and she stand [sic] out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">During trial, Ms. Gibbs noted that she falsified information regarding witnessing the murder because she believed that she would be released from jail.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> She clarified that while Dets. Pittman and Brummer interviewed her, she was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>promised anything in exchange for her information concerning Mr. Thompson\u2019s murder, and that she never received any personal benefit from her participation in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In light of the inconsistencies between Ms. Gibbs\u2019 testimony and her statements to the police, the State, over objection, questioned Ms. Gibbs regarding her concern about being a witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Ms. Gibbs, isn\u2019t it true that in the meeting on July 1, 2009 you expressed concerns for your safety if you were a witness in this case? I need you to answer yes or no[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">[MS. GIBBS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And isn\u2019t it true, Ms. Gibbs, that during that meeting on July 1, 2009, based on those same concerns you specifically requested a referral to the Victim Witness Assistance Unit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">[MS. GIBBS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">The State also presented testimony of Ms. Gregg. She testified that she was Mr. Thompson\u2019s girlfriend, and that they resided in the same household. On the night in question, Ms. Gregg found Mr. Thompson lying unresponsive on the floor. She proceeded to the door and observed a man walking away from her home with a shiny object in his hand. She then scanned the neighborhood and noticed the same man standing in front of Ms. Leak\u2019s house. However, when she spotted him, he ran. Ms. Leak indicated that the man\u2019s name was \u201cBishop.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">Appellant was arrested on April 17, 2009, and acknowledged that his nickname was \u201cBishop.\u201d He explained to the police that he had a verbal disagreement with Mr. Thompson over a drug transaction involving the purchase of some \u201cready.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Appellant told police, however, that the disagreement occurred early in the day and recited his alibi to the police.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Appellant stated that he socialized with others throughout the day, but refused to identify them.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Jocelyn Carlson, a forensic examiner, testified that in analyzing Mr. Thompson\u2019s fingernail clippings, she found that they yielded a DNA profile consistent with a mixture of Mr. Thompson\u2019s and appellant\u2019s DNA. She further indicated that the chances that an unrelated individual in the African American population could have been a contributor to that mixture was approximately one in 34.2 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s counsel motioned for judgment of acquittal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, I\u2019ll\u2014as to count one I\u2019ll submit. As to counts two and three, the only direct testimony we have regarding a deadly weapon in either case is from Ms. Leak and Ms. Gregg. Actually I guess Ms. Gibbs also testifies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">I know that\u2019s an issue of credibility, which therefore is in the province of the jury but I would proffer to the Court simply that, particularly Ms. Gibbs, the credibility is so suspect that I believe it should not get to the jury and other than that, Your Honor, I\u2019ll submit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">The court denied appellant\u2019s motion regarding the counts for murder and for carrying a dangerous weapon with the intent to injure, finding that ample evidence existed through which the jury could find the elements of those offenses. During the close of the defense\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s counsel renewed his motions for judgment of acquittal concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>remaining counts. The motions were again denied by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">On January 14, 2011, before 3:00 p.m., the jury began its deliberations. Later, after failing to reach a unanimous decision, and with agreement of the parties, the jury was released for the three-day weekend and resumed deliberations on the following Tuesday. On January 18, 2011, after several hours of deliberations, the trial judge received a note from the jury, which read, \u201c[w]e respectively cannot reach a unanimous decision on the counts.\u201d After a discussion with the parties, the court issued the pattern \u201cduty to deliberate\u201d instruction to the jury,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">THE COURT: ... You have the option of breaking now, if you wish to, until tomorrow, or you can go further this evening and then break later on. I just wanted to make sure that you know that you have that option, of either breaking now or deliberating further today and breaking again, if you wish to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">While the jury attempted to make a decision regarding its continuation, the trial judge made the following statement to the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">THE COURT: Counsel, I need to give you one other piece of information. When the jury foreperson came down and gave the note that I read to my law clerk, she also said that the vote was 11 to one and while I would not encourage jurors to disclose the vote, the foreperson apparently did that voluntarily and you need to know any communication that came from the jury as well. All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">When the proceedings resumed, appellant requested to waive his right to a unanimous verdict and to accept the majority verdict of the jury. During a brief recess, the parties and the court researched the legality of such a waiver. The court announced that its research indicated that a defendant could in fact waive his or her right to a unanimous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>verdict when the parties and the court agreed to permit the waiver. Though appellant reiterated his request for waiver, the State was unwilling to acquiesce at that time, and the jury was released and set to reconvene the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">During the commencement of the proceedings on January 19, 2011, both parties informed the court that they would consent to a waiver of appellant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict. The following colloquy, regarding appellant\u2019s waiver, occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVy\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... Mr. Clayborne, you and I have discussed this step you wish to take here, right? That\u2019s what I\u2019m calling you consenting or agreeing to allow the Judge to accept a majority verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And what\u2014and that\u2019s not a unanimous verdict. You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKO\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And do you know what a unanimous verdict is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Just in case and so that the record is clear, a unanimous verdict means that all 12 of the jurors have to decide, either one way or another beyond a reasonable doubt that you\u2019re guilty or not guilty, based on the evidence that they received. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And that\u2019s your absolute Constitutional Right to have a unanimous verdict by a jury of your peers. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-13\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And I had told you that-well, you\u2019ve heard that the jury is right now saying that they are deadlocked and can\u2019t reach a unanimous verdict. As a matter of fact, we now know that they are 11 to one. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s guilty or not guilty but they are split along the lines of 11 to one; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And I have advised you that I believe we\u2019re on the path to a hung jury. In other words, that they can\u2019t reach a unanimous verdict and there will come a time if it stays that way and this one person doesn\u2019t change their mind, that His Honor will decide that they\u2019ve deliberated long enough and declare the jury hung, meaning a mistrial will be declared and this case\u2014for today, this jury trial will be over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">Now, the State has the absolute right to try the case again for as many times as they wish to but there may be a hung jury in this case. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now, and you understand that I have advised you to wait for a unanimous verdict; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Now, understanding what your right to a unanimous jury verdict is; do you wish to waive that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And\u2014I don\u2019t know how far Your Honor wishes me to go. Are you thinking with a clear head here today, Mr. Clayborne?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-13\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Are you under the influence of any drugs or alcohol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-15\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-16\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Is there any questions you wish to ask me on or off the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWA\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-17\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And as a matter of fact, just to continue to make the record clear, you have\u2014your largest or biggest concern was if you agree, which you are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>agreeing to accept this majority verdict, your biggest concern is if it\u2019s a guilty verdict, you\u2019re worried that you can still appeal this case; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And I have explained to you that yes, you can. You have an automatic and absolute right of appeal, but that\u2019s why His Honor is making the record clear here today that you\u2019re waiving your right to that unanimous verdict and it\u2019s unlikely you would be able to win a reversal on the fact that the Court accepted a non-unanimous verdict. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJj\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Your Honor, if you wish me to make further inquiry, I will or I turn him over to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">THE COURT: All right. Mr. Clayborne, I want to ask you a few questions myself just to make sure that I\u2019m satisfied. Have you been treated for any mental illness or any mental problem in the last five years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">THE COURT: All right. You\u2019re not on any medication now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-11\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-12\">THE COURT: And you feel that you\u2019re thinking clearly today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-13\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-14\">THE COURT: All right. Now, [appellant\u2019s counsel] has already explained to you very well what it is that you\u2019re giving up. You understand you will have the right to appeal, but it is very unlikely if I find that you are proceeding voluntarily with waiving the unanimous jury that you would be able to appeal on that ground. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-15\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-16\">THE COURT: Now, I will be very frank with you. I believe and no one can predict this, but I believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>jury is weighted toward convicting you and I believe that by doing this, you are going to get a conviction of at least some counts in this case. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJI\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">THE COURT: All right. So, you\u2019re taking\u2014you realize that you\u2019re taking the chance that the 11 to one might be in your favor or it might be against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">THE COURT: And because you have the right to insist on a unanimous verdict as [appellant\u2019s counsel] has already told you, if even that one juror were holding out to find you not guilty, that would result in no verdict in this case and a retrial of the case. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlA\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">THE COURT: Are you proceeding because of\u2014with this waiver because you simply don\u2019t want to be held in jail any longer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">[APPELLANT]: No, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s\u2014I just have strong beliefs in the jury right now as far as\u2014you know what I mean? And I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">THE COURT: So, you think that the jury is heading towards acquittal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-11\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-12\">THE COURT: All right. And you wish to take that chance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-13\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-14\">THE COURT: And you understand you\u2019re giving up the possibility that it would be a hung jury and risking the chance that it will be a conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-15\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-16\">THE COURT: And you realize that on a conviction in this case, you face a substantial amount of incarceration? [APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-17\">THE COURT: All right. Do you have any other questions for me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>[APPELLANT]: For example, like the hung jury, how long would it actually take if it was a hung jury to get back into trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">THE COURT: To get back for retrial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">[APPELLANT]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">THE COURT: Your case would be sent back to postponement court. The court would have to schedule a new trial date. I can\u2019t predict that exactly, but I would guess that it\u2019s going to be at least a matter of months, if not closer to a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">[APPELLANT]: Okay. That\u2019s long.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">THE COURT: Any other questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">THE COURT: [Appellant\u2019s counsel], anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhW\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, simply that he had made that inquiry of me also about the length of time if there was a retrial and I indicated\u2014I didn\u2019t say a year. I said it was out of my hands and it would be up to the Administrative Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">A large factor would be my ordering of the transcript and how long it took to compile that and get it into my hands, because that would be a necessary part in the retrial. But, we did discuss that matter and I believe it was answered satisfactorily and no, Your Honor. Other than that, I have no further inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-13\">THE COURT: All right. Mr. Clayborne, this is how you wish to proceed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-14\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-15\">THE COURT: And this is your free and voluntary act in choosing to waive your right to a unanimous verdict? [APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-16\">THE COURT: All right. I find on the record, based on Mr. Clayborne\u2019s responses that he is proceeding freely and voluntarily with the waiver of his right to unanimous verdict in this case. Let\u2019s bring the jury down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Appellant was convicted of first degree murder by majority verdict wherein eleven jurors found him guilty, and one juror found him not guilty. All twelve jurors found appellant guilty of carrying a dangerous weapon with the intent to injure. On March 30, 2011, the court imposed sentences of life imprisonment, suspending all but twenty-five years for first degree murder and three years concurrent for the weapons offense. Thereafter, appellant noted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Additional facts will be provided as they bear on the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">(A) Appellant\u2019s Waiver Was Knowing, Intelligent, and Voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Appellant preliminarily asserts that his waiver of a unanimous verdict was neither competently nor intelligently rendered for two reasons. First, appellant contends that he was misled by his counsel\u2019s statement that if the jury were \u201chung,\u201d that \u201cthe State ha[d] the absolute right to try the case again for as many times as they wish[ed].\u201d Stated differently, he attests that the impression given by counsel\u2019s statement leads to an erroneous conclusion that the State could repeatedly try him until he was convicted. Second, appellant additionally argues that his waiver was not knowing because he was not informed by the court whether the eleven jurors were favoring conviction or acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">Conversely, the State asserts that when the record is \u201cviewed in its totality,\u201d appellant\u2019s waiver was competently and intelligently made, and that \u201cthe vote of eleven jurors to convict him of first-degree murder should be affirmed.\u201d We find the State\u2019s argument more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">To be sure, Maryland generally adheres to the common law system of trial by jury of twelve persons who must unanimously agree on a verdict. <em>State v. Gorman, </em>315 Md. 402, 405, 554 A.2d 1203 (1989) (citing Maryland Rules 4-311(b)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>327(a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>, and <em>State v.

Oregon, </em>406 U.S. 404, 406, 410-12, 92 S.Ct. 1628, 32 L.Ed.2d 184 (1972) (holding that a state law providing that criminal defendants could be convicted by a nonunanimous verdict, as long as ten members of the jury agreed, did not violate the Sixth Amendment applicable to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution); <em>Johnson v. Louisiana, </em>406 U.S. 366, 368-69, 92 S.Ct. 1635, 32 L.Ed.2d 162 (1972) (Powell, J., concurring), <em>discussed in McKay, </em>280 Md. at 565-66, 375 A.2d 228. As a consequence, neither the Sixth Amendment nor the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution are abridged when the defendant does consent and waives his or her right to a unanimous verdict. <em>McKay, </em>280 Md. at 566, 375 A.2d 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>In addition, the Court of Appeals had explicitly concluded that \u201c[t]here is no historical support ... for an interpretation of Article 21 that would make jury unanimity an imperative requirement as opposed to a right which can be waived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 375 A.2d 228. Like other constitutional rights, it exists for the primary benefit of the criminal defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 375 A.2d 228. <em>Accord Allen v.

Thus, a defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdietalthough a fundamental constitutional right\u2014may be duly waived by the express consent of the defendant, the State, and the court. <em>See McKay, </em>280 Md. at 567, 375 A.2d 228 (relying on <em>Patton v.

Because arguments of \u201c[i]gnorance, incomprehension, coercion, terror, inducements, [and] subtle or blatant threats might be a perfect cover-up of unconstitutionally,\u201d <em>Boykin, </em>395 U.S. at 242-43, 89 S.Ct. 1709, we turn to the previously established authority of the Court of Appeals and this Court. We find the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>State v. McKay, </em>280 Md. 558, 375 A.2d 228 (1977), and this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Allen v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 537, 551 A.2d 156 (1989), instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In the watershed case of <em>State v. McKay, </em>the defendant, McKay, had been charged with armed robbery and seven related offenses. 280 Md. at 559, 375 A.2d 228. At the conclusion of the McKay\u2019s trial, the charges to which the trial court did not grant him a judgment of acquittal were submitted to the jury for deliberation. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>After the jury had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>deliberated for \u201capproximately one hour,\u201d the jury\u2019s forelady proceeded to announce that the jury had found appellee not guilty under the first count of armed robbery, but \u201ccould not come to a unanimous decision\u201d as to the third count of robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 559-60, 375 A.2d 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Following the court\u2019s admonishment to the jury that it must make a unanimous decision, the jury resumed deliberations. <em>Id. </em>at 560, 375 A.2d 228. Those deliberations, however, were ephemeral, as the jury returned to the court ninety minutes later, \u201cstill unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the third count.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a consequence, McKay\u2019s counsel informed the court that he would be willing to accept a majority vote on the third count. <em>Id. </em>In response, the trial court reminded McKay that he had a constitutional right to \u201cinsist upon a unanimous vote\u201d or, \u201calternatively,\u201d a right to retrial. <em>Id. </em>Uncertain of the court\u2019s advisement, McKay asked the court to clarify, at which the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">DEFENDANT MCKAY: What will that mean, I\u2019ll have to be <em>tried again </em>[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">DEFENDANT MCKAY: The <em>whole trial </em>[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">[MCKAY\u2019S COUNSEL]: The <em>whole trial.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">DEFENDANT MCKAY: We\u2019ll take what\u2019s up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">[MCKAY\u2019S COUNSEL]: You will take what the majority is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-12\">DEFENDANT MCKAY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 561 n. 2, 375 A.2d 228 (emphasis in original). After being further cautioned that McKay maintained the \u201cabsolute right under the law to have the <em>whole trial </em>tried <em>all </em>over again,\u201d McKay, again, informed the court that he would accept a majority verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 561, 375 A.2d 228. The jury returned, \u201cand the forelady announced that the appellee had been found not guilty under counts one and eight, but nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>jurors had voted \u2018guilty\u2019 as to count three and three had voted \u2018not guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>McKay subsequently appealed his conviction to this Court, which held that unanimity could not be waived and we therefore reversed his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 559, 561, 375 A.2d 228 (citing <em>McKay v. State, </em>32 Md.App. 451, 462-63, 362 A.2d 666 (1976)). As a result, State petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The Court of Appeals granted certiorari to determine whether waiver of a defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict was prohibited by the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>Id. </em>at 559, 375 A.2d 228. Disagreeing with this Court\u2019s reasoning, the Court of Appeals held that a defendant may waive unanimity of verdict \u201cprovided not only that the court and prosecution consent, but also that the waiver by the defendant conforms strictly with applicable constitutional standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 375 A.2d 228. Nonetheless, the High Court concluded that McKay\u2019s waiver was invalid because of his obvious misunderstanding of his rights on retrial. <em>Id. </em>at 573-74, 375 A.2d 228. Specifically, it noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">[McKay\u2019s] paramount concern was apparent from the colloquy with the court: whether a mistrial for lack of unanimity on the third count would mean a new trial not only on that count, but also on the first and eighth, and possibly even on those which had been the subject of judgment of acquittal. This was evident from his repeated questions concerning the \u201cwhole trial.\u201d Not only did the court remain silent when defense counsel advised his client that a retrial would mean \u201cthe whole trial,\u201d but the court itself informed [McKay] that he had \u201can absolute right under the law to have the whole trial tried all over again\u201d and asked him whether he wished to accept \u201ca majority vote\u201d on count three or \u201chave the case retried?\u201d Only then did appellee reply that he would \u201ctake the majority vote.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">Given what we regard as a clearcut understanding on the part of [McKay] that a mistrial for lack of unanimity on the third count would have meant, at the very least, a retrial on counts one and eight as well, even though the jury had found him not guilty of those charges, his decision to accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>a majority verdict on the third count was hardly surprising. His consent, however, did not amount to an intelligent and competent waiver, since it rested on a grossly inaccurate premise. That he could not be retried on the charges of which he had been acquitted, without being placed in double jeopardy, was settled in <em>Pugh v. State, </em>271 Md. 701, 706-707, 319 A.2d 542 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"><em>McKay, </em>280 Md. at 572-74, 375 A.2d 228. As a consequence, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of this Court and concluded that \u201c[n]o consent founded on such defective grounds can amount to an intelligent and competent waiver of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 375 A.2d 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Twelve years after the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>McKay, </em>this Court, in <em>Allen v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 537, 539, 544-46, 551 A.2d 156 (1989), reversed an accused\u2019s criminal conviction based on a majority vote of eleven to one and determined that the trial court had erred in the procedures used in connection with an accused\u2019s agreement to accept a majority verdict. There, we noted, however, that it was \u201cquite clear\u201d from the record that the defendant, Allen, \u201cunderstood the implication of a waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 551 A.2d 156. Alternatively, we concluded that the trial court\u2019s failure to inform Allen of the full contents of a jury communication pursuant to Md. Rule 4-326(d)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (then, Md. Rule 4-326(c))\u2014which would have informed Allen that the sole juror precluding unanimity was preventing the jury from reaching a unanimous verdict of guilty<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>\u2014had rendered his waiver unintelligent and unknow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>ing. <em>Id. </em>at 545-46, 551 A.2d 156.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Following our conclusion that Allen\u2019s waiver failed to satisfy constitutional standards and, therefore, required reversal, we \u201cfelt compelled\u201d to address another \u201ctroubling aspect\u201d of Allen\u2019s waiver: \u201cthe fact that the trial judge initiated the waiver by suggesting to appellant, via defense counsel, that he might consider going with a majority verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47, 551 A.2d 156. Expressing grave concern about the potential for coercion where the trial judge suggests acceptance of a majority verdict, we determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">... we [could] think of no circumstances where it is appropriate for a trial judge to suggest a waiver. It should be remembered that, in the instant case, the trial judge was the <em>only </em>person (with the exception of the jury) who knew that the 11 members of the jury had voted to convict [the defendant]. Thus, the trial judge knew <em>when </em>he made the suggestion to [the defendant], that if [the defendant] agreed he would be convicted. As the instant case illustrates, such a suggestion can place a reviewing court in the uncomfortable position of wondering whether the trial judge was truly impartial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 549, 551 A.2d 156 (emphasis in original). Therefore, we concluded that the trial judge\u2019s suggestion amounted to a \u201csubtle form of coercion,\u201d and that \u201cthe safe practice ... is for trial judges to refrain from making such suggestions.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As a result, we reversed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 551, 551 A.2d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The circumstances present in <em>McKay </em>or <em>Allen, </em>however, are inapposite to the case at bar. In the instant case, appellant, against the advice of counsel, express his wish to waive his right to a unanimous verdict and accept the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>verdict. As a consequence, appellant\u2019s counsel and the trial court engaged in an extensive waiver inquiry with appellant. The waiver inquiry included questions relating to appellant\u2019s capacity to make a voluntary decision and ruled out the possibility of drugs, alcohol, and mental illness or impairment. To ensure appellant\u2019s understanding of his selection, his counsel not only advised appellant regarding the meaning of an unanimous verdict, he further informed appellant of his constitutional right to that unanimous verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Just in case and so that the record is clear, a unanimous verdict means that all 12 of the jurors have to decide, either one way or another beyond a reasonable doubt that you\u2019re guilty or not guilty, based on the evidence that they received. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And that\u2019s your absolute Constitutional Right to have a unanimous verdict by a jury of your peers. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">All of the jury\u2019s communications to the court were properly disclosed to the parties, including the communication which prompted appellant to request a majority verdict. Even though the jury\u2019s communication did not indicate the nature of the eleven to one split, the judge explicitly cautioned appellant of the court\u2019s belief that the majority likely favored appellant\u2019s conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">THE COURT: Now, I will be very frank with you. I believe and no one can predict this, but I believe that the jury is weighted toward convicting you and I believe that by doing this, you are going to get a conviction of at least some counts in this case. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag-\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-11\">THE COURT: All right. So, you\u2019re taking\u2014you realize that you\u2019re taking the chance that the 11 to one might be in your favor or it might be against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-12\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>After appellant\u2019s counsel further noted on the record his disapproval of his client\u2019s selection and advised appellant against the requested waiver, the trial court additionally cautioned appellant of the risk involved in making such a selection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now, and you understand that I have advised you to wait for a unanimous verdict; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">THE COURT: And you understand you\u2019re giving up the possibility that it would be a hung jury and risking the chance that it will be a conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">THE COURT: And you realize that on a conviction in this case, you face a substantial amount of incarceration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APB\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Notwithstanding the advisement by both the court and counsel that accepting a majority verdict could lead to a conviction by less than a unanimous jury and that such a conviction would result in a substantial period of incarceration, appellant\u2019s concern regarding the possibility of a hung jury was the length of time that would lapse between the court\u2019s finding of a mistrial and his retrial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-10\">[APPELLANT]: For example, like the hung jury, how long would it actually take if it was a hung jury to get back to trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-11\">THE COURT: To get back for retrial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-12\">[APPELLANT]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-13\">THE COURT: Your case would be sent back to postponement court. The court would have to schedule a new trial date. I can\u2019t predict that exactly, but I would guess that it\u2019s going to be at least a matter of months, if not closer to a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-14\">[APPELLANT]: Okay. That\u2019s long.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Appellant never suggested that he was concerned with the length of time he would remain incarcerated if he had been acquitted. In fact, appellant informed the court that he wished to waive his right to a unanimous verdict, and, alternatively opt for a majority verdict, because he believed the jury was headed toward an acquittal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">THE COURT: Are you proceeding because of\u2014with this waiver because you simply don\u2019t want to be held in jail any longer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">[APPELLANT]: No, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s\u2014I just have strong beliefs in the jury right now as far as\u2014you know what I mean? And I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">THE COURT: So, you think that the jury is heading toward acquittal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-8\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">THE COURT: All right. And you wish to take that chance?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Thus, his dialogue with the court demonstrated an understanding that an acquittal would not result in a retrial of the same criminal charges. Appellant clearly understood that an acquittal would bar the State from retrying the case, otherwise he would not have had any incentive to accept a majority verdict in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">A review of the record leads to the conclusion that appellant\u2019s choice to waive his right to a unanimous verdict was based solely on his opposition to a lengthy delay prior to his retrial in the event of a hung jury and prior to any right to appeal should retrial result in a conviction. Indeed, appellant\u2019s only concern if the majority verdict resulted in a conviction was whether he maintained an absolute right to appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATA\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And as a matter of fact, just to continue to make the record clear, you have\u2014your largest or biggest concern was if you agree, which you are agreeing to accept this majority verdict, your biggest concern is if it\u2019s a guilty verdict, you\u2019re worried that you can still appeal this case; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Out of an abundance of caution, his counsel further advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And I have explained to you that yes, you can. You have an automatic and absolute right of appeal, but that\u2019s why His Honor is making the record clear here today that you\u2019re waiving your right to that unanimous verdict and it\u2019s unlikely you would be able to win a reversal on the fact that the Court accepted a non-unanimous verdict. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Despite counsel for appellant\u2019s advisements, the court\u2019s cautionary explanation, and the appellant\u2019s clear understanding of the risks involved; the appellant still chose to place his faith in the jury\u2019s decision. Therefore, appellant\u2019s elimination of a hung jury provided appellant what he desired: avoidance of an unwanted delay to any potential appellate review in the event that he was convicted rather than acquitted. Accordingly, we conclude that appellant competently and intelligently accepted a majority verdict; and, thus, appellant\u2019s waiver to a unanimous verdict was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">(B) The Trial Court Properly Exercised Its Discretion When It Permitted Testimony That One of the State\u2019s Key Witnesses Had Expressed Concerns About Her Safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Appellant next asserts that the trial court erred by admitting evidence that the State\u2019s witness, Ms. Gibbs, was concerned for her safety. Specifically, he insists that Ms. Gibbs\u2019 testimony was unduly prejudicial because it was unclear whether appellant was, in fact, responsible for her fear and because the trial court \u201cnever instructed the jury that evidence of Ms. Gibbs\u2019 fear was admissible only for the limited purpose of judging her credibility.\u201d In response, the State contends that the trial court properly exercised its discretion on the issue, \u201cand, in any event, [appellant\u2019s] complaint that the evidence was admitted without a limited instruction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>waived when his trial counsel objected to a limiting instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Less than a month after Mr. Thompson was killed, Ms. Gibbs informed police that she heard appellant and Mr. Thompson arguing over drugs and that she had witnessed appellant murder Mr. Thompson. At trial, however, she stated that she had not \u201cwitness[ed] that exactly,\u201d and was under the influence of drugs at the time. As a result, appellant\u2019s trial counsel sought to establish that her pretrial statement identifying appellant as the offender\u2014which Ms. Gibbs renounced at trial\u2014was induced by a promise to get her out of jail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... After you spoke to Detective Pittman and he recorded your statement that you have just said that you made up, the case that you were arrested for that you said was false didn\u2019t that case go away and you got out of jail, that\u2019s why you\u2019re here today on the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">[MS. GIBBS]: So I can only answer yes or no and not tell my\u2014yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">[MS. GIBBS]: It\u2019s true but that\u2019s not how it exactly went. [APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, you spoke to Detective Pittman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">[MS. GIBBS]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-10\">[APPELLANT]: Then you went back to jail. Then you spoke to the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney and Detective Pittman and now you\u2019re on the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">[MS. GIBBS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">During the State\u2019s redirect examination of Ms. Gibbs, the prosecutor approached the bench and stated her intent to elicit testimony that, during the meeting between Ms. Gibbs and Detective Pittman, Ms. Gibbs had expressed concerns for her safety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-13\">[THE STATE]: I\u2019m approaching in an abundance of caution in light of the fact that Defense specifically made a point of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>asking her about her meeting with myself and Detective Pittman, my intention is to next ask when she met on July l[st], 2009 she expressed any concerns regarding being a witness in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\">THE COURT: I\u2019m sorry. Concerns what? About what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjP\">[THE STATE]: About being a witness in this case and she did. She actually referred to a specific threat that her daughter received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">I am not going to ask for the specifics of that but my intention is to ask if at the time she expressed any concerns with respect to being a witness in this case and whether or not she asked for a referral to our Victim Witness Assistance Unit. I anticipate that her answers\u2014they should be yes and yes. I have no idea what she is going to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1s\">THE COURT: Is that interview on record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">[THE STATE]: This interview was not recorded. It was conducted in the presence of Detective Pittman so if she denies it I will be seeking to ask Detective Pittman those generalized questions. I do not want to get into the threat that she relayed to us. I simply want to get in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">THE COURT: Would you proffer that she stated that there was a specific threat by [appellant] to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">[THE STATE]: Well, it was not a threat by [appellant]. It was a threat by an unknown individual. Her daughter went to collect some of her property from the location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">She had left that area out of concern for being a witness in this case and comments were made to her daughter indicating that physical harm may come to the family if her mother were to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">THE COURT: But not allegedly by [appellant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-11\">[THE STATE]: Not allegedly by [appellant] but I believe under <em>Washington </em>[ <em>v. State, </em>293 Md. 465, 445 A.2d 684 (1982) ], that a specific instruction can be generated to advise the jury that this threat was not made by the Defendant but the concern for her safety is essentially being offered as a motivator for why she is now recanting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>I don\u2019t have a copy of the case with me but I can bring it in the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">And furthermore, that\u2019s also why I\u2019m not attempting to get into the specifics of the threat simply that she expressed concerns for being a witness in this case. I don\u2019t want to bring up any specific elements of a threat and that she asked for a referral to the Victim Witness Assistance Unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agd\">THE COURT: [Appellant\u2019s counsel], what\u2019s your view on that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel then objected on grounds that he had not \u201copened the door to this subject ... simply because [he] mentioned a conversation.\u201d The trial court then ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">I don\u2019t think the door is opened based on simply asking the conversation. I think the door is opened because the Defense has raised the theory that she lied in her prior statements merely to get out of jail and her testimony at this point that she was out of jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">And the State can now raise the possible other motive why the witness would now change her story again at the time of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">So, I am going to allow the State to go into it and I will give the cautionary instruction depending on what it is the witness says that her concerns about the threat are not to be attributed to the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-10\">It\u2019s simply admitted in order to shed light on the witness\u2019s motivation for statement that she made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">Following the additional objection of appellant\u2019s counsel to the admission of such testimony on the grounds that it would be more prejudicial than probative, the trial court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-12\">All right. Well, I believe it\u2019s appropriate for this\u2014given the fact that this witness is making up a story or not or recanting it today or not is at issue in this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-13\">It is probative on that issue and I think the prejudice to [appellant] can be controlled by a cautionary instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">The trial court then permitted the State to lead Ms. Gibbs through the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>[THE STATE]: Ms. Gibbs, isn\u2019t it true that in the meeting on July 1, 2009 you expressed concerns for your safety if you were a witness in this case? I need you to answer yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">[MS. GIBBS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">[THE STATE]: And isn\u2019t it true, Ms. Gibbs, that during that meeting on July 2, 2009, based on those same concerns you specifically requested a referral to the Victim Witness Assistance Unit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">[MS. GIBBS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">The trial court additionally permitted the State to question Detective Pittman on the subject as well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">[THE STATE]: Did Ms. Gibbs express concerns about being a witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-11\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-12\">[THE STATE]: I want you to just [say] yes or no, not specifics[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-13\">[DETECTIVE PITTMAN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-14\">[THE STATE]: Did Ms. Gibbs request a referral to the Victims Witness Assistance Unit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-15\">[DETECTIVE PITTMAN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-16\">On appeal, appellant now asks this Court to reverse his conviction, arguing the premise that the admission of this testimony was unduly prejudicial because it was unclear that appellant was not responsible for Ms. Gibbs\u2019 fear and because the trial court issued no limiting instruction to the jury. We disagree with appellant\u2019s contentions and are more persuaded by the State\u2019s argument presented <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-17\">It is a bedrock principle in Maryland that the admission of evidence is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Armstead v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 599, 643, 7 A.3d 169 (2010) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>418 Md. 191, 13 A.3d 798 (2011). <em>See Sifrit v. State, </em>383 Md. 116, 857 A.2d 88 (2004); <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404, 697 A.2d 432 (1997) (internal citations omitted). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 5-104(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>(stating the \u201c[preliminary question concerning ... the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court\u201d). Relevant testimony is generally admissible and irrelevant testimony is not admissible. <em>Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. at 404, 697 A.2d 432 (citing Md. Rule 5-402).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cEvidence is relevant if it has a tendency to establish or refute a fact that is at issue in the case.\u201d <em>(Sifrit, </em>383 Md. at 128, 857 A.2d 88). <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-401.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Therefore, when the trial court determines that testimony offered into evidence is relevant to the case before it, \u201c[w]e are generally loath to reverse a trial court unless the evidence is plainly inadmissible under a specific rule or principle of law or there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. at 404-405, 697 A.2d 432 (citing <em>White v. State, </em>324 Md. 626, 637, 598 A.2d 187 (1991), <em>quoted in Sifrit, </em>383 Md. at 128-29, 857 A.2d 88. <em>See also Armstead, </em>195 Md.App. at 643, 7 A.3d 169 (citing <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 175, 729 A.2d 910 (1999), and <em>Hopkins v. State, </em>352 Md. 146, 158, 721 A.2d 231 (1998))).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Met with similar procedural circumstances relating to the rehabilitation of a State\u2019s witness, the Court of Appeals clearly noted in <em>Washington v. State </em>that \u201c[e]vidence of threats to a witness, or attempts to induce a witness not to testify or to testify falsely is generally admissible as substantive evidence of guilt when the threats or attempts can be linked to the defendant and not admissible as substantive evidence absent such linkage.\u201d 293 Md. 465, 468 n. 1, 445 A.2d 684 (1982) (citing <em>Saunders v. State, </em>28 Md.App. 455, 459, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>346 A.2d 448 (1975) (additional citations omitted), <em>quoted in Armstead, </em>195 Md.App. at 643, 7 A.3d 169). The Court further acknowledged that \u201c[w]hen a witness is impeached by a prior inconsistent statement, evidence explaining the inconsistency is clearly admissible for the purpose of rehabilitating the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>293 Md. at 469, 445 A.2d 684. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-616(c)(l) (\u201cA witness whose credibility has been attacked may be rehabilitated by ... [permitting the witness to deny or explain impeaching facts\u201d). The Court continued by delineating previously recognized examples of an impeached witness\u2019s testimony used for the purpose of rehabilitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">... [A] witness has been allowed to explain prior inconsistent statements by showing that they were induced by bribes, <em>State v. Minton, </em>234 N.C. 716, 68 S.E.2d 844 (1952); that they were made while under sedation, <em>Hodges v. Haverty, </em>115 Ga.App. 199, 154 S.E.2d 276 (1967); that they were made during a period of memory loss, <em>State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ropp, </em>7 Mich.App. 698, 153 N.W.2d 172 (1967); that they were made in an attempt to remain uninvolved in the proceeding, <em>Tucker v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 32, 245 A.2d 109 (1968); or that they were induced by threats from the defendant, <em>State v. Charles, </em>525 S.W.2d 360 (Mo.App.1975); <em>Commonwealth v. Crow, </em>303 Pa. 91, 154 A. 283 (1931).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-6\"><em>Washington, </em>293 Md. at 469-70, 445 A.2d 684. Following the example of these previously recognized set of circumstances, the Court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">[p]ursuant to the rule permitting explanations of prior inconsistent statements, it is generally held that evidence of threats to a witness or fear on the part of a witness, in order to explain an inconsistency, is admissible in criminal cases for credibility rehabilitation purposes <em>even if the threat or fear have </em>[sic] <em>not been linked to the defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 470, 445 A.2d 684 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). <em>Accord Brown v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 187, 194-95, 560 A.2d 605 (1989) (holding that although evidence of threats to a witness may be offered for the limited purpose of explaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statements in an <em>effort to </em>rehabilitate the witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Nonetheless, the defendant, Washington, insisted that the Court should reject the adoption of any rule permitting a witness\u2019s rehabilitation through the admission of threats or fear on the part of a witness unless the threats are linked to the accused. <em>Washington, </em>293 Md. at 470, 445 A.2d 684. Rejecting Washington\u2019s plea, the Court preliminarily admitted that, \u201c[t]he degree of prejudice caused by the evidence of threats is certainly less when the threats are not connected with the accused than when they are linked to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notwithstanding the higher degree of prejudice to the accused when the threat has no obvious nexus to him, the court concluded that \u201cany unfair prejudice to the accused in this situation [when the threat has not been linked to the defendant] <em>can be cured by his requesting a cautionary jury instruction </em>[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470-71, 445 A.2d 684 (emphasis added). In addition, the Court further emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">[e]vidence of fear caused by [even] anonymous threats obviously has very high probative value in explaining a prior inconsistent statement. Permitting one side to impeach a witness by showing a prior inconsistency, and not permitting the other side to explain the inconsistency by such probative evidence, does not comport with even-handed administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 471, 445 A.2d 684 (referencing <em>State v. Farmer, </em>97 Ariz. 348, 353-54, 400 P.2d 580 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">More recently, this Court was presented with an issue of witness rehabilitation through the explanation of a threat prior to trial in <em>Armstead v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 599, 640, 7 A.3d 169 (2010). There, at the conclusion of Armstead\u2019s cross-examination of the State\u2019s witness, Leroy Simon (\u201cSimon\u201d), Simon stated, \u201cI got something I need to say.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641, 7 A.3d 169. Upon the State\u2019s redirect examination of Simon, the prosecutor asked Simon what he wanted to say; and Simon replied, \u201cI\u2019m saying, Your Honor, I am doing the best I can. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>I\u2014I\u2014was frightened, my life was threatened the day [sic] so I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Following Simon\u2019s exclamation, the trial court directed the parties to approach the bench. <em>Id. </em>Armstead\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial, which the court denied and indicated that it would provide a curative instruction to the jury. <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel maintained that she wanted a mistrial, but also requested the that the curative instruction be given. <em>Id. </em>As a consequence, the trial court instructed the jury, stating, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, strike\u2014I\u2019m going to strike the last question and answer. Please disregard the last question and answer. They have nothing to do with this case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Thereafter, the State returned the issue initially addressed during Simon\u2019s cross-examination by Armstead\u2019s counsel: why Simon did not go to the police. <em>Id. </em>Simon replied, \u201cI was scared.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The response elicited prompted another bench conference, during which Armstead\u2019s counsel objected to Simon\u2019s statement. <em>Id. </em>In response, the State asserted that Simon\u2019s response was relevant because the issue had been raised during the defense\u2019s cross-examination of the witness. <em>Id. </em>The court agreed with the State, distinguished Simon\u2019s reply from any specific statement that he had been threatened, and overruled Armstead\u2019s objection. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Following a recess, the State proffered that Simon had been approached by women outside the courtroom two or three days ago and was threatened. <em>Armstead, </em>195 Md.App. at 642, 7 A.3d 169.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As a result, the State, relying on the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>Washington, supra, </em>293 Md. 465, 445 A.2d 684 (1982), asked the court to reconsider its prior ruling striking Simon\u2019s testimony that he had been threatened because it explained the inconsistencies between Simon\u2019s testimony at trial and his statements prior to trial. <em>Id. </em>Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the trial court ruled that testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ny regarding the threat made toward Simon was admissible and could be considered by the jury, provided that the jury received a limiting instruction. <em>Id. </em>At the close of trial, Armstead was convicted of second degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder, and he was sentenced to thirty years. <em>Id. </em>at 604, 7 A.3d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">On appeal before this Court, Armstead argued that the trial court had erred in admitting Simon\u2019s statements that he had been threatened. <em>Id. </em>at 640, 7 A.3d 169. Rejecting his contentions and affirming the judgment of the trial court, we noted that \u201cat numerous times during Simon\u2019s cross[-]examination, his memory needed to be refreshed[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644, 7 A.3d 169. We also recognized Simon\u2019s numerous inconsistencies about the time and day he witnessed the criminal transactions, noting that Simon \u201ctestif[ied] at trial that it happened during daylight hours, but [had told] police that it was \u2018[definitely night time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>As a consequence, we concluded that, on the record before us,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">the trial court [had] not abus[ed] its discretion in admitting evidence that Simon felt frightened and scared. The pertinent comment before the jury came at the end of cross-examination and arguably was Simon\u2019s attempt to explain any inconsistencies elicited by defense counsel [\u2019s cross-examination]. As this was admissible solely for the purpose of assessing Simon\u2019s credibility, the evidence was properly admitted at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 644-45, 7 A.3d 169 (relying on <em>Brown, </em>80 Md.App. at 194, 560 A.2d 605). Thus, we accordingly affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 647, 7 A.3d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In the instant case, the pertinent in-court testimony of Ms. Gibbs only established that she had seen a man \u201cfussing\u201d with Ms. Leak in front of her home. Ms. Gibbs further asserted that she had seen and heard Ms. Leak telling Ms. Gregg that the man was appellant. This testimony was a stark contrast to the testimony Ms. Gibbs had previously provided to police. <em>See </em>Part I, <em>supra. </em>During her earlier, recorded statement with police, Ms. Gibbs explained that she had seen appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>and Mr. Thompson, the victim, engaged in an argument over drugs and that she had witnessed appellant stabbing Mr. Thompson in the back. As a consequence, appellant\u2019s counsel used Ms. Gibbs\u2019 testimonial inconsistencies to call into question her credibility. Therefore, evidence explaining Ms. Gibbs\u2019 inconsistencies was clearly admissible for the purpose of rehabilitating her credibility. <em>Washington, </em>293 Md. at 469, 445 A.2d 684. <em>Accord Brown, </em>80 Md.App. at 194-95, 560 A.2d 605; <em>Armstead, </em>195 Md.App. at 644-45, 7 A.3d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Even so, appellant insists that the facts and reasoning of <em>Washington </em>and its progeny are inapposite to the case at bar because no cautionary instruction was ever provided to the jury. Appellant is correct that in <em>Washington </em>and its progeny the trial court gave a cautionary instruction that emphasized the limited consideration of the rehabilitative testimony and that it had failed to give similar instruction in this case. Appellant, however, fails to specifically note the reason why the trial court did not give the jury a limiting or cautionary instruction similar to the instructions present in <em>Washington </em>and <em>Armstead. </em>Appellant\u2019s counsel expressly objected to such an instruction. During the conference on proposed jury instructions, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">THE COURT: All right. Now, let\u2019s\u2014the Defense has requested 3.13, the witness promises to benefit. I assume because of his gifts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">[THE STATE]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-8\">THE COURT: And not perhaps related to this because it relates to Ms. Gibbs\u2019 testimony, you\u2019re asking for\u2014the State is asking for a Washington based instruction on her alleged fear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">[THE STATE]: Well, Your Honor indicated you wanted to give the instruction based on Washington and I think i[n] light of the fact that there were no specific influence of a threat that were elicited, simply that she expressed a concern being a witness in general. I don\u2019t believe that a Washington type instruction is necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>However, if the Court disagrees, what I did was a[sic] went with a line which is from Washington and attempted to modify it to the facts and circumstances of this case. I do have a response to the promise of leniency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">THE COURT: All right. First on the Washington issue, [appellant\u2019s counsel] what\u2019s your view on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiq\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I object to that instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW2\">THE COURT: All right. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. Thank you for including it, ... but I understand that you\u2019re only including it because you thought I might want it; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">[THE STATE]: Well, you said you did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">THE COURT: All right. I won\u2019t give it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">We are unpersuaded that the admission of general testimony by Ms. Gibbs that she was fearful as a result of her participation as a witness in this case was unduly prejudicial. Even if the testimony could be construed as unfairly prejudicial, the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>Washington </em>places the burden upon the defendant to request the appropriate limiting instruction: \u201c[A]ny unfair prejudice to the accused in this situation [when the threat has not been linked to the defendant] <em>can be cured by his requesting a cautionary jury instruction, </em>such as given in the present case, telling the jury to consider the evidence only for the purpose of assessing the witness\u2019s credibility and not as evidence of guilt.\u201d 293 Md. at 470-71, 445 A.2d 684 (emphasis added). As noted, <em>supra, it </em>was the <em>State </em>that submitted a limiting instruction to the trial court. Moreover, it was <em>appellant </em>who objected to the Washington instruction. Appellant failed to suggest any alternative. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion by admitting the evidence without a limiting instruction.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>(C) Appellant\u2019s Third Assignment of Error That The \u201cEvidence Was Insufficient To Sustain [Appellant\u2019s] Conviction For Openly Carrying a Dangerous Weapon,\u201d Is Unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Appellant\u2019s final assignment of error is that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for carrying a dangerous weapon openly with the intent to injury. Specifically, appellant attests that \u201c[u]nder the law of the case doctrine, the evidence was insufficient to support [appellant\u2019s] conviction for openly carrying a dangerous weapon because the State failed to prove that the knife used to kill Mr. Thompson was a dangerous weapon as defined by the jury instruction.\u201d (Footnote omitted). Appellant, however, presents this argument notwithstanding his concession that he failed to raise this argument below.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In fact, appellant failed to move for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case or at the close of all evidence on the ground that the State failed to prove the knife used to kill Thompson was one of the weapons outlined in the trial court\u2019s jury instruction. Moreover, appellant failed to raise any objection to the court\u2019s jury instructions, and he did not argue the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine at any point during trial. In addition, we are unpersuaded that appellant\u2019s sufficiency challenge occupies a \u201cunique procedural posture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that appellant\u2019s legal assertions are unpreserved for our review. See Md. Rule 4-324(a) (requiring a defendant to move for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case or at the close of all the evidence and \u201cstate with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted\u201d);<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Md.

State, </em>175 Md. App. 153, 159, 926 A.2d 805 (2007) (citation omitted). Thus, \u201c[a] defendant may not argue in the trial court that the evidence was insufficient for one reason, then urge a different reason for the insufficiency on appeal[.]\u201d <em>Bates v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 678, 691, 736 A.2d 407 (1999), <em>quoted in McIntyre v. State, </em>168 Md.App. 504, 527-28, 897 A.2d 296 (2006). <em>See also Starr v.

To be sure, \u201cno Maryland case has utilized the plain error doctrine to reverse a trial judge\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal when the ground raised on appeal was never advanced before the trial court at the time the motion for judgment of acquittal was being considered.\u201d <em>McIntyre, </em>168 Md.App. at 528, 897 A.2d 296.
