Holmes was convicted of first-degree assault; using a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence; wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun; possessing a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a disqualifying felony; and discharging a firearm within the city limits of Baltimore City. Holmes was acquitted of attempted first-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">Thereafter, the trial court sentenced Holmes to 15 years imprisonment for first-degree assault; 15 years for using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence (concurrent with the assault sentence); three years for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun (also concurrent with the assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>sentence); five years for possessing a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a disqualifying felony (consecutive to the assault sentence); and one year for discharging a firearm within Baltimore City limits (concurrent with the assault sentence), for a total of 20 years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Holmes filed a timely appeal and presents four issues for our review, which we have expanded and rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">1. Whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to sustain Holmes\u2019s convictions beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">2. Whether the circuit court erred in replying to a jury note by deviating from the language used in Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 2:01.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">3. Whether the circuit court erred in denying Holmes\u2019s motion for new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">4. Whether the circuit court erred in failing to merge Holmes\u2019s sentence for wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun, with the sentence imposed for using a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">5. Whether the circuit court erred by invoking impermissible considerations in sentencing Holmes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgments of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. We, however, merge Holmes\u2019s sentence for wearing, carrying, or transporting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>handgun into Holmes\u2019s sentence for use of a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">On December 15, 2009, Keytwan Deputy (\u201cDeputy\u201d) traveled from out-of-town to visit his father, Debro Muhammad (\u201cMuhammad\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Baltimore City. Some time later that evening, Deputy visited a friend of his father, a man by the name of Standsberry Lee (\u201cLee\u201d). In addition to Deputy, Muhammad, and Lee, a handful of other individuals were present at Lee\u2019s house that evening, including Bruenell Coleman (\u201cColeman\u201d), a man identified as \u201cK.J.,\u201d and another man that was referred to as \u201cQ.\u201d While at Lee\u2019s house, Deputy decided to use the computer. After browsing the internet for approximately ten minutes, Deputy heard a knock at the front door. Deputy testified that K.J. stood up, opened the front door, and an individual entered the residence who sat down in the living room next to K.J. According to the record, Deputy identified the individual as Holmes through the use of a photographic array.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">From his seat in the living room, Holmes called out to Deputy to inquire where he was from and what he was doing. Without answering Holmes\u2019s question, Deputy responded: \u201c[0]h, it\u2019s just a little website thing with girls on here.\u201d Thereafter, Holmes stood up, brought his chair over to where Deputy was, and sat down next to him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Deputy testified that he was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d at this point and so he ignored Holmes for as long as possible. As Holmes persisted with criticisms and questions, Deputy finally responded by stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">[M]an, dog, I don\u2019t even know you. So why did you take your chair and come sit over here next to me. Take your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>chair and go back over there and sit by the front door where you were sitting at before you sat next to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZD\">Holmes responded that \u201che wasn\u2019t going nowhere [and that] he ain\u2019t moving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">After Holmes remained on his knees for approximately 20 to 30 more seconds, Deputy then advised Holmes that if he said anything else, Deputy would \u201cbeat him up.\u201d Holmes replied with \u201cokay, okay, all right, all right,\u201d at which point Holmes then \u201cgrabbed his jacket, slowly put his jacket on real nice and calm and then he left.\u201d Moments later, Deputy heard a knock at the door. K.J. answered the door and Holmes re-entered the house. Deputy testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">When [Holmes] came in, he shut the door behind him, he lift his shirt up. When he lift his shirt up he\u2019s drawing a handgun. It was a revolver from his waistband and said, talk that shit now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Deputy described the revolver as a \u201c357\u201d with a \u201cwestern style butt\u201d and a \u201clong nose.\u201d At trial, Deputy demonstrated, with his hands, the length of the barrel for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">After Holmes revealed the revolver, Deputy began running through the residence away from Holmes. Deputy ran down a hallway, turned right into a bedroom, and ran straight through a glass window. Deputy testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">When I crashed through the window\u2014I felt down to the ground. As I\u2019m getting up I heard something go pow and the glass was cutting my hands up from the glass being on the ground from me jumping through the window. I took off running.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Deputy further described the \u201cpow\u201d as a gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">After running for a few blocks, Deputy hid behind a house. Approximately five minutes later, Deputy \u201cpeeked\u201d his head out from behind a wooden fence and saw an individual who he believed was Holmes and another individual with him. Deputy again took off running, and eventually came to a place with which he was familiar. Deputy began knocking on doors to houses, and eventually was able to find someone who provided him with water and alerted the paramedics. While being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>inspected for injuries on a porch, Deputy was told by the paramedics that he was shot. Thereafter, Deputy was transported to a hospital and treated for a gunshot wound to his right leg, along with other cuts from the shattered glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">At trial, Coleman testified that he shared a residence with Lee, and at the time that Deputy arrived that evening, Coleman was in his bedroom watching a football game. When Deputy was using Lee\u2019s computer to access the internet, Coleman left the residence to purchase a snack. When Coleman returned two to three minutes later, Coleman witnessed Holmes leaving the residence. Coleman then closed and locked the front door, and returned to his bedroom. Shortly thereafter, Coleman witnessed Deputy running into his bedroom through his closed glass window.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Coleman further testified that he witnessed K.J. \u201ctussling\u201d with Holmes near the front door of the residence. Moreover, when Coleman identified Holmes soon after the shooting through a photographic array, Coleman wrote: \u201c[T]he person I pick out [was] the person in the door with the guns.\u201d Lee, however, testified at trial that the individual who came back with the gun was not Holmes. Nevertheless, evidence was admitted that Lee had told Detective Jeffrey Rivera (\u201cDetective Rivera\u201d) during an interview that Holmes was the individual \u201cwho was in the house with the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The jury began deliberations on September 7, 2011 which continued into the following day. On the second day, the jury submitted a note to the court stating that \u201c[w]e are unable to meet an agreement on three charges. What are our options for next steps in the proceeding? Thank you.\u201d The court instructed the jury that they were to \u201c[c]ontinue in [their] deliberations.\u201d The defense moved for a mistrial, which the circuit court denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> More than one hour later, the jury reached a verdict. The jury returned a guilty verdict on five of the seven counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Shortly after the jury rendered its verdict, defense counsel informed the court that Holmes had told her that one of the jurors saw him in shackles while he was escorted by a correctional officer in the hallway. Defense counsel explained to the court that, upon initially learning of this, she had investigated the incident by speaking with one of the correctional officers involved and with that officer\u2019s sergeant, both of whom denied that the incident occurred. The trial court eventually questioned the foreman and the foreman confirmed that, in delivering the jury\u2019s \u201c[sjecond question,\u201d he had seen Holmes while \u201cthey was bringing him in.\u201d In response to questioning, the foreman stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t notice\u201d that Holmes was shackled at the time, and he denied that the incident impacted his verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Thereafter, defense counsel filed a motion for a new trial on the ground that the jury foreman viewed the defendant in shackles and in custody which violated Holmes\u2019s right to a fair trial. The circuit court denied the motion and determined that Holmes \u201chad to have been shackled at the time\u201d when the juror saw him, and that \u201cthere is reasonable concern of prejudice during the course of deliberation.\u201d Nevertheless, the court found that the juror \u201cdid not see that he was being escorted,\u201d and that \u201cthere was no prejudice of the Defendant being seen in the hallway by the juror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Upon a review of the facts and circumstances of the case, as well as Holmes\u2019s prior contacts with the criminal justice system, the circuit court sentenced Holmes to 20 years incarceration for all five convictions. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal trial, this Court must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 </em>S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 <em>(1979) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>(citation omitted); <em>see also Titus v. State, </em>423 Md. 548, 557-58, 32 A.3d 44 (2011); <em>Allen v. State, </em>402 Md. 59, 71, 935 A.2d 421 (2007). The purpose is not to \u201cundertake a review of the record that would amount to, in essence, a retrial of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478, 649 A.2d 336 (1994). Indeed, \u201c[i]t is not our role to retry the case\u201d, <em>Smith v. State, </em>415 Md. 174, 185, 999 A.2d 986 (2010), because the finder of fact has \u201cthe unique opportunity to view the evidence and to observe first-hand the demeanor and to assess the credibility of witnesses during their live testimony.\u201d <em>State v. Mayers, </em>417 Md. 449, 466, 10 A.3d 782 (2010) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting <em>Smith, supra, </em>415 Md. at 185, 999 A.2d 986). Accordingly, \u201cwe do not re-weigh the credibility of witnesses or attempt to resolve any conflicts in the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u201cA fact-finder is free to believe part of a witness\u2019s testimony, disbelieve other parts of a witness\u2019s testimony, or to completely discount a witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Pryor v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 311, 329, 6 A.3d 343 (2010). Furthermore, we recognize that \u201cthe finder of fact has the ability to choose among differing inferences that might possibly be made from a factual situation.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>415 Md. at 183, 999 A.2d 986 (internal quotations omitted). As such, we \u201cdefer to any possible reasonable inferences the [trier of fact] could have drawn from the admitted evidence.\u201d <em>Mayers, supra, </em>417 Md. at 466, 10 A.3d 782 (citing <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 557, 823 A.2d 664 (2003)). Additionally, we \u201cneed not decide whether the [trier of fact] could have drawn other inferences from the evidence, refused to draw inferences, or whether we would have drawn different inferences from the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In the instant case, Holmes\u2019s first contention is that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because the evidence was insufficient to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>that Holmes was in possession of a firearm. Holmes further argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he discharged the firearm towards Deputy, causing Deputy to be struck by a bullet. As a result, Holmes claims that all of his convictions must be reversed. The State counters that \u201call of Holmes\u2019s convictions must be upheld\u201d because the evidence was sufficient to establish that: (1) Holmes was in possession of a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a disqualifying crime; (2) Holmes discharged a handgun within the city limits of Baltimore City; (3) Holmes wore, carried, or transported a handgun; (4) Holmes committed first-degree assault; and (5) Holmes used a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence. We hold that the evidence was sufficient for a jury to convict Holmes on all counts beyond a reasonable doubt. We now turn to a review of each conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">A. Possession of a Firearm</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">At trial, the court instructed the jury that \u201ca firearm is a weapon that propels a bullet or missile or projectile by gunpowder or some similar explosive.\u201d Under the Maryland Code, a handgun \u201cmeans a pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on the person.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Grim. Law (\u201cCR\u201d) \u00a7 4-201(c)(l) (LexisNexis 2012). To qualify as a \u201chandgun,\u201d a device must be a \u201cfirearm.\u201d Further, in order to qualify as a \u201cfirearm,\u201d it \u201cmust propel a missile by gunpowder or some such similar explosive\u201d or \u201cbe readily or easily converted into a device capable of so propelling a missile.\u201d <em>Wright v. State, </em>70 Md.App. 616, 620, 522 A.2d 401 (1987) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting <em>Howell v. State, </em>278 Md. 389, 396, 364 A.2d 797 (1976)); <em>see also Moore v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 90, 108, 983 A.2d 583 (2009). Accordingly, the circuit court\u2019s instruction to the jury on the use of the term \u201cfirearm\u201d was consistent with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>According to the record, Deputy testified that when Holmes returned to Lee\u2019s residence, Holmes \u201clift[ed] his shirt up\u201d and \u201cat the same time [he was] lifting his shirt up he [drew] a handgun. It was a revolver from his waistband and said, talk that shit now.\u201d Moreover, Deputy described the handgun as a \u201c357,\u201d \u201clong, long nose\u201d that appeared to have a \u201cwestern type butt of a gun.\u201d Deputy further testified that he did not hear the shot inside the residence. After Deputy \u201ccrashed\u201d through the bedroom window, he detected the gunshot. Holmes argues that because \u201c[o]nly one eyewitness\u2014Mr. Deputy\u2014testified that Mr. Holmes possessed a gun,\u201d that testimony was insufficient evidence to prove Holmes was in possession of a firearm. Critically, Deputy identified Holmes as the individual possessing a firearm. Furthermore, evidence was presented that both Lee and Coleman provided statements to police officers in which they stated that they saw Holmes with a firearm that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Although their testimony at trial differed from what they previously told police officers, both Lee and Coleman\u2019s prior statements indicated that Holmes was in possession of a handgun. As such, the prior statements could be used as substantive evidence that Holmes was in possession of a handgun, which was properly before the jury. Accordingly, the jury had every right to weigh and consider all of the evidence submitted at trial in reaching its verdict. The jury had the \u201cunique opportunity to view the evidence and to observe first-hand the demeanor and to assess the credibility of witnesses during their live testimony.\u201d <em>Mayers, supra, </em>417 Md. at 466, 10 A.3d 782. Indeed, \u201cwe do not re-weigh the credibility of witnesses or attempt to resolve any conflicts in the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the evidence adduced at trial provided a sufficient basis from which the trier of fact, i.e., the jury, could conclude that Holmes was in possession of a handgun on the evening of December 15, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Further, because the evidence was sufficient to establish that Holmes was in possession of a handgun, the evidence was also sufficient to establish that Holmes was in possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>regulated firearm after having been convicted of a disqualifying crime. In order for the jury to reach a conviction for this count, the jury was required to find that Holmes: (1) was in possession of a handgun; and (2) had a conviction that disqualified him from possessing a handgun. It is clear from the record that the first prerequisite, i.e., possession of a handgun, was properly before the jury. Additionally, the record reveals that the parties stipulated that Holmes had been convicted of a crime that disqualified him from possessing a handgun. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to sustain Holmes\u2019s conviction for possession of a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a disqualifying felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">B. Discharge of a Firearm</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Holmes maintains that there was \u201cno physical evidence that [he] discharged a firearm\u201d because \u201c[t]here was no firearms evidence found\u201d at or near the location of the incident. Holmes further claims that \u201cMr. Deputy has never said he saw [him] discharge a firearm\u2014a critical void in the prosecution\u2019s evidence given that Mr. Deputy\u2019s wound is in <em>the front </em>of his leg.\u201d Nevertheless, the evidence submitted at trial was sufficient for the jury to reasonably conclude Holmes discharged a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Holmes challenges the allegation that his handgun was discharged because there was a lack of any \u201cballistics evidence.\u201d Critically, Holmes fails to provide any basis or reason as to why such evidence would be found or detected in Lee\u2019s residence. The record is clear that Deputy testified Holmes was in possession of a revolver. No evidence was presented at trial to dispute that the firearm was a revolver or that a revolver would leave behind \u201cshell casings\u201d or \u201cballistics evidence\u201d if discharged. In addition, because Deputy was treated at a different location, a search of Lee\u2019s residence might not contain any ballistics evidence. Further, a search of Lee\u2019s residence did not occur until \u201clater that day,\u201d providing ample opportunity for Holmes, witnesses, and evidence to be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Moreover, the mere fact that Deputy did not witness Holmes discharge a firearm is not dispositive. Deputy testified that after he ran through the bedroom window, he immediately heard a gunshot while he was outside of Lee\u2019s house. Based on the evidence submitted at trial, it was reasonable for the jury to infer that Holmes was the only individual in possession of a firearm that evening. Thus, the jury was presented with ample circumstantial evidence to infer that it was Holmes who fired the handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Similarly, Deputy\u2019s testimony that \u201che was not aware of being shot\u201d initially does not preclude the jury from inferring that Holmes discharged the firearm. It is simply another consideration to be weighed by the jury in its deliberations. Further, Holmes asks us to speculate that the gunshot that wounded Deputy could have been fired by either of the two individuals that were witnessed with Holmes that evening. No evidence or testimony was presented at trial to support the notion that either of these persons were in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Furthermore, it is unreasonable to speculate\u2014as Holmes asks us\u2014that Deputy \u201caccidentally shot himself in the front of the leg ... upon falling from Mr. Lee\u2019s window.\u201d Indeed, there was no evidence presented at trial that Deputy was in possession of a firearm, let alone discharged a firearm. Holmes sets forth additional hypotheses, but this Court limits its consideration to the record established at trial. Accordingly, we \u201cdefer to any possible reasonable inferences the [trier of fact] could have drawn from the admitted evidence.\u201d <em>Mayers, supra. </em>Therefore, we hold that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer that Holmes discharged a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">As a result, there was sufficient evidence to convict Holmes of discharging a firearm within the limits of Baltimore City. There was no dispute in the record that the incident in question took place in Baltimore City. As such, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Holmes discharged a firearm within the jurisdictional limits of Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>City, violating the Baltimore City Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Baltimore, Md., Police Ordinances art. 19, \u00a7 59-2(a) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">C. Wearing, Carrying, or Transporting a Handgun</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The circuit court\u2019s instruction for the charge of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun provided that \u201cthe State must prove that the Defendant wore, carried or transported a handgun that was in his reach and available for his immediate ... use.\u201d CR \u00a7 4-203. As set forth above, the evidence was sufficient to establish that Holmes carried a handgun on his person and that the handgun was available for his immediate use. Accordingly, Holmes\u2019s conviction for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun is supported by sufficient evidence educed at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">D. First-Degree Assault</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The jury was presented with two theories under which it could find Holmes guilty of first-degree assault. Although the jury was not required to specify the theory upon which Holmes\u2019s conviction was based, the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction under either theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The jury was instructed that it could convict Holmes of first-degree assault if it found that Holmes: (1) caused an offensive touching that was intentional and to which Deputy did not consent; (2) used a firearm to commit the assault; and (3) intended to cause serious physical injury in the commission of the assault.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the record, evidence was suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>cient to prove that Holmes caused an offensive touching through the use of a firearm by aiming and shooting at Deputy. Further, the jury could infer that shooting at a person would cause serious physical injury. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for first-degree assault under this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The jury was also instructed that it could convict Holmes of first-degree assault if it found that: (1) Holmes committed an act with the intent of placing Deputy in fear of an immediate physical contact; (2) Holmes had the apparent ability to bring about that contact; (3) Deputy reasonably feared that contact; (4) the assault involved the use of a firearm; and (5) Holmes intended to cause serious physical injury in the commission of the assault. Upon a review of the record, there was sufficient evidence to establish each of these elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Deputy testified that Holmes returned to Lee\u2019s residence with two unidentified individuals after engaging in an argument with Deputy. Deputy further testified that Holmes removed a handgun from his waistband making a threatening remark towards Deputy. As a result, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer that Holmes\u2019s act was done for the purpose of placing Deputy in fear of harm or contact. Similarly, by removing the handgun from his waistband, Holmes had the ability to cause Deputy serious physical injury. Deputy testified that he ran quickly out of the room and took exceptional measures by crashing through a bedroom window in an effort to avoid being shot by Holmes. Further, Holmes\u2019s display of the firearm was in relatively close proximity to Deputy,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which was sufficient for the jury to infer that such a display would cause Deputy serious physical injury if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>he attempted to flee. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for first-degree assault under either of the theories presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">E. Use of a Handgun During the Commission of a Crime of Violence</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Holmes further argues that there was insufficient evidence presented to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Holmes used a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence. In order for the jury to convict Holmes of this offense, the jury was required to find that: (1) Holmes committed a crime of violence; and (2) he used a handgun during the commission of that crime. CR \u00a7 4-204. The jury was instructed that a crime of violence included both first and second-degree assault. Indeed, there was sufficient evidence to establish that Holmes was in possession of a handgun. Moreover, because the evidence was sufficient to establish that Holmes committed first-degree assault, the evidence was sufficient for the finder of fact to infer that Holmes committed a crime of violence. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence presented at trial for the jury to find that Holmes used a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Holmes\u2019s second contention is that the trial court erred in instructing the jury to \u201ccontinue in your deliberations\u201d when the trial court received a note from the jury. The note provided that: \u201c[w]e are unable to meet an agreement on three charges. What are our options for next steps in the proceeding? Thank you.\u201d Holmes maintains that the trial court\u2019s response to the jury \u201cdiffers markedly from Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction (\u201cMPJI-CR\u201d) 2:01 and, as such, was an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree for two reasons. First, Holmes\u2019s claim was not preserved for appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>late review because he failed to note an objection to the court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s note on the grounds he now raises on appeal. Further, assuming <em>arguendo </em>Holmes\u2019s claim is preserved, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in its response to the jury\u2019s note to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Holmes challenges the substance of the language used in the trial court\u2019s response in that it was \u201cimpermissibly coercive\u201d because it deviated from the approved language in MPJI-CR 2:01. Holmes\u2019s contention is not preserved for appellate review because he raises this claim for the first time at the appellate level. The following colloquy ensued at the trial level:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">THE COURT: We just received a note from the jury that says, \u201cwe are unable to meet an agreement on three charges.

Would you step back to the officer, sir. Thank you very much, Move out, please.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The exchange between Holmes and the court demonstrates that Holmes never raised an objection as to the particular instruction provided to the jury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, when the court asked \u201c... do you have any idea what you want to do,\u201d Holmes\u2019s counsel replied \u201c[e]ontinue deliberating.\u201d Under <em>Patrick v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 475, 481, 601 A.2d 1133 (1992), when a defendant fails to meet his or her \u201cduty of stating distinctly at the time the specific grounds of objection\u201d for a jury instruction, appellate consideration of such a claim will be forfeited.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At trial, Holmes had every opportunity to contend that the court\u2019s instruction was coercive or an unlawful deviation from MPJI-CR 2:01. Instead, Holmes failed to distinctly state any objection except to move for a mistrial. Accordingly, appellate consideration of Holmes\u2019s claim has been forfeited because it plainly appears by the record that it was neither raised nor decided by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Holmes\u2019s claim is preserved for appellate review, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury to continue its deliberations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the circumstances, the manner in which the trial court used to communicate its instruction to the jury was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Holmes relies on <em>Ruffin v. State, </em>394 Md. 355, 359 n. 2, 906 A.2d 360 (2006) to support his contention that trial courts must issue MPJI-CR 2:01 \u201cwithout deviation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Holmes argues that \u201c[i]n addition to being drastically shortened, the trial court\u2019s instruction contained none of the pattern instruction\u2019s emphasis on \u2018individual judgment,\u2019 or on holdouts\u2019 adherence to their \u2018honest belief[s].\u2019 \u201d As a result, Holmes claims that the trial court erred in failing to issue the model instruction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">It is well settled that \u201c[t]he decision of whether to give supplemental instructions is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Sidbury v. State, </em>414 Md. 180, 186, 994 A.2d 948 (2010) (citing <em>Roary v. State, </em>385 Md. 217, 237, 867 A.2d 1095 (2005)); <em>Lovell v. State, </em>347 Md. 623, 657, 702 A.2d 261 (1997) (\u201cWhether to give a jury supplemental instructions in a criminal case is within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d). Additionally, the determination to have a jury continue deliberating or to declare a mistrial is a matter largely within a trial judge\u2019s discretion. <em>Graham v. State, </em>325 Md. 398, 412, 601 A.2d 131 (1992); <em>Mayfield v. State, </em>302 Md. 624, 631, 490 A.2d 687 (1985). This particular discretion has been deemed \u201cbroad,\u201d and a \u201ctrial judge\u2019s decision [whether or not] to declare a mistrial when he considers the jury deadlocked is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>therefore accorded great deference by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In <em>Ruffin, supra, </em>the appellant argued that the jury instruction given by the trial judge violated his procedural rights because key portions of MPJI-CR 2:02,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> necessary for the jury to understand its duties, were omitted. In particular, the appellant argued that the \u201cadditions and omissions of the trial judge in his instruction to the jury on the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt lowered the burden of proof necessary to convict him.\u201d <em>Ruffin, supra, </em>394 Md. at 362, 906 A.2d 360. The Court of Appeals held that, \u201cas a matter of non-constitutional Maryland criminal law, in every criminal jury trial, the trial court shall instruct the jury utilizing the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction on the presumption of innocence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, MPJICR 2:02.\u201d <em>Ruffin, supra, </em>394 Md. at 364, 906 A.2d 360. As a result, the Court reversed the appellant\u2019s convictions in <em>Ruffin </em>and remanded the case to the circuit court for a new trial. Nevertheless, <em>Ruffin </em>is distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">First, the issues in this case do not implicate MPJI-CR 2:02, and, therefore, do not trigger an analysis under <em>Ruffin, supra. </em>Further, the trial judge\u2019s instruction did not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>any additional language to suggest unlawful deviation, as was the case in <em>Ruffin, supra. </em>Furthermore, Holmes has not provided this Court with any authority to suggest that such a simple and abbreviated response is improperly coercive. In particular, Holmes relies on <em>Stewart v. State, </em>334 Md. 213, 229, 638 A.2d 754 (1994). In <em>Stewart, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the trial court\u2019s instruction to a juror of \u201cgo back and continue deliberating and exercise [your] best judgment as to how [your] duty should be discharged\u201d was \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d and \u201cin no way met the requisites of the instruction [the Court of Appeals] indicated would be proper to give a jury having difficulty reaching a verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229-30, 638 A.2d 754. The supplemental instruction in <em>Stewart </em>was improper because the Court determined that the trial judge\u2019s motive was to obtain unanimous verdicts of the jury on the offenses charged. <em>Id. </em>The Court further determined that Stewart was prejudiced by the judge\u2019s errors. <em>Id. </em>Critically, Stewart was denied the chance to evaluate the \u201cjudge\u2019s solution to the problem and make such objection and suggestions as he deemed to be advisable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">We recognize that judges must be careful that their responses to jury questions are not coercive. <em>See Butler v. State, </em>392 Md. 169, 178, 896 A.2d 359 (2006). Here, the record is devoid of any indication that the trial judge\u2019s motive was to ensure a unanimous verdict or was otherwise improper. The abbreviated instruction in this case did not charge the juror to defer to the majority or communicate to the jury that nothing short of a unanimous verdict would be accepted. <em>See, e.g., Goodmuth v. State, </em>302 Md. 613, 618, 490 A.2d 682 (1985) (finding error in language suggesting that jurors should give \u201cproper regard and deference\u201d to the opinions of a majority); <em>Goldsberry v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 394, 416, 957 A.2d 1110 (2008) (finding error in instruction that \u201canything short of a unanimous verdict is not acceptable\u201d). Indeed, the trial court\u2019s limited instruction made it clear that the jury was to simply continue its deliberations. Unlike in <em>Stewart, </em>Holmes was afforded the opportunity to evaluate the \u201cjudge\u2019s solution to the problem.\u201d Holmes and the court shared an exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>concerning the specific jury instruction, which resulted in an agreement that the court would simply instruct the jury to \u201c[c]ontinue deliberating.\u201d Accordingly, this case is distinguishable from <em>Stewart </em>because the trial court\u2019s instruction did not present any potential for coercion. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in responding to the note from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Holmes next contends that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for new trial in light of allegations that, while the jury was still deliberating, a juror saw Holmes, in shackles, being escorted by a correctional officer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Holmes maintains that the juror\u2019s observation of Holmes violated his constitutional rights because it impaired his presumption of innocence. Under the circumstances, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">First, by failing to bring this claim to the trial court\u2019s attention prior to the jury\u2019s verdict, Holmes forfeited any ability to challenge the validity of the jury\u2019s verdict based on these circumstances on appeal. The record clearly demonstrates that Holmes and his counsel were aware of this encounter in advance of the jury\u2019s verdict, but did not raise this issue until after the verdict had been reached.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Upon the conclusion of the jury\u2019s deliberations, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">THE COUET: Counsel, be aware is that we\u2019ve had and received a communication from the jury. In fact we\u2019ve received two communications from the jury. We had contacted you first because there was communication that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>they wanted some additional information, but at 12:55 the jury sent a message that says, \u201cwe\u2019ve agreed upon a verdict for all charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\n<em>Is there anything the Defense wishes to place on the record at this time?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>No, Your Honor.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">THE COURT: Is there anything the State wishes to place on the record at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">THE COURT: Thank you very much. Mr. Clerk, if you would please bring the jury in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">(emphasis added). After the jury was brought in and it announced its verdict, the trial court asked defense counsel if she wished to have the jury polled. Defense counsel answered affirmatively. After the jury was polled, the verdict was hearkened and the clerk announced that the verdict had been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">Prior to the trial court dismissing the jury, defense counsel asked to approach the bench. Thereafter, defense counsel shared with the court\u2014for the first time\u2014Holmes\u2019s account of his previous encounter with the juror, stating that Holmes believed that the foreman witnessed him shackled and escorted by a correctional officer. The trial court accommodated defense counsel\u2019s request to question the juror as to his observations, even though the \u201cverdict [had] been taken.\u201d The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">THE COURT: ... Please approach. Would you step over here for me. Earlier were you in the hallway when he was in the hallway?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">JUROR: Yes, I came out and knocked on the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-14\">THE COURT: When you had a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-15\">JUROR: A question, right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-16\">THE COURT: And did you see him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-17\">JUROR: Yes, and he was in the hallway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-18\">THE COURT: And what was he doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-19\">JUROR: They was bringing him in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>THE COURT: And that was after you saw that? After you had the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">JUROR: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">THE COURT: And that was the first question or the second question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">JUROR: Second question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">THE COURT: Okay. Now did that impact you in any way as to your verdict in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">JUROR: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">THE COURT: Do you have any questions that you wish to pose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you see that he was in handcuffs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-12\">JUROR: I really didn\u2019t notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-13\">THE COURT: Do you have any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">The trial court then dismissed the entire jury, including the foreman. At that point, defense counsel indicated her intention to file a motion for new trial. Defense counsel argued that Holmes was deprived of his right to a fair trial under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">In <em>Scott v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 130, 146, 926 A.2d 792 (2007), we held that \u201c[t]he failure of <em>voir dire </em>to disclose potentially disqualifying information does not, in all cases, entitle the defendant to a new trial.\u201d In particular, \u201c[w]hen a defendant is aware that a prospective juror has failed to disclose information that is sought by <em>voir dire, </em>and fails to alert the trial court of the fact until after the verdict, he has waived the right to later complain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Scott\u2019s motion for new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 147, 926 A.2d 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-17\">Similarly, the record here reflects that Holmes and his counsel were aware of the encounter with the foreman, prior to the jury\u2019s verdict. Nevertheless, neither Holmes nor his counsel alerted the trial court to the circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>encounter, despite the trial judge\u2019s explicit invitation to raise any issues prior to the reading of the verdict. As a result, under the circumstances, Holmes forfeited any appellate review of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Holmes\u2019s claim is preserved for appellate review, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Holmes\u2019s motion for new trial. The trial judge took appropriate measures by questioning the juror. In answering the trial judge\u2019s question, the juror stated that he did not notice whether Holmes was in handcuffs and that the encounter did not impact his verdict in the case. Accordingly, the record demonstrates that Holmes was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">As set forth above, after the verdict was returned, the trial court called the foreman of the jury to the bench for questioning. The foreman admitted that he had seen Holmes in the hallway with a correctional officer, but \u201cdidn\u2019t notice\u201d whether Holmes was handcuffed. When questioned whether seeing Holmes in the hallway impacted his verdict in any way, the foreman\u2019s response was \u201c[n]o.\u201d Holmes contends that the foreman\u2019s observation was \u201cinherently prejudicial,\u201d and any finding of a lack of prejudice was faulty without a more in-depth scrutiny of the circumstances under which the observation took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Holmes\u2019s claim that the trial court should have probed the juror further, such as questioning whether he shared his observation with the other jurors, is misplaced.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Holmes was questioned by the trial court whether there was anything he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>wished to ask the foreman. Except for the one question regarding whether the foreman witnessed Holmes in handcuffs, Holmes did not inquire further into issues he now raises on appeal. As a result, Holmes not only failed to establish error, but he failed to create a record from which any perceived error could be determined. Under the circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Holmes\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Holmes next contends that the trial court erred by failing to merge two of his convictions at sentencing. Holmes was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for his conviction of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. CR \u00a7 4-204. Holmes was also sentenced to three years for his conviction of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun. CR \u00a7 4\u2014203(a)(l)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">It is well settled that when convictions for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun are based upon the same acts, separate sentences for those convictions will not stand. <em>Wilkins v. State, </em>343 Md. 444, 446-47, 682 A.2d 247 (1996); <em>Hunt v. State, </em>312 Md. 494, 510, 540 A.2d 1125 (1988). Accordingly, the State concedes that Holmes\u2019s sentences for these two convictions must be merged under the rule of lenity. <em>Hunt, </em>312 Md. at 510, 540 A.2d 1125. Applying the relevant merger principles to this case, we merge Holmes\u2019s three-year sentence for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun into his 15-year sentence for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. <em>See, e.g., Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 356, 893 A.2d 1018 (2006) (\u201cWhere there is a merger under the rule of lenity, the offense carrying the lesser maximum penalty ordinarily merges into the offense carrying the greater maximum penalty.\u201d (internal citations and quotations omitted)) (citing <em>Dixon v. State, </em>364 Md. 209, 238, 772 A.2d 283 (2001)). Although we merge the two convictions for purposes of sentencing, we do not remand because the trial court sentenced Holmes concurrently on these two offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>y.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Holmes\u2019s final contention is that the trial court erred because Holmes\u2019s sentences were based on impermissible considerations. Specifically, Holmes maintains that: (1) \u201cthe trial court appeared to punish Mr. Holmes for invoking his right to trial\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe trial court appeared to base its sentencing decision on personal ill-will and extra-judicial considerations.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Trial judges are vested with broad discretion in sentencing. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>364 Md. 192, 199, 772 A.2d 273 (2001) (citing <em>Poe v. State, </em>341 Md. 523, 531, 671 A.2d 501 (1996); <em>Jennings v. State, </em>339 Md. 675, 683, 664 A.2d 903 (1995)). In exercising this discretion, the sentencing judge should consider \u201cthe facts and circumstances of the crime committed and the background of the defendant, including his or her reputation, prior offenses, health, habits, mental and moral propensities, and social background.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>364 Md. at 199, 772 A.2d 273 (quoting <em>Poe, </em>341 Md. at 532, 671 A.2d 501). The judge\u2019s consideration should be undertaken with the aim of furthering the goals of the criminal justice system: punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation. <em>Jackson, </em>364 Md. at 199, 772 A.2d 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">A sentence is subject to appellate review on three bases: (1) whether it is in violation of federal or state constitutional protections; (2) whether the sentencing judge was motivated by ill-will, prejudice, or other impermissible considerations; and (3) whether the sentence is within statutory limits. <em>Id. </em>at 200, 772 A.2d 273 (citing <em>Gary v. State, </em>341 Md. 513, 516, 671 A.2d 495 (1996)). In the instant case, the record demonstrates that the sentence imposed by the trial court was not based on any impermissible considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Holmes\u2019s first claim that \u201cthe trial court appeared to punish Mr. Holmes for invoking his right to trial\u201d is misplaced. \u201cIt is absolutely clear that a trial court may not punish a defendant for invoking his right to plead not guilty and putting the State to its burden of proof for protesting his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>innocence.\u201d <em>Jennings, supra, </em>339 Md. at 684, 664 A.2d 903 (citing <em>Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. 536, 542-43, 336 A.2d 113 (1975)); <em>see Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 363, 98 S.Ct. 663, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978) (\u201cto punish a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort\u201d). The trial court\u2019s comments which Holmes relies upon are taken wholly out of context. Further, Holmes ignores the trial court\u2019s affirmative disavowal of any impermissible considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Holmes\u2019s contention, in part, originates from pre-trial discussions regarding the possibility of Holmes accepting a plea agreement offered by the State.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> When Holmes and the State appeared for a motions hearing on September 1, 2011, defense counsel indicated to the court that although Holmes had previously expressed interest in accepting the State\u2019s plea offer, Holmes \u201cnow has decided that he is not going to accept the State\u2019s offer.\u201d The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">THE COURT: It\u2019s all right with me. It\u2019s not doing me any harm. I\u2019m not angry with him. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s taking off the table\u2014what\u2019s the charges in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Attempted first degree murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">THE COURT: Oh, okay. And he\u2019s no longer interested in\u2014what was the offer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: The offer was five years to the count of second degree assault and a concurrent five years to a misdemeanor in possession of a firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">THE COURT: With parole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">THE COURT: Oh, it\u2019s all right with me that he gives that up because it\u2019s not going to come back again. It wasn\u2019t offered by me so feel free to turn it down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Holmes claims that these statements were \u201cimpermissible\u201d because they \u201cindicated that [the trial court\u2019s sentencing] disposition was based at least in part on Mr. Holmes putting the state to its burden of proof.\u201d Indeed, the trial court\u2019s statements had nothing to do with Holmes\u2019s post-verdict sentence. The court\u2019s comments were made solely within the context of the plea agreement offered by the State\u2014and not the court\u2014that Holmes was considering, but ultimately rejected. It is clear from the record that the language the court used was for the purpose of ensuring that Holmes understood what he was rejecting. The trial court exercised its discretion by allowing Holmes additional time to consider the plea agreement offered by the State. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s pretrial comments do not constitute impermissible considerations, but rather the appropriate exercise of discretion in the management of pre-trial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Holmes further maintains that the trial court entertained impermissible considerations because \u201cthe trial court determined, <em>before trial, </em>that [it] would impose a sentence above the guidelines minimum if Mr. Holmes maintained his right to trial and was ultimately found guilty.\u201d The precise language used by the trial judge is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">THE COURT: If you\u2019re [sic] client doesn\u2019t want to deal that\u2019s all right \"with me. I don\u2019t want him to feel obligated. Because if they come up with one of these other counts it\u2019s not going to be five years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Critically, the plea agreement that Holmes rejected would have required him to plead guilty to second-degree assault and misdemeanor possession of a firearm. The trial court\u2019s statement simply acknowledged that if Holmes was later convicted of other offenses for which he was charged, the trial court would be required, by law, to impose a sentence greater than that contemplated by the plea agreement. In particular, if Holmes was convicted of attempted first or second-degree murder, the trial court would have been obligated to treat that conviction more seriously, for sentencing purposes, than a conviction for second-degree assault and misdemeanor possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Further, the trial court affirmatively disavowed any consideration of pre-trial discussions or negotiations in its formulation of Holmes\u2019s ultimate sentence. During sentencing, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I would just say that because of these discrepancies in the guidelines as well as Mr. Holmes did rely in negotiations before trial began\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">THE COURT: Well, I don\u2019t talk about negotiations, but I\u2019ll talk about anything else except the word negotiations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay, when there were plea discussions before the case began and after motions\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">THE COURT: Isn\u2019t that the same as negotiations, plea discussions? You want to talk about the guidelines?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">THE COURT: You can talk about the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Indeed, defense counsel attempted to continually reference matters relating to pre-trial discussions. Nevertheless, the court made itself abundantly clear that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">THE COURT: Whatever was discussed before trial is of no import to this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well,\u2014but Mr. Holmes could have if he knew that the guidelines were\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-14\">THE COURT: If Mr. Holmes could have, should have, might have is of no import for this court. Mr. Holmes elected a trial, elected a jury, had a trial by jury. A jury who failed to find him guilty of attempted murder in the first and attempted murder in the second.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">The record demonstrates that the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision was not based on any consideration of anything that occurred pre-trial. The record reflects nothing more than the trial court\u2019s view of the appropriate sentence based on a host of factors including Holmes\u2019s post-verdict refusal to accept responsibility or express remorse for his crimes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>finding of guilt on some of the charges, the trial court ordered that a pre-sentence investigation be completed. At sentencing, the trial court referenced Holmes\u2019s \u201cdisdain for the law.\u201d This reference by the trial court was not related to Holmes\u2019s failure to plead guilty, but rather related to the circumstances of this case and Holmes\u2019s prior interactions with the criminal justice system. Therefore, Holmes\u2019s claim that \u201cthe trial court appeared to punish Mr. Holmes for invoking his right to trial\u201d is completely unfounded. Accordingly, the trial judge\u2019s comments at sentencing were an appropriate exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion in sentencing Holmes.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Holmes\u2019s second claim that \u201cthe trial court appeared to base its sentencing decision on personal ill-will and extra-judicial considerations\u201d is misguided. Holmes claims that \u201c[i]n addition to embodying conspicuous animosity, the trial court\u2019s remarks indicate that the sentencing decision was based on a special concern for a neighborhood where the trial judge and his family have lived and traveled and attended church.\u201d Indeed, the trial judge discussed personal facts about himself and how his personal background <em>could </em>affect his sentencing decision. Nevertheless, a review of the record reveals that although the trial judge referenced his familiarity with the geographic area in which the offenses occurred, the trial judge\u2019s comment was designed to explain to the parties that he was explicitly restraining himself from using that information as a factor in sentencing Holmes. The following colloquy took place after hearing from both Holmes and the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">THE COURT: Upon review of the facts and circumstances of this case as well as your record is that the court is really tempted to bang you as far as it could bang you and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>that is to make [each of the sentences] consecutive to each other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">My calculation is 15 plus 15 plus three plus five plus one is 39 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">I\u2019m really tempted to let you know is that I don\u2019t want you anywhere near Baltimore City. I\u2019m clearly at this point that you should know is that as my family across Martin Luther King Boulevard, as my family comes up Saratoga Street, three blocks from where I grew up and when [sic] to church, where my aunt and uncle who raised me when my family couldn\u2019t, that I recognize where you came from and I don\u2019t think you belong there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">That\u2019s the temptation that this court is fighting this morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Nevertheless, rather than\u2014as the trial court put it\u2014\u201cbang [Holmes] as far as it could bang [him],\u201d the trial court exercised restraint and rendered all of Holmes\u2019s sentences to run concurrently, with the exception of his mandatory sentence for possession of a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a disqualifying crime.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Furthermore, it was appropriate for the judge to convey to Holmes the impact of his conduct on the community. That communication was certainly well within the court\u2019s discretion. Instead of using his personal background and calculation of 39 years to impose a higher sentence, the trial judge consciously disregarded that temptation and sentenced Holmes to 20 years. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in sentencing Holmes.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the trial judge considered his personal background in sentencing Holmes, doing so would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>not have been grounds for error. In <em>Jennings, supra, </em>339 Md. at 685, 664 A.2d 903, the Court of Appeals noted that \u201cpermitting the trial court to base its sentence on perceptions ... such as other sources as ... any personal knowledge the judge may have gained from living in the same community is perfectly acceptable.\u201d (internal quotations omitted). The trial court\u2019s comments, viewed in the context with which the court intended, merely reflect the trial judge\u2019s personal knowledge of the community, its historical struggles with criminal activity, and efforts made to improve the neighborhood. As a result, the trial judge\u2019s mention of his personal background was intended only to impart knowledge to Holmes that his actions on the community were destructive. Accordingly, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the sentence was based on the factors articulated by the court, the sentence would not have been based on impermissible considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgments of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. We, however, merge Holmes\u2019s sentence for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun into Holmes\u2019s sentence for using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

Whether there was sufficient evidence at trial to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Holmes discharged or possessed a firearm, used a handgun, or committed first-degree assault, where there was no physical evidence he did so, no testimony as to certain key elements, and no reliable testimony as to others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-14\">2. Whether the trial court erred in giving the deadlocked jury an instruction that substantially deviated from Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 2:01.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-15\">3. Whether the trial court erred in denying a motion for a new trial where the juiy foreman witnessed Mr. Holmes shackled and in official custody during deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-16\">4. Whether the trial court erred at sentencing by failing to merge Mr. Holmes\u2019s sentences and by invoking impermissible considerations.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-10\">.

The defense moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. Holmes argued that the prosecution had presented insufficient evidence that he possessed a firearm, that the firearm was operable, and that he used an operable firearm to shoot a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>bullet into Deputy\u2019s leg. The circuit court denied Holmes\u2019s motion as to all counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\">.

We are constrained to note that the trial court misstated the law in its instruction on the first theory of first-degree assault. Under CR \u00a7 3-202, first-degree assault does not require both the intent to cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>serious physical injury to another and the use of a firearm. Nevertheless, the misstatement is \u00f3f no consequence because the evidence was sufficient to support either theory of first-degree assault under the instructions provided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\">.

Such instructions are commonly referred to as an <em>\u201cAllen </em>charge.\u201d The term <em>\"Allen </em>charge\u201d is derived from the instruction given to a deadlocked jury which was considered by the Supreme Court in <em>Allen v.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>instruction is intended to promote unanimity in jury decisions, as well as to encourage jurors to consider the viewpoints of their fellow jurors.

When defense counsel learned of this allegation from Holmes, she questioned one of the correctional officers who had escorted Holmes during the event in question as to whether a juror had seen him shackled.

The State also agreed to recommend parole as ordinarily provided by law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b482-16\">. The Court of Appeals has held that where a defendant refuses to express remorse or accept responsibility for his or her crimes after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>jury\u2019s verdict has been rendered, that lack of remorse and failure to accept responsibility may be considered in the formulation of an appropriate sentence. <em>See, e.g., Jennings, supra, </em>339 Md. at 688, 664 A.2d 903 (\"We hold that a sentencing court may consider, on the issue of the defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation, the defendant's lack of remorse.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b484-10\">.
