Appellant noted an appeal raising five issues, which we rephrase as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>I. Whether the circuit court had authority to enter sanctions against appellant for its insurer, Mid-Continent\u2019s, alleged violation of a scheduling order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">II. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion in entering the sanction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer question I in the negative and question II in the affirmative. We shall vacate the default judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">On May 11, 2010, members of the Ratajczak family (the \u201cRatajczaks\u201d), as individuals, filed suit against appellee in the circuit court, alleging that approximately 5,400 gallons of gasoline had leaked from appellee\u2019s underground storage tanks at its facility at 7950 Pulaski Highway, Baltimore, Maryland, and contaminated the Ratajczaks\u2019 adjacent single family home property. On June 28, 2010, the circuit court issued a Scheduling Order, scheduling a settlement conference for April 5, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">On August 2, 2010, appellee filed a third party complaint against appellant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee requested \u201cjudgment by way of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>contribution and/or indemnification [against appellant] for all sums for which [appellee] may be adjudged liable to the [Ratajczaks], plus attorneys\u2019 fees and all costs and expenses[,]\u201d \u201cplus One Million Dollars ($1,000,000)\u201d for each count alleging appellant\u2019s negligence and breach of contract in failing to maintain and inspect the underground tank which was the source of the leak. On October 22, 2010, appellant filed an answer and a request for a jury trial. On December 3, 2010, the Ratajczaks filed an Amended Complaint adding all third party defendants named by appellee, including appellant, as defendants. On January 6, 2011, appellee filed an amended answer to the third party complaint. On March 24, 2011, appellee filed an Amended Third Party Complaint against appellant, repeating the pleas from the third party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">On March 29, 2011, the parties filed a Consent Motion to change the date of the April 5, 2011, settlement conference to October 18, 2011. On March 30, 2011, the circuit court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The parties agree that, on August 2, 2011, the Ratajczaks and appellee participated in a mediation conference, at which they agreed to settle the Ratajczaks\u2019 claims against appellee for $2,700,000, and the Ratajczaks agreed to assign their claims against appellant to appellee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 4, 2011, appellant filed a Crossclaim against appellee, arguing that appellee\u2019s actions proximately caused the injury at issue in the underlying lawsuit, and that, as a result, appellant was \u201centitled to contribution and/or indemnification from [appellee] for all and/or part of any judgment entered against [appellant].\u201d On August 22, 2011, appellee filed a Motion to Strike Cross-claim, asserting that the Ratajczaks were \u201cin the process of assigning their claims against [appellant] to [appellee,]\u201d and that, as a result, appellant \u201chas no claims for contribution nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>indemnity as the only claims being asserted against it are by [appellee].\u201d On September 6, 2011, appellant filed an Opposition to Motion to Strike Crossclaim, arguing that, because it was unaware of the release language that would be used in the settlement agreements between appellee and other parties, and of whether appellee intended to pursue its assigned claim from the Ratajczaks, the Crossclaim/Counterclaim was a reasonable method to assert claims of contribution and indemnification against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">On August 31, 2011, in response to a joint request by the parties, the circuit court issued a notice of hearing order moving the settlement conference from October 18, 2011, to September 27, 2011. On September 6, 2011, the circuit court issued a second order titled \u201cOrder to Attend Settlement Conference,\u201d providing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">[Appellee] and [appellant] are hereby ordered to attend a settlement conference before [the circuit court] on Tuesday, September 27, at 9:00 a.m. The following conditions are imposed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">A senior officer or employee of [appellant\u2019s insurance carrier [Mid-Continent] must be present, with binding settlement authority up to the full limits of its policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">A senior representative of [appellant] must be present with full settlement authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">A senior representative of [appellee] must be present with full settlement authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">On September 27, 2011, the settlement conference was conducted in the judge\u2019s chambers, not on-the-record in open court. It is undisputed that both parties and a representative of Mid-Continent attended the settlement conference, and that the representative of Mid-Continent was an independent third-party adjuster, not a \u201csenior officer or employee ... with binding settlement authority up to the full limits of [the] policy\u201d as ordered by the circuit court. On brief, appellant contends that a senior officer of Mid-Continent was not available to attend the settlement conference, and that appellant\u2019s counsel contacted appellee\u2019s counsel prior to the confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ence to request a continuance, but that appellee\u2019s counsel \u201cwould not consent.\u201d Appellant contends that the following occurred at the settlement conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">[The circuit court] asked counsel for [appellee] what sanction he would like the [circuit] court to enter for Mid[-]Continent\u2019s \u201cviolation\u201d of the September 6 Order. [Appellee\u2019s counsel] initially requested that the [circuit e]ourt award him attorney\u2019s fees and costs, but then withdrew this request, instead orally moving for a default judgment against [appellant] in favor of [appellee] in the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00). Before granting [appellee\u2019s counsel's oral motion, [the circuit court] requested that counsel for [appellant] contact Mid[-]Continent to inform them that she would be imposing the requested sanction against [appellant]. While [appellant\u2019s counsel] was speaking to a representative from Mid[-]Continent by phone, [the circuit court] granted [appellee\u2019s] oral request for a default judgment against [appellant], entering judgment against [appellant] in favor of [appellee] for one million dollars ($1,000,-000.00).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In contrast, appellee contends that the following occurred at the settlement conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">At the settlement conference, [the circuit court] questioned [appellant]^ counsel of record about whether she had, in fact, notified [Mid-Continent] of the court\u2019s order requiring its attendance. After confirming that Mid-Continent had indeed received' a copy of the order; that it knew it was required to be in attendance; and that it had nevertheless decided it would not send a senior officer or employee to attend the settlement conference, [the circuit court] considered entering a default judgment against [appellant] in the amount of its available insurance. Counsel for [appellee] moved for a default judgment and advised the court that if it could resolve the case on that basis, [appellee] would be willing to accept judgment in the amount of $1 million. The [circuit] court then granted a default judgment against [appellant] in the amount of $1 million, the limits of [appellant]^ policy with Mid-Continent. [Appellant\u2019s] counsel of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>record was present at the time the default judgment was entered by [the circuit court]. However, [appellant\u2019s] counsel of record never requested to place the settlement conference \u201con[-]the[-]record\u201d by having a court reporter attend or by using a mechanical recording system[.] ... Despite the fact that [appellant\u2019s] counsel was present when [the circuit court] entered the default judgment against [appellant], [appellant\u2019s] counsel never requested to argue \u201con[-]the[-]record\u201d that the default judgment should not be entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">(Record citations omitted). The circuit court docket entries contain the following information as to the entry of judgment by default in favor of appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">Sept. 27, 2011 [ ] Settlement Conference Held Today on (Sept 6, 2011) This Court Signed an Order to Attend Settlement Conference.

[Appellant] Has a Representative Available Here Today []. A Senior Officer [and] Employee of [Mid-Continent] is Not Present With Binding Settlement Authority Up To The Full Amount of Its Policy.

[Appellee] Waives All Claims in Excess of ($1,000,000.00) For Its Claim Against [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6d\">The circuit court did not issue a written order or opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">On September 27, 2011, appellant filed a Motion to Strike Order of Default and to Recuse. On October 6, 2011, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>lant withdrew the motion. On the same day, appellant filed a Notice of Appeal of the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">On October 10, 2011, appellee\u2019s counsel took the deposition of Robert L. Ferguson, Jr., an attorney retained by appellant. Ferguson testified regarding his communication with Mid-Continent on appellant\u2019s behalf as follows:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJP\">[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: ... [H]ave you taken the position with Mid-Continent that Mid-Continent should pay its full policy limits in order to settle the claims being asserted by</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARP\">[appellee] and [the Ratajczaks]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">[Ferguson]: Whatever it will take to settle it, up to its policy limits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: And are you familiar with whether there is a substantial excess exposure on behalf of [appellant] in this litigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">[Ferguson]: I understand there to be a significant excess. I understand that [appellee] has settled with the [Ratajczaks] in that case already for $2.7 million, and in addition, has sustained its own damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: Are you familiar with the fact that a judgment has been entered in this litigation against [appellant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">[Ferguson]: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: To your knowledge, did [appellant] consent to the entry of that judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">[Ferguson]: It did not consent, to my knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: What is your understanding as to why the judgment was entered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">[Ferguson]: My understanding is that the judgment was entered as sanctions for the failure of [appellant\u2019s] insurer, Mid-Continent [ ], to comply with an Order of Court requir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>ing that a senior member of the company with authority to settle the case attend a settlement conference that had been scheduled by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on September 27, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: Now, are you familiar with the fact that a motion to strike that judgment was filed on behalf of [appellant] by counsel appointed by Mid-Continent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADeh\">[Ferguson]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: Have you taken a position, or did you take a position on behalf of [appellant] with Mid-Continent as to whether Mid-Continent should withdraw that motion and allow the judgment to stand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">[Ferguson]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: What position did you take?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abm\">[Ferguson]: I communicated with Mid-Continent requesting that it withdraw the motion to strike the judgment so that the judgment would stand, and protect its insured from any risk of excess verdict. I also should add that I asked that the insurer pay the judgment so that it could be entered and satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">On October 20, 2011, appellee filed in this Court a Motion to Dismiss Appeal, arguing that, because \u201c[t]he claims asserted against Alger by [the Ratajczaks] and [appellee] have not been resolved[,]\u201d the default judgment against appellant was not a final, appealable judgment. On November 9, 2011, appellant filed in this Court a Response to Motion to Dismiss Appeal and Stipulation of Dismissal Without Prejudice. On November 29, 2011, this Court dismissed the appeal without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">On October 25, 2011, the parties filed a Consent Motion to Order the Entry of a Final Judgment in response to appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Appeal \u201cbecause there are open and unresolved claims.\u201d On October 25, 2011, the circuit court issued an order directing entry of a final judgment against appellant. On October 26, 2011, appellant filed a second notice of appeal. On October 31, 2011, the circuit court entered the default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>judgment against appellant. On November 22, 2011, appellant filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">(a) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court lacked authority to impose a \u201ccase-ending sanction\u201d against it for the actions of its insurer. Appellant argues that case-ending sanctions are \u201cgenerally reserved for conduct that is repeated, willful, and egregious, and which causes significant prejudice to other litigants or to the court.\u201d Appellant asserts that it did not engage in such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Appellee responds that the issue is not preserved for appellate review, as appellant failed to preserve on-the-record any objection to the entry of the default judgment and withdrew the motion to strike. As to the merits, appellee contends that the circuit court had authority to enter the default judgment, as circuit courts have authority to regulate the proceedings before them and may impose sanctions to enforce that authority. Alternatively, appellee argues that any error in entering the default judgment was harmless, as appellant \u201chas not suffered any prejudice as a result of the default judgment because the judgment does not exceed the limits of [appellant]^ commercial general liability insurance policy with Mid-Continent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">In a reply brief, appellant contends that, because the circuit court imposed the sanction summarily in chambers, it lacked an opportunity to object to the default judgment and, thus, did not forfeit appellate review of the default judgment by not objecting on-the-record. Appellant asserts that it did not forfeit the right to appellate review by withdrawing the motion to strike, as it \u201ccould not avail itself of [a] motion to set aside the default order\u201d because the circuit court never entered a default order prior to the default judgment as required by the Maryland Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Appellant contends that the circuit court is prohibited from imposing a monetary sanction as the penalty for violation of a scheduling order and argues that it engaged in no conduct warranting any sanction at all. Appellant asserts that the circuit court\u2019s error in entering the default judgment was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">(b) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u201c[W]here [a trial court] order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, [an appellate court] must determine whether the [trial] court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d <em>Jackson v. 2109 Brandywine, LLC, </em>180 Md.App. 535, 567, 952 A.2d 304, <em>cert. denied, </em>406 Md. 444, 959 A.2d 793 (2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">(c) Law</p>\n<p id=\"Ail\">(i) Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Maryland Rule 2-504 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">(a) Order required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the County Administrative Judge for one or more specified categories of actions, the court shall enter a scheduling order in every civil action, whether or not the court orders a scheduling conference pursuant to Rule 2-504.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">(b) Contents of scheduling order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">(2) Permitted.

Marriott Hotels, </em>111 Md.App. 566, 572, 683 A.2d 784 (1996). \u201c[Although the Rule does not, by its terms, provide for sanctions, the case law of Maryland makes the imposition of sanctions for the violation of a scheduling order appropriate.\u201d <em>Manzano v. S. Md. Hosp., </em>347 Md. 17, 29, 698 A.2d 531 (1997) (citations omitted); <em>see also Dorsey v.

Bankier, </em>114 Md.App. 641, 654, 691 A.2d 712 (1997). \u201cIndeed, if our courts could not enforce their scheduling orders through the threat and imposition of sanctions, the entire process of expedited case management would be at risk.\u201d <em>Manzano, </em>347 Md. at 29, 698 A.2d 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In <em>Tobin, </em>111 Md.App. at 567, 577, 683 A.2d 784, this Court reversed the imposition of a $750 sanction against a party\u2019s counsel in the underlying litigation, payable to opposing counsel, for failure to attend a mediation conference ordered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>circuit court under Maryland Rule 2-504.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the order imposing sanctions, the circuit court stated that \u201cTobin, ... is hereby sanctioned, assessed and shall pay the sum of seven hundred fifty dollars ($ 750.00), as attorneys\u2019 fees[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 683 A.2d 784. Although finding that the circuit court has authority to \u201cinsist on at least substantial, if not strict, compliance with their scheduling orders[,]\u201d this Court held that the sanction was improper because it took the form of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Id. </em>at 573, 575, 683 A.2d 784. We explained the history of Rule 2-504 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">The Committee was aware that a somewhat similar scheme had been adopted by the federal courts through revisions to Fed.R.Civ.P. 16 and that, as part of the federal approach, sanctions were expressly authorized. Rule 16(f) provides, in relevant part, that, if a party or an attorney fails to obey a scheduling order, the court, in addition to or in lieu of other sanctions authorized under Rule 37(b)(2), \u201cshall require the party or the attorney representing the party or both to pay the reasonable expenses incurred because of any noncompliance with the rule, including attorney\u2019s fees, unless the judge finds that the noncompliance was substantially justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>fied or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">Notwithstanding this information, the Court of Appeals declined to adopt such a mechanism, apparently preferring to see if the new procedure would work effectively without such sanctions. There is no indication in the record of the proceedings before the Court that it believed a comparable authority was inherent or implicit and thus did not need to be expressed. The court was certainly aware that, in instances when it desired to permit reimbursement of expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees as a sanction for violating a court order, it conferred that authority expressly. <em>See,- e.g., </em>Md. Rules 2-433 and 8-206(e), allowing an award of attorney\u2019s fees for failure to comply with orders or procedures governed by those rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 683 A.2d 784. We concluded that \u201c[e]xcept in the most extraordinary case, the Court has been consistently unwilling to allow [circuit] courts to shift litigation expenses based on relative fault, and in those cases in which it has chosen to do so on a systematic basis, it has made express provision in the rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 683 A.2d 784 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We held that the circuit court had \u201cneither a general inherent authority nor any specific authority under Rule 2-504\u201d to impose \u201csanctions of this <em>kind\u201d\u2014i.e. </em>attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Id. </em>at 575-76, 683 A.2d 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In <em>Naughton, </em>114 Md.App. at 647, 658-59, 691 A.2d 712, we reversed a sanction of $350 in attorneys\u2019 fees levied on a party for the failure of his insurance company to send an agent to a settlement conference. In <em>Naughton, </em>we did not address the circuit court\u2019s authority to sanction a party for the violation of a Rule 2-504 scheduling order by an insurer.

State, </em>99 Md.App. 60, 69, 62, 65-66, 635 A.2d 77 (1994), we reversed the circuit court\u2019s summary imposition of criminal contempt sanctions for violation of a scheduling order against a party\u2019s attorney in a civil action for failing to submit \u201ca written statement containing or addressing 10 enumerated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>categories of information\u201d at least five days prior to a pretrial settlement conference, holding that the violation of the order could not be considered direct contempt. We explained that, \u201c[although t]he failure of a person to obey an order of court may constitute a contempt if the person has notice of the order and the failure to obey is deliberate^ i]t is not the mere failure itself that is the contempt, [] but rather the intent behind and effect of that failure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 635 A.2d 77 (citation omitted). We noted that there is \u201ca strong public policy in favor of allowing a person ... to explain his action ...

All that the judge knew was that appellant had been ordered to attend and that he failed to do so. In the absence of a show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>cause hearing, that is not enough even for a constructive contempt, and it certainly does not suffice as a direct contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">(d) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Returning to the case at hand, we first address appellee\u2019s argument that appellant failed to preserve the issue for appellate review by not arguing in the circuit court that the court lacked authority to enter the default judgment. In this case, the default judgment is the final order of the circuit court, ending litigation of the underlying dispute between appellant and appellee. As such, appellant is not challenging an unappealable interlocutory decision by the circuit court. Rather, appellant is challenging the authority of the circuit court to enter a final, case-ending order. With certain exceptions not applicable here, the party against whom a final judgment is entered may appeal that judgment. Md.Code Ann., Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 12-301 (\u201cExcept as provided in \u00a7 12-302 of this subtitle, a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court.\u201d). As a result, the question of whether the circuit court lacked authority to enter the default judgment in this case is properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">As to the merits of appellant\u2019s argument, the circuit court most certainly has authority to sanction parties for violating scheduling orders. The cases that consider the question of the circuit court\u2019s authority to sanction a party for the violation of a scheduling order affirm that, although no sanctioning power is enumerated in Maryland Rule 2-504, circuit courts have inherent power to do so. <em>See Manzano, </em>347 Md. at 29, 698 A.2d 531 (\u201cThus, although [Maryland] Rule [2-504] does not, by its terms, provide for sanctions, the case law of Maryland makes the imposition of sanctions for the violation of a scheduling order appropriate.\u201d (Citations omitted));<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Dorsey, </em>362 Md. at 256, 765 A.2d 79 (\u201c[Sanctions are available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>for the violation of directives in scheduling orders, although they are not specified in any rule.\u201d (Citation omitted)); <em>Maddox, </em>174 Md.App. at 501, 921 A.2d 912 (\u201c[T]he appropriate sanction for a ... scheduling order violation is largely discretionary with the [circuit] court.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, it is abundantly clear that the circuit court had authority to sanction a party for its violation of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Although appellant argues that this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Tobin </em>and <em>Naughton </em>stand for the proposition that circuit courts lack the authority to impose a monetary sanction for the violation of a scheduling order, we find no basis for that conclusion in the cases. Neither <em>Tobin </em>nor <em>Naughton </em>contains a discussion of the circuit court\u2019s power to sanction parties for violations of scheduling orders generally or its authority to impose a monetary sanction for the violation of a scheduling order. Rather, both cases address the question of whether attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded as sanctions, and their holdings bar those sanctions which \u201cshift litigation expenses[.]\u201d <em>See Tobin, </em>111 Md.App. at 575-76, 683 A.2d 784; <em>Naughton, </em>114 Md.App. at 658-59, 691 A.2d 712. The sanction imposed in this case, a default judgment\u2014a monetary award\u2014does not fall within the scope of the holdings in <em>Tobin </em>and <em>Naughton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">At oral argument, appellant contended that amendments to Maryland Rule 2-504, adopted between our opinions in <em>Tobin </em>and <em>Naughton </em>and the events of this case, negate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>imposition of monetary sanctions for scheduling order violations. We disagree. Since our decisions in <em>Tobin </em>and <em>Naughton, </em>Maryland Rule 2-504 has been amended in 1997, 1998, 2003, and 2007. The majority of the amendments have added items that the circuit court must or may include in a scheduling order. For example, in 2003, the language of Maryland Rule 2\u2014504(b)(2)(D) was altered from allowing the circuit court to order a referral for alternative dispute resolution \u201cprovided that a court may not require the parties to submit to binding arbitration unless they agree in writing or on the record to that process!,]\u201d to allowing the circuit court to order a referral for alternative dispute resolution \u201cincluding a requirement that individuals with authority to settle be present or readily available for consultation during the alternative dispute resolution proceeding!.]\u201d None of the amendments altered the purpose of the Rule\u2014which is \u201cto expedite and control the orderly flow of civil litigation in the circuit courts!,]\u201d <em>Tobin, </em>111 Md.App. at 572, 683 A.2d 784\u2014nor made any reference to monetary sanctions. Thus, despite amendments to the Rule, circuit courts retain authority under Maryland Rule 2-504 to impose sanctions, including monetary sanctions, on parties that violate scheduling orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">We now address the critical question in this case: whether the circuit court had authority to impose a sanction against appellant based solely on the conduct of its insurer, Mid-Continent. In the cases discussing imposition of sanctions under Maryland Rule 2-504, Maryland appellate courts have not directly considered whether a circuit court may impose sanctions against a party for its insurance company\u2019s violation of a scheduling order.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude that the circuit court lacks the authority to impose a sanction on a party for violation of a scheduling order based solely on the conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the party\u2019s insurer. The circuit court\u2019s inherent authority to sanction parties under Maryland Rule 2-504 is based on the ability to regulate the proceedings before it in furtherance of the goal of efficient disposition of litigation. <em>See Naughton, </em>114 Md.App. at 654, 691 A.2d 712 (\u201cFor a trial court to permit a party to deviate [] from a scheduling order without a showing of good cause is, on its face, prejudicial and fundamentally unfair to opposing parties, and would further contravene the very aims supporting the inception of Rule 2-504 by decreasing the value of scheduling orders to the paper upon which they are printed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The authority to sanction is grounded in the belief that a party will comply with the order in order to avoid imposition of a penalty against it. If an insurance company\u2014or, for that matter, any person or entity\u2014was aware that someone else would be punished for its violation of a court\u2019s scheduling order, the threat of sanctions would create no incentive for it to comply with an order of the court. At oral argument, appellee acknowledged that there was no indication that appellant was involved in or played any role in Mid-Continent\u2019s alleged violation of the scheduling order. Where, as in this case, there is no information that a party was complicit in its insurer\u2019s violation of the court order, the circuit court has no authority to sanction the party.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Although the circuit court lacked authority to sanction appellant solely for Mid-Continent\u2019s violation of the schedul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ing order, there were several courses of action, of varying degrees of severity, available to the circuit court to address Mid-Continent\u2019s alleged violation of the scheduling order. The circuit court could have taken additional steps to speak with a representative from Mid-Continent to ascertain the reason for its failure to attend the conference as ordered, and the possibility of its complying with the scheduling order at that time. The circuit court could have proceeded with the settlement conference without a senior officer of Mid-Continent, to evaluate whether a settlement within the settling authority of the independent adjuster representing Mid-Continent was attainable. The circuit court could have scheduled a hearing affording Mid-Continent the chance to explain the alleged violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The circuit court could have postponed the settlement conference to give Mid-Continent a chance to comply with the order. Pursuant to the circuit court\u2019s March 30, 2011, scheduling order, the settlement conference was scheduled for October 18, 2011; it was moved to September 27, 2011, at the request of the parties. The trial date was scheduled for N\u00f3vember 7, 2011. It is clear that there was sufficient time for the circuit court to reschedule the settlement conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Finally, where the underlying scheduling order is valid, the circuit court could proceed under Maryland Rule 15-205 or 15-206 to sanction an insurer for constructive criminal or civil contempt for violation of the order.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In this case, neither party contends that Mid-Continent was unaware of the sched<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>uling order. It is undisputed that Mid-Continent had notice of the settlement conference, but failed to attend as ordered by not sending a \u201csenior officer or employee!.]\u201d Mid-Continent\u2019s violation of the order, therefore, could constitute con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tempt if it were an intentional disregard of a valid exercise of the circuit court\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See Betz, </em>99 Md.App. at 66, 635 A.2d 77 (\u201cThe failure of a person to obey an order of court may constitute a contempt if the person has notice of the order and the failure to obey is deliberate. It is not the mere failure itself that is the contempt, however, but rather the intent behind and effect of that failure.\u201d (Citation omitted)). In this case, however, Mid-Continent\u2019s mere knowledge of the scheduling order and failure to appear at the settlement conference would not be sufficient to trigger contempt proceedings without further information as to Mid-Continent\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For example, the record does not disclose why Mid-Continent sent a third-party insurance adjuster rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>than a senior officer or employee as set forth in the September 6, 2011, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">We agree with appellant that the circuit court\u2019s error in entering the default judgment was not harmless. In <em>Consol. Waste Indus, v. Std. Equip. Co., </em>421 Md. 210, 219-20, 26 A.3d 352 (2011), the Court of Appeals stated that error is not harmless where there is prejudice to the losing party, and that \u201c[prejudice exists when the particular error is determined likely to have affected the verdict[.]\u201d In this case, the error in question\u2014the entry of the default judgment\u2014deprived appellant of the right to a trial on the merits, and the possibility of prevailing against appellee\u2019s claims. The entry of the default judgment prejudiced appellant by dictating the verdict and the amount of the damages, and cannot be considered harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Although we need not address Issue II, in light of our conclusion as to Issue I, we do so briefly for guidance to the trial court. Appellant raises many arguments as to how the circuit court abused its discretion, we focus on two matters\u2014 not exhaustive due to the many abuses of discretion\u2014but which demonstrate that the circuit court unequivocally abused its discretion in entering the sanction of a default judgment against appellant. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">To begin, there is no explanation in the record as to how the circuit court determined the figure of $1,000,000\u2014the amount of the default judgment. Here, the parties themselves disagree on what, precisely, took place at the settlement confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ence\u2014with appellee arguing that appellant\u2019s counsel returned to the settlement conference prior to entry of the default judgment, and appellant arguing that the judgment was entered while she was outside of the room on the telephone. As the settlement conference was conducted off-the-record in chambers, it is readily apparent that the circuit court did not take an account of any evidence to investigate the matter of damages, nor does the record disclose any findings made by the court in arriving at the $1,000,000 judgment. That $1,000,000 was the insurance policy limit does not explain why a default judgment of $1,000,000 was awarded against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Appellee contended at oral argument that the circuit court was not required to make a finding as to damages or to hold a hearing to establish the amount of damages because the default judgment was a sanction, not an award of damages. It is clear that whether sanctioning a party for a scheduling order violation under Maryland Rule 2-504, as appellee contends, or awarding damages, the circuit court was required to make findings explaining the action taken. <em>See, e.g., Maddox, </em>174 Md.App. at 507, 921 A.2d 912 (\u201c[T]he imposition of a sanction that ... effectively dismisses a potentially meritorious claim without a trial, should be reserved for egregious violations of the court\u2019s scheduling order, and should be supported by evidence of willful or contemptuous or otherwise opprobrious behavior on the part of the party or counsel.\u201d (Emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Compounding the abuse of discretion, as a matter of procedure, appellant had no notice that it might be found liable as a result of Mid-Continent\u2019s failure to appear prior to the circuit court\u2019s entry of the default judgment. There is no precedent or rule establishing such a possibility, and the circuit court in this case provided no written notification to appellant. For these reasons, we have no difficulty in concluding that the circuit court abused its discretion in entering the default judgment against appellant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We vacate the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>default and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED.

To sanction a party for violation of a scheduling order, the underlying order must be valid. On brief, appellant contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in issuing an order directing Mid-Continent to attend the hearing with authority to settle \"up to the full limits of its policy.\" Appellant argues that \"[b]y requiring Mid[-]Continent to appear with one million dollars in settlement authority, [the circuit court] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>was clearly attempting, though indirectly, to coerce the parties to settle for a certain amount.\u201d Appellee responds that appellant failed to preserve the issue for appellate review, as appellant failed to argue in the circuit court the lack of authority to order Mid-Continent to attend the settlement hearing with authority to settle up to the limits of the policy. On the merits, appellee contends that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Mid-Continent to attend the settlement hearing, because circuit courts \"have the inherent power to regulate the proceedings that are before them ... not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">We agree with appellee that the issue as to the validity of the September 6, 2011, scheduling order is not preserved for appellate review. \"Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court!.]\u201d Md. R. 8-131(a). On September 6, 2011, the circuit court issued the order scheduling the settlement conference for September 27, 2011. There is no indication in the record that appellant or Mid-Continent objected to the order at any point within those twenty days or raised an issue as to the validity of the order in the circuit court. As such, the issue is not preserved. Indeed, although on brief appellant contended that the circuit court lacked authority to issue a scheduling order in which it required Mid-Continent to attend \"with binding settlement authority up to the full limits of its policy!,]\u201d at oral argument, appellant advised that the question of the validity of the scheduling order was not an issue that it was pursuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s failure to preserve the issue, it is readily apparent that the circuit court abused its discretion in issuing a scheduling order requiring Mid-Continent to attend the settlement conference \"with binding settlement authority up to the full limits of its policy.\u201d Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-504(b)(2)(C), the circuit court may order parties to participate in alternative dispute resolution \"with authority to settle!.]\u201d Nothing in the Rule permits a circuit court to require a party to settle for a specified amount. In this case, in ordering Mid-Continent to attend the settlement conference with binding authority to settle for the full policy limits, the circuit court, in essence, substituted its own authority for that of Mid-Continent\u2019s in setting the upper limit at which Mid-Continent must be willing to settle. As the scheduling order predetermined an amount up to which Mid-Continent was required to negotiate, thereby undermining Mid-Continent\u2019s ability to evaluate the claim against appellant and select a level at which it was willing to negotiate and settle, we conclude that the circuit court abused its discretion in issuing an order requiring the insurer to attend the conference with settlement authority \u201cto the full limits of its policy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b513-4\">. At oral argument, appellant incorrectly took the position that the circuit court lacked authority to sanction Mid-Continent for contempt because Maryland Rule 2-504(b)(2)(C) is permissive, providing that the circuit court may order a date for a settlement conference, but is not required to do so. That the circuit court is not required to schedule a settlement conference under Maryland Rule 2-504 is not dispositive. The circuit court clearly has authority to schedule such a conference and require attendance by the parties and other necessary persons or entities. Once the Order to Attend Settlement Conference was issued, it had the same compulsory effect as any other order of the court, and the circuit court, therefore, would have had authority to find Mid-Continent in contempt for violation of the scheduling order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b513-5\">.
