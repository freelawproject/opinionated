Police officers responded, and B.H. was charged with Child Abuse in the Second Degree, Assault in the Second Degree, and Reckless Endangerment. All charges were placed on the STET docket<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on September 3, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">On April 27, 2010, DSS began a civil investigation. The investigation concluded on July 30, 2010, finding that child abuse was indicated as defined in the Family Law Article and by its corresponding COMAR sections. B.H. appealed from that finding and on December 21, 2010, a hearing took place before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). The ALJ found that DSS met its burden in proving indicated child abuse. B.H. appealed that decision to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. In a memorandum opinion docketed October 4, 2011, the circuit court upheld the ALJ\u2019s decision. B.H. noted a timely appeal to this Court on October 25, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">B.H. presents three questions for our review which we have rephrased and combined for clarity as:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>1. Did the Administrative Law Judge draw an erroneous conclusion of law or fail to base her decision on substantial evidence when upholding a DSS finding of indicated child abuse?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">For the reasons that follow, we answer no and uphold the decision of the Administrative Law Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">On the evening of April 22, 2010, B.H. prepared a meal for himself and his two minor children. B.H. made spaghetti with a sauce containing mushrooms. Brayden, B.H.\u2019s four-year-old son, refused the food because he disliked mushrooms. B.H. responded by informing Brayden that if he did not finish his dinner, he would not get dessert and he would be unable to go outside to play with his friends. Brayden then left the table. B.H. returned Brayden to his seat and told him that his presence at dinner was required while B.H. and his eleven-year-old daughter, Brianna, finished eating. Brayden resisted and B.H. held Brayden by the arm to ensure his attendance at the dinner table.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Because B.H. and Mrs. H.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> shared custody of the children, she picked them up from school on the afternoon of April 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>2010. Once home, Mrs. H. found several bruises on Brayden\u2019s neck and a scratch under his chin. That day, Mrs. H. brought Brayden to his pediatrician. The pediatrician documented the injuries discovered by Mrs. H. The pediatrician\u2019s office referred the matter to DSS on the evening of April 23, 2010. DSS contacted the police, and on the morning of April 24, 2010, Officer Laura Witherspoon, of the Anne Arundel County Police Department, joined by Officer Josh Ingerebretson, of the Annapolis Police Department, investigated the claim. Although Officer Ingerebretson was present, Officer Wither-spoon conducted the investigation and completed the Application for Statement of Charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In the presence of Mrs. H., Officer Witherspoon questioned Brayden about his injuries. Officer Witherspoon testified that Brayden informed her \u201chis father had grabbed him by\u2014 around his neck and had pulled him down and that he had also somehow bruised his arm in the process of\u2014of either falling or hitting it on something.\u201d Officer Witherspoon charged B.H. with three offenses: Child Abuse in the Second Degree, Assault in the Second Degree, and Reckless Endangerment. All charges were placed on the STET docket on September 3, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">DSS assigned social worker Lauren Askew to conduct a civil investigation into the incident on its behalf.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On April 27, 2010, Ms. Askew interviewed Brayden, Mrs. H., and Brianna. The investigation resulted in Ms. Askew finding indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>child abuse. B.H. appealed that finding to an ALJ and a hearing was held on December 21, 2010. At the hearing, Ms. Askew testified to the contents of her interviews. She testified that Brayden told her \u201chis dad tried to make him eat the mushrooms that was [sic] in the spaghetti sauce and that he did not like them.\u201d Further, she testified \u201c[s]o he tried to run away from the table. Brayden said that he hurt his elbow by hitting it on the wall while he was running away from dad, at which point dad grabbed him by his neck and brought him back to the table.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Mrs. H. confirmed this account. Ms. Askew testified to her conversation with Mrs. H., saying \u201cshe said that Brayden said that the incident happened, because he refused to eat his mushrooms and that he had hit his elbow on the table, and his dad had held him down to force him to eat the mushrooms.\u201d Brayden told Mrs. H. that, in the words of Ms. Askew, \u201chis dad [ ] held him down to force him to eat the mushrooms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Atl\">Brianna provided the following account, testified to by Ms. Askew:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">Brianna told me that they were at dad\u2019s house eating spaghetti and that her brother did not want to eat the mushrooms and that dad had told him that he had to eat the mushrooms or that he would not go outside and play if he did not eat them. At which point, Brayden got up from the table and tried to run, but dad grabbed him and picked him up by the arm and place [sic] him back at the table.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8c\">Brianna went on, as Ms. Askew testified, \u201c[d]ad had put the mushrooms in Brayden\u2019s mouth, and Brayden spit the mushrooms out on the floor, because he did not like them and started to cry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Ms. Askew interviewed B.H. on April 29, 2010. He provided a substantially similar narrative. Ms. Askew testified \u201c[h]e stated that Brayden did try to exit the table, but he picked Brayden up from under his arm and carried him back to the table and told him to sit there.\u201d B.H. testified directly that after dinner \u201cwe watched TV downstairs ... then we went upstairs, and [the kids] wanted to snuggle on daddy\u2019s bed, so I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>let them ... I read Brayden a book ... and then I took them both to their beds.\u201d When asked about whether B.H. intended to injure Brayden, Ms. Askew agreed that \u201cthe intention of Mr. H[ ] at that point was to have his son eat mushrooms.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Ms. Askew\u2019s investigation resulted in a finding of indicated child abuse as defined in the Family Law Article and by its corresponding regulations. Abuse means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">the physical or mental injury of a child by any parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child, or by any household or family member, under circumstances that indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or at substantial risk of being harmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 5\u2014701(b)(1). Indicated Child Abuse means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">(1) Physical Abuse Other than Mental Injury. Except as provided in \u00a7 A(3) of this regulation, a finding of indicated child physical abuse is appropriate if there is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that it is more likely than not that the following four elements are present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">(a) A current or prior physical injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">(b) The injury was caused by a parent, caretaker, or household or family member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">(c) The alleged victim was a child at the time of the incident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\">(d) The nature, extent, and location of the injury indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>COMAR \u00a7 07.02.07.12(A) (2012). In support of her finding, Ms. Askew testified that it was based on \u201c[t]he statements that were presented to myself, the pictures<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, of course, talking to Mr.\u2014the appellant and the kids.\u201d Ms. Askew testified to each of the regulation 07.02.07.12(A) factors. She testified that there was a current injury,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that Brayden was under the age of 18 at the time of the incident, and that the injury was caused allegedly by his father. To satisfy part (d) of the regulation, Ms. Askew said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">[t]he nature of the incident in regards to when Mr. H[ ] was shoving the mushrooms down Brayden\u2019s neck\u2014I mean, down his mouth\u2014Bray\u2014as I reported, Brayden could have choked on the mushrooms, which had\u2014could have caused him to die by blocking the airways. So that\u2019s how\u2014he was placed\u2014his harm and welfare\u2014his welfare was placed in substantial risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Finally, Ms. Askew was asked \u201cduring the course of your investigation, was the appellant able to satisfactorily refute the\u2014this\u2014this matter to\u2014your satisfaction, so that you could, you know, change your disposition?\u201d She responded, \u201cno.\u201d The ALJ issued an order dated January 21, 2011.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The ALJ found that in this case, \u201c[ajppellant\u2019s actions rise to abuse.\u201d The ALJ \u201caccept[ed] Bianna\u2019s and Brayden\u2019s hearsay statements to the [ ] [DSS] investigator over the [ajppellant\u2019s testimony and believefd] that the [a]ppellant chased Brayden and forced food into his mouth.\u201d The ALJ \u201cfound Brayden\u2019s statement that the [a]ppellant grabbed him on the neck persuasive because [the ALJ] [did] not believe, and there [was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>anything] in the record to convince [the ALJ] that the child would lie and carry on the lie.... \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The opinion concluded that appellant injured Brayden\u2019s neck. The ALJ reasoned that \u201cBrianna and Brayden\u2019s statements, the photographs, and the medical report are credible evidence\u201d of the injury. The ALJ said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">I have considered that the [appellant is an adult confronting a four-year-old boy. The [ajppellant\u2019s size and strength relative to Brayden\u2019s size and strength magnifies the [appellant\u2019s force and, if he is angry or out of control, renders that force physically dangerous to a small child. Thus, the [appellant\u2019s actions placed Brayden\u2019s health and welfare at substantial risk of harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Applying the COMAR factors, the ALJ found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">[appellant did not satisfactorily refute, that: Brayden was injured; the [ajppellant, his father, caused the injury; Brandon [sic] was four years old and a child; and Brayden\u2019s health or welfare were harmed by the scratches and bruises on his neck, and at substantial risk of harm given the comparative size and strength of Brayden and the [appellant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">B.H. appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The circuit court heard argument on September 6, 2011. By memorandum opinion docketed October 4, 2011, the circuit court upheld the ALJ\u2019s decision. As previously indicated, on October 25, 2011, B.H. noted a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Axp\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">Generally, \u201cin <em>an appeal </em>from judicial review of an agency action, we review the agency action directly, not the decision of the trial court.\u201d <em>McLaughlin v.

Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 112 n. 12, 771 A.2d 1051 (2001)). We do not \u201csubstitute [our] judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>United Parcel Serv. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 576-77, 650 A.2d 226 (1994). \u201cNonetheless, if an agency has made an erroneous conclusion of law, it is our duty to correct that conclusion.\u201d <em>Anderson v. General Cas. Ins. Co., </em>402 Md. 236, 245, 935 A.2d 746 (2007). Although we are constrained to reverse if the agency has made an erroneous conclusion of law, \u201c[t]he substantiality of the evidence is the common denomina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tor of the scope of judicial review with respect to all administrative agencies.\u201d <em>Baltimore Lutheran High School Asso. v. Employment Sec. Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 661, 490 A.2d 701 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">As the Court of Appeals said in the case of <em>Charles County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Vann, </em>382 Md. 286, 855 A.2d 313 (2004), \u201c[t]o determine the proper standard of review, we must first determine whether the agency decision was a legal conclusion, a factual finding, or a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296-97, 855 A.2d 313. In <em>Vann, </em>The Court of Appeals was called upon to decide whether or not a finding of indicated child abuse was \u201csolely\u201d a legal issue for the purposes of applying the correct standard of review. The <em>Vann </em>Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">We disagree that the issue is solely a legal one. Whether a finding of \u201cindicated child abuse\u201d is permitted by FL \u00a7 5-701 when, in the course of administering corporal punishment, the child disobeys the parent and consequently is injured is patently a mixed question of law and fact. When the ALJ concluded that a substantial risk was \u201cimminent,\u201d it did so by applying the law, which requires a substantial risk of harm for a finding of indicated child abuse, FL \u00a7 5-701(b); C.O.M.A.R. 07.02.07.12, to the facts of the case, the possibility of a swinging metal buckle causing severe injury to a six-year old child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 297, 855 A.2d 313. Although the case before us does not involve a finding that corporal punishment was administered, it does parallel the facts of <em>Vann </em>sufficiently for us to adopt its reasoning. Although the ALJ thought it \u201cimprobable\u201d that Brayden could choke on the mushrooms forced into his mouth by B.H., the ALJ made the determination that \u201cthe [ajppellant injured Brayden.\u201d In <em>Vann, </em>the finding that \u201ca substantial risk of harm resulted from respondent\u2019s swinging of a belt buckle at a six-year old attempting to evade the blows\u2014was an application of law to a specific set of facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298, 855 A.2d 313. Such is the case here where an application of law to facts was required to find that \u201c[ajppellant\u2019s actions placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Brayden\u2019s health and welfare at substantial risk of harm.\u201d Therefore, we are reviewing a mixed question of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u201cWhen the agency decision being judicially reviewed is a mixed question of law and fact, the reviewing court applies the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Harford County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>384 Md. 213, 223, 862 A.2d 1026 (2004). An administrative decision is based on substantial evidence when a reviewing court determines that \u201ca reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion that the agency reached.\u201d <em>Eberle v. Baltimore County, </em>103 Md.App. 160, 166, 652 A.2d 1175 (1995) (quoting <em>Hill v. Baltimore County, </em>86 Md.App. 642, 659, 587 A.2d 1155 (1991)). The ALJ\u2019s decision is \u201centitled to deferential review, that is, substantial evidence review, and the court should [] consider[] whether the ALJ\u2019s application of law to the facts was fairly debatable or whether a reasoning mind could have reached the same conclusions reached by the agency on the record before it.\u201d <em>Vann, </em>382 Md. at 298, 855 A.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>Admission of Hearsay Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">B.H. first argues that admission of the children\u2019s out of court statements constitutes reversible error. Citing <em>Jones v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 162, 510 A.2d 1091 (1986), B.H. contends that \u201cMaryland law requires that prior to the admissibility of testimony from a child[,] the finder of fact must determine whether the child possesses the capacity to observe, understand, recall and relate the events that occurred and that the child also possesses the duty to tell the truth.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> B.H. draws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>guidance from criminal cases, arguing that the ALJ \u201ccommitted reversible error by admitting the statements of the four-year-old child at the hearing without requiring DSS to lay the proper evidentiary foundation and by failing to conduct the requisite examination to determine the child\u2019s competency.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> B.H. urges this Court to apply the factors set in Section 11-304(e) of the Criminal Procedure Article to \u201cdetermin[e] the admissibility of hearsay statements by child abuse victims under the age of twelve----\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>In support of upholding the admission of the hearsay statements here, DSS claims that \u201cunder traditional principles of administrative law, an ALJ is encouraged to err on the side of admitting hearsay evidence, trusting the process of judicial review to weed out decisions that are not based on \u2018reliable\u2019 evidence.\u201d Because the testimony of Officer Witherspoon, Mrs. H., and Ms. Askew was subject to cross-examination by B.H., DSS argues that the legal standard for admitting the testimony was satisfied.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">B.H. points to the factors of Section ll-304(e) of the Criminal Procedure Article, arguing that the ALJ failed to apply them, thereby committing reversible error. The factors are restricted facially to hearsay statements offered \u201cin a juvenile court proceeding or in a criminal proceeding.\u201d Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. \u00a7 ll-304(b). This was a civil investigation and not a criminal case. In a contested case administrative proceeding, such as this one, hearsay \u201cmay not be excluded solely on the basis that it is hearsay.\u201d Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10-213(c).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although the factors of Section 11-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>304(e) do not apply strictly, they have been cited with approval for assisting an ALJ in determining what testimony to credit and in sifting through contradictory evidence. <em>See Montgomery County Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs. v. P.F., </em>137 Md.App. 243, 271, 768 A.2d 112 (2001) (reciting the factors and using them as guidelines in an administrative proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In the case of <em>Montgomery County Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs. v. P.F., </em>137 Md.App. 243, 768 A.2d 112 (2001), the administrative law judge used the Section ll-304(e) factors to assess whether the hearsay statements of a three year old were sufficiently reliable to be \u201cconsidered credible evidence\u201d because hearsay statements \u201cinherently raise[] concerns about trustworthiness and reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271-72, 768 A.2d 112. On review, the Court of Appeals recognized that the statutory factors \u201caddress[ ] the inherent questions of trustworthiness raised by such a young child\u2019s out of court statement and balance[ ] the need to protect child victims from the trauma of court proceedings with the fundamental right of the accused to test the reliability of evidence proffered against him or her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272, 768 A.2d 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Like <em>P.F., </em>application of the statutory factors was not compulsory here because \u201cthe proceedings did not involve a proceeding in court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 768 A.2d 112. In that case and in this one, the statements were admissible under Section 10-213(c) of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> B.H. argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the <em>P.F. </em>case requires application of the Section ll-304(e) factors as a predicate to the admission of hearsay testimony in this case. The <em>P.F. </em>Court thought it was \u201cappropriate for the ALJ to question whether the hearsay statement by this three year old was sufficiently reliable to be considered credible evidence.\u201d The fact that something is \u201cappropriate\u201d in one case does not make it obligatory in another. Although the <em>P.F. </em>Court found that \u201cthe ALJ was legally correct to make a threshold determination of trustworthiness by considering the factors identified in section [ll-304(e) ]\u201d the converse of that statement does not follow necessarily.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">While it is true that in an administrative hearing testimony may not be excluded simply because it is hearsay, \u201c[i]t is improper for an agency to consider hearsay evidence without first carefully considering its reliability and probative value.\u201d <em>Travers v.

Brayden and Brianna were with B.H. on the evening of April 22, 2010. Ms. Askew interviewed them only five days later.

Bo Peep Day Nursery, </em>317 Md. 573, 565 A.2d 1015 (1989), the Court of Appeals identified four main dangers associated with statements made by a child testified to by a third person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ake\">[f]irst, the content of the declarant\u2019s statement may be false. Secondly, an adult witness, either intentionally or unintentionally, may have inaccurately conveyed the declarant\u2019s statement to the decision maker. Third, the adult witness may have drawn an erroneous conclusion from the declarant\u2019s accurately reported statement. Fourth, the adult witness may have accurately communicated the declarant\u2019s statement, as far as it goes, but may have omitted other matter never explored, or deemed by the witness to be insignificant, but which would be significant to some other evaluator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 599, 565 A.2d 1015. In <em>Bo Peep, </em>because \u201cthose who testified concerning statements made by the children were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>subject to cross-examination concerning the accuracy of their communication,\u201d the danger in admitting the statements was cured and they were properly considered by the hearing officer. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 565 A.2d 1015. In this case, B.H. had the opportunity to, and did, subject the testimony of Officer Witherspoon, Ms. Askew, and Mrs. H. to cross examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">B.H. emphasizes that \u201cthe determination of whether a child is competent to testify is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>68 Md.App. at 165, 510 A.2d 1091. Before such testimony is admitted, B.H. argues, \u201cthe court must at least conduct such an examination as will disclose the factual basis on which his conclusion as to competency rests.\u201d <em>Brandau v. Webster, </em>39 Md.App. 99, 105-06, 382 A.2d 1103 (1978). But this case does not involve the admission of direct testimony from a child. In this case, the question is whether or not hearsay statements by children were admissible through a third party adult witness. We conclude that they were.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Because B.H. subjected the hearsay statements to cross examination, they were rendered \u201csufficiently reliable to be admissible in this administrative proceeding, whether or not some or all of the hearsay declarations of the children embodied within that testimony would have been admissible in a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Bo Peep, </em>317 Md. at 589, 565 A.2d 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\n<em>Additional Fact Finding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">B.H. next contends that the ALJ \u201cerred by failing to make a specific finding of fact to establish that the location, nature or extent of the four-year-old child\u2019s alleged injury injured the child or placed the child at a substantial risk of harm....\u201d. This Court, based on the administrative record, \u201cmust assess whether a reasoning mind could have reached\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the same decision as the ALJ did. <em>Vann, </em>382 Md. at 299, 855 A. 2d 313. B.H. submits that the ALJ made fact findings insufficient to \u201csupport a finding of indicated child abuse.\u201d B. H. argues that because the ALJ made insufficient findings of fact, and because the decision \u201ccan only be reviewed on grounds identical to those relied upon by the agency,\u201d we are constrained to reverse. <em>Doe, </em>205 Md.App. at 55, 43 A.3d 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">B.H. identifies three findings that he alleges cannot support a finding of indicated child abuse:<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">3. At dinner, Brayden refused to eat his spaghetti because there were mushrooms in the sauce. Brayden left the table without permission. The [a]ppellant chased after him, grabbed him, and brought him back to the table. The [a]ppellant then tried to force the child to eat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">4. While running, Brayden hit his elbow on a table or a wall and sustained a scratch. The [ajppellant caused three bruises on Brayden\u2019s neck and a scratch under his chin when he grabbed the boy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">6. On April 23, 2010, [Mrs. H.] took Brayden to his pediatrician who documented a right elbow bruise, a scratch under his chin, and three superficial bruises in a row on Brayden\u2019s neck.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">B.H. stresses that \u201c[i]t is a necessary element of the act of child abuse for DSS to demonstrate, and the ALJ to find as a matter of fact, exactly <em>how </em>the nature, extent and location of the injury demonstrates that [Brayden] was harmed or placed at a substantial risk of harm.\u201d (emphasis added). A <em>how </em>clause is not explicit in the rule; regardless, DSS must show that the \u201cnature, extent, and location of the injury indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of harm.\u201d COMAR \u00a7 07.02.07.12(A)(1)(d) (emphasis added). Although DSS places greater emphasis on the fact that B.H. force fed mushrooms to his son, the ALJ found satisfactorily that the \u201c[a]ppellant caused three bruises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>on Brayden\u2019s neck and a scratch under his chin when he grabbed the boy.\u201d From the three cited findings of fact, the ALJ found that DSS met its burden. Brayden\u2019s three bruises and the scratch under his chin satisfy both the nature and extent requirements. The location is while running away from the dinner table, down a hall at B.H.\u2019s home. The scene may have been painted more clearly, but error cannot be predicated on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">B.H. cites <em>Turner v. Hammond, </em>270 Md. 41, 310 A.2d 543 (1973) for the proposition that \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals has rejected administrative decisions that rely only upon a recitation of the statutory criteria without making specific factual findings.\u201d In <em>Turner v. Hammond, </em>Turner attempted to secure a special use exception from a Salisbury zoning ordinance. The zoning board denied the exception by using a preprinted check off form. The form listed a series of conclusions and then provided a box in which the preparer could check \u201cwill or will not,\u201d thereby indicating if the proposed development either would or would not have a certain impact on the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The zoning board was empowered \u201cto judge whether the neighboring properties and the general neighborhood would be adversely affected\u201d by the development project. <em>Montgomery County v. Merlands Club, Inc., </em>202 Md. 279, 287, 96 A.2d 261 (1953). The Court of Appeals found the \u201creasons given by the Board for denying the application suggest a rather cavalier attitude in respect of its duties and responsibilities. It made no findings of fact worthy of the name and we think citizens are entitled to something more than a boilerplate resolution.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>270 Md. at 55-56, 310 A.2d 543. The <em>Turner </em>Court recognized that the \u201crecord [was] utterly devoid of any evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 310 A.2d 543. In conclusion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">We have said that substantial evidence is required to support the findings of the Board and that substantial evidence is more than a scintilla of evidence. All definitions of scintilla, at least in this context, are imprecise but if we assume it takes ten gossamers to make a scintilla then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>appellees\u2019 evidence before the Board falls well short of five gossamers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 60, 310 A.2d 543 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"><em>Turner </em>is low tide on the high seas of administrative decision making. In the order here, the ALJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">[i]n sum, Brianna\u2019s and Brayden\u2019s statements, the photographs, and the medical report are credible evidence, which the [appellant did not satisfactorily refute, that: Brayden was injured; the [appellant, his father, caused the injury; Brandon [sic] was four years old and a child; and Brayden\u2019s health or welfare were harmed by the scratches and bruises on his neck, and at substantial risk of harm given the comparative size and strength of Brayden and the [appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">While this language tracks the regulatory requirements for a finding of indicated child abuse, <em>see </em>COMAR \u00a7 07.02.07.12 (2012), the case here distinguishes itself factually from <em>Turner. </em>In <em>Turner </em>an administrative body made insufficient factual findings, adopted a \u201ccavalier attitude\u201d and ultimately generated a record \u201cutterly devoid of any evidence.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>270 Md. at 56, 310 A.2d 543. The pre-printed check off form used by the zoning board rigidly framed the issues and, metaphorically at least, usurped the board\u2019s duty as fact finder. Ultimately, by following the form in rote, the board made \u201cno findings of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55-56, 310 A.2d 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">We cannot conclude that this record is one \u201cutterly devoid of any evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ALJ heard testimony, credited the testimony which persuaded her, and applied the law to the facts in order to uphold a finding of indicated child abuse. <em>Turner </em>defined substantial evidence as \u201cmore than a scintilla\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 310 A.2d 543. A record completely absent of evidence merited at most five gossamers; here, the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact, combined with the hearing testimony, rises to the level of eleven gossamers at least. Ten being sufficient, the ALJ has committed no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>\n<em>A Parent\u2019s Right to Use Reasonable Physical Force in Disciplining a Child</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Section 4-501(b)(2) of the Family Law Article states that \u201c[n]othing in this subtitle shall be construed to prohibit reasonable punishment, including reasonable corporal punishment, in light of the age and condition of the child, from being performed by a parent or stepparent of the child.\u201d B.H. argues that under <em>Anderson v.

Reviewing an agency decision in the light most favorable to it, \u201cthe agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ALJ determined that B.H.\u2019s actions in disciplining Brayden were unreasonable.

B.H. argues that the ALJ completely failed to apply any of the factors. As proof, B.H. places emphasis in his brief on the statement of the ALJ that \"if\u2014if the [DSS] fails to establish that the child knows the difference between right and wrong, then that will go into my\u2014decision on what weight to give any hearsay testimony. But it is admissible in these proceedings, and\u2014and so I will allow it.\u201d Allowing the evidence was not error. The ALJ acted as empowered by Section 10-213(c) of the State Government Article. Further, in its memorandum opinion and order, the circuit court found that the AU correctly applied the factors in rendering her opinion. The factors noted by the circuit court include: factor (iii) any apparent motive to fabricate or exhibit partiality by the child victim, including interest, bias, corruption, or coercion; factor (vi) whether the child victim\u2019s young age makes it unlikely that the child victim fabricated the statement that represents a graphic, detailed account beyond the child victim\u2019s expected knowledge and experience; factor (ix) the inner consistency and coherence of the statement; and factor (xiii) the credibility of the person testifying about the statement. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Crim.

The ALJ resolved the testimony on this issue by finding, as fact, that \u201c[wjhile running, Brayden hit his elbow on a table or a wall----\u201d. Whether Brayden ran into a table or a wall neither renders unreliable the balance of the AU\u2019s findings nor precludes the legality of the finding of indicated child abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">. Here, the ALJ \u201caccept[ed] Biana's [sic] and Brayden\u2019s hearsay statements to the [ ] [DSS] investigator over the [appellant's testimony and believe[d] that the [appellant chased Brayden and forced food into his mouth.\u201d The Court of Appeals has held that such evidence \"is admissible before an administrative body in contested cases and, indeed, if credible and of sufficient probative force, may be the sole basis for the decision of the administrative body.\u201d <em>Redding v.

Even if B.H. succeeded initially in proving the use of corporal punishment, \u201c[a] finding of indicated child abuse may be appropriate when the evidence establishes that the child\u2019s parent imposed corporal punishment that left the child with an injury the nature, extent, and location of [which] indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of harm.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v.

B.H. raises the issue of intent as a defense to the finding of indicated child abuse. Intent would be probative of a defense only after a finding that corporal punishment was administered. <em>See Dep't of Human Res. v. Howard, </em>168 Md.App. 621, 642, 897 A.2d 904 (2006) (noting that \"[a] finding of 'indicated child abuse\u2019 is not 'appropriate' when the evidence establishes that the child\u2019s parent imposed <em>corporal punishment </em>that left the child with an injury unless the nature, extent, and location of the injury indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of harm\u201d), (emphasis added) (internal quotation omitted). Here, intent is irrelevant because the AO failed to make the predicate finding that B.H. used corporal punishment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
